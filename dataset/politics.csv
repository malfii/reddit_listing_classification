"Earlier this month, The 19th launched its first-ever series: a four-story package investigating the experience of being pregnant in modern-day America. The stories focus on what it means to choose pregnancy in a nation not only where federal abortion rights have been eliminated, but where medical care and health outcomes have long been subpar. 

Our reporting focuses on the unique danger to pregnancy for Black Americans, for transgender pregnant people have faced marginalization and discrimination, Americans who become pregnant in their mid-30s and later, and those who have experienced pregnancy loss.  We wanted our journalism to help them remember that even in what can feel like the loneliest experiences, they are not alone.  

We want to know your questions about our reporting, about where things stand for reproductive health in America now and as we head into a major election year.

You can find all the stories in the series here:

"It's Saturday, folks. Let's all kick back with a cup of coffee and share some cartoons!

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.


2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.


3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons. 


That's all. Enjoy your weekend!",Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Thread,18ju947,1702742608.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18ju947/saturday_morning_political_cartoon_thread/,

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.


2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.


3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.

"Happy Holidays, /r/politics!

Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. **Also, please actually describe what happened. Things like ""I live in X, you know what happened"", ""Nothing happened"" or ""[Politician] continues to be an idiot"" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.**

If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review [our civility guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) before engaging with others.

"It's Saturday, folks. Let's all kick back with a cup of coffee and share some cartoons!

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.


2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.


3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.


2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.


3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.
