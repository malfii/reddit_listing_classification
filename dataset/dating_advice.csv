"I (30,F) have been in a sexual relationship with a doctor (32,M) since February. We live in different states, I’m in CT and he is in DC, and we met in 2018 at a convention and have kept in touch ever since, with the exception of 2020-2022 when I was in a relationship. We reconnected in February of this year and communication has been very consistent between us ever since. He’s made it clear in September that he wants us to continue dating, having sex, “grow together”, and having meaningful conversations, but he’s not looking to be in an official relationship right now. I completely respect his decision and appreciate his honesty. I’m not necessarily ready to jump into a relationship right now, because I’m still healing from my dad’s passing in January, so I like the pace we’re going, and it’s helped me keep my emotions at bay. He has expressed wanting marriage and kids one day, just not right now.

I went to visit him in October and we had a great time together. During that trip, he told me he would be open to a relationship but the distance is a glaring problem for him. Understandably so. He also  said that it’s not just about the sex and that he wouldn’t even waste his time if that’s all he wanted. This past weekend, he bought me a plane ticket to come back and spend time with him before Christmas. We had an amazing time together. He’s such a gentleman, opens my doors, pays for everything, he even took me apartment hunting unprovoked because I’ve been telling him how much I love the DMV area and have been really thinking about moving (for myself and my own personal growth. I would not be moving for him). He said next time he will come visit me in CT. I love how he takes charge, he’s a disciplined and respectable man that I truly admire. Definitely the type of man I’d want to marry and raise kids with one day. He makes sure I get home safe, the sex is incredible, he calls me often and we talk for at least an hour, we FaceTime regularly and he even apologizes if we haven’t spoken in a few days. But he’s also not very affectionate. Idk if he’s just lacking emotional intelligence or if he’s not the romantic type. As a young doctor he has a very rigid personality. I’m the fun one who gets him to loosen up and laugh a little. 

When we sleep together, we don’t cuddle. He doesn’t hold my hand when we go out, he gives me hugs goodbye instead of kisses. We make out during sex and I know he’s very attracted to me..we go out dancing and I can feel his hard on. He tells me how good I look all the time, dolled up or half naked, he’s always complimenting me. I’m thinking maybe he doesn’t do the sweet romantic gestures because he doesn’t want to give me mixed signals? Maybe he’s trying to keep an emotional distance on purpose? 

He could just be a nice guy who loves having sex with me, but a part of me thinks he likes me he just doesn’t want to think about committment while we live in two different states. I can’t tell. I don’t want to badger him again on the relationship front, because again, the distance, and I still have quite a bit of healing to do since my father’s passing just before my 30th bday, but I’m wondering what are the signs that a man is actually interested in a relationship with you, but it just might not be the right time?",What are signs that a man actually likes you for more than just sex?,18ngp5t,1703141071.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ngp5t/what_are_signs_that_a_man_actually_likes_you_for/,
"So I’ve been dating this girl for about two months now. We’ve been talking for about five months though, and honestly exclusive through the whole time. We’re both 22. She’s currently working on average 8-10 hours a day Monday-Friday. 
We live about 30 minutes from each other. We see each other once a week, on weekends. She claims she’s very into me, I did my tests, turns out she is.

What confuses me is how “busy” she is. I asked her “let’s grab lunch soon” she says she can’t, I say “okay dinner” and she says she can’t either. We’re hanging out (solidified plans) this weekend, and I haven’t seen her since last weekend.

I’ve had busy girlfriends, work+internship+school+athlete, that have had more time to hangout, and I’m talking 3x more time. This girl only works and goes to school, as well as I. 

I keep thinking to myself, if she wanted to she would. I’ve been the one to make all the plans, I do most of the lovey-dovey talking, and I have more energy overall. We text frequently, and call every day almost.  

Am I overreacting? If I sound entitled, or like a douche, please let me know. I don’t intend to be that, but this is new to me, so I’m asking anyone with advice. Or is it fair I act a certain way. She only wants to hangout when it’s okay for her. 

For context, if it matters, she doesn’t party, club, drink, or smoke, has almost no friends due to business (just coworkers). 

I’m honestly thinking about just matching her energy, maybe letting her know I can’t hangout this weekend (even though I can). Is this toxic?","She’s too busy, or am I exaggerating?",18ngp2o,1703141061.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ngp2o/shes_too_busy_or_am_i_exaggerating/,
"Last minute advice

So i am a 41M white guy… i have recently connected with an amazing woman almost the exact same age… things have been moving kinda fast and i invited her over to my place and hoping to determine if this spark has an equal physical component.. we have been super open and honest and open on all things sex.

So the vibe is good but i come to ask this community if there is any additional PR culture element that i should include or celebrate if u will. As i bought fancy champagne and OJ to greet her with a mimosa i realized what a plain or predictable American white dude i am.. Again not gonna likely scare her away but if there was something unique that a plain white guy could incorporate to add something that would put a few extra sparks in the air it would be phenomenal.

Hi,
I met a guy on Omegle almost 2 months ago. We talked for 3 hours straight, essentially about everything. We both showed a lot of interest in one another and exchanged our socials to further get to know each other. We talked for about 2 weeks before finally meeting up, almost like a date of sort. The thing is, this man is beautiful, like so good-looking that people would come up and ask if he was a model. He literally got scouted by a model agency on our first date 💀. We only held hands and exchange greeting hugs on our first date. He even posted a picture of our dinner with a tag of my name on his Instagram story, I did the same but didn’t tag him (cuz yk you gotta keep pretty men for yourself 😭). We continued talking for 2 months, going on about 3 more dates. He live an hour away from me but he never fails to make that as an excuse to drive down and see me. We kissed on the 2nd date but haven’t done anything more than that since then, like we don’t even talk about it. Now…this man sound perfect, no? Handsome, oh did I mention rich?, and a gentleman. Here’s the thing though, our communication is really bad…We take hours to respond to each other and honestly it’s such a turn-off that sometimes I just wanna block this guy. We don’t call, and he doesn’t even care to watch any of my Instagram stories. Ok, one may say that this is because he isn’t active on socials but let me tell you, he would post stuff on his Instagram before responding to me. It’s kinda like he is active but just don’t want to respond. We don’t even flirt when we text like it’s very minor flirting and we never talk about anything deep like our feelings or our experiences. I honestly don’t know what this man want from me and I have asked him this before, his response was that it’s casual for him at that time but he wants to get to know me more before he can see the full picture. Tbh, that is very reasonable but I just feel like I’m wasting my time on something that won’t have any result. I enter this with the full intention of it being something not serious at all but I think I may have developed feelings for him…and if my intentions one day don’t align with his casual intentions anymore, then I will be the one hurting…Should I just block? Is it a waste of time? Is he worth it?",Should I block him?,18ngnkd,1703140908.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ngnkd/should_i_block_him/,
"My ex-coworker (35M) and I (26F) went on a date a week ago after a long period of messaging. We’ve been talking outside of work for about a month and it was pretty equal in terms of effort/who was first to message. On my last day of work, I finally gathered up the courage to ask him if he’d like to go out sometime. He agreed and we ended up going on a coffee date that lasted about 3 hours. It was a good time I think! We get along well and laugh easily, so even though I was nervous it felt mostly smooth. After that, he messaged me first for a couple of days so I thought that was a good sign. He said “next time we do this…” at the end of the date so that was also promising. But now I feel like he’s not reciprocating as much. We still talk most days but he hasn’t asked to see me again and I’ve started most of the conversations. Granted, it’s holiday time and we’ve both been a bit busier than usual.
Anyways, I’m wondering if I should wait and see if he asks for a second date or if I should just ask him for a drink? I don’t want to come across as annoying because I asked the first time, but I also would like to know if he’s not interested so that I can stop wondering.",Should I ask him on a second date?,18ngio8,1703140416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ngio8/should_i_ask_him_on_a_second_date/,

"I’m 20F and really struggling with the prospects of dating. My best friends are all in relationships where they prioritize their SOs, my entire family is bugging me about when I’ll “find someone”, and it just feels like the world around me (us) is so relationship-couple centric?

My mom tells me it gets better with age as more people mature and find identity outside of their partners, but I worry I’m destined to a future where I’m left out as everyone around me settles down (I’m friends with a handful of 23 year olds: couples moving in with each other and discussing engagements?!?! Am I going crazy?!?? Is this young?) and it becomes harder to find someone. 

Don’t get me wrong, I have no qualms being single. I love myself and I love who I am. I go on dating apps and my friends always ask to set me up but it’s dead end after dead end. My parents say I should specifically seek out new friends who are single but everywhere I look everyone I know is coupled up!

And of course, my family &amp; friends love feeding me the ‘ole “Get off the apps and look outside!” “Love yourself first!” or my personal favorite: “You’ll meet someone when you least expect it!” I swear if I hear someone mention how much they pity me being single I’ll actually rip my eyeballs out.

"I have noticed a pattern. I had my first actually gf 8 years ago. (Messed around with a lot of girls prior but nothing serious). We dated 5 years, broke up and I met a new girl in a month, and it was the most magical start to a relationship and just so much chemistry and compatibility. Well that turned out to not be the case we eneded up being very different people and had horrible conflict resolution. We tried therapy and she would get upset when the therapist called out any behavior of hers and treated like we were there to fix me, not the relationship/how we communicate together.

"There’s a guy at work and we kinda speak but not very often (we both are early 20s). We’ve just began to get to know each other and I’m crushing hard. 

I’m an intern that’s leaving the city soon and going back to college. Today is his last day at work before break and I noticed he wasn’t in office so in the afternoon I sent him a text message, and here are the texts word for word;

Me: “Hey &lt;name&gt;, since I’m leaving I just wanted to say I had a good time with you the few times we spent together. Also completely forgot to thank you for insisting on waiting with me after &lt;friend’s&gt; bday dinner. Have a good break! :)”

Him: “Shoot are you leaving rn?”

Me: “Leaving Friday but you mentioned today was your last day lol”

Him: “Oh cool I’m on my way to the office rn, I get to say goodbye in person”

Me: “Oop see u soon then”

Him: “Yup”

Him: “Still loved the text tho”

Me: “Guess I’ll have to repeat it to you in person😔”

He came into work in a bit (he lives walking distance away). He may have come into work just for me maybe? He’s never before walked into work during the second half of the day like that so that’s a first. He also seemed to need something there tho so maybe that’s why?? He smiled at me.

At 5pm, I noticed he was caught up in a foosball match and figured he wasn’t as interested as I thought so I left and was waiting for my Uber outside when I saw him walk into the lobby possibly searching for me (I sometimes sit on the couches in the lobby). I then got a message -

Him: “I think I missed ya but have a great break and good school year! Hope to one day see you again”

Me: “Sorry didn’t wanna disturb your last foosball match with &lt;insert intern name&gt;, had to catch an Uber fast. I hope I see you again too!”

Him: “you definitely should’ve but I got you”

Me: “Welp my Uber driver is going in circles so I’m waiting outside if you’re still here”

Him: “I left when I first texted ya😂”

Me: “Rip”

Him; “it is what it is”

I know he wasn’t too far so he could’ve turned back I think when I told him I’m waiting outside.

"So recently I (22m) started talking to this girl (20f) and she has stated many times how she wants to be in a committed relationship. After abut of talking I found out that she lives in the same suburb as me so that's convenient. However whenever we talk I try and try to get to know her but at most I only ever get 5 word answers or less then that but it's sending me mixed signals she whenever I don't get time to start talking she always starts the conversation which tells me she's interested. 

I was just wondering if anyone had a good way to ask her without being rude to put in some more effort and be less blunt.

"So for context, I am a senior in hs and I’ve been dating a girl for 3 weeks now. Tonight we went out on a date and it went pretty well besides two things. The first was when I was trying to hold her hand. I was visibly hesitant and she eventually just looked at me, held my hand, and said it was okay to hold her hand. First question I have is: is it bad that I was hesitant/does this sort of thing reduce her attraction to me? The second awkward thing was when I picked her up and she gave me a Christmas gift. It was a $20 stuffed animal with a $15 gift card. The issue is that I got her nothing and I’m not sure if I will see her before Christmas. To make matters worse, she had kind of told me that she was gonna get this for me but I thought it was a joke.

"A single, young woman who has been a friend for a few years and I recently started hanging out more and talking. 
At first she initiated all our interactions and then I have been the initiator almost every time since we have started seeing each other more often it seems. 
She and I happen to work together, and both of us are managers in complete opposite sides of the business. 
The other day I asked her over the phone if she would like to go out sometime soon and she said yes! 
Since then though, she seems to be actively distant at work. Usually we have a few moments throughout the day to interact and chat for a few, but now seems like she would rather act like she barely knows who I am at work. 
Today she literally asked me how I was doing in such a way you would a stranger and then proceeded to completely disregard/ignore anything I said to her while turning her back to me and finally only turning back to give me a mean look for some reason I’m not aware of, and walk off to never return for the day. I don’t understand why. 
Outside of work though, she’s still cool and acts normal. We definitely get along really well and there is definitely some attraction between us.

"I (24F) just got confessed to the other day by a coworker (Andrew 23M) and I have no idea what to do. He is a project member of a project I manage. We have been friends for 8 months since he joined my project, he's a great asset to the team and I really enjoyed the late-night coding sessions we had together. Our relationship seemed for the most part felt like a pure work relationship. In the recent two months, he's gotten more pro-active in asking me to go out and eat, or play games together at night. I rejected all the outings to go eat but accepted playing games. I've had an inkling that Andrew liked me for a few months and have analyzed his behavior to see if he checks my boxes, as I do want to get into a relationship. Unfortunately, he's not a very romantic/attentive person and conversation with him isn't the most enjoyable. He was so unromantic that I never felt that he actually liked me during work, only after-hours when he would text me to go out sometime or play games. He didn't seem to care when I said I felt unwell during work, or bothered to do anything about a disruption that I said bothered me during work, until I specifically asked him to. So I dismissed him as a potential romantic partner, and hoped I was overthinking that he liked me. 

Out of the blue last week, he confessed to me. I was shocked to hear it. It was right before he was leaving the company (he was an intern). At this point, I had completely gotten a gauge of his personality, and have decided I was not romantically interested in him. I did not see a long-term future for us at all. I said I needed to think about it (because I did not have a clear head at that time because I had not slept in two days doing overtime), and he proposed to go on a few dates to try it out.  

Now, I am 24 and I have never been in a relationship. In the past, I have received confessions many times, but I've rejected them all because I didn't see myself marrying them. I had always wanted to date for marriage, but now I'm rethinking this perspective. This has caused me to lose good friends, because for some reason boys cannot be friends with girls who reject them. (I hate that men seem to only be nice to women when they want to bed them). It was a turn-off when Andrew said he probably wouldn't continue talking to me if I rejected him too. 

There was this one guy in the past I really regretted rejecting, because I realized that since then I have never met anyone else as lovely, thoughtful and intelligent as he was. I was stupid and rushed to reject him (before he confessed) because I was afraid of ""leading him on"". I don't want to make the same mistake again. I'm beginning to think that I should be more open to people that don't check all my boxes. I'm considering dating him for the experience of dating. I feel like dating him would help me grow as a person. He's not all bad, there are parts of him that I do like. If I do date him though, I know for a fact that I'd leave him as soon as I meet someone better. But there may also be a 1% chance that I'd actually fall in love, though I doubt it. It feels mean to date someone if this is the case.  Is it normal to date someone just for the experience?

"I know the story of a girl falling for her FWB is pretty common on here. Mine is a little different maybe?  
I (F19) have been seeing someone (M21) for five months now (since July). He’s really sweet to me, takes me on nice dates, and we have really good sex because he’s the type of guy who only cares about my pleasure lol. Also I’m reallllly attracted to him. For context, we go to the same college — I’m a sophomore and he’s a senior.  
I really didn’t think it would happen at first but I caught feelings for him faster than I ever have. Throughout July-October, I was talking to a few other people (since we’re not exclusive) and he was totally fine with that. He’s super busy and wasn’t talking to anyone else. We would say “I like you” to each other a lot, but he had mentioned before that he was trying not to date. He has this thing where he’s never been in love, despite having been in a few long-term relationships, the longest one being almost 2 years.  
In October, I decided to talk to him and tell him that I like him romantically. I was thinking about him a lot and realized that I just felt really genuinely happy when I wake up next to him. He told me that he likes me too, that he gets excited/nervous when I’m coming over, that he wants to make me happy. He said he feels the same way towards me that he felt towards the girls he’s dated. But he explained that when he starts dating someone, the affection he feels towards them either declines or stays the same. He told me that he promised himself and his friends that he wouldn’t date someone again until he could feel from the beginning the potential that he could fall in love. Then, he said he knows that us starting to date would mean giving me the agency for the affection to grow, and that dating wouldn’t be fair to me because he probably wouldn’t be able to match that. At the end of the conversation, he said that I deserve better than him. (Sorry, this was SUPER complicated to explain).  
He told me he totally understood if this meant we couldn’t see each other again, and if continuing the “situationship” would be hard for me. I totally knew that this could end up being hard for me emotionally in the future, but I was okay with it. We’ve been hanging out/hooking up 2 or 3 times a week since then, and now that it’s been quite a long situationship, I don’t really know what I should do. He’s a really good friend to me now, and I like hooking up with him, but I know that the truth is that I’m waiting for him to fall for me, and that he probably won’t, no matter how much he tells me that he likes me. I went on a date with someone else recently, but it feels weird because it’s not him. There are times that I’ve felt frustrated/annoyed with him, but when I see him, I’m suddenly not upset anymore. I know this probably isn’t good for me. We’re away from school now — should I end things when I see him again?

I met a work colleague for the first time while attening an out of state work meeting. We ended up sitting next to one another at dinner and we clicked. I’m married (she is as well) and I kept things professional as possible even though I thought highly of her and was enjoying her company and our conversations. At times I had to back away from her as becaue she was standing so close to me at the bar etc.  She is super intelligent and very social. I enjoyed her presence when she stood close to me , but did not want my other colleagues to think something was up. Nothing physical happened. After two days the meeting ended and it was time to part ways. When we hugged she told me quietly that she enjoyed EVERY conversation that we had.

"I started dating a guy that I met on Bumble back in April of this year. The relationship progressed very quickly, which I probably should have seen as a red flag. I had phone conversations with him that were hours long before we had even met. I do remember getting a gut feeling about something he said to me during one of these phone conversations, but I brushed it off. He asked where we were going to live when we got together, since we live about an hour away from each other. I thought it was alarming that he asked this so early on, and I’m kind of kicking myself now for not seeing the red flags. He was extremely charming and flattering, and seemed perfect. He texted me essentially nonstop. We worked opposite shifts, and I was on night shift at the time. He would stay up and talk to me even if it meant he only got a couple hours of sleep. Our first date went really well, and we spent the whole weekend together. He lives with his parents so he spent the weekend with me at my house. He sent me pictures of wedding veils and talked like he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. When he traveled to see family, he told me that he was bragging about me to his family. A couple of months into our relationship, things started going south. He initially talked about being a Dom and that he liked being in that role both inside and outside of the bedroom. We talked about a lot of things over text, but these fantasies never played out in real life when we spent time together. He started really pushing my boundaries regarding how I wanted to be spoken to and treated. It got to the point that I felt like he was making excuses to avoid coming to see me in person. He started forgetting about plans we made, and things that I would tell him. He works as a police officer, and he told me about some things he did at work that I thought were very concerning. There was one thing towards the end that really rang my alarm bells concerning lack of empathy. He was in a patrol car and realized he ran over someone’s dog. He found the family and told them, which was the right thing to do. However, he asked the father in the family if they had any kids. The father said yes, and my ex asked if he could give the kid a sticker to make up for running over their dog. I thought the fact that he assumed the sticker could fix the situation showed a severe lack of empathy. He also told me that he was mad that a suspect kept hitting their head on the divider in his car. This person was handcuffed behind their back, and my ex had failed to buckle them in with the seatbelt. He also was in a call one day and noticed that a lady at the scene had a really bad spray tan. He asked her, “What’s wrong with your face?” I think all these things were extremely inappropriate. My ex and I talked about kink a lot, and he told me that he was dominant. I found out that he was secretly submissive and wanted me to degrade him. He seemed to have a lot of interest in “mommy” kink. It was fine that he had a submissive side, I just wish he had been more forthcoming with me about it. He also was very critical about how I spent my own money, even though he has a car that he can’t afford, and has also bought a motorcycle that he can’t afford since we broke up. He was critical about how I did my makeup too. He would lose his mind if I took more than an hour to respond to his messages. I asked him what I could do to make our relationship better, and he said “More pleasing me and giving me attention.” 
This was ironic since it happened during the last month when he didn’t spend any time with me in person, but how dare I take too long to answer one of his messages. I took him to one of my favorite restaurants, and asked him what he thought of it. He said that the $13 burgers were too expensive. Towards the end, I noticed him treating me very coldly. He said he was going through things with his parents, and he was thinking of moving back to his home state. He complained that he didn’t have any friends around here, and that he wanted to go be with his high school football buddies. Of course he didn’t end up doing that. He started talking to me like a friend, and all the affection was gone from his messages. I confronted him after a couple days of this. I essentially told him that sometimes feelings change, but if that was the case that he needed to be honest with me. After hypothetically backing him into a corner, that finally got it out of him. The “you deserve better, you didn’t do anything wrong.” All the cliche things, pretty much. He did tell me at the start that he felt like he wasn’t good enough for me. I have a good career, my own home, an amazing group of friends, and I’m in a doctoral university program. I also have struggled with anxious attachment and past trauma due to emotional neglect. I have been in professional counseling for a few years, and it has helped. This whole situation with him has thrown me for a loop. He is now dating a girl who looks so much like me that it’s kind of scary. She also has the same career as I do, but she just finished school within the past year. She looks very young. He’s an attractive and charming guy on the surface. I just don’t know what to think about the whole situation. Does it sound like he has NPD? I sent him a text last month about his “slow fade” behavior during our breakup and told him it was unacceptable. I’m pretty sure he blocked me afterwards.",Is my ex a narcissist?,18nedfl,1703133075.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18nedfl/is_my_ex_a_narcissist/,

"So, for some backstory I met this girl on a dating app and was really into her. We hadn’t been talking for very long but I was interested enough to want to meet up with her and see if the vibe continued in person.
This title of this post is what happened, but of course the details of this story is really important.

So, she messaged me and swiped right on me on a dating app, basically asking on go clubbing with me. I tell her can on the weekend since i was planning to go anyways, but I told her I’d like to meet up before hand and do something more chill to make sure that it’s not awkward between us. So we make plans to meet up the day before (Friday). On Thursday I randomly had some free time on my hands and asked if she wanted to meet up then instead, she accepted and I got ready to go see her. When the time came, she didn’t respond to my messages for maybe 3-4 hours. So obviously I thought she ghosted me and went on with my day not expecting to talk to her again.
 
At some point she messaged me back saying that she fell asleep and only woke up to a call from a family member, with an emergency. I told her there was nothing to worry about and that I understand things happen, we tried to make things work that day but she just couldn’t go out and see me so we settled for just meeting up the next day (friday) in which we had plans to do already. 

Friday comes along, and I text her in the morning asking what time she wants to meet up. Once again she doesn’t respond, this time for the entire day. This time I again thought for sure I was ghosted. Eventually around maybe 3am she responded apologizing for not responding, that she just was going through some stuff with her family and that she tends to ghost people when she is going through something. I told her not to worry and that i understand completely, and to let me know if she needed space or someone to talk to. 

It’s now Saturday morning and I ask her if she is still coming to the club with me and some friends. She says she can’t, but that she’d be willing to see me before hand. Stupid of me I know, to believe her yet a third time, but I get ready and go to pick her up. She lives an hour away from me and it was raining cats and dogs. I almost crashed on the High way bc I couldn’t see, so i was already agitated. Once I get there I text her saying I’m outside. And as you can guess no response. 

I leave her a message letting her know how rude it was for her to stand me up 3 times and that I know she’s going through something but that the lack of communication is hurtful. 

I showed my friends the text messages and history and ask if it was something I did, or if I was delusional for thinking she was interested. All of them said that she definitely was interested but she prolly really is going through something and just is having a bad mentality. Which made me feel bad for sending that last message. But we haven’t talked in almost a week and didn’t need up responding to my message.
I guess I just want to know if I’m deluisional for maybe holding out hope or if, maybe at some point when she’s ready she’ll come back?","Stood me up 3 times, first two times with an excuse",18ne645,1703132381.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ne645/stood_me_up_3_times_first_two_times_with_an_excuse/,

"So I (26F) met a guy (43M) months ago and we get along really well. Sex is great, we have a lot of fun together but it is super casual (no talk of anything serious developing). I dont think either of us have any intentions of it going anywhere because of the age difference. I go over his place and stay for the weekends. He has a house to himself, but his daughter (22) rents an apartment on his property. I think its super awkward around her just because we are basically the same age and I’m fucking her dad. HE however is very casual about it. He cooks me dinner every night and always offers her to come over for the left overs. She will just grab a plate and go but I usually go away to the bedroom or bathroom when she’s coming. I admittedly make the whole thing much more awkward than it needs to be. In an effort to be more casual, I baked him a box of christmas treats with enough to give to her as well and he seemed excited about it. 

I get if we were interested in dating each other I’d have to formally meet her and learn to get over it. But is it normal for a parent to be so lax about blatantly having hookups over in front of their kids? Not like I expect him to be sneaking me out the back door, I’m sure she is used to her dad dating at this point - it seems like they have a good close relationship. The age is just what really what makes me uncomfortable. He has never dated outside of his age range before.

ALSO, he invited me to go to Maine with him in February where his mother and her family lives. I have no clue if we would meet them or not, but based on how casual he is with his daughter I wouldn’t be surprised.

I’ve never had a boyfriend but I’ve had two sexual partners in the past. I never really enjoyed how my other “relationships” worked since they were sort of FWBs, I don’t want him to be that. It makes me unbelievably depressed to know that is all I ever was to them.

"M27 here. I've been on 45 dates, yet still single, and I'm trying to find out why. While some women have expressed interest in me, the ones I considered serious girlfriend material all rejected me after the first date, citing a ""lack of chemistry."" What does this mean?

I don't think it's a problem with my physical appearance, because I have been told many times that I'm cute in person, and on top of that I've been exercising twice a week and watching my diet. I'm not a body-builder type, but people in my sports class tell me that I look ""generally fit.""

Nor do I think it's a problem with my speaking skills. Okay, fine, they may have bogged me down towards the beginning of my dating journey, but later I joined a public speaking class and learned to pay attention to my vocal variety, body language, etc. Still no chemistry.

I also don't think that I necessarily suck at conversation. When I asked my dates for feedback to improve, they generally gave me glowing reviews for my personality, telling me about how I seemed ""reflective,"" ""genuine,"" ""down-to-earth"", and how I made them feel safe to share their life experiences. While I'm 90% introverted, and not exactly a charismatic stand-up artist, I try to stay true to myself, and I think people generally enjoy having conversations with me.

However, it turns out that listening carefully and expressing genuine curiosity about other people just isn't enough. These dates weren't looking for a calming presence, but more of an exciting adventure. Something magical, like butterflies churning in their stomachs. A few of my dates described chemistry this way:

&gt;I want to feel those hormones flowing through me!  
I just don't get that spark from talking to you which I enjoy so much.

How on earth does one acquire this magic? Is it just all flirting, or is there something else I'm missing? (I have very little experience with flirting and find the whole concept of purposefully teasing people downright bizarre -- why do women even find this attractive?? Another clue: I'm a really cerebral kind of person, and while I think I can direct the conversation to interesting topics, they don't flow as organically as my dates might expect.) Can I create chemistry without sacrificing my personality or acting inauthentically?

"Ghosted once again…

Hey y’all. My lesbian dating life has been a flop so far…

About a month ago, I met this girl on a dating app, and we set up a date at the park. It was a great first date, and our conversations were amazing. We played a card game and got to know each other more. She was nice, funny, and sooooo easy to talk to. At the end of our date, she asked if I was interested in a second date. I of course said yes.

For our second date, we went to a restaurant and then to her place since it was nearby the restaurant. We played board games and got to know each other more. She asked if I have ever been in a relationship or if I have any past sexual partners. I said no to both questions, and she didn’t judge me at all. Since I’m in my mid twenties, it’s been hard finding someone who takes me seriously because of my virginity. I really appreciated her for not judging me at that moment. We did cuddle a bit in her bed, but nothing past that. She was telling me more about her past sex experiences and how her last partner was kinky. She said she fell in love with her after 2 weeks, and they were together for 3 years. They broke up because her ex was constantly cheating. Her ex was an Aries, and she claims that she doesn’t trust Aries because of her ex. I’m also an Aries, and I kinda thought that was a bit immature to say. She’s pushing 30, and believes that zodiac signs are the same….?!?

Anyway, it was a great second date, and I thought we were going somewhere.

After our second date, I never heard from her again. Days went by and I reached out to her to see if she wanted to hang out again. She responded and said she would be busy with her family for the Thanksgiving weekend (which is totally understandable). She texted me happy Thanksgiving the next day, and I responded back with the same. A week went by, and I never heard from her. I reached out again, and I tried to set up another date for us at another restaurant. She said she would hang out with me but it would depend on her mood. She told me she would let me know, but I received no answer. Our last conversation was on December 3rd, and I never didn’t hear from her. 

I wonder if I did anything wrong. Why did I get ghosted? Is it my lack of dating/partners? I’m genuinely confused. Did I scare her away because of my lack of relationship and sexual experience? I really like this girl a lot. It also makes me wonder if she feels the same. I’ve been ghosted so many times before due to my lack of experience with relationships/sex. So this kinda sucks, because I thought we were going somewhere…

I also forgot to mention: she invited me to NYC for her birthday weekend in January. I used to live in NYC for two years before moving back home to the south. She asked me this on the second date, and I was truly considering going with her. Now I’m not so sure anymore. Maybe she only asked me that to keep me around…

"This applies to a very small, minority of people here but... I guess this is just to spread awareness?

To start with, and also keep in mind I've been doing this for a long time and am not the average joe in finding things out about people. So, very few people will actually know how or *where* to find all of this. But, it's still possible for anyone who is determined...

I am a Penetration Tester of 20+ years (get paid to 'hack' into company networks and find loopholes/vulnerabilities, basically) and a big part of my job is to do extensive research on individuals - typically higher ranking ones or those who have or may have certain access to things I want. Meaning, I need their username/passwords, basically. Which part of finding those things out is by researching them. Finding out what they like to do, married, kids, wife/husband name, kids names, bdays, etc...  99% of this comes from their social media accounts. 

So in a round about way, I am a ""PI"" for this specific, and intial portion of my Pentest. Which is research. Digging up dirt. Finding anything and everything I can about this person(s) and then using that to find more out, and eventually hacking into their computer. (in basic terms)

While it is ""safer"" to give out your Social Media name versus a phone number, you'd be surprised how your seemingly nonvenomous or inconspicuous SM handle actually *can* reveal a TON of info about you. This absolutely includes your OF if you have one btw... Someone who wants to find you, can and will. A phone number can reveal a LOT about you... if you know of places that gives it for free (most places charge, and even those are horseshit and very innacurate.) 

From a simple IG handle, or SC handle, if I wanted to, can find out everything about you. Your phone number, where you live, your job, etc... 

So my point here is that, don't list your damn IG handle on dating profiles because it actually does give away a LOT more info than you think it does... for the minority who are malicious.

"I’m usually pretty good at guessing what someone else is expecting of me (friendship, relationship, fwb, etc). But this guy is either super friendly or flirting, I can’t tell. We go back to a couple years ago, we used to work at the same place, I was 20 so he was 32. We always got along pretty well. Talking and laughing a lot, we had (still do) inside jokes and all. Back then, a relationship with him wasn’t even an option in my mind. He had a good job, a house, goals. I was living at my parents and had a basic job and didn’t have anything really. So there was no way he would’ve been interested in me back then, I was a loser, he was a full-blown adult.

 I always liked being with him. He’s easy-going, calm, great sense of humor, maturity but young at heart. Went to his place a couple of times (watching hockey games, playing music, playing darts), nothing ever happened. Then we had 4 years no contact, just life being life. And we’re recently having contact again. My life is completely different, I have a nice job, a house, I’m going somewhere. I have a 4yo son from a previous union, at peace with my past. 

We talked and saw each other a couple of times. He invited me to his house (didn’t get to it yet). The other day he invited me out of the blue to the movie theater (he was going either way). When we parted ways at the movie theater I lifted my fist to fist bump because that’s kinda what we used to do, but instead he pulled me in a hug (I never striked him as a hugger).

"So I never dated in school and now I’m 23 just out college working full time, so I tried online dating. I guess I have a good profile/am a good texter because women seemingly obsess over me until we meet in person.

"There is this coworker I’d like to get to know better. We both 25 I think. I do have a big crush on him, didn’t happen to me in a very long time.

At first I didn't pay much attention to him, not to say any. When I started this new job, I was behaving pretty haughtily..

The 1st time I really noticed him was at an integration day for new arrivals. He was staring at me from afar and seemed to be waiting for me to come and say hello.

I realized he came from the same department as me and because I was ashamed not to have recognized a colleague from the same dpt, I just ignored him lol. I had the worst attitude really, it was just rude. After that I felt bad and I went to his desk say sorry that I didn’t say hi.

After that, whenever he came across me alone in the corridors, he'd say hello in a very clumsy way, it felt like he didn't really know what he was doing but I thought it was cute.

I helped out with a product inventory for the department he works in, we happened to be on the same team. When he arrived and saw me, he gave me a smile that gave the impression he was happy to see me.

As we'd never talked before, I broke the ice and found him to be a really nice guy. Every time I moved a box or walked past him, he would systematically say ""oh thank you, so nice"", ""thank you so much"" that was very cute to see. I started to think that he seemed to have a thing for me.

But twice I bumped into him and he didn't say hello, he just kind of froze and didn't say anything back. Sometimes I see him staring from afar but maybe I am wrong. Also today we had a Xmas party and I thought it would be the perfect occasion to have a chat. I dressed up sexy and was hoping to talk to him.

He talked to every girl but me. He didn’t even say hello back, just stared at me. In our office there are about 40 girls for 2 straight men (including him). At first he was alone and then all the girls were crowded around him. I was surprised, because to me he's just a regular guy who seems pretty quiet and introvert.

Yet yesterday he saw me coming from a distance and stood in front of me so he could say hello and gave me a smile. He seemed happy to see me.

Would I have misinterpreted? for me, his slightly awkward attitude suggested that there was something going on.

Thereafter he was all “yeah I didn’t have to ask for your permission do I?” And the argument didn’t end very well so we ended things.

"On Monday my guy best friend of nearly a decade, Cole, told me he had feelings for me. He came over to my place to say a quick goodbye before he goes to Sweden for Christmas/NY. He won’t be back until the 2nd week of January.

  
I really didn’t see his feelings for me coming. He hid them well and I think he understood my shock because he told me not to answer right away and to just think about it for a few weeks and we can discuss planning a date the next time we see each other if I’m open to it. Ever since he told me I've been thinking about him nonstop in a romantic context and I keep picturing what it would be like to kiss him. I even had a sexually charged dream about him last night but we weren't having sex, he was just hugging me and we were both naked. I had never felt more warm and close to someone in my life and it wasn't even a real scenario. I had never thought about him in that context before so now I feel very caught off guard.  

I don’t know what to do. I like Cole a lot but I have so many things going on in my head I can hardly decide where to start. I was excited to go into 2024 single so I can focus on my degree full time and I really wasn’t expecting a boyfriend being on the cards. I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle a relationship on top of everything else I have going on. I have messaged with Cole a bit since we spoke and it's been mostly normal but sometimes I feel like he's being flirty. I don't know if it's all in my head because of what he told me or if I should flirt back. I feel like I'm monitoring everything I say to him now and second guessing every move I make in case I confuse him or confuse myself.  

This is pretty much my thought process right now:  

1. What will be the same? I know what will be different…physical intimacy and other emotional responsibilities which are expected in a relationship. I feel a bit overwhelmed by those things, but mostly I worry that I’ll one day miss how we used to be together. I know that some people manage to be best friends and lovers and I’d really like some advice on how to maintain that balance. How can I keep his friendship even if we became more than friends? When we last saw each other I could sense his nervous energy around me and I didn’t like that because he is usually so comfortable and relaxed when he’s with me. Maybe I’m overthinking this part idk but it feels like there’s some sort of tension between us that wasn’t there before he told me he liked me. I want things to stay chilled and carefree between us but I don't know how to make that happen.  

2. What do we tell people? Going on dates doesn’t mean we’d be an official thing…at least not at first. Ideally I’d prefer to go out with him a few times and see if I’d like it to be permanent, but in the meantime it feels silly to keep it a secret. Then again, it feels equally silly to tell everyone because what if it doesn’t work out and then that's just more questions I'll have to deal with?  

3. What if I'm still not sure even after the first few dates and would asking needing more time without making him think I’m rejecting him? I don’t want him to feel played with but I genuinely don’t know if less than a month is enough time to think all this through when there’s a 9 year friendship on the line. If I fuck this up we could lose each other and I really want to be sure about this. But at the same time asking him to wait after he's already given me almost a month sounds a bit ludicrous on my part and I will feel like an idiot even bringing this up.  

4. What is the best way to go about breaking the dreaded touch barrier? Throughout our friendship we weren't ever really touchy-feely. I'm not a hugger because that's not what my family was like growing up although we do give quick hugs when we say hello/goodbye. The most contact I've had from him is our arms or legs touching while sitting beside each other and sometimes we'll lean heads on one another's shoulders but that's it. He has always been very respectful of the fact that I'm not big on physical contact so I feel like I would need to be the one to signal to him that it's okay for him to be more free with his casual touches. With my past boyfriends I never had a problem being affectionate but after going so many years with that barrier up around Cole I have no idea how to go about making such a drastic change in a way that wouldn't be awkward for him or for me.  

5. I'm not sure yet if any of this is 'worth the risk.’ This is a difficult one for me because while I can now close my eyes and see myself with Cole I don’t exactly know if it’s worth risking the friendship. Cole told me that for him it is worth it but he has had a lot more time to think about this than I have and I really don't even know how to go about determining this. What pros and cons should I be weighing?  

6. I worry about having physical intimacy too soon and essentially becoming friends with benefits before I’ve had a chance to bond with him as a partner first. I feel a lot of anxiety about all this. I feel excited at the thought of going on dates or being with him intimately but I don’t know if it’s good excitement or bad excitement. I know that dates lead to hooking up which means we can’t go back. I’m just freaked out about the thought of the friendship becoming cheapened by sex, but I also don’t want him to feel like I’m withholding sex nor do I want him to view me sexually before I have had time to process everything. I just want our emotional friendship connection to translate into an emotionally stable relationship before we take this step.  I don’t even know if he wants to be sexually intimate with me so soon but it feels awkward asking him. Are there some other ways I can find out (e.g. through social cues) without him knowing I’m worried about this?   

7. Will I need to dress up like I would for any other guy next time I see him or is it okay for me to dress like I normally would around him? He’s apparently liked me all these years regardless of appearance, but I don’t want to insult him and make him think I don’t think he’s worth the effort. I would dress up for past boyfriends but that was because I wasn’t as comfortable with them as I was with Cole. I don’t want him to think that I believe he’s shallow, but I also don't want to look like I’m overthinking by going all out on the attire. I really dread asking him about this.
  
8. What kind of date setting should we go for if we decide to give things a shot? If we go for something more like a hangout then I worry we could end up reverting back to how we were. On a date I won’t be treating him like simply a friend anymore but I also don’t want him to become just another romantic partner either going through the motions in a fancy place. Knowing Cole our first date will be super romantic, but deep down I want something more casual...I just fear that might make things feel like a hangout. A romantic date is the best way to get a feel for our emotional intimacy but I feel like there’s a lot of pressure that way. I just want it to feel natural and comfortable.  
I think I’m really gonna struggle waiting almost a month to see him in person with all these thoughts. I almost wish he hadn’t told me he liked me until he was back from his trip so that way I couldn’t overthink and maybe I’d know what to do instinctively if I was given less time. I don’t want to call him and ask him any of these things because I don’t want him to think I’m panicking. I want him to enjoy his trip and not worry about me. Help please!

**TL;DR:** My best friend asked me out but I won't see him until after the holidays so I have a few weeks to figure out how I feel and let him know. I'm worried about how to keep things comfortable between us while we figure things out including what to tell people, how much touching is okay, how to navigate a sexual relationship, if it's worth risking our friendship, if I would look bad asking him for more time to make a decision, should we go for a romantic vs. casual date and if I should dress up for him like I would for any other guy.",My [24F] guy best friend [24M] of 9 years has asked me out and I have until the middle of January to give him an answer,18ncefd,1703126758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ncefd/my_24f_guy_best_friend_24m_of_9_years_has_asked/,
"I'm a 35 y/o F recently out of a several year relationship. I started dating soon after because I felt that I was over my relationship and wanted to work toward finding a partner. I was dating several people at once, but felt quite connected to someone (36 y/o M) who I was dating for about 3 months. He said things like he wasn't seeing anyone else and that he could see himself living in this (my) house.  Once I noticed how much he was pursuing me (asking me to hang consistently, helping me around the house, talking about future things to do with each other, and saying he likes me) I decided to stop seeing the other people I was seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going to well, yet I felt anxious and this weird gut feeling like something wasn't right; he talked about his past relationships quite a bit and mentioned several times that he was afraid to repeat past mistakes. This man was very emotionally vulnerable and sensitive with me several times within the past 3 months, so I figured it would be okay for me to say how I felt. I called him **this past weekend** and basically said, ""I'm feeling a bit anxious about things; I really like you and want to know where you head is at."" He immediately responded that he can't do a longterm commitment, he gets lost in his relationships, etc. I was obviously devastated and don't really remember what I said bc of such intense emotions, but I remember him saying something like, ""Why does it have to be all or nothing?"" I did not get angry and I did not insult him. I wished him well and said I guess we're not seeing each other anymore. As I went to hang up he said ""Wait,"" but I hung up the phone.

I feel like a sabotaged something that was going well. I also feel that if he wanted to reach out he would. Part of me believes in saying how you feel, but part of me also thinks there's validity in letting a man lead in hetero relationships, *especially* early on in the relationship.

"I go to a school with pretty big hookup culture, but with an even bigger serious/long term relationship culture (Ivy League, everyone wants to lock it down before careers start). I was introduced to a guy through a mutual friend and ended up taking him to a formal and then took him home with me after a fun night of drinking and partying. We talked a lot, made out, but nothing more. He ended up sleeping over anyway. The cuddling, etc overnight was super affectionate and intimate. Throughout the week, we hung out a few times (coffee, study, meals). Friday, we were both out partying and he came home with me again. Even more talking (this time a little bit about the relationship), making out, foreplay, he went down on me, even made me finish, then as he was about to get a condo he said he didn’t want to have sex. He said that he likes me too much for it to just turn into a casual hookup situation. I even offered to reciprocate head and he declined. He slept over again, but asked to make sure it was ok first. Cuddling was even more affectionate and intimate than the first time. What does this mean? Just having a hard time believing that any man, let alone a college student, doesn’t want to have sex.

Yay high school crushes... sorry this is long

So im not sure if this is a take a hint type of situation or a chase him situation(for the record, I enjoy initiating and taking chances- I'm not so great at it though) 

I have a bit of a crush on this guy from my high school but we're pretty much strangers(no classes together, and hes a year older). Other than accidental eye contact, being at the same school events, and living in the same general area, he doesn't know me.

We follow eachother on instagram(he doesn't follow everyone that follows him but Idk if that makes much of a difference).. Recently, my friends texted him and asked some stupid question. 5 text conversation, he responded pretty dryly, not very engaged, and then left my final message on seen(it wasn't really a text that required a reply but still)

Since that message, we've definitely been noticing eachother around the hallways more frequently, like when I say he's EVERWHERE I mean he's everywhere. Like I guess I never noticed how often he's around me lol. We constantly make eye contact, and I kinda started trying to avoid it in case he thinks I'm weird... idk him and his friend were looking at me waiting for the train and walked further down(maybe im overthinking it but im worried).

He's always with his guy friends(like 4 of them and they're kinda intimidating ngl) so I can't really catch him alone throughout the school day.

Just wanted some advice on what to do, or should I just leave him be lol

I asked a friend who also used to talk to him a while ago and he did the same thing to her. He talked to her for over a month, they've exchanged nudes, sexted but when they'd set a date he'll not respond on the day or will make excuses and avoids meeting up so she never met him.

I've met this guy in real life at uni and I was the one who made the first move, so he's not catfishing. This guy is good looking and has already a pretty good career and seems to be very popular with girls but from what I've heard through multiple people, he likes to text girls and make it seem he is interested in them but avoids meeting up with them in real life.

The weird thing is he will always disappear very close to the hang out time.

For example: We go to the same uni everyday. One day he asked me to grab coffee with him the next day at uni and I of course said yes to it. On the day, he texts me early in the morning saying that he is already at uni, when I tell him that I arrived at uni, he goes MIA.

This happened again when he asked me to hang out the second time. When the day of the hang out has gone, he'll send an apology message with ""photo proof"" that he was too busy. He did this to my friend as well where he sent her a screenshot of his email to proof that he was not available. I think he never really had the intention to hang out in the first place which is why I don't understand why he'd ask to hang. He is right now talking to another friend of mine and every time she asked him to hang out, he'll say he's too busy but they text everyday and he always appears to be super engaged in the conversation.

Hi, so I made a post about this recently. I had a date planned with this guy and I just now got back from the date. So I’ll kind of explained what happened and would like help figuring out if he’s interested? I think so but like also I’m not sure bc like I get mixed signals. So anyways, it started off where we were going to get thai food. When it came time to go the place was closed right at the time we were supposed to meet, so instead we decided on going to dennys. We met there and it was awkward, but i apologized for not checking to see if it’d be closed and he said that he actually hates thai food but was going to tough it out because he already committed and was okay with going since i suggested it. He told me he was talking to his friends and was like “i already said i didn’t care but she wanted to get thai food and i hate thai food. he initially didn’t mind where we ate but was glad we didn’t eat there. also I told him I was gonna pay for everything because I invited him out, he was glad because he’s broke rn and yeah it worked out. He like occasionally asked me questions, he remembered stuff I texted him about and like brought it up in the conversation. i embarrassed myself a lot but he didn’t make me feel bad he like laughed it off or went with it. For example i meant to ask what he wanted for christmas but i was extremely nervous and somehow said “do you believe in santa?” and i had to explain i didn’t mean to say that and he was like “of course I do who else eats my cookies..” and whatever, so he like didn’t make me feel bad and it was overall good. The only thing that makes me feel hesitant is because like he didn’t say goodbye after, he just walked away after i said “thanks for hanging out” and he like he didn’t seem to like some of the things I was talking about. But I think maybe he was just awkward? he’s not a very social guy anyways and I think maybe he just didn’t know what to say, but like I think he’s interested but idk if i’m getting full of myself? Idk i don’t wanna assume anything, he still doesn’t initiate any conversations via text but sorta did when we were in person.

I'm 29(m) and I work out, I'm 6'4 so I'm not short, I've been told that I'm attractive from my female friends and even my gay guy friends as well as others that are older then me. I work and in school for my masters in bio technology. Don't wear glasses( if that matters) but seem to have a hard time finding a girlfriend. I go out and am an extrovert so it's not like I'm secluded or anything. I go to church but don't find anyone there that's around my age attractive and when I go out to the bars I find alot of attractive woman but when I go up to talk to them their friends either pull them away or they're only interested in me for like a minute. Most of them are probably in there early 20's cause I live in a college town, so that's understandable but it seems like it's hard to find a woman now adays that wants a relationship with some unless your like loaded and have like the model looks with a really nice and fancy sports car. 

I'm only asking cause I've used multiple dating sites like bumble and match and even tinder to try and find dates but it seems like all the girls on those sites that I like probably get over a hundred likes by other guys so they either don't see yours cause there's so many or they just use it to promote their Instagram. I'm getting to the point where I'd like to find a woman that doesn't have a kid either cause I've tried that and it makes it really difficult. Idk if what I'm putting as a bio on the apps is what's not working or the photos as well as I'm thinking I'm maybe not going to the eight places to meet people my own age or I don't know how to come off so strong to where it creeps them out when I do talk to a girl I like and get her number it seems like it's just for that night and the next day when I text her she's not as interested in me so what am I doing wrong any advice on this that would be relevant and helpful would be great.",What wrong with me and dating?,18nb459,1703122743.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18nb459/what_wrong_with_me_and_dating/,

To make matters worse, I have also started losing more hair (genetics + stress go brr) since age 20 and its only made me more insecure about my appearance.

"My boyfriend (25M) and I (26F) have been together for a total of 8 years. However we did break up for a year so we both count our relationship to start again since we got back together (so basically 2 years).

I love him very much. He’s a really easy going person and really low maintenance. I am quite the opposite lol. My love languages are words of affirmation and quality time. My bf feels “unnatural” saying “i love you” to me out of nowhere. Meanwhile I feel comfortable telling him this any time. I feel like after many years of being together, it should feel natural to say to me. And it shouldn’t be prompted only when i say it first.. right? 

There are also times where I suggest that we go on dates or go out for dinner. When we do go out, he doesn’t really initiate conversations as much as i do. He’s more of a homebody and prefers staying in and ordering food. We do his way more often than the things i suggest. I don’t mind staying in but .. there should be compromise right? It hurts to feel like he doesn’t want to impress me or take me out or make the effort of taking me on a date. He also plays a lot of video games and is on his phone a lot when i am over his place. So when I think about it, we don’t ever really converse about our relationship at all. 

I am at that age where I want to start thinking about my future. Our relationship feels so.. stagnant and almost too comfortable. When I bring up our future, he gives blank responses or doesn’t really go into depth of what he wants. At times he’ll also get annoyed when I tell him what i feel is lacking in our relationship. So basically all of that just makes me feel like maybe he doesn’t see a future with me in it. 

Honestly that only time i feel truly wanted by him and hear him compliment me is when we’re intimate together. 

Although i often have thoughts questioning our relationship, I don’t want to give up. But i don’t know if im holding on to something that might not serve me any good in the end. 

Am i thinking too much of it? How do I bring this up to him and have him actually listen? Has our relationship run its course?",Relationship has run its course?,18nb07y,1703122396.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18nb07y/relationship_has_run_its_course/,

"Hi everyone, first of all I apologize if there are any grammatical errors but English is my second language. I'll start by saying that my ex left me 6 months ago because he lost interest/love for me. We were both young (we were 17). We spent 6 wonderful months, right from the start he introduced me to his family, his mother treated me as if I were her second daughter and her little sister treated me as if I were her older sister. I know that the cause of the separation is largely caused by me.

It was my first relationship, I had never had anything to do with guys because I'm quite shy. Towards the last month we started to argue quite a bit due to some of my worries or jealousies (the fact that he was so friendly with other girls even hugging them, especially a classmate of his, or even spending time playing PS4 with his friends. Having no friends due to my shyness, this thing weighed heavily on me) and with this he left me a few weeks before the summer holidays. I fell into a deep depression, but with the help of my father and my friends I managed to get out of that dark period. We spent the summer with ""no contact"" and towards the end of August I found a very sweet boy with whom I am still Together.

School started, and I have to say that since September both I and my classmates have noticed that most of the time my ex glances at me in the corridors, on the bus or walking down the street (we both live in a small town and our houses are 5min away from each other); plus when our classes find themselves playing together in the gym he always throws the ball towards me or in he positions himself in front of me. A few days ago his little sister even asked me explicitly whether I was still engaged or not with my current boyfriend.

I really don't understand why he's doing this, also because looking at his Instagram profile he follows at least 5 new girls every day",Why Is my ex acting like this towards me??,18naiqt,1703120912.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18naiqt/why_is_my_ex_acting_like_this_towards_me/,
"I (26m) am getting increasingly closer to my married work colleague (31f)

Background:
I (26m) who has a girlfriend (22f) am starting to get quite close with my co-worker (31f) who is married (40m) and it's getting a little confusing/complicated. 

I'd like to firstly state that I would never cheat on my girlfriend, however, I'm unsure on where this line sits now, prehaps I am already there emotionally?

My colleague works in the same position as me, we are an extremely small management team (4 total) with a crap lead, so we lean on each other a lot.
My colleague works from home most of the time, every two weeks she comes down for 1 day.
Over the last 6 months, we have become closer and closer.

Phone calls &amp; contact:
-  First it was just long zoom calls mostly about work. Over a period of months this became phone calls, texts etc just getting to know each other every work day. 
It's now to the point that yesterday, we were on the phone for over 2.5hrs.

Her situation:
My colleague is married, when her husband (40M) is around, she doesn't contact me as much, and I notice she talks about him a lot more, and 70% our conversations are work related. They also have a child together (1f).

The issue:
Today, I drove 3hrs round trip to see her. I was due to have a day off today, but she kept asking if I would meet her for lunch. As mentioned, she comes down to ""site"" once every two weeks. So far, everytime she has come down we have met for lunch, however there's always been an excuse to meet up (me helping her with something)

Today, we had a table for two in a semi casual restaurant, she spoke about issues in her relationship and opened up about quite a few personal things to me. At this point, I'm unsure how she views me and how I view her. I do feel like I'm catching feelings for her - which I know isn't right, but I am struggling to distance myself. I am suspicious of her intentions as she is so different when her husband is home, almost a different person.
A few weeks ago at the work Christmas meal we found ourselves on a table of two in the corner, a lot of the staff were making comments that we looked like we were on a date and were getting on extremely well.

Does anyone have any thoughts? I have a lot more to say, but wanted to keep this readable.

"I’m F32, he’s M27

I’ve been dating someone for 4 months. It’s been going slowly but steadily. We’ve only started being intimate in the past couple of weeks. 

I noticed that from around 6 weeks in he started making roundabout jokes about marriage, but not directly related to us being married. At first I thought it was because he was scared I was looking for that, but then I kind of got the impression he was testing the water (since the jokes kept coming).

Last night we went for dinner and he asked me if I was still looking for what I said I was looking for on the first date (a relationship, which is what he said he’s looking for too). He’s asked me this a couple of times in the past to check that I haven’t changed my mind about my intentions.

Then later in the evening at home he asked what I’ve learnt about him in 4 months and I asked him the same question. He said ‘I learnt you don’t want to get married’. I asked him when I said that and he said during dinner (the conversation I referenced, even though I didn’t think that’s what we were talking about). I said that wasn't true and then said ‘Do you want to get married?/Shall we met married?’, which I assume isn’t him being serious. Soon after he randomly asked if my family owned any properties and he told me about a property abroad that he’ll inherit and how much it’s worth. He asked ‘Do you want to get married?’ (Like me and him getting married, now) about 5 more times during the evening and other similar comments, including insinuating I’d be his wife. 

We then slept together and he had to go but even right before he left he asked if I wanted to get married to him as we locked eyes. Sometimes I rolled with the ‘joke’ and he would continue on, and other times I looked at him like he was crazy and he would laugh a bit. 

So what does this mean? Is he just joking? Is this love bombing? Is he actually serious? Is he testing the waters to see if this is something I’d be interested in down the line? This is not something I'm used to.

"I (F23) don’t know if I want to continue my FWB situation. Initially I met this guy (M24) off of a dating app. We are both inexperienced in online dating but we went on a couple dates and it went pretty well. We ended up having sex on our 3rd date, we continued speaking for a few more days then I was told he “didn’t see this going anywhere long term.”  

To be fair, I wasn’t sure where I saw it going either because it was so early on (legit 3 dates in!!) but I was shocked as our dates went really well and there seemed to be chemistry between us. He ended up saying he was looking for a “non committed, casual relationship,” aka FWB. At first I wasn’t interested in this arrangement (even though we had really good sex) so we went our separate ways. 

About a month passed and I couldn’t get him out of my head so I texted him. He came over, we had sex - yk the usual. For the past 4 weeks, he has been coming over every Friday night after work. We usually have sex, he sleeps over, goes home in the morning. I know he is still on dating apps, I’m not but for other reasons. 

I told him I was afraid I was going to catch feelings and hurt myself he said “well try not to catch feelings but if you do, talk to me about it. I could end up feeling the same way.” The last time he came over he was acting totally different -  he was behaving more like a boyfriend than a hookup. But immediately after leaving my house he started ignoring my texts which he’s never done before. 

I know he’ll probably come back and this is where my problem lies. I don’t want to let go of him because the sex is great and it’s adding excitement into my life right now… I just don’t know if I’m screwing myself over because I seem to care more than him and am scared to catch feelings.

 So after all this happened i started to show more that i like her, since that's something i've always had a hard time doing, i decided it was time to surpass this barrier i have (showing feelings). she didn't react negatively, she even said she was happy things were doing well for me (im going to therapy for other reasons and i've been feeling better with things in my life) but that's something friends do i guess, she seemed a bit worried when i got sick, it's pretty unusual for her, so i was kinda surprised.

So since i wanted to get out of my comfort zone i asked her out and she said yes, which i was kinda surprised since she never agreed, asked her to eat out, go biking and other stuff, it never worked, so i wonder if she might be interested now

what should i do to make things go well ?

I want to kiss him but since I think this would be his first kiss I dont want to scare him to death because all i remember from my own first kiss is feeling really awkward. There have been a lot of situations where Ive thought damn we could have kissed in retrospect however due to my own lack of self confidence I have been unable to jump over the ledge.

Took a break at some point for about a week, he came back to me, everything was great again for about a month, then he said that it was difficult for him to catch feelings, kind of avoided giving me a real reason why he was pushing me away, stopped talking again for about a month, and we reached out again to eachother and this time he asked me to be his girlfriend, lovebombing, everything sweet and amazing. I fel in love with him (I was interested in him for a while too) and recently he broke things off again saying that he doesn't feel the relationship 'vibe'. What is that supposed to mean? That's the most confusing part. I conseder myself to be a stable partner but this really put me off.

"My (24f) boyfriend (28m) have been dating 6 months now. 

I have done absolutely everything to reassure my boyfriend that I am where I say I am, what I'm doing, who I'm talking to, who texted me, who I just got off the phone with, why I'm wearing what I'm wearing, etc. Everything is a question and I have to be on my P's and Q's during every moment we interact. It's becoming a chore now. It gives me such bad anxiety now. Instead of waking up looking forward to talking to my boyfriend, I'm not anymore.
 I just woke up from a nap, and now I'm being bombarded by questions like:

""What are you doing?""
""Where have you been?""
""Why?""
""Are you sure you don't hate me?""
""Are you sure you love me?""
""What are you doing right now?""
""Okay...you're not cheating on me are you?""
""There's nobody else in your life, right?""
""You'd tell me if you were cheating on me, right?""
""I saw that you left your house, but you didn't tell me....that's kind of suspicious.""
""Oh you went to the store? Why? See anybody there?""
""If I ever find out you're cheating on me...""
""If you ever did me dirty, I can promise you you're never coming back into my life.""

Mind you, this is everyday. Every minute of every day.

Not once have I made this man feel like I am a cheater. He has full access to my phone, accounts, not once have I been unfaithful. And I've tried to prove to him on several occasions that I am true to him...

But the fact that I have to answer a billion questions is making me withdraw from this relationship, and quite frankly I'm becoming resentful.
 I can't even have a constructive conversation with my boyfriend, because he just wants to know what I'm doing, who I'm talking to, and why every second of the day.

He made me download Life360 so he could see where I was at, which I did. That wasn't a problem at all. But the fact that he keeps tabs on me, and where I'm at is super weird and I feel like it's controlling.
Anytime I don't respond to a text or miss the first call, he rings and texts me back to back to back until I answer... and has a sour attitude when I answer because I didn't beforehand. Even if I just got done taking a nap...then proceeds to ask questions upon questions upon questions as stated above. The same, everyday, every minute, I am asked questions instead of:
 ""How was your nap?"" ""Did you sleep well?""
""How did your day go?"" 

Now that would be nice to wake up to, but instead I'm talked to like I have already cheated or been unfaithful in some way.

I have never cheated, he has full access to my phone and my accounts. He can see everything. 
Even goes as far as to look through the likes in my pictures and if any guys like my photo, I have to answer to that. 
He made me unfriend several of my guy friend on social media. Genuine friends that I've had for years. People who have helped me out of a deep depression.

He gets upset when I choose to hang out with my best friend (f), which I don't see anymore because he wants me at his house all the time...and when I want to go home to see my family, or my cat, he makes me feel bad. I keep trying to reassure him that it's not because I don't want to be around him (which is starting to become true), I just want to see my family like he gets to every single day. His attitude towards the situation is very ""woe is me"" I guess you would say. ""If you don't want to be around me, you can just tell me."" He says stuff like this all the time, but I just want to be with my family as well. Just like he gets to. 

I know he wants to spend time with me, and I really appreciate that, but I think he wants to spend a little TOO much time with me, and the fact that he makes me feel bad about not being around him is making me want to distance myself further. 
 
I don't know what to do, and I'm in need of some real advice. I feel like I'm falling down a hole, is this abusive in some way? Is this him being super super controlling? I know he has some insecurity issues, obviously. I really love him, and I don't want to end things, I just want things to change. It's making me super depressed and withdrawn from this relationship. I'm becoming resentful, Even if he does ask me about my day, it gives me anxiety because I wonder if I'll have to answer a thousand more questions about me cheating, which again, I have reassured him on all aspects, and have never cheated on him.

"My boyfriend(26M) and I(27F) have been exclusive for almost a year now.

Fast forward to August 2022, he tells me he's not ready for a relationship and we go no contact. We reconnected right in the new year (Jan 2023) when he reached out and we decided to be exclusive from from the onset. He just last week came clean to me about the fact that in June 2022 he met up with his ex (he told me this already) and that they slept together. Them sleeping together was news to me. I then also learned he slept with her when we were no contact as well which was 2 months before we reconnected. The summer we first started dating I told him if he plans on sleeping with other people, then it would be important for me to know because I take my sexual health serious and wouldn't partake in certain things like no condom oral.

"A week ago I (30F) had a date with this guy (32), we had deep meaningful talks a month ago but haven’t in a while but finally met in person. 

At first he acted super into my appearance, constantly calling me gorgeous and “out of his league” and was very physical, making out with me, etc. but he wasn’t super emotionally connective. He kept putting me on him and basically was dry humping me, but no emotional questions or getting to know me. Eventually at the end when we were saying goodbye he was kind of quiet and didn't make much of eye contact and was just like ""oh hey text me when you get home safe"" And I never texted him because I wanted to see if he’d text right after I left. And he didn't text me at ALL after I left which felt like a sign he didn't actually like me.

So hours after that ""date"" I finally had sent the texts breaking off the next ""real date"".

The first texts are when I broke it off and then I finally texted him last night which is in the other half of the text thread. Does it sound like he actually is interested in me?? 

THE TEXTS:


ME: Hey! Thanks so much for having me over, I think you're so amazing. I feel like I may be having a harder time with the effects of my previous relationship than I realized, and I really have loved our connection, but i'm not sure if I feel the vibe I had before.
I do feel like it's just completely not fair to you that I can't really loosen up and be in the moment


HIM: Ok. 
So should we cancel our Wednesday
date for now?


ME: Probably


HIM: Ok. Well I enjoyed our time together
If you think about it over the holidays and decide you want to get together again, maybe we can revisit at some point. I think you're great but will give you space

ME: Well maybe let's not cancel
Wednesday. Idk maybe dinner and stuff will give me a better feel


HIM: I'd rather wait until after the holidays if you felt a different vibe. It makes me nervous to hear that. Give me some time to process as well


ME: I think you're right. Thanks 🤍

ALSO ME: I just want to apologize because I think you're great and I don't want to make you feel lesser. I could have been wrong in my judgment of it feeling too physical off the bat and the lack of emotionally connecting in other areas…but either way, I want you to know that it wasn't for superficial reasons at all

HIM: I am sorry too then. I thought you wanted to kiss me and it felt like the culmination of a lot of previous talking but I appreciate you saying that.

ME: I did and it was genuine. Just a lot of time had passed from our previous talks i think

(No response since)


Two nights I finally texted him: 


ME: Hey just thinking of you. I hope you're doing well and just wanted to say have a safe trip 🤍


HIM: Thank you! I hope you're doing well too.
I leave Thursday!

ME: Ohhh okay so fun!


HIM: Yeah! How are you? You popped up on my hinge as my most compatible today lol

ME Haha aw that's cute. I'm good, excited for the holidays 🤍

HIM: 😍 (heart face emoji)

ME: Hey! Thinking of you 🤍🫶🏼

HIM: Awww, thanks. How are you?

ME: I'm good thanks!

ME: I'm spending it at my moms, and going to stay with her for a little next week! Are you doing anything fun with your family?

"Tldr: Do I double text after radio silence for a week? 

I (35f) recently started dating again after taking 2 years to be single and work on myself following the end of a LTR. Over the past 2.5 months I've gone on 5 dates with a 36m who seemed to have great chemistry with me. Each of our dates has been 5-6 hours long due to us losing track of time when we're together and he has been driven up to 2 hours to see me on two of those occasions due to having been out of town on the day we already had plans to meet. I confirmed early on that we were both looking for a potential LTR and he waited until date 4 to kiss me. He later told me he waited so long because he was nervous and I was the one who had originally suggested we meet in person so he was afraid of being too forward. We finally hooked up after date 5 and chemistry seemed to be good there too.

My main complaint throughout the entire time I've been seeing him is that his texting habits are very different from what I'm used to in my LTR, which I expect to a degree because we're not officially exclusive yet and his career involves swing shifts + long hours so he is legitimately busy. There are times when we'll text back and forth in conversation the same evening and then there have been times when it'll be up to 3 days before I hear from him. On a couple of occasions he apologized profusely for the delay and said he thought he had sent a reply already. He also told me early on that he's not great at texting consistently when he's busy or stressed/tired and that friends/family have commented on his communication or lack thereof previously. This has been a little triggering for me because my LTR ended due to infidelity but I'm aware of that in myself and had planned to discuss it with him face to face.

My dilemma now is that it's been a solid week since I've last heard from him. I had texted to set up plans to see him again and he indicated that he was going into a string of night shifts but would have time off soon and that we could figure out a time to see each other then. I had asked if he had a rough idea of when that would be so that I wouldn't make other plans and haven't heard back. I'm overthinking now and torn between not wanting to be seen as begging someone to be with me and just letting it go vs reaching out one more time to confirm this wasn't another instance of a text getting lost in the shuffle of busy schedules and holiday obligations. I know ghosting is part of modern dating so I'm bracing myself for that but I also don't want to throw away a good thing over my pride if I'm just being hypersensitive because of my own past.

I was initially mortified that so and so said anything of that nature, but it ended up doing me a solid. As it got him to talk to me, naturally.

"I am a 24 year old male in my last semester at university in a smaller US city. I have never been in a relationship and spent the last 3 years just assuming that something would work out. Last semester I realized that I needed to start putting in effort if I want to make something work. This just led me to realize how desperately behind I am. I do not understand at all how dating works.

For context nearly all of my friends are married or in serious relationships. Its extremely discouraging when it everybody around me has figured things out and I am still completely lost. Its definitely gotten stuck in my head that I am somebody that can never find a relationship no matter how badly I want to.

I really just don't understand what is wrong with me. On dating apps I get completely ignored. For example Tinder showed I got 10 likes a few days after making a profile but in the past 3 months I've swiped through every profile in my area and it has never shown me any of those 10 people and that number has never gone up or down. Other dating apps are basically the same. I'm over 6', pretty slender and fit from regular long distance running, highly active outdoors, I've traveled lived abroad multiple times, and speak a foreign language fluently. All of this highlighted on my profiles. I used to think that I was fairly attractive but my complete lack of anything on dating apps makes me feel like over estimated that. I've had a handful of friends review my profiles with zero effect. This has honestly had a big impact on my self confidence.

Since I have started trying to put effort into dating I have made the following changes. I started pushing friends more to help set me up. This has led to a handful of extremely mediocre dates. I switched from running to going to the gym for exercise. I started asking out any girl that I have any interest in that will have a conversation with me. This has been extremely difficult fir me. I am a pretty reserved person and I have never had a girl show any interest in me. Every time I've asked someone out they say yes, I get their number, I send them a message, I get a reply 4-5 days later saying they were busy, and they continue to say that they are busy and ignore me until I stop messaging them. This is humiliating and hurts the most. It hurts that nobody will give me even one chance and it hurt to be ignored. I would much rather just have them tell me they are not interested in the beginning.

I'm sure that one reason I'm getting shot down because I'm not a very confident person, but any attempts I've made in dating have just brought my confidence down further. It seems confidence is the number one deciding factor in dating success. I don't understand how I am supposed to build up my confidence enough to be successful in dating when every one of my attempts has a discouraging result. I really need to find a way out of the negative feedback loop.

I really am just looking for any advice from anybody that has felt similar to how I do, but has managed to increase their confidence enough to be successful in dating. I just want clear steps that I can take and definite changes I can make to help me out. Any other advice that might help my situation is also appreciated. I really want to be able to have some success before I graduate and things get even harder.

"When going out on dates with guys sometimes they insist on going to a certain place and then when we get there they expect me to pay for myself. I'd rather do something cheaper imo. Like this was your idea 100% I've asked you for nothing.

 Idk how to approach something like this lightly. In this instance we are going on a train ride because we both like trains then exploring the city, bar hopping, food, he suggested museums. This was all his idea and he brought it up on multiple occasions, now we're doing it. I expressed that filling up the tank in my car is cheaper than the tickets. But were doing it for the experience. He just texted me asking if I bought my ticket yet ?? Like huh? 

 I feel like when I pay for my train ticket it will open the idea that I will also pay for my museum ticket, beers, food ect.

 I will pay for it all but I hate the unknown and having it sprang on me like this. I'm also unemployed and living off my savings. I just moved here and I've applied for at least 15+ jobs.

Hey Reddit fam,

I (F21) find myself in a puzzling situation with a guy (M22) that I've been talking to on and off for about two years. We've both expressed interest in each other at different points, but things have remained unclear. Lately, he texts me every day, yet his messages are strangely cold, and he takes quite a while to reply. It's driving me crazy, and I'm not sure how to interpret this behavior. 

Has anyone been through something similar? What could be going on here, and how should I navigate this situation? Any advice or insights would be much appreciated.

I work with this girl in a care setting. We do 12 hour shifts supporting a young, nonverbal man who in his home and out in the community. We have now worked together for around six months.

From early on I started to fancy her but knew she had a boyfriend, so I of course have never said anything about it. On our shifts we tend to take him swimming, to animal parks, to scenic parts of the country, out to a restaurant for food. All relatively date-y activities and we spend a huge amount of time talking in the mornings before he gets up.

When we first knew each other she was very keen on her boyfriend and talked very highly of him. As time has worn on it’s got less and less as she has started to talk quite lowly of him. In fact, last time we were on shift she told me they had broken up but were still trying to make things work and were giving it a chance. She explained her heart wasn’t in it. She also told me that she went to show him a message I sent had sent her about how I coped stopping smoking weed as he was struggling with this but he fell out with her when he noticed she had deleted all of the other messages between us. She then joked about how I had broken up their relationship. Including saying things like “wait till he hears I cook breakfast and dance for you as well”, she had done both these things but the dancing was just jokey.

I would argue she is quite flirty with me. Not shy at making sexual jokes, last shift she (and me admittedly) took every opportunity to brush hands, cooked me breakfast, offered to pay for my dinner, told me everyone thinks I have a great and kind “aura” herself included, wore a relatively revealing top, lent me a blanket to have a nap, suggested we go study at the same uni, suggested she would get on really well with my mom, done her makeup up all nice before leaving (she was going out after work with a pal tbf), she mentioned she wanted a nose job because she was insecure and got bullied for it, I told her I thought it was one of her better features and she said “oh I might keep it then”, she joked about me having a “fat ass” when I knocked something over by accident, she made a point of smelling really good and told me about it (she did), she told me the shifts that we work together were her “favourite shifts ever”, she listened to a song her bf sent her saying it was rubbish, joked “maybe we should just breakup now” before saying as soon as it was over we could put on &lt;genre we both like&gt; and when I jokingly asked what she was getting me for Christmas she brought up an inside joke from months ago we had and said “remember?”, I had forgotten about it but she seems to remember everything about me. This was all in one shift and not everything, there have been a lot of what I read as signs over a long time.

I obviously really like her but have never said anything out of respect for the relationship. I feel like this is probably the right time to mention it even tho it’s still disrespectful. AITA for doing this? It’s probably the right time regardless. Either way I’ll get an answer and be able to move on after such a long time or have a brilliant relationship. I know neither of us come across great in this but life is full of nuance which is often lost on Reddit. I would appreciate as objective feedback possible as I’m already fully aware Reddit doesn’t fully approve of this morally.

"So I went to Japan a few months ago and I had the best time of my life. My last night I was a bit sick and just chilling looking for a place to eat. While walking, I saw one of those girls working in a maid cafe/concept cafe (There are lots of them scattered around) pointed at me with the cutest smile. I was smitten but walked past anyway. A few blocks I started thinking that I wanted to go back and talk to her. I never entered any of these establishments before so I decided why not just for the experience. I mustered up the courage to talk to her since im not really an outgoing person and decided to talk to her. Also I felt bad because it was cold and windy, but I saw that she was working hard anyway. We started talking although there was a language barrier and managed to introduce what her cafe was about. So we went to this quiet sort of bar and started talking. Honestly, it wasn't too bad of a place but what I enjoyed most was talking with her. After a couple hours of talking and hot drinks, I said goodbye and left but got her work social media. Honestly, it was one of the best nights I had in a long time. There we started talking and even after I left Japan, we continued talking. We just talk about normal stuff and random silly stuff but I feel like i was drawn to her. So I started learning Japanese, paying attention to how I look, and made this massive plan of going back next year in several months to visit her again on her and my birthday month. I was planning to give her some souvenirs and a gift, and visit the cafe again. She doesnt know all of these of course, but she does know that I was visiting again. Thing is her job entails talking and maybe flirting with other guys. In the past, i have suffered from anxiety and depression. It's just a few years back that I started healing and just moving forward, hence going to a trip. I'm at this point where I'm not sure what I'm feeling about her anymore. I keep asking myself what I really want out of the planned trip. I do want to surprise her and do all these things because I'm thankful that she took care of me last time but that was part of her job too. I question myself why she is still talking to me even if I was not there anymore, if she was just being nice or if she just wanted me to come to the cafe again. I'm trying to accept the reality of the distance and what her job is too. In the back of my mind, I feel like it won't work out but I still would go to see what I really feel and decide what happens after. I would appreciate any thoughts and advice on the matter.

"Dated twice. Once when I was 16 and once when I was 18. I broke it off both times. He’s super nice and wonderful but I was a mess at that age. So recently I was visiting home (now 31) and hit him up and said I didn’t know what his life circumstances were but I’d like to grab lunch. So fast forward, he picked the spot and all that. He moved around his meetings and everything to accommodate madate the time. Well at some point he got on the topic of kids and marriage (I have 2 kids he has none) and he said he’s had a few relationships here and there but nothing ever worked out. So I’m thinking cool he’s single PLUS he never responded to the “idk what your life circumstances are” part. So anyway we conversation and kind of do a rough decay of the past 12 years on both ends. At one point I made a joke about us being single as a Pringle. He laughed and quickly responded “yea”. Towards the end, maybe more like halfway, he mentioned “I’m seeing someone right now” but it was not really prompted. It was kind of random during the the subject of travel. I ignored it bc he kept talking about what ever he was saying. When we finished we hugged and he said if I had travel questions hit him up and he’d message me from time to time. 

Now, he did message me when I got home. That was the first time he messaged first and he followed up with “ it was nice seeing you. Tell your family I said hi.” (He knew my family from back when we dated). 

I feel mixed signals OR maybe he wanted to see available to keep his options open with me and at some point he decided he’s not into it so it was time to mention the “seeing someone”.

Now after a while having difficulties and me telling her its okay to sometimes have contact with these people as I dont see them as a real threat.

And when I didnt show any real hurt she told me about that that is a guy who she sees a lot and has almost the same roster from going, and getting to school.  


\-She shows herself off as someone who doesnt talk to any guys at school.   
\- Says its very easy to be rude to people and also tells me to be rude to girls that talk to me  
\- Says she doesnt talk to any guys.  
\- Our relationship has not been very good because we dont have any time to call recently  
\- I think is trying to get back at me because I am always very rational when saying you can talk to classmates and colleagues.

"Alright guys and girls, I need your help. 

New to the dating game at the ripe old age of 28. Matched with this girl on tinder and gave her my number, she messaged pretty much instantly on WhatsApp. I’m thinking she’s interested but she dry messages back and doesn’t really ask about myself. 

Then she asks to meet which we roughly agree to (coffee date) and then she tries to call me. I’m in the gym so I reschedule for tonight. I called her and she just says “Hey” and it’s basically awkward silence (which she actually said: “awkward”) until I ask her questions and she perks up a bit. I take the reins and just talk about previous things like secret Santa etc and then I end the call as we agree to meet as we are just in awkward silence as I was waiting for her to say something. 

Now this is the bit that confuses me. I’m thinking that was not very good but she messages like 10 minutes later saying, “Heyy u have a nice voice”. 

She also said she wants me to message her more but I’ve not got anything to go off as her responses are normally closed.

- Opened the car door for me
- Planned a really sweet thoughtful date
- Took me for fish and chips down at the beach
- Went and looked at Christmas lights after (because he knows I love Christmas in his words)
- Conversation is there but a bit awkward I didn't feel this instant 'hit it off' but found his company really warm and enjoyable
- He seemed a little off, not sure if shy or uninterested
- Eye contact was there 
- On the drive back I thanked him for a nice date and he said 'my pleasure, anytime' 
- Then he asked me if I was everything I expected he'd be and more, I said yes, and I asked if it was the same for him. He said 'yes' and 'I'm keen' and then said he has some free time next week after Christmas to do something (a few days away) 
- I made a joke and said 'I wondered when you said anytime if that meant a second date' and he laughed and we joked about how its nice to know instead of finding out later the other person isn't interested. 
- When he dropped me off he said 'I'll come and give you a hug' and got out of the car to come and hug me goodbye 
- After he left I sent him a message and this was his response 

Me: 'Hey you 😊 I had a really nice time with you tonight. Thank you for a lovely date, we should do it again sometime x'

Him: Howdy, yes I had a great time too! For sure, we'll organise something over the Christmas break 😊 have a good sleep x

"I (37f) have been with my boyfriend (32m) for about 5 months now. We’ve been in a relationship for 4 months. The other night when he was tipsy, we got into a small argument and he said “I’m worried I will never like you as much as you like me.”  The next morning he told me he said that because he was tipsy. We left the conversation, but I resurfaced it again yesterday before we went our separate ways for the holidays. 

When I brought it back up, he told me he was worried in the future he wouldn’t have the spark or chemistry to have deep feelings/fall in love with me. He said it was nothing to do with me specifically, just an irrational fear because he spent 8 years with his ex(his only other relationship) and was engaged and then realized he didn’t feel the right way for her.

I did bring up to him that I think this issue was due to some emotional intimacy issues he needs to work through. He agrees, and said he has felt for awhile that his therapist wasn’t the right fit and he hasn’t even gone into depth with her about this, or even very much when he broke his engagement in the beginning of the year. He promised in early January he would look for a therapist because he does want this to work. 

I’m at a crossroads here, he says he doesn’t want to break up and wants to see how it plays out. I do feel like it’s early for him to even be festering about that, like in some way we all worry it won’t work out with someone in the future. 

I’m curious to see if anyone has been in this situation before on either side, if you have any advice on sticking it out and trying, or cutting it off now.  It just sucks to feel “unsafe” in a way, as in I don’t know when the other shoe will drop. However, I also wonder if it’s giving up too soon and I’d always wonder what if.

So to cut a long story short, me and a girl from my school used to talk on Snapchat, and were kind of at the stage of being girlfriend and boyfriend for a while, but for some problems on her end we had to stop talking. She was the first girl I had a proper connection with, and I was absolutely gutted when we had to stop talking. 

That was over a year ago and I have talked to her a couple of times since, and as corny as it sounds, I don’t think their has actually been a day where I haven’t thought about her. 

There has definitely been times where I thought I was genuinely over her, but then I just see her somewhere or hear about her and my stomach drops. 

I haven’t talked to any other girls since her and I know I really should, but I just don’t seem to find anyone else attractive. She was one year behind me in school and now that I’m finished school, atleast I don’t see her as much as I did. 

But last Friday one of my friends from school had a party in a local bar and she was there, she came over and we talked for a few minutes and then she hugged me after. Now after thinking I was over her again, just that conversation has me sad about her again. 

She has had another boyfriend since we had talked over a year ago, so I think she’s definitely not interested in me in that way. 
She has snapped me a couple of times, and we have talked over a couple of days, but I eventually just had to stop snapping her back because I just hate texting her when I realise the feelings not mutual. 

How do I manage getting over her? I know it’s unhealthy to be holding on for so long and It’s exhausting thinking about her all the time.

"I would like some advice.
So... I'll try to be brief. 
Just today I finished my first college semester ever. Just over a month ago I fell in love with a girl who attends the exact same courses as me. Having had an eye on her for some time I noticed — or at least, I had the impression of noticing — that she is extremely shy and 'solitary', within the classroom she has no friends and during lunch breaks she eats completely alone. Not having any friends either, just a month ago I started telling myself that, sooner or later, I would try to talk to her, perhaps asking if I could join for lunch. Well, as I think you can guess, I've never had the courage to do it until now — although I have tried several times, evidently not to the best of my ability. I don't even know her name, the best I've managed to do is sit — one seat away — next to her once.
I find this really frustrating, but I haven't given up.

Second part (the main one). 
While I was on my way to university this morning, I met her right in front of the entrance. Given that she usually comes by bus or bicycle, this time she instead walked side by side with a boy, with whom, I deduce, she had probably come together. Honestly speaking, I'm confused, I have no idea if he was a friend, or maybe her brother or... The question I leave at the end of the post is trivial: how should I behave?  Don't get me wrong, I'm still determined to meet her during the next semester, but I'm less confident — I really don't want to ruin a relationship that's already formed.",I would like some advice about a girl I like but don't know,18n4nke,1703104873.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18n4nke/i_would_like_some_advice_about_a_girl_i_like_but/,

"My(26) girlfriend(23) recently went to play board games with her friends and a couple of random people. During this time, she and one guy wanted to get some bubble tea (though she wanted to stay behind and keep playing, he wanted to go together). They went to the bubble tea place and talked there for around 15 minutes, and the dude did not let my girlfriend know he had received a text for the bubble tea for that duration. He was informed that she was in a relationship with me, and she found out he actually lives right next to my girlfriend. The dude said that he only focused on studying for his grad program and did not have many friends in the area. He asked about her Christmas plans, and my girlfriend said she wanted to plan a get together with some friends. He asked to let him know and invite him too. He also asked if she wanted to come to his graduation because one of his friends from new york was iffy about coming (you can have 2 guests i believe), and said he would be fine with telling that friend not to come. Literally like 30 minutes after meeting her 😂. He is also moving back to China in a week and a half or so. 

Then the next night at 10pm he texts my girlfriend “do you wanna come over and play some board games? I’m bored and I cant fall asleep haha”. My girlfriend was busy at the time, but also did not even consider the fact that it could have been a hook up invitation. She assumed it was going to be a group of people(which was not specified), and was actually shocked to hear that possibility.

The next day she invited over her friends to play some board games, including the neighbor. When I finished work and went to her place, she introduced me to everyone. However, when I saw the neighbor he didnt make eye contact with me, nor did not seem happy to see me(maybe this was my imagination, but ive also had a similar experience before and I was right). He had drank the night before.

My girlfriend is not a very confident person and always first assumes a person wants to be friends without an explicit ‘i like you’. This is to not over interpret their feelings or make everything too serious. But clearly to any male I feel this is a hookup invitation. No one tries to sleep at 10pm during winter break LOL, and the ‘I’m bored and cant sleep’ is probably the most overused line in hookup history.

For context, both my girlfriend and the guy are international chinese students, and my girlfriend says that irl(not through dating apps) chinese people rarely hook up and look more for relationships. Ive definitely seen some international students hook up though.

My girlfriend is of the option that there is an 80% chance that he wants to be in a position between friends and a relationship, where he is basically having fun, flirting, and raising his confidence, but also at the same time not having to deal with the responsibility of a relationship. She feels this way because of her experience at her job as a dungeon master for a game, where if boys are single they falsely believe that she is interested in them because she is nice to them versus people in a relationship are chill. She also has a 20% genuine belief that he actually just wants to be friends. This is especially because he is returning to china soon. I told her she has no idea what it feels like to be a guy. She has also shown multiple times in the past that she has difficulty interpreting guys intentions. 

One of her male friends is in agreement with me, saying that cliche line is really weird. My girlfriend thinks that me and him are jaded thinking malicious intent from the getgo, but we’re not exactly living in a candy land paradise. Suffice to say, she wont be hanging out with him anymore, but I wanted to see everyone’s opinions on the neighbor’s intentions.",My(26) girlfriend(23) doesnt believe her neighbor wants to hook up with her,18n4k4a,1703104624.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18n4k4a/my26_girlfriend23_doesnt_believe_her_neighbor/,

 Basically, I met this guy, and we really hit it off. I really love being with him if I could be with him every day, I really would. He’s told me time and time again that he wants a relationship with me. we haven’t officially started dating. I believed him before we got into our first fight. 

I got random flowers from someone anonymous, and it really hurt him; he was acting super jealous, etc. I tried to explain and solve the problem with him. He said he would be good, but then ignored me for a whole night and started acting super distant. I really get triggered when people ignore me, so I told him if your feelings will change so quickly because of something I can’t control, then we shouldn’t be together.

 He gets super upset and starts getting even more mad at me, so I just block him. I know it is childish. but I was so hurt that he would change so fast especially when i was reassuring him the entire day making sure he was okay. I realized with some space that I really like him, and I want it to work. I ask him how he feels, and he tells me he’s too hurt by me blocking him to get back together, and he’s already having financial issues, so he wouldn’t be able to treat me the way I deserve. So I just say okay and tell him I'm sorry, etc.

 We stop talking for good until a week goes by, and he tells me that he misses me so much and can’t forget me. I ask him why he’s telling me this, and he says that he wants to be with me, but he doesn’t know how since we’re far apart and he won’t have enough money to always see me (we’re college students), but he does not want me to spend money on anything. I tell him not to message me if he’s not serious, and he says sorry, he’ll leave me alone. I told him maybe in the future and I would miss him, miss the sex, etc. he asks me if i moved on yet and i say i only want him. He does a complete 180. After I say that, he tells me that he doesn’t care how much it is; my sex is too good, and he’s going to figure it out anything we can do. 

We talk, and he says he wants to love me, etc. We work things out, but now after everything, he hasn’t really been messaging me as much, saying he’s working, and I just haven’t felt the same energy as before. He barely gives me attention. I don’t know what to think. I thought it would go back to the way it was before, but it feels different, like he’s still so distant. Ever since I got those flowers, he changed. I want us to go back to the way we were before but everything is so different. How do i go about bringing this up to him.

TL;DR: I met this guy and fell in love. We both wanted a relationship, but after receiving flowers from an anonymous source, He became very angry with me and distant for the entire day, despite my constant assurances. I was very triggered by the sudden change in his behavior and told him we shouldn’t be together if he’s going to change so quickly on me. After regretting ending it, I tried talking to him again, but he said he’s not financially ready and too emotionally hurt by my breaking up to get back together; it won’t be good for him mentally. So I let him go. A week later, he messaged me, saying he needs me back and he misses me, but he’s still unsure if we can really do this due to his finances and not being mentally stable. I tell him to only message me if he wants something serious, and I will miss him and the sex, but we shouldn’t be in contact. He tells me he does want something serious, and he will figure out anything to be together. But he’s back to being distant and not talking to me as much.

"TLDR I'm completely lost not knowing if I'm doing the right thing by trying to go out instead or using DM only interaction.

M27 Introvert looking for advice and skip online dating to better myself and get rid of the shyness.

This girl sent me a friend request, I got excited since I'm not the one ever adding people and she's really pretty. I decided to do do something with my life and DM her. We had a very short conversation and She gave me her number almost right away (which is good I guess), saying it is easier for her to DM that way (using whatsapp).

I'm trying to get to know her by DM at least for a while until we meet, but she's busy all the time and kinda seems like she ghosts me sometimes. I didn't want to keep waiting for her responses so I ask her out thinking it will be easier to get to know each other and gain confidence.

She keeps pushing back the date for whatever reason (not even mad, I'm feeling pacient and chill). BUT I want to get to know her IRL not online (since I want real conection and interaction) also since she's busy I don't really send any messages (don't want to seem desperate or interrupt her work, also it's boring waiting for responses).

Since she works at the mall and I had to go (buy christmas presents) I told her (wondering if we could meet, just implying). She told me she wanted to or at the very least, have a look at each other from afar. Agreed but I found out she's actually busy all the time at work, couldn't even grab her phone or talk to me. It is fine, I don't mind waiting a little bit more for us to actually have some conversation.

But since we don't DM much or don't have the time to meet, I'm wondering if I should just give up and do it online and skip the real life stuff.",Am I screwing things up?,18n46ge,1703103637.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18n46ge/am_i_screwing_things_up/,
"Said person (who i've been seeing for 1.5 months) will reply sometimes enthusiastically and sometimes in a few words; but will always be happy to meet. I take it that there are three reasons for this:

1. genuinely 'bad' at texting, doesn't really see the point to have to stay in touch through texting between meetups
2. not that interested in me and just seeing where the wind blows
3. doesn't want to seem overly interested/needy; however, I assume this only happens in pre or very early dating stage.

"A little backgroud, a couple years ago I was engaged and I was broken up with on facebook. Yes, a 33 year old man stonewalled me for days, refused to speak to me, and broke up with me on facebook as I lived with him. I found out through facebook he had impregnanted another girl after he tried ""working things out"" with me. Because I moved states, he ended up getting all of my stuff like my washer and dryer (and much much more). It's over, it's done. I wake up every day thankful. &lt;- just some of my background

I'm a 31 year old female. I live at home because I go to school for studies regarding law, where I live in the US, rent is exttremly high, hence why i live at home. I have lived on by myself many times, I'm not some loser living in my parents basement; however I will admit I am a little late on the success train.

I wasn't even planning on dating until I finished school but this guy slid in the DM's while I was at the hair salon and I was bored so we began talking and hit it off. I always heard that when you aren't looking it will happen so I let it happen. 

Also, I am attractive. I'm not bragging or anything but I am a good-looking woman with a nice body as well. I'm really not trying to brag about this, but I am certainly not ugly. 

I like this guy, lets call him Greg. We have insane chemistry. He deoesn't want to make any previous misktakes and nor do I, he has been burned by his execs too.

He is successful, has a nice home, a very nice car (not that materialistic things are my thing) but yeah. I have dated a few successful people but it didn't work out. I guess i bring this up because i dated bums before and thought I could raise a man (ladies you can't rasie a man). 

We have been talking for a month and he ""doesn't want to make the same mistakes"". He doesn't want me talking to any other guys and yada yada. Yet he is still unsure of me because he doesn't know how i will act around his friends or family, ""I'm very soft spoken"" he says. 

Let me bring this up too because these things are a thing when dating, he is arab and I am from the Ozarks. He is an american and all and we were both raised with christian beliefs. he is much louder where ""we"" are more soft spoken. there are cultural differences. NO im not a bigot but that stuff exisits. 

We have been talking for a month and here comes the good stuff. He invited me to a work christmas party before even knowing me, i thought it was too soon and crazy but figured if he asked it wasn't a big deal. I bought a dress and everything and then after our first date he thought it would be too soon. Of course I was quite upset because he knew I was buying dresses and what-not. He said ""I don't know you're just so proper and if you're mine I want to call you mine."" Honestly I think he was a little itmidated by how friendly I am ""you wave at everyone and say hello"" yeah because I was raised a certain way. 

I have stayed at his place a couple times even when he is at work (i know that means he likes me) and I did some chores and whatnot because I like doing those things. I met a couple of his Muslim friends and we went out to eat last night and he was just like ""you're so soft spoken, no one can hear you"". 

I spoke to him today and he wants to see how I interact with more of his friends.... like i get it. 

I dont know if this is worth continuing even though I really do like him.

"I (27f) have always had a little crush on my teamleader (m31). Today I found out that his 9 year long relationship ended just before the summer break. I had no idea and now I am wondering what this means and if I should do anything.

You could read my ramble below for more context, but basically our relationship has always been strictly business. He has always done small things for me that made my heart skip a beat a little bit, but I always pushed that to the side because I knew he was in a 9 year long relationship with his girlfriend, whom he was living with. Today I found out that relationship ended a few months back. I stayed behind in his office to have one of our usual, yet rare, chats when it came up. He was very open about how the situation still upset him quite a bit and how he wished he could just get over everything, but that it's hard because of all the memories. The conversation shifted to dating, we talked about going on dates and what that's like. I joked that I could teach him everything about the dating apps since I have been on them for ages. He started asking me what I was looking for in a potential partner, what kind of relationship I wanted etc. How I felt about dating someone non-christian (I am christian, he is not). I asked the same questions back and it was odd because our answers to all those questions were basically the same (which I desperately tried not to put emphasis on). When the conversation got deeper, I realised I had to leave for a dinner so we packed up and he suggested to continue those questions some other time. We cycled to the city centre together and I was left with my mind reeling... 

I have no clue what any of this means. I work at a high school and I cannot imagine what it would be like to try and flirt with a colleague. He works as a PE teacher but is also the leader of our team (my headmaster is responsible for assessment of staff) so it feels almost inappropriate. He is still hurt about his past relationship, I have no clue if he even sees me as potentially more than just a colleague... Any advice?


Context:
I am a high school teacher and started teaching at my school when I was 23. He was my teamleader back then and he always supported me whenever I had a rough day. We immediately clicked because of our common passion for education but also because we have a similar way of thinking, always excited to try new things in the classroom. Ever since I started working with him, we have had a very fun banter, teasing eachother back and forth. He is kind and caring and overall just a great person. 

When I had to leave the school because my contract period was up, he took the effort to call me once in a while to ask how I was doing at my new job. We had never hung out privately, except in his office to discuss work things and to dream aloud about possible changes at school for the future, so I was happily surprised he made that conscious effort. I knew he always believed in me as a teacher and thought I was a capable one. He was bummed out when I had to leave and say goodbye to him and his team, so I figured he was just trying to stay in contact professionally to potentially get me back on his team at some point. Secretly I enjoyed those chats a bit more than I should have, but I always reminded myself that he lived together with his girlfriend and that I was happy for him.

I ended up coming back to the school I currently work at after a year and I re-joined his team. The work relationship was still great. One time the team went out for dinner and he and I stayed longer and had drinks together to chat. Again I was reminded of how fun he was to hang out with. He opened up a little bit about his own shortcomings and it felt like we were growing a bit closer. He offered to take me home afterwards, since it was dark and late. I refused saying I lived incredibly close and that I could handle myself. He insisted, saying he was raised by his parents this way. I refused again, a little bit confused because I knew he had a girlfriend (fast forward to now: he had apparently broken up with her back then). He conceded and we both went home our seperate ways.

Whenever I cannot reach him on the phone about something work related (I also work for another department in the school, so it's actually relatively hard to see eachother often) and I shoot him a message that we can chat about it the next day, he always rings me back, joking that whenever it's me who calls he definitely needs to ring me back. 

I tend to change up my clothes quite a bit around summer time. I normally wear jeans and comfortable outfits at school. When the summer break draws closer I swap those out for skirts and dresses. Last summer I caught him twice giving me a longer stare than necessary and commenting that I looked nice. This gave me a sense of quiet satisfaction, but again I was convinced this man was in a relationship so I pushed it away.

"Hi Reddit,

I’m in a confusing situation with my partner and could use some outside perspectives. Here’s the rundown:

	•	Background: We had a serious relationship last summer, but things have since changed. Now, he says he loves me and isn’t interested in anyone else, but he doesn’t want to be in a serious relationship.
	•	Communication Issues: He doesn’t call, visit, or video chat with me. I have a job near him and I visit him after work once a week. Our communication is limited to texts. He claims he needs his weekends for his hobbies and because his last 2 relationships never let him do that he’s being extra selfish this time (his words). 

	•	Social Media Blocking: He has blocked me on social media, which is really upsetting to me. I brought this up, and he understands my feelings but hasn’t made any changes.

	•	Holiday Plans: Recently, when discussing the holidays, he mentioned he isn’t ready to have me join his family Christmas, contrasting our previous level of seriousness. In my birthday I got no gift. No anything except sex. 

	•	My Feelings: I feel like he’s taking advantage of me. He expects me to be okay with his behavior, which feels unfair and confusing. It was ok until he decided to create this distance and I really don’t know what changed. 

I’m struggling to understand where I stand in this relationship and what I should do. He expresses love but his actions and boundaries suggest a reluctance to be fully involved or serious. Is this a situation where I should continue to be patient, or should I consider stepping back from the relationship? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

I started talking to a guy that is a little older than me. He treats me very well and is very attentive to my feelings, goes out his way to make me feel special blah blah.  A couple weeks ago i stopped talking to him for a little because we live a little distance from each other &amp; the times we would see each other he preferred to stay in the house, cuddle and watch movies which is cool but at some point started to seem like he just didn’t want to do anything with me.

Come Saturday night I watch his ig story (which I only found because he’s in my contacts) &amp; I see a bunchhh of people (a mix of ppl around his age and good number of young girls) with drinks and everything so this was clearly not an intimate party.

I really enjoyed this lifestyle and would be interested in continuing but know it isn't everyone's cup of tea. I have continued on as a single guy in the swinging lifestyle.

Me: Yeah most of next week actually. I could also hang this Saturday but whenever is fine with me

"Hey all, 
I’m hoping for some insight on someone I dated who I believe fabricated many lies during the time I dated him. He was in his mid 20’s and I’m trying to figure out if and why this guy made up stories.

 First this man told me he was a wildly successful business owner and that banks were trying to get his business by giving him massive business loans because his brand was so successful and profitable. Then he told me he owned his own home and allowed his parents to live with him while also supporting his folks financially. The one time I visited his home, his parents area was in the master bedroom/bath suite and his room was a tiny cramped space in the basement. While giving me a tour of “his” home, he also told me he used to live in a much larger home, but that he sold that bigger house so he could better support his parents and extended family. He then offered to drive me by his old house so I could see where he used to live, which I declined, because-weird. Another thing he told me was that he used to drive a Bentley, but that he sold it so he had more money to buy his mom a car. The car he owned when I met him was an older ford with lots of miles. I thought his current car choice was a big jump from a Bentley, but I didn’t think a ton about it as my work car/company car is the same and pretty reliable, so I figured he just wanted to be more sensible with a depreciating asset. Another bizarre instance occurred when he first called me, his number came up on caller ID as his father’s name. I asked him about this and he said it shouldn’t be in his dad’s name as everything is in his name since he pays all the bills.

This guy would go on and on about the things he’d buy his family. He once gave me a pretty bling bracelet that he said was “very expensive”. I soon discovered it was a fake bracelet, which didn’t bother me so much until he showed up for a date wearing the matching bling (women’s) necklace. I asked him some follow up questions on the gift and apparently he bought the set long before meeting me, but thought giving me the matching bracelet would be a thoughtful gift. 
Anyways, I was pretty suspicious that he was fabricating stories, so I just broke things off and gave him back the “gift”.  

I saw him recently working at an entry level job, certainly not being an entrepreneur. I’m not really one to call people out, but my feeling was he lied about living at home with his parents and probably everything else.

We met on a dating app and our first date was supposed to be a quick coffee date but it ended up going so well that he asked me to get dinner the same day.

I told him from the start that I am not looking for anything casual or FWB and he told me he is unsure what he wants because he recently got out of an 8 month relationship. We continued to hang out and he told me he has a crush on me but is confused because he is scared of commitment and he has a lot of life changes happening right now. I’ve never had this good of chemistry with someone before so I told him to take his time and just be honest with me if he decides he wants to be just friends.

"So I (23m) have a crush on my roommate (21f). I suspect that she might like me too, but have been throwing mixed signals. We only have 4 months left as roommates anyway so if she’s interested I wanna ask her out.

Signs that she might like me:

* she joke-flirts with me (she keeps saying “I love you”, hugging me sometimes for no reason. I write her jokey love songs and buy her small presents).

* she makes sexual jokes (we would hang out on the couch and she’d say “should we go upstairs and have sex” or I’d say I’m gonna take a shower and she’d say “do u want me to join you”)

* we cuddled a couple of times in bed, she put my arm around her and her head on my chest.

Signs she’s not interested:

* says I’m like their brother (we live with two other girls)

* she sets boundaries (i once spent the night cuddling with her in her bed and a few times since then when we hung out in her room she said “you’re not gonna spend the night”.

"I’m 25m living in a major west coast city. I split up with my partner of three years three months ago. Then I ran into 24f, a college crush, at a party a few weeks later. She had also just exited a long term relationship (both of us as dumpers) and turns out the crush was mutual. 

We hooked up the next week and went on some dates in the weeks afterwards. The sex was amazing from the get-go and all the dates were fun and full of laughs. We pretty quickly defined our relationship as casual, because she was moving to the east coast for a career opportunity in the new year.  

However casual we defined things, it did not stay that way. Both of us shared a lot about our recent breakups and supported each other in those lonely and hard moments. And we really clicked in a lot of ways; we had great conversational chemistry and social chemistry when out in the world and at parties and such. We were spending like more than half of the week together and basically getting the full bf/gf experience without an actual commitment

This is where it starts to get complicated; our circumstances were quite different. She was horribly overworked and simply didn’t have time to get out and date others. She made that clear to me and it became accepted that we were de facto exclusive. I had a much more balanced schedule, but I was really satisfied with dating her and didn’t want to seek anything else. She had a rough living situation and my place was solid, and I basically let her into the very middle of my life at a vulnerable time. 

You’ll never guess how this ends: I have quite strong feelings for her. She feels them for me too but I don’t think as fully. But things were fun comfortable and temporary, so we leaned on eachother hard. 

She just moved. And we continue to talk since the move; we are very open about how sad it is, and both of us have expressed that we wish it would have worked out to be together. It was predetermined but it has had me a wreck. We did not commit to anything together, we remain single, and yet we are still texting all the time and sharing our feelings and it’s been really hard on my heart. I realize that I overextended myself and got carried away, but I feel that she encouraged it too. 

She wants us to stay close now that she’s gone. And she wants me to visit her out east, even though we aren’t together and have no plans to be. I have real feelings for her but it feels so risky to go see someone who I’m not exclusive with, and who I’m worried likes me more out of the circumstances and less because she is into me as a person. I’ve shared that I feel sad and uncomfortable about this and it’s made her feel guilty. I don’t know if my heart can take the continued intimacy knowing she’s out on dates with new people. 

How should I approach this? Part of me knows that my feelings are really strong and I’m seeking real love (I’m not 100p convinced we have this potential together which is why I haven’t asked her to stay together/exclusive). if we can’t pursue that deep connection then I should save myself the hurt and pull back. But I also don’t know how to stay intimate and flirty and friendly with someone who I used to have as a (de facto) partner and no longer do. It makes me feel awful thinking about her hooking up with other guys, and I’m worried about the fact that she is pretty sexually open and told me she is de facto exclusive with me only because she had no time to meet other guys. I think I also need to be single for a bit after she goes, but I’m not really into hookups and much prefer a connection with people I sleep with. 

Is staying in close touch and planning a trip a bad idea? I’d love advice on any ways I can help our friendship be as strong and full as it can be without giving me great heartache.

"I guess it mustve been since she didnt answer but I wanted another opinion on this.

This is the story.

I started working at this clothing store this week and there was this one girl, she was alone there that day since theyre understaffed and she was actually from a store from a city like 1 hour trainride away. She basically trained me and showed me how the business is run. Since Im parttime Im there tomorrow again and she worked there tuesday and today and tomorrow shes gonna be in her town again.

I started by asking regular stuff, like how long does she work there, does it get hectic sometimes all that stuff. Throughout the shift I made jokes like for example she tasked me with getting all the stuff from the changing rooms and hang it back on the racks theyre supposed to be on. A lot of times I had stuff that was labeled ""pullovers"" even though it wasnt a pullover and one time I had a weird dress I wasnt sure of and asked her ""where does this go?, pullovers"" and she just died laughing. Or I didnt like the music in the store so we would check out all the radio stations and I suggested Reggae since thats usually mellow and easy to listen to. We find a station and Im like ""this might be something"" so we just stood there just critically nodding our heads like ""is this good or nah?"" and she died laughing again by the fact we both had the same exact reaction. Or she had this diabetes beeper thing on her and had headaches, I asked her what I am supposed to do if she just collapsed on me and she laughingly said shes fine. I asked about her well being throughout the shift and asked if I should get her something with sugar from a store nearby. She declined because apparently chocolates and stuff has fats in it that doesnt transport the sugar as well. Apparently Fruits and especially orange juice is the way to go.

It went really well, I was unexpectedly smooth but I think we just clicked and it was just me being me that worked. An hour before the shift ended I just asked into the room kinda like ""oh so when this shift is over we wont see us again right?"" which she replied to ""Im here till wednesday"" so I just pulled out my phone opened ""create contact"" and she put her number in.

Later that day I asked her if she got home fine and she replied the next morning which seemed weird (I wrote her 8pm). She replied like ""yeah I got home fine thanks for asking"" and I replied ""alright great, trainrides can get crazy, you never know who steps in"" (maybe open a conversation about crazy stuff weve seen on the train) and followed by ""are you starting your shift now?"" (I wanted to follow up with like ""are you alone there today again?"" or maybe ask her to do stuff when shes done since shes in my city, like just confirm ""are you in town today?"")

She didnt reply to that ever since, I guess its over then. I asked my sister and she said maybe she wanted me to go there, hangout with her in the store but didnt want to ask, basically wanted me to show stronger interest in her. But I feel like maybe it was too intrusive like ""are you there right now?!"" (and my sister just meant well so that the hit on my self esteem isnt that hard). Like I replied to her 10min before her shift started. I didnt wait for that I just happened to check my phone around that time.

I didnt go there on her shift since I was afraid I might come off as creepy. Like ""you didnt answer but I wanted see you"".

Would you ever date someone in a wheelchair? 
As a male wheelchair user it can be hard to meet people and this seems to be the main factor I thought I’d just get different thoughts. 



Hello, fellow Redditors. I'm a 30-year-old male exploring the dynamics of relationships with unique needs. Specifically, I use a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, which primarily affects my mobility.

As I navigate the realm of relationships, I often ponder a significant question: Would you ever date someone in a wheelchair? This inquiry stems from the challenges I face in meeting people, and I'm keen to gather diverse perspectives.

In my journey, I consistently use mobility aids, including wheelchairs, and while I can manage without them for a significant part of the time, there are occasions when they are essential. Navigating the early stages of connection, I've hesitated to discuss my personal disabilities, fearing it might overshadow getting to know someone. However, I realize that eventually, this topic will surface, and I'm uncertain about the outcomes.

I'm reaching out to the community for experiences and perspectives on forming connections with someone who uses a wheelchair. Have you or someone you know embraced relationships with someone like me? How did you navigate the unique aspects of intimacy and connection?

I genuinely appreciate any insights or advice you may have as I continue on this journey, striving for meaningful connections despite the challenges my disability presents in meeting new people.",I (M30) am Seeking Insights on Dating as a Male Wheelchair User.

"Hey all, figured I would ask this on a whim cause I'm dumb (and also lonely, obviously!)

I am in my early 30s, and have not so much as been on a date (much less any kind of physical intimacy) for over a decade. I tried tinder and bumble during the early days of the pandemic with no luck, and was badly burned by the experience since a few trusted people around me suggested it. However, while I have heard a lot of negative things about online dating, I thought I would get some more opinions on whether I should even bother at all, or continue to improve myself and wait another 5 years or so before trying. For reference, I have heard the least bad things about hinge, so that would probably be where I start unless there are better suggestions!

Pros: somewhat athletic (run \~5-8 miles every other day, lift weights on days that I don't run, have only missed 5 days in the past 7 months); dress decent I think (generally button down shirts with jeans/slacks and dress shoes is my standard); fine at talking to women in a non-romantic context (get along quite well with female coworkers, more of my close friends are women than men); willing to try new things; have some hobbies, though they are solitary (I have a hard time trying group activities by myself); decently paying job that I love but isn't too tough, and my own apt (looking for house); willing to try new things (getting new interests, I have started going to museums and traveling, also love finding new places to have coffee/sweets); trying to improve mental health (therapy helps).

Cons: lack of self-esteem/confidence (this is a bad one, though I can hide it well sometimes); overweight (5'10"" and 185 lbs, I am working on it with but I love my tea/coffee and sweets); lack of experience (as I said, 10+ years; no idea what the hell people even do now. Is a coffee date even a thing? is that boring?); fairly boring (spend a lot of time at home, though I am trying to improve); not really attractive (especially in terms of photos/videos, I always cringe when I see myself in them, would give myself 4/10 on a good day); few friends, so lack of a strong social life (most live in other cities, close to some coworkers though); worry about looking desperate (I know this is a turn-off, so I want to make sure I don't come off as being super-needy or that I just want to get in bed).

So tell me, do I have a decent chance, or should I continue self-improvement? Honesty is what I want, I am looking for legit data and will not be offended (""no you suck lol"" ""keep running big chungus"" are acceptable answers!) Thanks in advance!

"I just wanted to share my story to be transparent and explain everything. My name is Rick and I live in New York, I was diagnosed with Autism when I was five years old. I spent most of my childhood in special education up until I turned 17, at that time I transferred to a regular high school and completed four years, graduated with a diploma and a regents diploma. Currently, I'm 23 and in a tight spot regarding girlfriends and sexual relationships. It's very cold here in NYC right now and I just finished this semester of college. I have tried putting myself out before and I was rejected a few times in the past because of various reasons, but none of them had to do with me personally.I'm very up-to-date on my appearance and my cleanliness. I don't go out at all unless I have to go to college. I feel like this is what is hurting me the most. I'd love to meet an Asian girl or woman because I am attracted to them, I find them to be very cute, beautiful, or sexy. I feel like that element of amazement and excitement is missing from my life and it has me feeling depressed and hopeless. I just want to overcome this fear I have. I feel like if I leave the apartment, something terrible will happen and it will destroy my spirit. I'm afraid of the possibilities and I'm also yearning for genuine connection and romance.

"Hello everyone, as mentioned in my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/s/YCo67xXdbn), I want to optimize my online dating experience to get out of my loner life. Besides my profile, I also aim to optimize my approach. Luckily, I get decent results with the way I approach women on the apps so far. The question I have today has been a rather confusing topic for me for a while now.

When I send a ""Like"" where I not only swipe but also leave a message, I always write a girl-specific compliment to warm her up to conversation. (This works most of the time.) But when they match my like and just say ""Thanks,"" I really get confused. It seems to me they are just being nice and polite, but on the other hand, in order to write me back, she has to match me first, right?

So, my question is: Is this ""Thanks"" actually just her being nice and polite, or should I consider her match and this confusing message combination as an obvious green light for me to elaborate on the conversation?

"I thought maybe if people have an idea on how to understand it better maybe i could re create such situations myself, to be natural and to find natural. 

To give context about myself and what i think adds to my situation; at the start of my middle school i was private schooled. Ever since 19 I've been seeing thru the consequence of my middle school decisions, wich led me to not have a well developed social circle and not be able to go to university (Graduated but low points).

  
The big problem i find myself in is that in school you are stuck there for good or for bad but you are stuck there and you'll deal with it. I didn't do that. I do have my friends but meeting girls thru my friends is just a no for various reasons. Even tho i did meet a girl not a long ago thru one of these friends and it was with her that i didn't even realize time or think about reason to stay in the conversation. It got messed up but i still think back about it and that's my bar, to have met a girl that i felt a natural gravitation towards. I'm naturally curious and i like to listen, understand and summary. That's why i still have the same friends from 10 years ago because i push them and they push me as well. I just never felt this way towards any girl, i liked her character, personality, her history, made it easy and a pleasure to be there. Later it turns out our family situations were similar wich was unusual for me to have met but it kind of was the silent connection that was there even before we started speaking. So there's that. 

No school, i hate clubs, i hate this rave party culture that's going on rn (at least in my country). It's the winter and even if it was summer i'm starting to find it less and less amusing to go up to someone random, i'm in the GYM often but same problem. At work chances are you'll be working with a 40s mom is pretty high. I feel like there is nothing natural that i can do to meet girls. Just the cold approach, search for parties 24/7, attend random events that you don't care about. I could pick up hobbies but it would be to meet girls. What can i do, that i just DO, and girls will be just there and there will be opportunities for me to see who these people are. The only thing on my mind is to get more points, get to university, and somewhere down the line be capable of a psychology university, that i feel like could be a genuine goal for me and a opportunity where i can get to know girls without the girls being the goal, the obsession.

"I’m going to put my own list because I was looking around and didn’t find a ton of answers. Please add yours!!! 

(clarification so no one feels attacked
or exposed: I wrote this list to remind myself so I’m the you here lol)

1. recognize that you’re being a “dopamine gremlin” and want to “live in their back pocket” @[AdRepresentative584](https://reddit.com/u/AdRepresentative584/s/GKvPWZKagW)

2. ￼ limit number of days of the week you interact with them

3. See your friends; do your hobbies

4. Figure out which buttons they are pushing*** and push them yourself. examples:
* Validation and words of affirmation
* worthiness, being lovable
* Physical stuff
* Attention in general
* Posing you with interesting emotional problems
* Talking, listening 
* reflecting you back at yourself
* Learning something new
* Acts of service
* Monetary support
* Adventure
*  Protection, safety

5. keep your text conversation on do not disturb so you don’t get lots of little text dopamine hits throughout the day. 

5b. When you do get a message and it spikes your brain chemicals, recognize what’s happening (that you’re getting a brief high from their message)

6. Be honest with them about what you’re feeling and why you’re feeling it (i.e. we’re re in a honeymoon phase and I’m feeling a lot of intense stuff or talk about the brain chemistry of falling in love which applies to NT folx too) 

7.  If they run for the hills, that’s a sign that they weren’t the right person at the right time (NOT that you did anything wrong)

8. don’t avoid difficult conversations. in fact, encourage them

9. ***If you don’t know what buttons they are pushing for you, take time to do body and emotion scans, or journaling, or therapy to figure it out

10. ***If you don’t know how to push the buttons that they are pressing yourself, take the time to learn!!!! (this is Hard Fucking Work and out of the scope of this post)



bonus: There’s no right way to take it slow. you can take it slow with:
a. information about yourself
b. physical acts
c. conversations that will get you into a heightened emotional space
d. stories about your past
e. amount of time you spend
f. Who you introduce them to from your life

You can mix and match. If you go fast, emotionally or physically, but take other things, slow… It still counts as taking things slow. you get to decide what will help you get the healthiest most positive outcome. i’m going to say that one again for the people in the back/myself 

you get to decide what will help you get the healthiest, most positive outcome

"Started to talk to this girl on Dec 1st. We meet at work and that very next day I went to her apartment, we had a really good time and everything felt right and i had this connection with her instantly. After i left her apartment she texted me saying that she doesnt want to give off the wrong intentions and said she just wants to be friends. I told her that we really had a good time and that the connection was real cause energy doesnt lie. 

The next day she said she has somebody and isn't interested. Said she wanted to be just friends, I told her that I can not be friends with her since that day we hung out at her house was amazing from 10 P.M till 2 A.M I thought friends didn't do that type of thing, im from a different era where ppl who do that are generally interested in more than friends. I told her that I can not be friends with her cause I'll eventually want more and that it hurts to like her. She says don't say that, you never know what could happen. I then asked her If she was open to what could develop between us and she said yes, but no rush. I told her okay no rush. 

All that I've typed so far was like a 3 day span, fast forward a week later we go to the casino and that's when we get all touchy, she leans onto me and I'm holding her thinking this is awesome we are moving forward in this relationship, we make out that night and have sex. The next day we go to work together and come back to her place again having sex. The next day she tells me that she's not interested in a relationship cause her last one ended like 2 months prior before talking to me and that it was too soon. 

3 days ago I told her that I can't keep doing this if she just wants to be friends, cause I am getting way to close to her way too fast. These last two days we been texting but I can tell there's a difference now, I texted her good morning this morning and no reply. Just need some advice.

Then this happens with the 1st girl I've tried to talk too.

Mom being emotional and physically abusive, beating her up multiple times like ripping her hair out during physically attacking her and kicking her in the chest. Yelling at her, calling scum and sick. 

Saying she’s ungrateful and that her younger brother is the favorite child over her. Saying that she doesn’t like her, and doesn’t r because she looks like her dad who she hates. When she cries, if they hear her, they tell her to shut up because she’s too loud and can wake her younger brother up who’s 5. Such things as that. Since I came into the picture when I attended UCLA and started dating her, her parents and her relationship got worse. Her mom threatened to get me hurt by her family because she didn’t want her daughter getting any ideas running off with me. Just things got even worse since I’ve been around, 2x more emotional and verbal abuse, 2x more physical attacks. 

Parents say she should be lucky that they give her a place to stay and make her pay cheap rent, and that she has barely any responsibilities.

We are in a long distance relationship now and every single day he expects me to call him, or send him snaps or voice notes and he claims that he loves me a lot. He needs a lot of reassurance which kind of gets tiring for me also to keep giving him keeping in mind my vulnerabilities as well. I always appear to be babying him and I'm not able to open up to him since he'd start crying about his own issues. I don't mind giving assurances as long as he is also understanding that I can't text him and be mushy every time. 
The problems began when he started to hate the male presence in my life. Even my brother's existence in my life, or for that matter, me hanging out with my BROTHER bothers him. He gets ""scared"" that he might lose me. I can't mention my other male friends I have set clear boundaries with to him or else he starts overthinking that I might end our relationship. 
He was very nice to me when we first met and we weren't dating. Nobody would even doubt that. But now its getting suffocating to me to talk to him or even reply to his messages.

"So, I am 28F, he is 33M. We are classmates for our master degree, and known each other for three months. We have same profession so we start having connection from there. However, both of us are introverts, and he kept most of the things himself. I still have energy to speak a lot with my classmates, while he only had short conversation with other classmates, and came back to his computer. With each other, we spoke in a great length, even though most of them were light topics, like cultures, hobbies, laundry, food, materials. We had inside jokes and laughed together. However, it needs a lot of effort to reach this stage.
He hangs with me a lot in class, but I suspect he did it because I am the most bearable to him. Lol. He is observant, and remember quite a lot of details I told him weeks/months ago.

Nevertheless, I asked him several times to hang out outside class, and I did not invite others in case he was not comfortable with a lot of people. And he kept rejecting my invitations. But he seems fine if I followed him around pre/after class. So, I am so confused.

"Gf has new job, extra curricular event is going with her girl (let’s call her Samantha) workmate to watch a soccer match where some of the guy coworkers play against each other. Now she’s pretty quick to name the coworkers she hangs around with, drinks with etc. I appreciate this and I say i trust her and encourage her to socialise. 

She’s always specifically said that “her and samantha” are going to watch and drink with them. Or retrospectively she’d say “me and samantha went”.

Last week me and girlfriend were out drinking, she’d had a few, I asked her about her experiences with workers in specific department in her building, the question was just about them as people and how I think they can be quite rude to customers in my experience, this came up because we had just interacted with some people doing that kinda job. She said she thought they were okay and I asked if she interacted with them much or even made friends with any at her own workplace to which she said “yeah, one of them gives us a ride to watch them play soccer”. I swept that under the rug. This feels so in contrast to the usual “me and Samantha went”, “me and Samantha are going”.

She usually mentions her guy workmates by name and openly, same as the girls, when I brought this up again yesterday she first said that “her and Samantha go to the match, who is the other person?” I told her about what she said and she said “ohh yeah, he’d take us there that’s it”. I find it weird how it’s still a “he”. I asked whether or not they not made friends? I’d understand that if he was giving them a ride back, but a ride to the place? Makes me think the three of them are friendlier than she’s suggesting. I asked her that and she hasn’t texted back in 24 hours.

Is her claim that only her and Samantha would go to watch her work soccer match true or false?",Is she being purposely vague about male coworker?,18mvrh1,1703082227.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mvrh1/is_she_being_purposely_vague_about_male_coworker/,

Anyway my mom just found out she got covid and i where supposed to spend christmas at here place and my gf at here moms place...
So i said that i got news that i wasnt going to go there this christmas and she came in and said jokingly ""ugh then we have to spend christmas together..."" and then said well mayby you should go anyway covid is not that bad nowadays..

And i got upset even tho it was a joke it was in a negative kind of way, instead of saying something like ah nice then we get to spend christmas together.. or it will work out..
And i told her that it wasnt fun to hear, i felt unwated and in her way..

So when i said that she told me the classical ""im sorry YOU took it that way"" 
And i always hate to hear that becuse in my world when you say something like that you dont take any responsebilaty for having a negative tone and dissmiss me..

So i told her i dont like when you say that and she got really defensive and started an argument and got realy mad..

Its like when i open up and say how i feel she turn it on me that im the one who is to blame for ""taking it that way"" 
She dont want to admit that she hurt me by the comments she made..

"Is this… ok? Is there protocol for this?

I have been dating this (amazing) girl for about 2 months, and we finally had the exclusivity talk. We also have not had sex yet, since she wanted to wait because she “really likes me” and was scared of getting hurt. Totally reasonable.

While having this discussion, I found out that during those first couple months of us dating she has been sleeping with a FWB. I was surprised that she would make me wait this whole time, while still having sex with another guy. However, that’s something I can get past because we weren’t exclusive yet—but upon hearing it I was still taken aback lol, and an unexpected question escaped my mouth:

“When??”

We had been spending so much time together (and I hadn’t even been thinking about other girls) that I wondered when she even had time to be hooking up with a FWB?

“Most nights…” she (kinda nervously) told me. Never asks questions you don’t want the answer to lol.

“Even nights you were with me?” I asked, almost reflexively.

“Yeah…” she said. A couple examples:

One night we had this really fun carnival date, and I dropped her off at her apartment when the date was over. He came over a little later and spent the night with her.

Another morning, I picked her up early so we could drive to a music festival. Her FWB had already spent the night and left her apartment shortly before I arrived.

You get the idea? “Most nights” were probably like this.

She has no problem being honest/transparent (one of the *many* qualities I really admire in this girl), and she has no desire to see the FWB once we are exclusive, which she seems really excited about! (She’s “absolutely crazy over me,” and “can’t stop thinking about me 24/7!” she told a mutual friend). But the *timing* of her hookups (i.e. the distance between them and seeing me) is not sitting right with me. And now I’m not so sure if want to enter a relationship with her.

I told her I felt surprisingly stung by this, and I needed a couple days to think about things. She has reassured me that I am *all* she has been thinking about this whole time, and there were zero feelings for the FWB. I can tell I’ve made her feel super anxious now (which I feel bad about), but she is doing her best not to appear upset.

Is this something you could get past? Should I commit to her? Have I been “wronged” in any way? Has some sort of dating decorum been violated here? Should I end things? Maybe I'm just being butthurt about the FWB and focusing on the timing when it doesn't really matter.

I’d also love to hear from women specifically, have you done this? Does it matter? Could you still really like a guy, and hook up with an FWB… on the same day you hung out with him? Is there like… an appropriate time (in terms of hours), between when its ok to see one dude, then another? I am just confused.

**Edit: Here's an Update**: I couldn’t shake the ill feeling in my stomach, and I decided to end things completely with her. She was very sad, and it was hard for me to hear. I won’t be seeking out another LTR anytime soon. I should probably just focus on having fun at this stage in my life, anyway.

Rack my brain really hard to come up with creative bios , try to upload the best pictures that all my friends , many of whom are women , liked. I have even used ChatGPT to write my Bumble bio. I have posted my profile here in this community for feedback , showed to my friends. The effort is real. But RARELY I have gotten any matches. And when say rarely it means I got two or maybe three dates in more than 4 years. Matches I get , mostly do not respond , they just expire. The ones that do respond unmatch after few words. I used to think this is probably normal experience , maybe others have it marginally better. I am not a bad looking guy , people compliment me the way I represent myself. But I don't have facial hair and I am medium height. The awakening came when I started to compare my profiles with other friends of mine. My jaw dropped when I saw a friend of mine with very similar height as mine but with facial hair , with maybe with slightly cuter smile is getting scores of matches. Or another friend who is 6ft , average looking but with facial hair and nice jawline overflowing with matches to the point he gets 3 to 4 dates every week.

"Hello Reddit this is my first time posting on here ever so I’m not really sure how to do this. But basically I am looking for some advice. I met this girl via a dating app about 2 weeks ago. We hit it off decided to go on a date and then things were going smoothly for a while after our date. One day I got bored and decided to use this sendit app (where you can have people ask or tell you things anonymously and you’re supposed to try and guess who they are.) I posted a prompt on Snapchat to see if anyone would anonymously ask me anything. I noticed a few hours later I had a little message in the send it app, clicked on it and it said “I really like you”. Now this girl that I was talking to and went on a date with is the only girl I was talking to at the time (and I’m still not talking to anyone). So I decided to post this anonymous message to see if she will swipe up and say it was her. Instead I don’t hear from her for a few hours which turns to two days. I find this odd and decide to check things out and realize she has blocked me on all social media platforms that we had added each other on. This confused me as I thought the message from sendit was from her, I decided to look into the sendit notification a little deeper and realized that it was from over a year ago so actually couldn’t have been her. Now I feel like I have a clear picture of what got her upset and why she blocked me but I’m not sure how to go about trying to talk things out and see if we can patch things up. I can’t talk to her over the phone as she has unfriended or blocked me on everything. I did pick her up from her place for our date so I can go talk to her in person, I am just not sure if this would come across badly on my part by just showing up unannounced. Or would showing up in person be a good sign that I care and would like to communicate rather then just move on and seem like one of those hallmark movies where the guy chases the girl to the airport before her flight leaves.

"For anyone who wants a bit more backstory / context, please read my last post. 

So on Thursday last week I asked a girl named Angela I work with if she wanted to hang out at some stage. She said yes but before I could ask for her number she had to leave to talk with our boss.

Since then I haven’t really had ample opportunity to talk with her again due to us not being in the same sections and me needing to be in work a bit earlier for a different shift. On Monday Angela wasn’t in, yesterday I thought I’d write a quick note during some down time with the following:

“Hello I forgot to ask for your number the other day but if you wish to grab dinner / coffee / drink sometime when you aren’t busy let me know. No pressure

(With my number below)”

I intended to give it to her before I left but she was talking with another woman as I was leaving and I didn’t want to interrupt or give the note to her with people around. Today I had no time whatsoever to even get a break so I missed my opportunity again. Tomorrow is her last day I’m pretty sure so I’m basically forced to try speak with her some stage.

"Met a guy, we instantly liked each other and upon starting to talk after liking each other for months, he discovered I still live with my ex (until I find my own place -which may take some time because we own the house we’re living in so it’s a lot more complicated than me just moving out). The guy said after seeing each other for a week it kept bothering him that I still shared the house with my ex. Then we stopped talking and that’s it. It’s really killing me to not talk to him, I’m wondering if he feels the same or do guys just shut their feelings off? 

I’m being told if a guy really likes you there’s no way he can handle you living with another man so his actions are normal.

Then I’m being told if he really likes you he’ll try to make it work. 

I don’t want to put a standard on what he should do. I just want some clarity (as I was still getting to know him) if he was just looking to date and get in my pants or if he’s honest about having feelings for me.

I just feel like if he had feelings for me he couldn’t just go from that to zero. Or do guys work like that?

For reference we’re both 33 and he’s been through a divorce and heartbreak/has trust issues, and seems very protective over his heart.

"I've been pondering over a social phenomenon that seems to be quite common, yet it leaves me baffled. It's about the dynamics of attraction and the initial approach, specifically why I never seem to get approached by women.

Now, I'm fully aware that traditionally, men are often expected to make the first move. And I'm okay with that and I will continue doing that. However, I can't help but notice instances around me, like coworkers who frequently get approached and even asked for their numbers by strangers at the gym for example . This got me thinking. 

I consider myself a regular guy, not giving off any weird vibes, or at least I hope not. People often tell me I'm quite attractive and have very masculine features. But could this actually be a double-edged sword? I have a theory—bear with me, I'm not trying to come across as cocky—that maybe my appearance is somewhat intimidating, making it less likely for women to approach me.

Is it possible that being perceived as 'very attractive' can create a barrier in social situations? Could there be an element of intimidation at play that deters someone from making the first move?

I'm genuinely curious about your thoughts and experiences. Has anyone else encountered this? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

"I 27f was cheated by my 27m bf with his coworker

Do I lack something that he choose to cheat on me?

Hi, I really need some advice,  and I'm not sure what to do next with our relationship, by the way I'm a 27 yrs old female, same age with my partner. It's been 5 years being with him and I cannot believe that he cheated on me,  we did love each other, he supported me emotionally and physically and he also supported with my school tuition fee sometimes, until I graduated. Until this happends, when I was still working with my previous company, every weekend I usually visited him just to hangout and talk... since we have a different schedule, he works night shift and I work day shift,I always give time, I cook, I buy him snacks that he wanted, shower him the love that he wanted... until I've noticed that he keeps on looking at his phone, and I have this gut feeling that something is off... as he goes to take a shower he left his phone and I have the chance to  look at it... I don't  usually do this since I trust him like a 100%, but as I look at his phone there's this girl He keeps on messaging, he keeps on asking her different questions, giving her money since she keeps on asking to send her some... asking what she is doing, sharing deep stuffs about life and choices... the worst part is that he keeps saying I love you to her... But the girl doesn't responds back, I think that his I love you to me wasn't special anymore.... since he gave it to someone else making them feel special... I was crying that time and confuse what to do... we try to talk it out he said it was just a friend since he badly wants to talk to someone... since I was busy and doesn't have time to talk with him. I said that I always try my best to give him attention... to give him time... but that doesn't mean that he should say I love you to another girl... and give her money every time she needs it...

"If this is the wrong sub I’ll delete, sorry I’m advance.

I have a coworker, a woman, who I for the life of me, cannot tell if she is just being friendly with me or not. I’m gonna preface all this by saying though I’m basically a ghost employee/coworker, I talk to basically no one, but for the most part I’m friendly/helpful when I do. 

So…

I work a delivery job with her. Over time I feel as though she has sometimes gone out of her way to do things just to talk/be around me. For instance, about a week ago I was given two newbie helpers in the morning to load my work van, more than enough help for me, never need it really anyway. She sees them helping me and yet still comes by just to help when there were plenty of other people around that would’ve been in need of her help, so I thought that was kinda odd…

I once made an off hand comment about something I noticed she was doing one day, nothing flirty in any way, nothing one would really consider as a meaningful conversation topic. Just, offhand small talk. I think almost a whole day later, I see her again in the morning, and she just picks up this nothing convo again, it’s really just odd to me that she would just start talking about what I said an entire day later. I really want to emphasize that what I said was not in any particular way interesting or funny or anything like that, but she just brought it up out of the blue almost to seemingly just have anything to talk about with me. This also wasn’t like a time where we were stuck together and she’s just starting small talk to fill the silence in the air, she came out of her way over to me and brought this up again, I find that a little odd.

She has once randomly offered to get me some water during the loading of our workvans. Another really unnecessary thing to have asked, considering we have both a little shop to buy drinks where we work and a few different little fridges where they straight up have water for us all, free of charge. We weren’t particularly rushed/it’s not like I didn’t have time to get water, I was just chilling in my van at the time 🤔.

Fast forward to yesterday. She called me almost towards the end of my shift to “check” on me. No one, including her, has ever done this before. I wasn’t moving particularly slow. I wasn’t showing signs of struggling in the morning when she saw me. It’s basically my main route that I never have a problem with. In the moment, I told her I was fine and ended the call, but afterwards I started doing mental gymnastics about it and really started questioning why she did that. I will say this, she knows my grandma passed and might’ve been just seeing if emotionally I was holding it together but I haven’t been much acting different since her passing/telling her that and it’s also been about a week since I told her that so it’s kinda odd if she’s just now “checking” on me imo. 🤔

Idk, I honestly feel like maybe she’s just a bit odd/overly friendly or something and I’m just really overthinking her interactions with me. They really seem like just someone being friendly but I always find interacting with her leaves me doing mental gymnastics for the next day or so.  

Am I overthinking this? Is this nothing? Or am I not picking up on subtle clues that’s she’s crushing on me in some way?",Am I looking too much into things or dropping the ball??,18mru0p,1703069246.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mru0p/am_i_looking_too_much_into_things_or_dropping_the/,
"So I met this girl a few years ago when we were out clubbing and we ended up going back to her place with some friends. We sat talking all night long and really hit it off, having the best conversation ever and we align in so many ways it was almost uncanny. After this night we didn't speak too much as we don't live nearby each other.

Now, we live in different countries however only like 1 hour from each other which isn't crazy. Recently she came to my city and I took her out, we both had a great night and finished it with a kiss. We have been consistently texting for a few weeks now and she takes sometimes 24 hours to reply to a message but we speak in depth so maybe she is just waiting until she has enough time to process what we are talking about.

However, this is where my real confusion begins. She ignored my messages for 7 days then finally messaged me and apologised as she has been feeling quite down and been super busy with working and just hasn't had alot of time to process things and was super apologetic but then said she would give me her full attention from then on because she thought we were super alike and she really liked me. Now, only 2 days later, she has done the same again where she is taking over 20 hours to open a message. I don't know if she is fucking around or is just busy but either way, it's not good for me.

"I’m crushing on this girl I met at school. I have no idea if she’s interested or attracted to me. Our short conversations have been neutral and friendly. I have no idea if she’s just being friendly, interested, or shy. I have an inkling that I have a chance, but I want to be optimistic without being delusional. She literally doesn’t talk to any other guys in class and the one class we have, she always sits next to me. Idk if she just likes that seat or is just comfortable being around me.

I’m not being overbearing or even flirting with her. I’m pretty much stuck at default, but I want to make some moves so I’m not “friend zoned”.

I think having each other’s numbers is a start. She has 2 friends she always talks to so if she texts me “about school”, it could mean she just wants to talk to me because she could’ve just messaged her friends and not me. I have a feeling she’s very aware of how boys are around her and I don’t wanna seem thirsty by texting her as soon as I get her number.

I also don’t want to look into every positive interaction we had and think she likes me. It’s gonna drive me crazy. I’m trying to be realistic.

"23M I’ve recently started dating this girl 23F . We met on Tinder and she reached out to me first and we started talking there and after few days we switched to Instagram. She goes to college near the place I live but she lives in town not far from mine. We agreed to go on a date after her college finished I picked her up and even offered to drive her home and she accepted. First date was mostly talking and meeting each other and she said she had a great time with me. We continued talking and exploring and second date came in and we decided to go for a walk after her college and when we were walking by the beach we stopped for a minute because it was beautiful moonlight and she said her hands were kinda cold so I took my chance to hold her and we kissed.

She told me she is really into me as I am into her and she wants to take things very slowly so she can know me better and I was honest to her that I want relationship and she said that it will happen but it will take time so she can fully trust me… It may seem simple but also other thing that worries me is that she really wants to see me but she feels like we should do it maybe once per week because if we see alot it may not work because we don’t know each other very well…and she feels she will miss me more and stuff if we don’t see so often.

"tl;dr: I was invisible, now I get asked out, what I see should point to the opposite.

In short: I'm the side character in the background that's usually invisible, I did attempt over the years to make my own place, find love and be a bit more than that random person in the background. It didn't work, and I gave up after turning 30.

As I stopped, a lot of the efforts I made also came undone.

I used to dress well enough to be complimented on my taste. Now I just pick stuff that is comfortable and don't look if it fits or not. My looks are rather random, but not great as a result.

I stopped smiling or asking about people. I've never been the most social person, but I made efforts to not be completely silent, and showed some interest towards people. Now, if I speak, it's for a verbal attack. It makes some people laugh, but my humor is solely based on ""attacking"" others verbally, for lack of a better word (not english native, sorry about weird sentences). I stopped caring about what other people think since I threw in the towel and resolved to make peace with living an existence alone.

It's less ""I'm honest, deal with it"" and more ""gratuitously aggressive for no real reason"". I lost a few friends that way who called me a prick and I agreed.

I go out a lot less. If I go somewhere, it's because I really, really love it (concerts, martial arts clubs mostly), but other outings were cut down, hobbies that I can do alone I make sure to do alone. I still see my friends, both men and women, being completely alone isn't good for my head. Even if the social skills got a lot worse.

So why do I get asked out now? I'm more of an ass than I ever was and I think people are supposed to turn wiser as they age.

An acquaintance I made while eating with friends was really pushy to invite me to a concert. We went. I tagged along and enjoyed the music, didn't care much about her. I went radio silence afterwards, she was annoying. My friends later told me she was sweet and all and they never saw me with someone so I could have given it a try.

It happened again. This time, I considered it. But I'm 36, and I felt this ship had sailed as far as I'm concerned. I did consider playing along to try out sex, elected against it. Despite me turning her down, she tried a few more times, we have common interests and so on. She was hurt I didn't reciprocate, and my friends, again, told me she was pretty cool so why not?

Sure, it happened only twice in my life, but of all periods, it happens now? I can't make sense of it.",At which point did I (36m) turn attractive?,18mqocg,1703064576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mqocg/at_which_point_did_i_36m_turn_attractive/,

"So I (30F) have been seeing a guy (33M) for just over a month now. We have slept together, we kiss and cuddle, basically acting like we’re together, but we’re not. 

He never compliments me and while I understand that some people aren’t like that, it was starting to make me think that he doesn’t find me attractive. So I straight up asked him and the response I got was “I don’t feel as much as I should do but I enjoy being around you”. He then went on to say “I mean attraction is different, I’m not sure if we’d be together but I’d still hang. I’m still on the fence.” 

Now from day one I’ve been clear that I want a relationship, he said that he wants to casually date with a view to finding something long term. So I gave it a chance. I hinted to him last week that I wanted to take that next step and he said he feels a bit pressured and wants to get to know me more. But now this… does he only see me in a friendship/sexual way? 

I really do like him, but I know my worth and I know that if he won’t see me like that another man will. I’m struggling to know whether to walk away or give it more time.

had 3 dates with this girl i met from bumble. she put she was looking for ""not sure yet"" whereas i put relationship. she seemed down to earth and i thought she genuinely liked me. first date was fun and ended in sex a few times and i slept over. 2nd date was really just me going to her place the following night and having sex and sleeping over. then a week later, i made her a nice dinner and we had sex at least 10 times followed by her sleeping over. we were cuddling practically all the time we slept together....

i dropped her off at her house and she texted me later thanking me for the nice time and i responded but the convo that night stopped there.

but then when i texted her two days later, she didnt respond. my text was just asking her how her day was going. now i havent heard from her since, its been like 5 days. im wondering if the sex was so terrible she ghosted me. it feels weird that she didnt respond because we had sex so many times and we were hardcore cuddling like we liked eachother ~~ i didnt think that type of cuddling was normal for someone just wanting a fwb or hook up. idk if maybe she just lost interest. we didnt have set plans to hangout again. 

what should i do? i want to keep seeing her but im confused by her not responding to me, especially in light of what i thought were some really fun nights (sex mainly). 

she did say at one point that she told her friends ""im going thru my hoe phase"" but she seemed to walk it back as if she didnt mean it. also she initiated sex on the first date, i wasnt expecting it. so many she was just interested in sex.....

"So pretty much there was this girl in my class last year. We got to talking and I eventually asked her out in December and we had a good time. Afterwards she text me to tell me she had fun and wanted to do it again soon. We tried to work out a second date but our schedules didn’t match up and we were both out of town whenever the other was available, so a distance sort of just grew between us. I’m also someone who’s very anxious about relationships so I got in my head and told myself that she couldn’t possibly want to be with me so I kind of spiraled until I distanced myself too far from her. A lot of our mutual friends mentioned that she talked about our date with them and said it was really fun, but at this point I talked myself out of all my confidence so I pretty much just stopped talking to her. This all occurred in mid-December until the end of January. A couple months later she had a boyfriend so I kept my distance as I wanted to be respectful of their relationship, but I couldn’t help this feeling that we could have had something good. I pretty much didn’t talk to her from March till the 4th of July, where I was at a baseball game and got a text from her saying she was at the same game and we ended up meeting up and talking for a few hours. I was reminded of how funny and great she was so this made me want to ask her out again, but I was working crazy hours, 7 days a week and then moving an hour away (which at the time felt like a far distance but now it doesn’t feel as far). So now it’s December and I’m back in town and I want to ask her out, even if not to go on to start dating, but just to put myself out there and tell her how I feel so I can try to move on if she doesn’t reciprocate these feelings.

I answered him, ""No, why would I ? my parents raised a lady.""  then he unmatched me. because truly I am probably one of the classiest, reserved  and hard to get women out there.  I am not easy. No amount of money or fame will ever buy me. MANY people have tried but I've always stood strong.

Hey everyone, sorry about the long read. I am seeing a girl now for two months and it has always been really tricky situation since the beginning. We met while she was in a bad relationship but she broke up after 3 dates and we have been seeing each other really often since then. She was pretty clear she didnt want any commitment early on but later changed to that she does want me as a boyfriend in a month or so after she has processed her breakup a little more. Lately tho, we had been having some troubles as she had some issues setting up boundaries with her ex and also some things she did that crossed my boundaries as well (nothing major but still borderline). So I decide its better to take a break and heal rather than being in this situation and lets start it again in some time but I couldn’t really help myself and texted her to meet in two days. When we met, she had the wallpaper of her and her ex bf (I consider this strike 2) although she explained it didnt mean anything and she was upset about everything. She said she was going through her gallery and just thought of having a good memory as the background but I do think coming into my house like that is a bit weird. Also something to note here is that I saw the glimpse of it before she changed it and I spoke about it. I wanna know if its worth continuing with this woman or not since i like her but also need rational advice

"Hello everyone. I 22f have been dating my bf 23m for a year now and we’ve liked each other since the beginning. It was a rough start at first but our feelings grew towards each other within a month or two and started dating after 3-4 months of knowing each other.

Throughout that time, there was something I felt that was missing and I couldn’t figure it out, which is why I decided to stay with him longer because I still love him and I’m not gonna leave him because of something that I didn’t know, so I disregarded my feelings because I thought I was being too harsh on him, so I just let it go.

 I didn’t realize until today when my bf came over to my house and talked with my mom for the first time. The whole night went pretty well, better that I expected. We ate the food my mom made and hung outside my backyard. After that, my mom had a talk with me and told me that “he’s very nice but he doesn’t seem very enthusiastic, he’s kinda boring and I can tell you’re not completely yourself when you’re with him, and I feel that you’re someone who would like a partner who’s more adventurous, like let’s do this let’s do that, and getting excited over it” I didn’t notice this and to be honest, she was kind of right. Because my bf is a more laid back person overall, very calm and gets mildly excited over a lot of things, I realized why I felt like this relationship is boring, not because I have toxic traits and like relationships that are a thrilling and constantly fighting because I hate arguing, and I’ve grown past the need for alI that.

 I noticed that this quality from him are also tied to my other underlying problems with him that I just couldn’t figure out, like sometimes I felt like because he’s less enthusiastic, the relationship feels one sided because it seems like I’m the only one expressing my excitement when we’re spending time together, and those feelings from him aren’t being reciprocated. I communicated this to him shortly after the talk with my mom, and he actually agreed with me, and that he’s aware that he doesn’t get too hyped over many things, but is still happy and content on the matter. This is a flaw in him that I can definitely deal with, as it’s not a problem for me because I accept how he is as a person, and I would’ve broken up with him if it was that bad. I just know it’ll get boring at times if we continue to date, and I know can’t be the only one to express enthusiasm and fun for the both of us, because that’ll be draining eventually, I feel like I need him to be at the same level as me somewhat when it comes to that.

"I (25F) was causally seeing a guy (28M) over the summer. We went out for dinner a few times and hangout at his apartment. He treated me well. We had really amazing chemistry, I can’t explain it. I very rarely feel as drawn to men as I was to him. 

We never slept together but I knew he wanted to. I never felt like the timing was right/I just didn’t feel ready. I moved away back to grad school in the Fall and our communication just kind of stopped (we were never big on texting back and forth to begin with except to ask how day was briefly etc and make plans). Neither of us really initiated talking after I moved, if we did speak a bit, it was all friendly. We’re both *very* career motivated people and I’m in an intense program and he’s in an intense job. But I still think about him here and there. 

I’m home for the holidays and am interested in seeing him again.

I can’t even think about my own life without them popping into my mind. When I got a little bit more confident I was able to easily express me liking somebody. I would flirt, give super obvious hints, but I never really said it until I knew they liked me too. Then dating began, every boyfriend I had was a decent guy.

"Howdy y’all, this one will be lengthy 

Completely crazy circumstance here to say the least. A month ago I lost my leg in a motorcycle accident. I spent 3 days in the ICU and was blessed to spend each day with a gorgeous nurse (every man’s dream). Over those days we spend considerable time talking, deep stuff not just surface level. She became somewhat touchy at times and went out of her way for stuff. I got the feeling on my last day and risked it all when she transferred me to general. I asked for her number and asked if she would like to go out to dinner to which she agreed. 

For context she is 28 I’m 22, this is a considerable gap but I do have the emotional maturity of someone that age. This never seemed to be an issue and she was clearly interested. She offered to visit on days she was working once I was out of the ICU. During my stay she followed through on that promise and visited multiple times for hours (after 12hr shifts) We texted in between daily but she is a terrible responder. There were times where I wouldn’t hear from her for 2 days. Nonetheless she never backed out on her word, was attentive and receptive any time we visited.

Fast forward to now, we spoke daily and exchanged playful texts. Kept tabs on each others lives once I was out of the hospital and everything seemed great. I popped in one day after my PT to see her and we chatted for a bit, she was stressed about me being there due to our exchange not being allowed generally speaking but acted the same as always and assured she wanted to see me. I said let’s hang out in person next time then, she agreed we said bye hugged then went about our days. She texted me saying it was nice seeing me, I responded then later asked if she would like to hang the following week. I got no response for a week, and she eventually reached out checking in (not mentioning my last text). We send a few messages then I haven’t heard from her for a few days now. 

To sum it up, everything was going great and I was very excited. To think something like that could come out of such a terrible situation blew my mind. She gave me hope and boosted my confidence, it felt good overall. Now I’m wondering what happened, did I share too much? Did I overstep and she lost interest? I tend to read into things too deep, we don’t owe eachother anything and I’m not in the physical state to pursue anything rn. I just find this very odd and would like some outside opinions. I’m debating where I should take this, I’m not super attached anymore. If anything I’ve learned from it, but knowing her I could easily leave it for now and reach out when I’m ready to take her out.

"So I (34M) usually talk with coworker (25F) at work. For like 4 months since she got there (August). We work in separate departments but they operate next to each other. The first 2.5 months or so, she was just a coworker I said hi to or had a quick casual chat, usually work stuff. It's usually me going up to her desk.

Anyway, mid October, things got me wondering. Her department had a social event, and she asked if mine was included. I said probably not, and she looked visibly bummed out. This made me wonder maybe she likes me or something. Up to this point I wasn't into her but I thought she was cute.

So from then on, I started to talk to her more at her desk, about other stuff besides work. I offer to get her and her female coworker food (they pay for theirs, I do food runs with my department coworkers daily, so I wanted to include them since they can't go get food). She seems to always appreciate when I ask her if she wants food.

So when I first started talking to her, I would talk to her face to face with her desk between us. As time went on, I would go behind her desk to where we're talking standing next to each other.  So for most of our conversations, I'm in her personal space but I never see any form of rejection or discomfort. I'm usually there 30-45 minutes at a time during the shift. Sometimes I do feel like I overstay my welcome, so I go back to my station. Most of the time her coworker is there, so I talk to both of them.

We're friendly, but it's all just been relegated to work. There's never been an insinuation of hanging out outside of work.

It wasn't til November until I realized that I like her. I keep looking for signs but I'm not sure if there's any.

Last week, same thing as always. I talked with her at her desk. I tried to make more eye contact but that day it seemed like she was avoiding to unless it was unavoidable at times. We mostly talked about holiday stuff. I felt I was being overbearing so I talked to her less that day. I came back to asked if they wanted any food and were going through options, then we settled on pizza and I said we can share one since I wasn't going to eat all of it. I came back with the pizza and she asked how much was their part and I said don't worry about it. Felt like a wow moment for her when I said no charge lol.

I went to eat after this so I didn't talk for the rest of the shift.

Before I get to the next thing, let me preface by saying we have never texted or called each other. She has my number because she put it into her bank app so she could pay me for food weeks earlier. She never gave me hers though.

So I'm at my station and I get a text from a number from my contacts. I knew it was her because I reversed searched the number. She texted me a meme and I replied about it and she replied back. After this, it got me thinking that she's starting to get interested and wants me to have her number. She didn't have it in her contacts, so she had to go back into her bank app to get it. I went back to talk to her at her desk for the rest of the shift. She and her coworker were looking at memes related to what she texted me.

After that night, she didn't text me again nor did I.

A day or two after that, I was talking with her and her coworker and the topic of me having a sister came up. She started asking me how old she was and then I said she was 27 and she was 7 years younger than me. Then she was kinda smiling and starting to count on her fingers while her coworker was smiling looking at her. She was like I keep forgetting your 34. This brief moment made me think if she is pondering about being interested.

Now finally to this past Sunday. It was our company holiday party. Some of us were still on shift but could attend since it was at work. She and her coworker went ahead and then me and my male coworker followed like 10 minutes later.

While we were getting food, I saw her and asked where they were gonna sit and to save us seats. She texted me a couple moments later to tell me where they were. We get to the table and I sit next to her. I spend the party mostly talking with her and her with me more than with our coworkers. Seems like it is a good time. She tells me that there's an after party by another department and is wondering if she should go. I thought maybe I might get asked to go.

People start dancing and she asks if I'm gonna go out there and dance. I shrug my shoulders like I dunno (I'm very self conscious and don't dance). She asks my coworker the same thing and he says maybe. She says she's gonna get a drink and then go dance. At this point I panic and feel I'll like like a no fun guy so I wait til she comes back to ask her if she wants to go dance. She ponders for a bit and then asks her coworker and then we ALL end up going to the dance floor. While on the dance floor, she's just dancing in front of me with her coworker by her side and my coworker next to me. It was weird because for about 5 minutes, she would not make eye contact with me at all. She was either looking down, away, or at her coworker. I saw her smile with her coworker a few times as if it was about something. The song changed so we go back to the table.

At the table, everything resumed like before with us talking again. She asked if I was gonna go to the photo booth and I said yeah. A bit later, another coworker of mine came over to get us all to go to the photo booth. Not sure if she wanted to go in that moment. So we all go and get a picture.

We go back to the table and we talk again. This time the music is super loud, so throughout this we're getting close in each other's ear to hear each other. She doesn't seem to be talking like this with her coworker.

A bit later she says there's no longer a huge line at the photo booth and that you can take a picture again since it's empty. I just say yeah. I wonder if she wanted to go take a picture again, but just with me this time.

Now later the four of us our leaving and my other coworker comes back to ask us to all dance before we leave. So we all go back into the dance floor. Again, she's kinda avoiding eye contact with me expect for a brief moment to tell me I'm not doing the dance right. My 1st coworker suddenly leaves and they look at each other like hmm shrugging their shoulders. Then me and her go into another dance which is a line dance everyone. Oh my god I never done anything like this lol. Then we finish up and I'm talking on the side with her. My coworker comes back and she goes over to talk with him, dunno what about. Then I can see she asks him if he wants to go on the dance floor to dance and she calls over her coworker.  So all three of them go to dance. For this, I must admit I did get a little jealous left out.

Then we all leave and go out to finish off the rest of the shift. Now it was just like a normal day. I go back to talk to her at her desk but there's not much talking. Maybe they're tired. She then says she got a text from her friend to go to the after party but she's not sure. She asks her coworker if she wants to go. I'm there but I don't get asked lol. So then the shift is over and I go home.

Seriously I dunno if she's into me or not. If I have to make the move, and we're just both nervous to ask or if she thinks maybe I'm just a friendly coworker. Maybe it seems I give mixed signals.

Anyway I'm going on vacation soon for 2 weeks in 2 days so I can't ask her out anywhere soon since I'm working. I told her I was going on vacation and she was like oh cool. I don't think she knows how soon I leave because Thursday is my last day working and if she works that day, that will be my last day seeing her, so we'll see how she reacts. Should I just ask her out on my last day before my vacation, or just wait til I come back so there's no pressure on her end?

Typing this just gave me anxiety. Hopefully they're not on Reddit. But if they see this, text me lol.

"I [23f] fell in love for the first time with [27m]

I’m a 23 year old woman who fell in love for the first time, and I don’t know about anyone else, but I’ve always been around people who had their first live at like 15-16, definitely before high school ended.

The point is being 23 in live for the first time is really terrifying and makes a person feel completely inept and helpless at times. It doesn’t help that the person I fell in love with has been in love before and had a long term relationship, so he has a better understanding even if it’s just of himself and how he acts with someone he loves. Thus, I have a dilemma if anyone can help.


So I’ve been seeing this guy for almost two years, met in March 2022 we started out very fwb, it escalated into something confusing and warped and there ended up being a break of no contact for about 6 months starting in Aug 22. Since we started seeing each other again, early March maybe late February of 2023 it’s amped up and doesn’t feel so casual. I’ve met his parents, been with him to the hospital, he’s let me move in with him when I had a past apartment issue, etc.

We’re exclusive, and I’m polyamorous, but there’s been no agreement made about any arrangements, so I’m not seeing anyone else. We also are artists and work together in a way. I recently started having realizations that I’m ready to move in to the next stage of my life soon, like have kids and get married. He’s said repeatedly for many reasons we wouldn’t be in a relationship but has been dwindling on that bit by saying things here and there, and asking certain questions, showing more interest in my relationship with my family, how many kids he wants and what he would need in a relationship, etc. 

After Thanksgiving I thought I was going to have to move back in with my parents for a bit for a whole other set of apartment issues, so I mentioned it to him. He gets flustered, immediately tells me it’s a manic episode and gets upset with me, saying I don’t believe in myself and I have specific responsibilities. I understand what he’s saying, but my plan was to head to my parents house to figure everything out from there because my apartment complex is just not a place to be and I need somewhere to think and have my own space. Granted being at my parent’s place for a week an a half with a break in the middle to see him has definitely shown me exactly why I can’t feasibly and emotionally safely stay there, and I’m pushing it with two weeks. My housing is a whole separate issue which would be less of a problem if I didn’t have two cats with me that had to be allowed in the housing as well. (When I stayed with him before, I was able to afford a cat sitter, I unfortunately can’t do that right now)

I just recently sent a fed-up-with-the-lies-I-tell-myself text that said:  let him know I’m new to love and figuring things out with someone else and I love him, I also mentioned that I know he’s said he isn’t looking for a girlfriend in the past, and I wasn’t asking him for anything, I just needed to let him know cuz I couldn’t be one of the people on my deathbed with that regret. And what made me send it was the fact that I thought he might be unalive earlier today. I couldn’t take it.
 And now I’ve confessed and he said, “welcome to the big leagues, just try.” (he’d also been saying for a while that he knew I was in love with him, but he never said anything about reciprocal feelings, so I’ve always felt a little self conscious about that.) 

Now I literally don’t know what to do, what I’m supposed to say, where do we go from here??? I know nothing.

I’ve been in an abusive relationship in the past and it’s put these rust tinted glasses in front of things sometimes, and I never loved that person. I’m still learning to recognize certain behaviors are from feelings of the past, but the more immediately detrimental thought patterns are addressed daily and were also at a point where we understand each other more, our modes of communication, our traumas and how they all influence how we interact with each other. It’s just a lot.

"Hello, I'm a 31 year old male and it's been a few years since I have been in a relationship with a woman. I used to date lot in my mid twenties but got tired of the short term dating game and never found someone that I connected with emotionally. I took a break and was celibate for a few years until I lost someone close to me who I would spend every day with, and since then I've had an empty hole in my heart that I still feel even two years after they passed. I did some soul searching, looked into my own identity, even dated multiple men but in the end I came to the conclusion that I really am just a man who wants to be with a woman. (I'm also attracted to trans women, I just don't feel any sexual attraction to masculinity). 

I just worry that it has been so long (at least five years since I've slept with a woman) and since I've gotten older more will be expected of me. I dropped out of college in my twenties when I didn't want to commit to the field I had been studying and I'm still unsure where my life is going to lead me. I feel like I'm still an immature 25 year old but I'm 31. I own a house and I do work that pays pretty well, but I'm just not happy where I'm at in life. I also travel throughout the US for work and am currently working a night shift 12 hours throughout the week and then off Fri to Sun. I've been at this work for about seven years and though it works for me it has definitely made socializing a lot harder.

When I was very young I was in a long distance relationship and I was pretty happy with it. To be completely frank I'm not an overtly sexual person (I enjoy it but I'm not driven to do it very often) so I also worry about not providing enough in that regard. I have been described as demisexual, I generally don't feel any drive if i don't love the person and many of my partners I only slept with because I felt pressured that they would be unhappy if I didn't want to sleep together. I'm moreso looking for a life partner, someone who I connect with who wants to spend the day watching shows or having fun. As I get older it seems harder to find something like that. I have friends who are in long term relationships with women outside of the US and they all have different stories for how they met. What seems like a good start? I also don't want to seem forward, I'd ideally make friends first then leave the door open for more.",31M - How to meet women online as a night shift worker,18mmuij,1703049747.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mmuij/31m_how_to_meet_women_online_as_a_night_shift/,

He says he is busy due to work, he works from 8 to 5pm. a lot of time he expresses how tired he is and how difficult it is for him to manage living alone now. On his free Day we never see each other, he says he does other hosehold chores that day. He also never expresses how he feels about me.

"I met a girl on Bumble about a month ago, and we’ve been talking consistently since then. We don’t live in the same town, but I just went and visited her for a few days and we had a great time together. 

When we first started talking she was very open with a history of abuse in her family and how it affects her ability to be intimate. I sort of felt like she was oversharing, but admired her willingness to be open about this and other things, and it didn’t change how I felt about her.

She also told me about several of her exes, one of whom she said had ceased to be intimate with her long before they broke up. (This was during a conversation about exes so I didn’t feel it strange for her to bring him up)

About a week into talking she said a coworker of hers was moving in with her. Now, 3 weeks later and after I visited her in person, she says that her coworker/roommate that she has mentioned many times is actually the ex that stopped being intimate with her.

She says he originally moved to her town to try to get back with her, but it didn’t work out. Now she says she doesn’t have the heart to kick him out of her house, and that she couldn’t afford house payments without him. 

With her having been so open about her issues, it feels especially strange to me that she wouldn’t be honest about this from the get-go.

If they had been living together before we started talking and she told me that, I know I wouldn’t have proceeded with talking further. Now that we’ve talked, I know I really like her but I just can’t help but feel uncomfortable with her and her ex being financially codependent like this.

"Crush on my gym teacher 27 and 40 ( maybe)

Hi everyone! I've recently been going to a gym class at Equinox and my teacher is probably the most handsome, cute nerdy, ambition guy. He seems to love his job and training. Just overall that typical passionate gym guy. So, we have noticed each other and I caught him staring at me. He didn't look away 🥰. Then I went to his class, and he was like ""im going to adjust people but let me know if you don't want me to touch you."" Ofc I'm thinking in my head, is he going to adjust me... and he does!  Butterflies! The next class, when I was leaving. I just wanted to say bye and thank you, and he stop me for this conversation about the class and if I wanted to added anything to the class.. that he send me around..etc! I was so happy to just talk to him face to face. The convo was in passing and there was another class coming in. So it wasn't long but good enough! I feel so giggly like a high schooler!  it made me so happy lol 

By the way! He is definitely older than me, I'm not sure how old. I am 27.. maybe he is 40/ 45...

So now, the big plan is! How do I go about this? Apart of me just wants to go straight for it and ask him in a date. I would be fine if he reject it lol but apart of me doesn't want to be secretly crushing in a gym teacher.. rather just go for it.. however! I could just continue going to the class and hope something comes of it but apart of me feels it was stay at a professional relationship. Also it's awkward trying to talk in front of the other people. I felt we both wanted to talk more but the timing wasnt great.

"So I (30 M) had a first date this girl (23 F) more than a week ago, where we clicked immediately and ended up at my place until the next evening. She ended up saying it was the best night of her life and that she wants to see me again. We then sent texts back and forth almost every hour or two and made plans for this previous Saturday.
She introduced me to her friends, showed me around her favorite bars and a club and we ended up soending the night together again until the next evening. We even ended up cuddling and she confessed that she started to have feelings for me and that she‘s not sure whether she likes to have feelings at the moment. She also said that she‘s scared of getting hurt. And after that, she started becoming a bit distant over text, which I thought was probably a normal reaction after those two intense dates. We still agreed seeing each other this Thursday and that she would spend the night at my place.
Anyway I thought I‘d show her that she doesn‘t need to be scared to get hurt and got her a small present I was gonna surprise her with. I wanted to be spontaneous and bring her the gift yesterday, so she wouldn‘t be insecure about feelings on our next date (I know, I know). Anyway when I texted that I was bringing her something she said she already had plans with her family and that it‘s too soon for me to meet her (which I agree upon). Realizing what kinda idiocy I got myself into I apologized immediately. This was yesterday and I still haven‘t heard from her yet.

"I've recently started a relationship couple months ago with this girl and wanted to hear about any thoughts/advice, with regards to some things she does that stand out to me.  
  
It's my first relationship and I've enjoyed hanging out with her thus far. We met each other at a party, and developed good chemistry after seeing how much we had in common. Her personality is rather playful/touchy, since she's always laughing, hugging and kissing me very often, but there are a few things about her in particular that stand out to me: for instance she enjoys punching my chest, poking, headbutting and biting my finger playfully; she laughs hysterically after doing those things every time. Whenever I ask her whether she enjoys hurting me, she jokingly says yes. Every time I tell her the punching hurts, she doesn't believe me, but she does always ask for permission to punch me however. I'm fine with her doing these things, because even though they sometimes hurt, it seems to me that she's naturally bubbly, playful and enjoys physical intimacy, along with the fact that we'd always initiate a tickle fight and/or kissing afterwards. She also asks me to lift her up then carry her around the room, and teases me when I can't do that for at least 1 minute.  
  
I'm not quite sure about the meaning behind her doing these things, has anyone else hear/experienced of something similar?

"I met someone earlier this fall. Great guy, possibly my dream man. This guy has all the qualities I look for in someone. I’m super attracted to him inside and out and I feel like he’s felt the same towards me. He’ll call me a few times a day, text throughout the day with super engaging &amp; meaningful convo, etc. Whenever we got some face time, it always felt like we’ve known eachother forever. Just so comfortable. 

However, this last week he just pulled away?  In short, we had plans last tuesday that got kinda shaky. He suddenly said “never mind it’s not gonna work today” and since that moment he has been so totally different. Since then, I’ve gotten two phone calls both at the very end of the day and minimal communication from him the rest of the day. I decided Sunday that maybe it wasn’t going to work out so I talked to him about it and he said that he’s sorry, but he wasn’t ready to give me his all. I never expected a serious commitment right away, and I never put any pressure on him to do so. I genuinely just have enjoyed getting to know him and we agreed to take things slowly. THEN we discussed being intimate just one more time for funsies and calling it good. I’m cool with that. I have needs, he met them for me and I’m sure I’m going to be going through a drought for a while so might as well. 

While we were discussing these plans last night (which btw we were supposed to do the deed earlier today), he suddenly said nvm. His reasoning was that I was supposedly blowing up his phone? I definitely was NOT. All the messages I was sending him were in response to messages he was sending me. And also said he doesn’t want to hurt me. In his defense, he has been busting his ass the past few weeks and I think he maybe just felt overwhelmed? I’m not sure. 

I am super sensitive and I truly hate when people switch up on me for no good reason and with little to no explanation. If I’m being honest with myself, I really wished I had just been a bit more patient with him and given him some time to come around when he had initially pulled away. That sounds desperate, but I really really do like him a lot and I hardly get that drawn to someone.

"I (F34) was dating a guy (M34) and ended things with him because I felt our communication styles didn’t match. He kept saying my poor communication and slow response time (max 3-4 hrs) was an issue. When he first brought this up, I started initiating texts but then noticed that despite me initiating, our texts would die quickly, he’d stop engaging and send dry replies instead of asking questions which is what I’m used to with guys I date.

The biggest concern for me was after the fourth date, he told me that he wanted us to have open communication, focus on each other and that he wouldn’t talk to anyone else but shortly after that, I saw him active and chatting to matches on a dating app… 

I asked him about it and he admitted that he logged on to the apps because he was fed up with my poor communication and that the other girls were insurance policy in case we didn’t work out. 

I told him he could have communicated this to me and he told me that I couldn’t hold him fully accountable for his behavior since I also logged on to the apps. I was never on the apps to begin with and only created the app because I had a hunch something else was going on. (Ex: I wouldn’t hear from him for several days and would have to initiate convo and have the convo die)

I asked him why he kept letting convos die and he said he did it to give me a taste of my own medicine. He said he loses motivation to continue the conversation we are having when I take 3 hrs to reply. I’m super busy with work and already told him back then that my response time has nothing to do with my interest in him. Never had problem like this before with other guys.

I’m talking to this guy on social media. We used to go to school together in middle school and I had a crush on him back then but he moved away. I connected with him again on Facebook in October, just as I was curious how he was doing. We got pretty close pretty fast and we made plans to meet. It’s been two months and we haven’t met, it’s my fault because I’m not really comfortable meeting. I actually tried to end things with him already because I told him I didn’t think I would be able to really be what he was looking for and I’d waste his time and he said he didn’t care. 

So we’ve been talking since then and he’s been very confusing since then. He tells me that he’s very interested in me, and he wants to meet. But at the same time, sometimes he will be very active and engaged with me and other times he won’t. The thing is that if I do this it bothers him but he does it to me. I know that he’s probably hesitant because we haven’t met, but initially I didn’t even connect with him because I was interested in him in that way. And I’ve told him that I wasn’t ready for that right now and he said that was okay. I approached him as an acquaintance and I really do like him, but I also value him as a friend.

At this point, he goes back and forth so much that I want to tell him we can just stop talking. I’m confused. Everytime I think to leave him alone he messages me again with a believable excuse and I accept it. 
At the same time he also does this to me (takes forever to respond) when he asks me to take and send inappropriate photos for him. But when he asks and I brush it off, I will also get a bit distant. And he will tell me that the photos don’t matter to him, that he will drop it. Then he goes silent. It’s like he gets mad and does this. What should I think?

"So, I am 27 years old and I’m coming to terms with the fact that the last few years of dating, I’ve realized that I have taken this process too serious. I developed an anxious attachment style and would constantly overthink. But after many failed attempts at dating and meeting new people, I think im realizing that people come and go and im moving from being anxious to being secure. So here’s a few things I’ve learned.
1. Stay in the moment. Stop planning your future with this person when they haven’t even been in your life that long. 
2. Be yourself. Do not be like anyone else. 
3. Do not over analyze and overly critique every encounter. 
4. Sometimes people do like you just as much as you like them, you just don’t give them a chance to show it. 
5. Slow and steady wins the race.
6. Communicate how you’re feeling. Even if the response is not what you want. It will save you trouble later.
7. If you think this person likes you, it’s probably not all in your head.

8.  Find things to do in your free time to get your mind off of them. It’s unhealthy to sit and think about someone 24/7.
9.  If number 8 is hard, refer to number 4.
10. Love yourself enough to be okay with walking away from things that don’t serve you.
11. My last one is, if they leave. It’s okay to be sad, upset, frustrated etc. Feel those feelings but get up and try again.

but I never really liked her. I just found her cute and always got out of the seat to move after the next time I would sit in that class if she sat next to me. I did not want to talk to her because 1. I got severe social anxiety and social issues. She just seemed hella unconfident in the gym when she would walk next to me and have her head down like really nervous. The best way to describe it was that. she hella feminine and I guess geeky. I heard her liking Jojo, 'I love Jojo bizarre adventure' another reasonm i found her cute.  
  
fast forward to junior year. I moved to a different table in English class and. After like 10 minutes maybe 20 she started rubbing my leg with her feet. I did not react cuz as I stated before I'm socially awkward asf. Either that same day in that class or the next day I can't remember it was last month. She used both her feet and went up and down from like my knee to calf length a couple of times. I did not react other than like a little smile but idk if she looked. couple secs after both instances i looked up she was smiling one time but i think she was looking at the electronic board or listening to teacher.Other time just kinda how i look staring at her work or phone etc.  
  
During all this time I just stared directly down onto either my phone Chromebook or sketchbook while this happened. After that that much no type of flirty behavior unless idk social cues. She did sudden foot taps every day for a week putting her foot on my foot for like a 1 minute for a week again. After that nothing just I'm pretty sure accidental leg kicks when she was adjusting how she sat in her seat.But im almost certain i took too long to talk to her .I did some flirty stuff back put my foot on her foot but that pretty much it.I put my foot in like her section of the table i gues where to stands are and yeah just have my legs extended in her space but she aint do nothing other then a single foot tap.

"My girlfriend (now ex), had been one of my good friends since kindergarten. I thought of her sort of as a sibling, considering how long we'd known eachother. Starting in 8th grade, she confessed to me for the first time. I politely turned her down and explained how I dont feel ready for any relationships at my age, and how I want to be friends. She said she respected my choice. But after this, a couple months apart she would keep confessing again and again thinking my answer would be different. This continued about 4 times, and it was getting pretty annoying. 

Whenever I turned her down she would make me feel guilty in some sort of way. She would either ghost me, or drown me in insults and teasing (to cope with the rejection i guess??). Our friendship was on and off all the time and really confusing and toxic. The fifth time she asked (halfway through 9th gr), I accepted, thinking: ""I'll just give her a chance, how bad can it be?"" 

Accepting her might have been one of the worst decisions I'd ever made so far in life. 
When I agreed to be her girlfriend, I made it clear that she shouldn't expect much from me and it'll be almost the same as how our friendship normally was, and to take it slow. When she would come over I'd be REALLY uncomfortable. Almost everytime she came over she would try to initiate something sexual. Sometimes I would straight up say no, or just indicate I didn't want to with body language. After me declining she would still beg and plead until I gave in. She'd make me feel guilty for saying no sometimes. Here are some things I quote:
""Pleeeeaasee...i wont see you until next week so we have to do it now""

""Just get it over with""

""You think I'm fat don't you""

Sometimes she'd put her hand up my shirt without asking, and even one time tried to put her hand down my pants until I stopped her and asked what she was doing. I'd make up excuses to not see her, and she'd get mad at me. While I was with her she wouldn't put in any effort to talk about or respect my interests and passions. She only talked about stuff she liked and sarcastically told me to ""shut up🤪🤪🥰"" whenever I brought up one of interests. She wanted to see me any day possible, everyday if she could. After months of pretending I loved her back, I broke up with her because I couldn't take the discomfort anymore. And she said I was a selfish piece of shit, and she had no reason to live if I left her.

What makes a guy go up to a girl and ask for her number, compliment them, or buy them something on the spot like a drink?

Versus a guy who thinks a girl is attractive and wants to be with them but tells them later, for example them saying “I liked you from when I first saw you.”

What makes a guy go out of his way to “woo” a girl publicly versus letting a girl know later that he was always interested in them?

Is it because of society beauty standards or one girl is easier to get or you respect one more rather than the other?

"I (21F) have a friend (25F) who I'm quite into, although we live in different countries. I asked her out a few months ago, and while she decided against it because an LDR wouldn't work too well given our circumstances, she said she'd be willing to try if/when we're both in the same country (we're both moving to continental Europe in the next 2 years, so it was a reasonable prospect). However, it wasn't always very clear how she felt about me, and she's said she wasn't sure what she wants in a relationship and she wasn't sure things between us would work because of possible compatibility issues.

Today I brought up why she wanted to date me at all then, and she acknowledged most of the reason she was willing to try was because I wanted to date her so much, but not only she isn't sure it'd work out, she isn't even sure she feels anything romantically towards me (even if she appreciates me a lot as a close friend, which is true; she is very nice).

¿Should I even bother pursuing a relationship under those circumstances? I really do like her a lot, but... Her seemingly not feeling much romantically feels crushing. If she was going to feel anything at all, I figure she already would after more than a year of talking to each other daily. On the other hand, I think she could be a really good partner...

"Last night, I (22M) went out drinking with my friends. My friend (let’s call her Claire) introduced her friend (let’s call her Maria) to the group, and after a while her roommates joined us. One of the roommates, (let’s called her Anna) caught my eye. Gorgeous girl and I immediately wanted to talk to her, and I kinda did with my friend. The night went on and she kinda disappeared for a little bit, but then we all met up again when we left the first venue to go to a second. Danced with Anna for a little bit, was a liiiiittile bit touchy with her but it didn’t go too far. 

The night ends and we go to get post clubbing drunk food. Don’t really talk to Anna but she’s nearby. I’m mainly with Claire and Maria waiting for their food and because I’m drunk, I’m just talking with everyone around the place lol. Maria invites myself and Claire to stay the night at hers and Anna’s place, which no one protests to. The four of us head in the direction of their house, and Claire and Maria keep stopping because they’re drunk and trying to eat their food. I’m walking ahead, and Anna comes up to me and offers me her food. It’s about a 30 minute walk back to the house, and Anna and I make that walk just talking about everything under the sun, laugh together, and we don’t really look back whether Claire and Maria were there. 

We get to the house and Anna walks to the kitchen and I follow suit. She eats the rest of the food she brought and takes out a baguette and some cheese. We’re still talking and laughing loads, and she tells me to have some of the food. The conversation snowballs into the food we like and we start talking about a mutual love for herbal tea and she tells me about how she has this tea that she’s obsessed with and makes me a cup. (the tea was fantastic) At this point it’s like 3 in the morning, and she remembers she has class in the morning so she goes up to bed and gives me a blanket to sleep on the couch. I think if she didn’t have class we would’ve spent much longer talking, and I would’ve really enjoyed that. 

This morning there was a very rushed and brief interaction of her just saying hi and then leaving immediately to go to class. Didn’t get her instagram from her but I got it from Claire. 

Am I an idiot for not making a move? Or was she just being nice? Claire said she’s very hard to read romantically and all that stuff, which is fair but damn I’m hoping I was right and she seems to have liked me- and I’m just an idiot for not trying to kiss her or anything.",Am I an idiot?,18mjzfm,1703040682.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mjzfm/am_i_an_idiot/,

"As someone who has never been in a relationship and is in their early twenties, I still feel confused on how to tell if feelings for someone are romantic or just strong platonic. 

To sum things up, a long time friend and I “dated” for a short period of time (literally like a week and a half) before he broke things off with me. We remained friends and after a few months and him making flirty comments towards me, he eventually fessed up that he broke things off early bc he was scared of not meeting expectations he thought/felt I had.

But since then, I’ve been feeling like there’s still something between us??? But I keep second guessing myself and thinking that there’s nothing really there and I’m just being delusional and desperate because I just want to be in a relationship. And I recently talked to another friend who brought up that it seems that he and I are constantly testing the boundary with each other but neither one of us is committing to it or our feelings and raised a good point that I seem unsure about my feelings for him and I can’t progress past this point until I figure out where my feelings on him lie.

Again as someone who’s never had any sort of romantic experience, I feel like my reading on romantic feelings is muddled. I’ve started to question whether I’m actually in love with him or just in love with the attention he gives me or even just the idea that someone would like me romantically.

"I (32f) have just started seeing a wonderful man (36m). I don’t have a ton of experience with dating. My kids dad and I were together 4 years, and when he left I jumped into a toxic relationship for 5 years. After that guy I was alone and celibate for three years. Then I stupidly got myself into a “situationship” for a year that ended in August. I was heartbroken after said situation, so I (very cautiously) opened myself up to the world of Tinder. I’ve been on a few dates, met a few people, but didn’t really spark with anyone. 

Until I met this guy. It’s been three weeks now, and we’ve had three dates. And he’s so sweet! Like a total gentleman, super calm and gentle with me, good conversation, and major sexual chemistry. He’s wonderful. 

But I can feel myself putting a wall up (which is new for me, usually I wear my heart on my sleeve), and almost forcing myself not to like him too fast. And I feel like that’s not really fair to him, because that’s not my normal love style. What do I do? Should I let him know? Should I continue to just move slow? I’m worried about telling him how I feel about him (I don’t think I’m in love yet but I am REALLY digging him) and setting myself up for hurt or failure.

"So a week ago i went to a friends house to party and have some fun. I met a girl there which i liked and from her signs i knew she liked me too. After the party, my friend who was with his girlfriend decided to go sleep to his bedroom leaving me and this girl alone at the living room ( we were only 4 people there) .
Long story short, i made the first move we kissed , i started touching her everywhere and in the end i fingered her in a way i thought she liked it (she held my hand and was gasping). After a while she wanted more , i started again and after a while i asked her if i could have sex with her. She told me not to hurry and i respected that. We continued and at the end she gave me a handjob. After this whole scenario, she said she enjoyed the night a lot with me and i gained hope.

The next day , my friends girlfriend texted me and told me to ask the girl i met to go to a date together (she had spoken with her about me and she told me she wanted to meet me again)
I sent her a text after 2 days and told her to go to a date with me which she accepted. We went out ,i liked her a lot, she seemed very interested in me the way she talked, we laughed a lot and the date went very good. After a while we were at a park and we kissed for quite some time. Then she told me it was late and we should leave so i took her to her home and left . She told me to meet again that week and i knew the date went amazing. 

Then, all of a sudden she texts me the next day and tells me  that i was excellent with her, she liked the time we spent together, she liked my personality BUT she didnt want this to go any further because she wasnt feeling the sexual tension with me ( she wasnt sexually attracted with me ) and wanted us to just stay friends.
Now, i was pretty dissapointed with all this as i didnt expect this at all. Do you think i fumbled the bag?  i feel like the first night i spent with her was great but the second time i met her i should have been more agressive with her and touched her more while i was kissing her.

"* TRY TO DATE WOMEN FOR EMOTIONAL CONNECTION INSTEAD OF LOOKS. Even if you’re not that physically attracted to a woman, try to develop really good emotional connections with women you are less physically attracted to. After-all, YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT LOTS OF WOMEN TO GIVE YOU CHANCES, DON’T YOU?
* Likewise, don’t just try to date attractive women for their looks. Make sure you develop good emotional connections with these women before you try to date them.

5. LAST BUT NOT LEAST! CONFIDENCE! CONFIDENCE! CONFIDENCE! NO SELF DEPRECIATION.
* NEVER PUT YOURSELF DOWN.
* SINGLE = GREEN LIGHT. ASK OUT LOADS OF GIRLS SO THAT YOU ARE PREPARED IF YOUR MAIN CRUSH DOESN’T COME THROUGH IN THE END.
* MAKE SURE YOU ASK OUT GIRLS YOU GENUINELY LIKE! STILL GIVE ALL GIRLS A CHANCE. IF YOU’RE NOT THAT PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO A WOMAN, REALISTICALLY, THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION HAS TO BE EXTREMELY STRONG.
* Again there has to be good emotional connection with attractive women too, but the physical attraction probably does help, that’s why you should aspire to be physically attractive yourself. BE WHAT YOU WANNA ATTRACT. BUT DON’T DO THE SAME THINGS SHALLOW WOMEN MIGHT HAVE DONE TO YOU - REJECTING SOMEONE COS THEY AREN’T ATTRACTIVE TO YOU, but there MUST be a strong emotional connection to COMPENSATE for the lack of Physical attraction.
* YOU MUST TAKE YOUR TIME TO ASK THESE GIRLS OUT. NEVER ASK ANY WOMAN - ATTRACTIVE OR LESS ATTRACTIVE OUT OF PURE DESPERATION.

6. FINALE! NO PORN AND MASTURBATION MAY MAKE YOU SLIGHTLY LUCKIER. WORSE CASE SCENARIO, IF THINGS DON’T WORK OUT WITH YOUR CRUSH…YOU ARE GENUINELY MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE THAT IS JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN YOUR CRUSH.
SO PLEASE, THE NUMBER ONE THING IS NO PORN AND MASTURBATION!


TL:DR -
* If you don’t look at porn or masturbation you’re gonna hopefully have more luck.
* Delete and block Instagram, Facebook and TikTok and Twitter also Twitch.
* Stop stalking your crush on social media.
* Be hopeful, she doesn’t have a bf, she’s not having sex, HAVE HOPE!
* Turn to religion or KEEP YOUR HOPES UP.
* Seek out other women, BUT FOR NOBLE RELATIONSHIPS ONLY - DON’T ATTEMPT TO PARTAKE IN HOOKUP CULTURE.",Don’t look at porn or masturbate. You’ll be luckier.,18miqcf,1703036949.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18miqcf/dont_look_at_porn_or_masturbate_youll_be_luckier/,
"hi, backstory, we (both F) met back in the summer (late may to be specific) and hit it off pretty well after that. on the first date, she (22F) mentioned how she didn’t want anything serious since she had just gotten out of a long term relationship a week or 2 before (1st 🚩), but i (24F at the time) didn’t think much of it at the time since I never thought we’d make it past a few dates. However, as time went on and things started to progress, i was starting to fall for her &amp; we even agreed to be exclusive. we’d hang out almost everyday and even call/ft when we’d get back home after spending the day together. we’d go on cute dates…i even met a bunch of her friends &amp;  i  stayed over hers (back at school) for the july 4th week. everything just felt right. i was honestly on cloud 9. 

A month or two as things started to get more serious, we brought up moving past being exclusive and into a relationship. she promised me we’d get there but she needed more time. In Aug, things were a bit rocky because my anxiety was getting the best of me. Towards the end of this month (3 months in) i thought now was the time to really emphasize a relationship. She said we could try it out but 2 weeks later she tried breaking it off with me right before school was starting because “she wasn’t ready” and wanted this year to her and her friends since the last two years she was in relationships with other people. it was hard for me to take in atm but she let us talk the next day. the day we talked we ended up agreeing to take a few days away to give each other space, but we could talk once i moved back onto campus. that night she told me to come over and she told me how much she missed me and honestly it felt so good to hear. however she said we couldn’t be seeing each other very often as we’d get attached again. fast forward to october, she p much went against her word and we’d been seeing each other almost daily including sleepovers (5/7 days of the week).

one day one of her friends flings at the time asked us what we were &amp; she just stared at me &amp; told him we’re just seeing each other. he then asked how long we’ve been dating for and that was easy for her to answer. this hurt &amp; ended up with me confronting her about it, telling her how i felt. i told her i wanted her to give us a try since things were going well again. she was rlly hesitant at first, but ultimately gave in and said we could try (🚩). things felt like the summer for a bit. i wanted us asking each other out to be special, things didn’t necessarily go as planned but the night we wanted to make it official, she ended up asking me to be her gf and i just felt so much happiness at this moment. things were good for a few days until right before halloweekend where she ultimately wanted to “break up” bc it was too much for her. she liked the way things were just without the label bc it put too much pressure on her. this hit me like a truck and i was hurt esp telling me this the day of halloweekend when we’re supposed to have fun. she definitely did as she went out with her friends while i was losing my mind back in my room. surprisingly 2 days after she asks me if i want to stay over which i agreed to. we were supposed to talk about what happened the next day but we both avoided it bc i didn’t wanna ruin anything (🚩). we agreed to be exclusive again tho.  fast forward to around my birthday in nov, things were okay. she did make me feel special on my birthday &amp; surprisingly got me a gift ive been wanted. it was rlly sweet. however, a week after my birthday i noticed how different she’s become. she started to be distant and cold towards me. wouldnt include me in her plans &amp; wouldn’t reach out unless it was to stay over which was also late at night. excitement, affection, and s*x were declining and my mind was starting to spiral.  last week, i went to hers after the bars to talk about it and instead of her listening and talking it out she was very mean and did not care even though i was crying/being vulnerable. this hurt me and i didn’t talk to her for 3 days. although i wanted to wait for her to reach out since she hurt me, on Friday i gave in and texted first. she agreed to meet with me after her night out (mind u she was not sober). i was nervous and rightfully so bc i was expecting the worst. she ended up breaking things off with me for real this time. this broke me. i saw it coming but i was in denial. i thought we could’ve resolved this issue but i guess we couldnt bc she didn’t want to. her reasoning was that she wanted to work on herself and be with her friends blah blah blah. cliche stuff mixed with some hurtful things. i just felt like i wasn’t good enough for her. she ended up comforting me. as soon as i was leaving she tells me to take all my things so i end up doing so and taking something else we both shared. she got rlly mad and we ended up fighting as she drove me back. i asked if she was willing to throw everything we had away over “this” and she said yes. anyways, the next day she texts me apologizing and we send a few texts back and forth bc as i was going home, i see her come out of her house all happy and she ends up going to bars so i call her out on it. she says it has nothing to do with me and that she wants to be out with her friends. i just couldn’t wrap my mind around her being okay enough to drink and party one day after she ended things. we stopped talking after she sent me a paragraph apologizing, saying i wanted something more serious than she did and that i wasn’t going to find that with her. it’s been really hard i feel lost. we’d spent almost everyday together for 7 months. i also decided to check and see if she was back on dating apps (i had no interest in talking/seeing anyone else) and as i went through my messages, her profile was gone. the only reasonable explanation i have is that she redownloaded it last night to remove me &amp; use it again without me knowing. i don’t think she deleted her account either bc it was still up around the last time i checked in aug (first breakup). i’m not sure what to do i feel so fucking hurt and it makes me feel like i didn’t mean anything. she’s so quick to jump back onto dating apps just like she did before she met me. did i really mean nothing? am i that easy to replace? this is gonna hurt so bad and the fact that we live 5 mins away from each other and go to the same school doesn’t help at all. i’ll admit i wasn’t the easiest person to please. i’m very needy and have bad jealous issues i need to work on. as bad as she sounds too, i really do miss her and want her back as much as shes hurt me. our time together was truly memorable &amp; im afraid to move on bc i dont want to forget. any input/advice would be appreciated.",idk what to think…,18mipeo,1703036871.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mipeo/idk_what_to_think/,

"I'm 31M. I recently realized I might be fucked up.

BACKSTORY: I had two very intense “relationships” in my early and mid twenties that were very short-lived (one a few months and another about a month). One during college and the other a few years after graduating. Without getting into details, both women did things that I now know are associated with lovebomb-y/narcissistic behavior. it took me a bit to fully get on board, but eventually I was extremely into both relationships and saw great potential with both. I saw both of them as really working out long term. It was like I eventually bought into the way they talked about us. Then it was like a light switched off and suddenly they weren’t interested anymore. Happened in both instances. Just a huge night-and-day difference. (the one that lasted a month dropped me completely while the one that lasted multiple months actually ghosted me). Both of these were extremely hard to get over. In the instance where I was ghosted, this was someone I thought I was maybe in love with.

I do not think either of them acted deliberately or maliciously. They didn't set out to use me or anyting. The one who ghosted did eventually reach out to apologize a few years later. I also know that one has BPD, which I read has a tendency to engage in behavior like this. Since they didn’t set out to deliberately manipulate me, I guess they don’t fit the real definition of “lovebombing.” That’s fine. I use that term for lack of a better word. I'll never know exactly what made them act that way and that's fine. This post isn't even about them. I just think they are necessary to mention because I believe it explains my current problem.

THE PROBLEM: To this day, I’m pretty sure I still hold the feelings I felt during these “relationships” as the standard for how I \*should\* feel when dating someone. This is not something I was even conscious of until recently. I'm pretty sure this is a problem. If so, how do I get over this and start having more realistic standards for dating and relationships? Are there books I can read about this specific topic? I already have a therapist but I’m not sure how much they know about this topic. Should I try to see a specialized counselor or something?

I’ve had other relationships since those two, but nothing lasting more than a year and I often had a hard time fully identifying how I felt about them, or I kept waiting/hoping for stronger feelings to develop that never came.

RECENT BACKSTORY: What sparked this revelation is that I recently dated someone for about two months. I was extremely into this relationship (""relationship""). She was aggressive about reaching out, making plans, talked a lot about our future together. Moved very fast, we “clicked” instantly, etc. I remember thinking, “I haven’t felt this strongly about someone since \[the two people from my early/mid 20s\]. But this time it's real. Finally, \*this\* is what it feels like to be truly interested in someone. I’ve found it etc etc.” I was convinced that this was going to be the long-term relationship I’ve been waiting for. CUT TO: Late last week where, as before, it’s like a switch flipped and she was no longer interested. One day we were making a list of things we want to do together and then the next day she’s just done. The text she sent me (she ended it via text) wasn’t mean or anything, but it was like the impersonal kind of text you’d send someone after one date. Just really out of sync with how excited and enthusiastic she seemed just days before.

But yeah, what do people think? Where do I start exploring this? Has anyone ever found themselves in a similar situation?

Another point: I am not the kind of person who consciously pines for an idealized disney rom-com sort of relationship. I think this is why it took me a long time to notice that my point of view is warped. I guess I always just assumed that I had normal standards because i'm not an overly romantic and sentimental kind of person.",Discovered I might have a hard time investing unless they are showing lovebomb-y/narcissistic behavior?,18mihjc,1703036241.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mihjc/discovered_i_might_have_a_hard_time_investing/,
"Basically I'm in my second year of uni now, finishing my first semester. In my first year I was put in a group for project where I met this girl. We worked pretty well together and got along pretty well. There was some flirty vibes (like holding eye contact with each other silently), subtle things. End of year came around and we went our separate ways, at that point I wasn't too sure I liked her but I knew there was something there. Second year came around and obviously with the excuse of the group project that we worked together gone, we didn't get to talk much at all. I caught her staring at me a few times and would look away whenever I'd look back.

Recently, I developed stronger feelings for her and I'm pretty sure she has feelings for me too. But the main issues I'm having are one, how risky is to have a relationship within the same course?

And two, during the group project, due to the nature of our course it's mainly male dominated so naturally she has two close guy friends which I'm cool with. But one of them clearly seemed to have an issue with me during that project, just via clear non verbal cues. And when our interactions ended with the project those cues went down.To be clear, I don't feel threatened or anything like that.

I'm just very serious about my studies and I'm not interested in childish drama, nor do I want to cause her any issues. I have no problem with her social group but they aren't exactly the most studious type and I'm a strong believer in no company is better than bad company. Naturally though if I get close to her I'm going to have to somewhat be close to them. Again nothing personal but it's not exactly a social group I want to be a part of. 

So I'm not sure whether to just let it pass or pursue it. I'm very inexperienced with this since the furthest I have gotten with romance in my life thus far has been unrequited, hence why I'm here.

Hello everyone, I have a question for everyone here. This is a real r/dating_advice post that needs serious attention. Online dating is so prevalent and often problematic, and this is my attempt to improve my results in it. If you have genuine advice, topics, links, examples, or perhaps can share your male profile that has seen decent success, please do so in this post. I desperately need any kind of help and attention on this matter. Send everything my way, whether it's links to research, perhaps a Facebook group, a TED talk, YouTube, Instagram - everything is welcome as long as it has proven to have a positive effect or increase in results. Maybe it's even something you've tried yourself!  
  
I need help optimizing my online dating profile. I really want to escape my lonely life, and online dating seems like the best way for me since I'm a very introverted person. I find it much easier to chat with people over the internet than to communicate in real life. I tend to open up and be more extroverted around people I know, and everyone likes my sense of humor and my personality. However, when it comes to strangers on the street, I'm just a different person - shy, insecure, and almost invisible. That's why my goal is to get to know someone over the internet first, and then, when I know them a little, it would be much easier for me to talk to them in real life. I know for a fact this will work, as my last relationship was almost 2 months only on the phone, and the girl liked me quite a bit when we first met on a date.  
  
I really hope to get some help and advice on this from here, since this subreddit is actually meant for it.

"I am very annoyed and frustrated atm. The last two guys I (F 28) matched with on dating apps, found a connection with through text and met up with, both ended up telling me that that they were going to be moving to different city soon (6-7hrs drive away) but wanted to meet up before they left. I wonder why these guys even bother still dating and matching with girls  (for the purpose of a long-term relationship) if they have already made plans on moving? Whats even weird is that both of these guys seemed very unbothered by their move and the situation and just assumed that I would be totally fine with a long-distance thing. I feel very annoyed right now because if I had known this from the start I never would have matched with them or put in the effort to get to know them in the last 5-6 weeks.

I guess you could ask what I talk about with friends but I have the same issue with that somewhat where the quality of conversation really degrades if I’m constantly around them, and I’m obviously going to be around someone I’m dating much more than friends.

You could also say that I should just enjoy being in the presence of someone I find sexy but I still don’t like struggling to think of shit to say and having to resort to dumb small talk.

You might also say that we can talk about what we’re doing or what’s going on around us but it’s not always feasible to be doing stuff especially during the week.

I’ve even had some say that well you have to be interesting enough to be in a relationship but one stock take of all the dull mfers I know in relationships punctures that theory. 

I really enjoy good conversation and I don’t want to become like those couples who just sort to waddle along in silence next to each other. We don’t always need to be talking but I want it to remain engaging (and spicy) when we do

"I am male, 22, and thought to ask some general viewpoints from others what to exactly do in this situation. I met this nice girl on one of the parties that I went to and she is actually from the same country as me (I am not from the country where party was at) and she looked absolutely stunning and cute. We had few shots together and some beer (in a group) and we talked definitely decent amount, from both sides, considering it was loud club and she was with other best friends. I decided to ask her instagram as I normally prefer this over phone numbers, and the next day, I got follow back as well. Maybe the next day seems long time but she generally looked like person who is not on Instagram 24/7 so I take it as normal. What I am thinking about is whether to just text her on Instagram now and ask if she wants to get some drinks or hang out sometime? What I am mostly contemplating about is what time is the best to text her and whether I should do it at all? As she is going to Christmas holiday abroad soon, I thought I will do it when she is back as then it is more chill time for her. It might sound silly, but this time I really want to try to have my kind of best strategy as I don't want to look weird or needy in any way as I guess I have made this mistake when messaging girls before. I sometimes feel like also when I message too soon I might look like for women I don't have better stuff to do and put too much focus on trying to date them. 

Also, what I think is relevant is that I discovered we actually study at the same  university, just different years and degrees and we also live in the same neighbourhood. Again, she seemed and was by conversation really the woman I would have so much to share with and would like to give it a shot the best way.

"I [M29] have been texting this girl [F30] daily for 3 months and sporadically hanging out with her the last 2 months. Generally, the dating has progressed well. While I mostly initiate the texting, she does so from time to time, too. Lots of questions being asked, lots of emojis, and a few cute nicknames sprinkled in-between.

However, and I may be overreacting, now it seems that she lost a bit of interest or got insecure from one day to another. Like four days ago, she sent the first nudes and was SO excited to meet. This behavior has been the norm. But.. then I made a - perhaps - bit stupid joke?

So yesterday, I sent her a reel about a couple's dance. I'd told her I don't like dancing, but wanted to show some effort in her interests, so I asked if we should dance it together. She was excited and called me a gentleman. I don't know why, but I jokingly wrote: ""A gentleman.. or just a good actor? 🤪"". Generally, I've been doing good in staying sweet, funny, a bit mysterious, and also getting some sexual tension in there. So I really thought she would understand the sillyness, because if I had been acting.. well, I'd be a good actor, because I did a lot to show effort and affection, which was clearly appreciated.

After that message, four hours went by left on read. I thought she was just busy. Then she just wrote: ""Well, I need to ask you, are you a gentleman or a good actor?"", to which I just replied ""What is your feeling?"". She said that she doesn't think I'm acting, and I replied that I was glad that was the case, because I genuinely liked her a lot and spend a lot of time thinking about her throughout the day. Then I was left on read for another 2,5 hours (during hours that her kids are put to bed and she would just be chilling by herself), before she gave a quite endearing and cute reply that she was ""glad, because she also thought about me a lot every day"". Then she promptly wished me goodnight.

Okay, so I thought that cleared the air. But now I'm not sure. Because today I was hella busy, so I didn't text her all day. As I said, I mostly initiate texting, but when I've had a busy day and not texted her, previously she has ALWAYS checked in before bedtime with something: a meme, a question, a simple goodnight. But not this time. I eventually shot her a message: ""hey [personalized nickname], you awake still?"". And she just wrote, in a colder manner than normally: ""Hi, I'm going to bed. And you?"". Perhaps she was annoyed about not hearing from me the whole day, but this was definitely not the usual enthusiasm. I wondered if I have somehow planted a seed in her head yesterday about the whole ""gentleman or actor""-thing, and now she felt I might just take advantage of her, and not really give a fuck, leading to me not engaging with her all day. 

I don't wanna come off too strong either. Part of me is leaning towards being a bit extra sweet tomorrow, while another part of me wants to stay quiet and let her take the wheel, as my feeling is that she should also be capable of voicing concerns and contacting me throughout the day when she is not busy with anything else. Alternatively, keep status quo and hope it resolves without further intervention?

By the way, sorry about the long post about something that is not that important.

So after many years of not dating due to a really bad breakup, I've decided to try online dating and going out to bars and talking to women, etc. to date again. I just started so I haven't run into a problem yet, but I'm concerned about my current living arrangements being a deal breaker once a conversation starts. So I live at home with my parents still and I'm afraid even with my reasoning being explained that women are going to instantly stop talking to me or ghost me etc. So I'm living at home while I save money towards a down payment on a house and I wait to get accepted into a trade apprenticeship and increase my income. I have never gotten an apartment because it never made sense to me to pay for one when that money could be better put toward a house/mortgage.  
  
Just a note because I feel like it's going to get brought up, I didn't end up trying to move out until now at 29 because I was hoping to find a partner and buy a house together in some fictional world I thought was going to happen. Beyond that, I have a few mental disorders that were not properly handled and medicated for a majority of the time I've been at home so I honestly really wasn't fit to leave until I was 27ish because I refused meds, therapy, and the such.

We both find it difficult to part ways when we meet, as she expresses a desire to spend more time. Even after a hike, dinner, walk, she still wants to spend more time. We’ve even gone on weekend vacations together, but nothing happened because I’m afraid I will end up developing feelings for her, even though I flirt with her. I sometimes feel it’s foolish to spend this much time with someone who is here temporarily.

  
.Last weekend, she called me out of the blue and was heavily drunk as she and her coworkers got kicked out of a bar. When I went there, I saw her coworker kiss her on the cheek, and that kind of hurt me. She could tell I was upset by this. She couldn’t even walk, so I had to carry her to drop her home. While drunk, she told me she cannot stay here long-term and repeatedly asked me why I treat her well. I told her I’m aware of her situation and that I’ll be okay with her leaving. She then told me to find someone else and pay more attention to them. When I met her the next day, I could tell she did not remember any of the conversation, but it’s clear she knows I like her. I think she likes me too, because she often tells me she admires the qualities that I have and always looks forward to seeing me. She also stares at me a lot. I realized the reality of the situation, so I have been trying to spend less time with her, but she is contacting me more since then.

  
She and I planned to spend the Christmas holidays together to travel for a week, and now she’s telling me she wants to spend more time with me. She also asked me to come see her when she goes back to her country.I do want to date her, but I don’t want to stop her from living her life. I’m now wondering whether I should have a candid conversation with her, asking her whether she likes me or if she’s open to something long-term while maintaining a long-distance relationship. We both share similar hobbies, values, and get along well. I’m also unsure if I should cancel the vacation with her.  
TL;dr I met someone few months ago, we ended up spending a lot of time together, she knows that I like her but unsure if she likes me back.

A friend of mine (F24) hooked up with this guy (M24) when we were all in college (around 4 years ago). They hooked up only once and then their friendship fizzled out and they stopped talking. She said he was being a creep and only wanted sex. 

Fast forward to now the guy is hitting me up now and wants to hookup with me. I very strictly follow girl code but this situation I feel conflicted about. I’m fine with just hooking up and I have always had a big crush on this guy. Normally I steer clear of guys that my friends have done anything with but I live in a smaller city so sometimes that is hard. 

My friend knows that he has been messaging me and she told me that she feels weird about it and doesn’t like it. She won’t really tell me why she doesn’t like it though and she currently has a long term boyfriend that she lives with. This guy keeps hitting me up and asking me to go out with him and I keep saying no but I’m only saying no because of my friend.

M15. Not the kind of guy to really crush on girls but I met this girl in my creative writing class and she’s really, really kind. And super pretty to boot. Can’t get over her. I think she’s a grade over me. We don’t talk much, although she sits behind me (unless my friend steals her spot lol). We’ve done peer review together a couple times and she’s a really smart girl. She’s also one of the heads of the newspaper club (which I frequently write for) so she’s complimented a couple of my pieces there. Other than that, she spends every lunch alone and inside, so sometimes if I have writing after lunch I’ll go to that room and she’ll have taken my seat. Then when class starts she moves back and I’ll sometimes say “you can stay there if you want” and she just says “no, no worries”. At this point I’m just coming up with reasons to talk to her. She must think I’m stupid with all the questions I have about the newspaper lol. By now, the writing class is coming to a close, and there will be less opportunities to see and talk to her.

For context, besides her having leaned her head on my shoulder once we didn't really have any intimate physical interaction and I've always seen it more as a friendship. Also she tried once for me to flirt with her (which I didn't get at that moment)

I personally like her really much and she's attractive, what made me not try to commit is due to her being surrounded by man 24/7 and getting hit on almost always. Also she has been pretty avoidant and when I ask her to meet or smth else she mostly only texted 2-3 days later.

"Hi everyone

I, f(18), have a mindset where I have a negative opinion about guys I don't even know. I don't want this post to sound male hating at all, because that's not what I'm doing. I want to stop having a negative prejudice about guys I don't even know.

I have had experiences with guys in the past who were immature, mean to me, uncaring etc.. These experiences caused me hurt and a lot of distrust in guys. I don't want to think the worst of them, but when I don't and they turn out to be bad, then I will be hurt again. I want to prevent myself from getting hurt because that has happened before. Because I think like this, I have no male friends because I just block any male interaction, in fear of getting hurt again.
Every time one of my friends got with someone I had a bad feeling about, it turned out to be true. I just instantly get this bad feeling about guys when they talk to me. Like they're not honest and only want one thing. I don't know if this is accurate, surely not, but there have been too many instances where a guy seems honest and nice at first but then turns out to be completely different. I make myself seem unapproachable to them. I do this unconsciously, it's only at times like this when I look back on it and reflect that my behaviour is not good..
I don't want to make myself seem unapproachable. I also want to have guy friends, because I used to have them in the past.

"I'm not emotionally built for casual sex, but this man and I would go at it like rabbits and then grab lunch, have beach day, go out to nice restaurants for dinner, and we've even gotten couple's massages.... We've been talking since January, started dating in March, and began having sex in May. We've been in and out of each other's lives since. I gave him a pass for 'taking a break' while he was studying for his bar exam and again when he started his new job. It was like we'd always circle back to each other.

I cut him off and blocked his number and social media around September due to inconsistencies. However, I had to break no contact to crash at his place when my power went out. Seeing him this time sparked us seeing each other again, leading to our weekly dates and intimacy. He let me know I was always welcome as long as he had a place, even offering to put me as an occupant in his apartment when my housing hunt was looking grim. He didn't want me in an uncomfortable or rushed situation or homeless. So, he helped me move into my new place recently. I bought him lunch as a thank you, and a few days later, I decided to cut him off after we re-followed each other on Instagram. His following was full of women, like a menu he's just waiting to go through or already has. If I was 7 years younger - I'd scroll through, look at each account + his engagement but I don't want to hurt myself nor put myself through that. 

After reflecting on this, I decided to end things. I didn't tell him I thought I was in love, just that ""I didn't think he was my person, and I can't continue entertaining something that's proven to turn into nothing"" and  wished him well. 

I've had boyfriends in the past, but I've never felt feelings like this before. I hated the fact that he was like my everything and nothing at the same time. We've shared so many intimate moments, but I felt like I had to diminish my feelings to not get my hopes up or be hurt by the thought of him with someone else—yet he's super possessive. He got upset when I mentioned how someone I do business with hits on me and said, 'Not on my watch &gt;.&lt;,' grabbing my leg. In public, we move like a couple—holding hands, him holding me even tighter around other men. He just treats me like his girlfriend. This man also planned and payed for every single date we had. Ugh, I may have messed up.....

"I (24m) started seeing someone (21f) this past summer. I was gone for a big chunk of summer, but we managed to go on a couple of dates. We had a lot of fun, but it only ever went as far as kissing and hugging. Things got rough towards the end of summer, especially on her end, and she was dealing with some personal issues. She decided to end things. At this point, we weren’t officially, and we only had been talking for about 2-2.5months. 

We stopped talking, but after no contact, we started talking again. We decided to be friends, but as we hung out more, I started to genuinely like her. We started hugging, then kisses on the cheek, and now everyone we hangout we make out. I don’t see her often, usually once a week, but I’d like her to be my girlfriend eventually. I told her this, and she decided she couldn’t continue this any longer because she just didn’t feel ready.

I wanted to see her in person, so I could say goodbye, since at this point we had been talking and seeing each other for about 3-3.5months, half of that was us just being friends. When we met up, we just ended up having fun and she finally confessed to me that she has always been scared of relationships because of how badly her past ones her. She told she just wants to take things slow, which I’m okay with.

Last time I saw her, which was a week ago, we made out again. I have always been scared to get super physical with her because I really like her and don’t want to scare her off, but this time I got more physical. It was just mainly me grabbing her etc, but nothing else. I even stopped midway because I was scared. She never pulled away, so I’m assuming she liked it.

It’s been 3 months of us seeing each other, where we’re a little more than just friends, and I want to get more intimate with her. We already agreed to be exclusive, but before we become official she wants to really get to know me and she wants to work on herself before doing so.

I’m also scared to ask her because I’m a virgin, and the only girlfriend I had was when I was a dumb teenager, which only lasted about 2ish months. I have dated other girls, just not long term, and have been offered sex and I declined because I was just too scared. When I see someone I can’t really imagine myself in a long term relationship, I’m not scared to get physical.

"Am I a hookup or is it too soon to tell?

Hi. I F26 need advice for a very new relationship M30. I wouldn’t even consider it seeing or talking or even FWB. It is VERY NEW and I can’t say that enough. 

Last Sunday (over a week ago) I decided to download hinge. A guy popped up and I sent him a like. He matched me and we immediately started talking about my debate prompt. Shortly after he wanted to know if Thursday was okay for a date and I said yes. We talked briefly but it was more to do with the date and not anything else. Thursday came and we texted about our plans that evening. So essentially this was a kinda blind date because we knew nothing about each other.

Our date came and it was AMAZING. We immediately hit it off and had an amazing night. He kept saying how much fun he’s having and that he really likes me. He also did say that he wants our relationship to naturally progress and not stress or worry about this. And that he’s really enjoying his night with me and he really likes me so far. We continued to joke and have more drinks and just have a great time. By the time our night was finishing we were pretty tipsy and since he lives over an hour away I told him to stay at mine. He clarified that this wasn’t his intention to come home with me and he was expecting to go back to his house but we just kept talking and having a great night that we got carried away. 

We got back to my house pretty drunk and we started talking and realized we had a lot in common including music taste. So we put a few records on and then he kissed me. I told him that I usually don’t hookup on the first date and he said “we don’t have to do anything you aren’t comfortable doing, I wasn’t even planning on coming here so we don’t have to” obviously the night went on and I was feeling it so we had sex a few times. We fell asleep and he cuddled me. Next morning came and we got up and called an Uber to his car. He hugged me, kissed me on the lips and told me he had a blast and we absolutely need to do this again. He texted me immediately when he got into the Uber about him reeking of booze and said again that he had a blast and it was so fun being with me. I responded and he never responded back which is no big deal. 

He never messaged me until Sunday and when he did he was talking about how horny he was and how he absolutely needed to see me. He drove over an hour again and came over. We hooked up and after he took me for lunch. When we got home, we hooked up, watched tv and took a nap. After hours and hours he left because he worked early. He hugged and kissed me again and said he had a blast and that we absolutely need to do something again. 

I texted him yesterday about doing something on Wednesday but he said he had plans already which is no big deal because December is a busy month. I said that it was okay and that I hope he has fun. He HASN’T responded to me yet and it’s been almost 24 hours. 

So my question is… am I just a hookup? Is he just not a huge texter (and this could be the case because we didn’t really talk that much before our date) because what could we possibly talk about 24/7? Or is it way too soon to even tell what I am yet? I mean it’s only been not even a week since our original date so maybe it’s too soon to tell. I find it hard to believe that a man would drive an hour and a half for a hookup, can’t you hookup with someone in your town? And wouldn’t he say that rather than say he wanted our relationship to naturally progress? Idk I’m confused. Maybe I’ll just enjoy and live in the moment but I need a mans opinion lol.",Am I a hookup or is it too soon to tell?,18me7e2,1703024311.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18me7e2/am_i_a_hookup_or_is_it_too_soon_to_tell/,
"So I (20M) met this girl (20F) on a dating app few weeks ago and we started to text. She asked me for my IG within first minute of the convo. Since then she texts me every day, every ""good morning"", every ""good night"" she responds within seconds. We eventually met once and now we want to meet for the second time.

When I asked her when she has time on Christmas holiday, she said she is free on NYE, but I already have a trip planned with my friends and apologized. Anyway she understands, but still wishes I was free. I was a bit surprised that she would want to spend NYE with me after seeing me just once, because to me that shows already a decent amount of romantic and maybe physical intentions...  I personally don't mind that, It just surprised me a bit and I'm wondering what can you guys tell me about it, what do you think she was expecting? I've never had a girlfriend.

"I'm a 24 year old female. I wanted to hear from others if they could relate or could offer any advice for my predicament. I would say that my life is going well. I've been single for 1.5 years now and I would say that I am fairly content. I'm a college student with a stable job and I'm deeply involved in my local community. I spend most of my time focused on building my career and working on myself. I work out pretty regularly to stay in good shape, have a 4.0 GPA, and have even gained national recognition for the volunteer work that I do in my local community. I have friends and family near me. I like to take care of all aspects of my life. I even go to therapy bi-weekly to work on my mental health. I would say I'm a pretty well-rounded individual. Yet, I don't feel truly happy in my life. I feel emotionally lonely, and I constantly crave a romantic relationship. I haven't been intimate with anyone or even casually dated someone in 1.5 years. This isn't because I don't want to, but just because the opportunity hasn't presented itself. I am on dating apps pretty regularly, yet nothing seems to come of it. In the past, I used to always be the person that made the first move and I've pretty much set up every relationship I've been in. Since then, I've been trying not to always be the one to make the first move, since it has led me into toxic or one-sided relationships in the past. I've been on one date in the last 1.5 years, and there wasn't much chemistry between me and the other person so it didn't go anywhere. I feel romantically lonely very often and find myself constantly yearning for a relationship. My last relationship lasted over 3 years and we even lived together and had pets together. I miss the comfort of being in a relationship, it provided me with a sense of security and love that has been almost impossible to replace. Everyone usually just says ""Focus on yourself"" but I already do that. Like, I said I work out, I have a 4.0 GPA, and have a whole list of hobbies I frequently do. I just wanted to hear from other folks if they feel the same way or can offer any advice. It's frustrating to try so hard to be a well-rounded individual and yet feel unhappy because I'm not in a relationship. I feel pretty touch-starved, and I just miss the feeling of being in love. I miss spending my time with someone, and I miss giving someone my attention and getting that attention back. I get jealous of my peers who seem so satisfied being single, and don't seem to crave relationships at all. But most of all, I feel frustrated because I've done everything I can to feel happy on my own, and yet I don't.tldr; I don't feel truly happy unless I am in a romantic relationship despite everything else in my life going well",I'm only truly happy when I am in a relationship,18mdtud,1703023291.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mdtud/im_only_truly_happy_when_i_am_in_a_relationship/,

We both over the course of the month have been talking a LOT and have really emotionally connected or at least I think we have, he and I often tell each other how much we like each other. So we have really met due to him and I being busy with our studies but now it's winter break and I keep telling him how much I'd like to go on a date with him, we're both too socially anxious to see each other but I'm trying to push myself. 

Yesterday I told him I'd like him to take some initiative and plan a date, now you see I genuinely don't mind planning a date as well, I just expect the guy to plan it on the first date, let me know how much he cares. He told me isnt the guy if I want someone who can take initiative and I understand that since he is nervous and shy guy, but like how am I supposed to see him ever? It feels like we're literally e-dating 😭😭. He also kept saying he's ""bad at planning dates"" but seriously, he lives in Toronto, how freaking hard is it to search up ""affordable dating spots in Toronto"". He finally suggested aimelessly walking the streets of Toronto, like seriously how low effort is that specially after we spoke for so long. I'm not even asking for a candlelight dinner, just a cafe or ice cream would suffice. He also told me planning a date should be mutual but when I sarcastically said I'd plan the date, he said ""sounds good"".

"Recently, I emerged from a 6-7 month situationship that ended with me feeling quite foolish and hurt (detailed in another post). Now, back in the dating game, I’ve had some success with online dating.

Interestingly, the first woman I met through an app has been amazing. We instantly clicked, talking for nearly 5 hours on our first date. Since then, we’ve been on couple more dates, bonding over shared hobbies. I feel a strong connection and believe the interest is mutual (she’s been complimentary, initiated physical contact, etc.). However, given my recent past, I’m wary of misinterpreting signals or rushing into filling the void left by my last experience.

I’ve invited her over for dinner this weekend, and she’s accepted (didn’t realize it was Xmas Eve, but yeah …). While I’m excited, I’m also cautious about getting too attached too quickly. I’m looking for advice on how to approach this budding relationship. Should I bring up certain topics or just let things flow naturally?

Last week, we had a school trip. In my class, there's a nice girl with whom I have a friendly relationship - nothing more, we didn't text much, just talked occasionally. I've had a crush on her for 2 years. During this trip, we started talking, and our conversation was practically uninterrupted. I made her laugh, etc. She initiated the conversation from time to time, looking for a response. When we got back home on the same day, we texted practically all night for the first time. The next day, on Friday at school, we continued talking frequently. Over the weekend, we texted every day until late. On Monday, we talked again, I made her laugh, and we texted until late. She also sent a lot of voice messages besides texting. However, for the past 2-3 days, I've had this minimal feeling that I need to start the conversation. So today, I decided to wait for her to text first. As you probably guessed, she didn't. I don't know if she has lost interest in me or if she expects me to initiate the conversation.

I think this is probably the most interesting thing that has  happened to me in a while although the backstory is not too important I think it still gives good context, so I’m gonna share it any way

So I went the bar for my friend’s birthday last Saturday. Almost instantly I was approached by a girl (lets call her C) and her friend (V), both very flirty and physical, V was quite literally unbuttoning my shirt in the middle of the bar telling me to take it off. I of course instantly became uneasy, especially because V seemed really eager (she even joked about a threesome). But what can I say, they knew how to charm me, I buy my friends and the girls some drinks. V wanders off after a while, but C sticks around with me and she seems like she is having a great time. We talk about ourselves and get to know each other an and soon enough we were making out and dancing. We can’t get our hands off of each other for the rest of the night. Admitidly it was, almost an embarassing amount of PDA

Sparks were flying and I was having a great time. She was an extremely beautiful girl and she seemed like she had a good head on her shoulders (about to graduate school with a sociology degree and generally aware of the political climate of the world). She was the last person I was expecting to meet at this bar and I knew pretty quickly I wanted to get to know her better, so I made sure to grab her number

Eventually V comes back around, and I am assuming she was jealous because she did everything in her power to split us apart for the the rest of the night when C didn’t want to. V even kissed me at one point but I didn’t really think much of it. They had gone on a few bathroom breaks together, and on their third trip I lose track of C. And my friends at this point wanted to go the next bar over, so I texted C so she could tag along but my phone died almost right after. 

So here is a transcript of our texts since images aren’t allowed:

Me @ 11:40 pm -  “My phone is about to die, come to *insert name of bar*!”

Her @ 11:48pm - is this *insert my name*?

Me @ 11:49pm - “the one and only”

*My phone dies at this point*

Her @ 12:24am - “I’m sorry my friend lied to me saying we were going to the bathroom but we ended up leaving 😭 “

Her (continued) - “Lmk when u want to go out downtown I'll show u around :) “

*The next afternoon my phone is charged at this point*

Me @ 2:30pm  - “its all good haha, last night was hectic”

Me (continued) - “What did you have in mind? I’m free Wednesday night :)”

Her @ 10 pm (8 hours later) - “Hmmmm I’m not sure what’s going on on Wednesdays tbh”

*The next morning*

Me @ 9am - “Hmmm you make a great point”

Me (continued) - “Alright here’s the new plan. Friday night, I’ll treat you to dinner at *insert restaurant name here* @ 7pm and then we’ll go get drinks and you can show me around.”

Her - *No response*

I think maybe she just wanted to have fun, but I really fell for her in those few hours and maybe I made it too serious over text by suggesting dinner. Either way it sucks, because she felt perfect in the moment, and I am personally not someone who just gets passionate like that with anybody. (I’m pretty picky, I have clicked with maybe 1 or 2 other people like that in my life). I saw a beautiful girl with a seemingly great personality that fit my criteria, I got hooked on her and I was left wanting more. 

I have been considering double texting and being vulnerable with her and straight up telling her how I felt about our chemistry that night but I don’t want to scare her off even more, or end up making a fool of myself.

"I (30m) got set up with her (25f) by one of my coworkers. Coworker thought we'd be a good fit. 

When she gave the coworker the green light to reach out, I did. Thing is, it took her over a day to respond. Now I'm not bothered by that much since we did not know each other and I'm not owed anything. 

We ended up going out for the first time last week Wednesday and I had a great time. We planned for our second date as soon as we ended the first. Second date I thought went just as good. Had dinner, dessert at a nearby place and just talked for a couple hours. Again, I had a great time.

Thing that now bothers me is how hot/cold her texts can be. Sometimes it'll be within minutes, others it stretches over 24 hours late. I'm aware I have an anxious attachment style and therapy has done wonders for me, but when I start to catch feelings, they start to get the better of me. 

I reached out again after waiting over a day for her response, and still radio silence. I was hoping to see her again before the holidays where both of us will be busy with our own schedules. She says she has had a great time with me after both dates, but maybe I'm getting into my own head, or maybe she's just not as interested in me, which is fine. I asked my coworker how she is with texting and the coworker said that she's just a really bad texter. Which confuses me more with texts going from playful banter, to nothing.

HOWEVER after talking to my friend about something that happened on the date, i'm now kinda upset? but confused on if its the situation or because of my friend's reaction?

  
Some Backstory...when we went on our first date he paid for everything and I made a comment about how next time I wanted to grab the bill for dinner. So when it came to the second date I went in with the intention to do that. We first went to the Christmas Market for some Gluhwein, he bought the first round and and I said i'd pay for the next. He said to me just pay me back later so I was like ok!  (in hindsight i should have just done it in the moment). After the two drinks we went for dinner at a Chinese place (i speak Chinese) and it was nice. It was all going well but when we went to pay I got completely engrossed in a conversation with the boss of the restaurant that I forgot I said I wanted to pay. I barely clocked it but he paid with no questions and didn't say anything. We left the restaurant and whilst walking away chatting he jokingly said a bit later something along the lines of 'didn't you say you wanted to pay?' I was like OH SHIT i did say i was going to do that and told him I'd pay him back. He then never mentioned it again and it was only after he left the next day (he stayed the night) I remember I wanted to give him the money so I asked for his paypal and sent it over.   


I was telling my friend about the date and we were talking about the 'etiquette' of when it comes to paying the bill on a date and when i told her about the situation and that he jokingly said 'didn't you say you wanted to pay?' ', she said 'Wait what?! He said that? Omg I would’ve been annoyed tbh but maybe cause that would be so frowned upon here for a guy to say that.'

Few days ago, I met her at the store with a guy (don't know if he is her bf or not) and again she said hello, we talked for a minute, laughed a little and punched me in the arm when she left.


I don't know if she is this friendly with everyone or not and I don't know if she has a bf or not.

Its not the fact im a boring person to message nor am i dry infact im like the opposite its just i always feel awkward now, a year or two ago this WOULDNT happen but now its like something has drained my lust to respond and talk to girls.

"I was in a relationship with a guy for 5 months and we had a huge fight. Things were not great between us and some issues happened during my last visit to him.

I’m Latina, he is American. It was long-distance, we met in travels, but we saw each other 4 times during this period. I was not asking him to be his girlfriend, I told we could keep seeing each other, traveling together and see where this was going. I have plans to move to the US very soon because I’m going to study there.

We decided to make peace and he’s never clear about his feelings. But one thing he said to me before and now is that everything was going too fast between us and he was not with both feet in.

But even with the distance and with me not charging him to be bf and gf, it was aaaaalways too much. Small things were always too much.

He keeps talking about women always wanting to get married, have children, and that he was not sure if he wanted this. and he said that he doesn’t feel like he is in this phase on his life. And I said thousands of times during the relationship that this was not in my head. For us Latinos start a relationship doesn’t mean instantly start thinking about those next steps. It is about having fun and building trust and next steps together. 

Anyways. Is it a cultural difference and the pace is more slow for dating to Americans? Or he’s just an overthinker? Or am I too fast for wanting us to keep dating?

Now we are trying to be friends and know each other on other perspective. And he says I’m the only one who understands him and with who he feels he connects (which I don’t understand, it doesn’t make sense). 

I will follow my life in terms of dating because I can’t wait for anyone, but I am curious to hear opinions about it.",He 30M said everything was going too fast but I 30F think it was okay,18mbwbd,1703018387.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18mbwbd/he_30m_said_everything_was_going_too_fast_but_i/,

"Before i start writing asking for advice, may I ask, i am eligible to create a long post about my situation?

Here it goes, ill copy paste from another subreddit, which is pretty empty (only 2k members)

\------------------------

1st post which i made after first date:""Long story short, ive never been good at dating but in 2022 i started listening to Corey and following his advice. Since then I've been able to secure a few dates with magnificent women and even managed to hook with 2. In general, I am very anxious person and I always overthink things for no apparent reason.I've had a few successful and good dates over Tinder and Bumble but lost my account 3 months ago and haven't been on a date since I lost access to app.10 days ago I've reinstalled Bumble and Tinder and made new account. I've got some lovely pictures on them and a decent bio, saying that i look for a girly, feminine woman. About a day after I matched with a younger girl instantly. We exhanged a few texts as she lives far away but agreed to meet when we are near eachother, we exchanged instagram info so we can hear eachother later.2 days ago I had to visit a city near her place and hit her up on instagram a night before. She responded the next day saying that we can meet. I told her ill be nearby and to give me her number and that I will call an hour or so before im there. I called her and she answered and seemed to be a pretty lovely lady.I picked her up and we went on a date. We hit it off immediately. She was doing 80% of the talking, touching her hair etc. I was just laid back and let her talk. We talked about her family and relationship with her parents, about her studies. I kept teasing her and she seemed really into it. After 2/3 hours at the bar i paid the bill and was about to take her home. She instited on taking a walk around the city to show me nearby castle. When we got to the castle, i just pulled her over and we kissed. Then she took me to a nearby market - it was late so everything was closed. And it was also freezing cold. When we got to the car we kissed passionately again. I didnt put any emphasis on kissing and just brushed it off as its something usual. I really felt calm and collected around her and she seemed to be having a good time also. I took her home to nearby parking lot, when we got out we kissed and she was giving me the puppy eyes and said that she had a great time then i said that i had a good time as well and thanked her for her company and told her that she should call me when shes bored. And she said I will.Anyway, its been 2 days since and I havent heard from her. Usually when dates go as good as this one girls text me as soon as they get home, at least that was the case with 2 or 3 girls that i had almost as wonderful date with this year like with this one (it was one of the top dates as she's got all the attributes ive been looking for and she really is the girl that you come across every few years).I know i might be overthinking but it just feels good letting things out and maybe hear rest of Corey's followers take on this. Im thinking about calling her in 2 days and see whats up, maybe arrange another date on sunday and ask her to come over to my city.In any case, i have to thank Corey that I managed to get so far with girls compared to not even being able to get dates with below average looking girls a year before.""

\-------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

2nd post - after 2nd date:quick about me: im 31, an enterpreneur with a decent company, small but super muscular, i like to dress stylish and i have this big sleeve samoan tattoo on my arm.After I've written previous thread last tuesday (after 1st date when i got no message from her). I've called her a day or two after I made the thread (that is 3 or 4 days later) and arranged another date and she actually answered and agreed to a date on the coming sunday at around 6pm (3 days after the call). She didnt seem that excited tho but she agreed. We spoke for 1 minute or two at most.When sunday came I called her around 2pm and she didnt pick up. She lives an hour away. I called her again 3 pm and she didnt answer. 5 minutes later i received sms: ""Hey, sorry, I will call you later"". After half an hour i replied: ""ill be at agreed location at 6pm""I felt really disappointed since it was obvious that she will cancel date, however, considering the fact that the first date was (objectively) one of the best dates that ive had with women, I still gave it a go and just left for her city expecting her to show up at 6pm. Something about chemistry on the first date just felt so right and eventho i was disappointed i was convinced that there is no way she will flake.When i was driving for about half an hour, i received sms: ""hey, im done and free to talk:)"".I felt really happy to be honest. I called her and told her ill be there a bit later because I'll stop on my way at my friends place.When I arrived at 6 she was already waiting. We met and i told her she has dry lips and that we need to fix that and we kissed passionately. I then cracked some jokes, asked her in this exact words: ""pretty, smart, innocent, feminine... whats the catch"" and she went along with jokes really well and couldnt stop laughing. We went to a bar for a drink where I mostly listened to her talking. I also asked her if she locks all her boyfriends into her sex dungeon. The jokes were all very well received with some positive replies and laughter. She never replied with anything naughty tho. I think she is as innocent as she looks. I also asked her about her relationship with her parents, sister etc to which she also had very positive things to say. She also told me that she has seen my isntagram story when i took out my employees out (a day before we met) to a team building go-kart race and asked how was it.She is really girly and feminine (25 years old and psychology student). She never swears, likes to dress unprovocatively and is very conservative. She is still a student so i asked her how her rhytm is like. She told me she likes to sleep and isnt a very morning person and that she always falls asleep watching movies. I asked her if she ever gets mad at another person and she told me that the most mad she's been recently was when she went to a yoga class and the training room was so cold that she had to workout in her winter-wear, she told me that she was so mad that she had written an email to please turn on the heating. We had a laugh because she really cant and never gets mad and writing an email saying ""please"" is the worst thing she can do. I told her to make an angry face to which she laughed and said that the only face she can do is a cute face. I told her im super shy and a mammas boy, to which she replied: ""yeah sure, what else isnt true about you"".Then we took a walk around the city, went to a merry-go-round then then stopped at some stalls where we drank wine. She noticed another stall with helium baloons at which she pointed and said when she was little her father got her one and she kept it at home but it got more and more deflated every day which made her sad. I took her to the stall and bought her the most ridiculous looking helium baloon there was - a police car. I told her she has to keep it with her so it will surveil her if she will do some naughty things, she laughed and kept it close to her at all times. During the date she kept making jokes about it. The only thing i've noticed is that she doesnt mind if i touch her anywhere but she doesnt touch me as much.After about 2 hours into the date, i told her im hungry and that we should go to her place and order some food and that I have a bottle of champaigne with me that we will drink. She didnt even flinch (saying ok) but took it very casually. We then drove back to her apartment, we parked, exited the car and as we exited ive noticed ive had a plastic 3D printed model of my company's figure in my car and i gave it to her. She took it and said it looks great and we went straight to her apartment.When we got home we first ordered some food and opened champaigne. We sat on her sofa but before we even started drinking we started making out and it didnt even take 5 minutes before i got her naked and gave her some good oral sex, she came hard in like 30 seconds. We had some sex but i didnt last long as she is one of the most beautiful girls ive seen.She seemed satisfied tho as she cuddled up to me. You could tell she was super relaxed with me and very responsive to everything I did. She said she really likes my tattoo as i look dangerous (i might have made the last part up, i dont know). The only thing that ive noticed during these 2 dates is that she didnt ask me much personal questions. Ordered food arrived and we ate it in the kitchen and had some nice conversation.After the food we laid back on sofa and watched a movies but we both fell asleep. We woke after an hour and i told her to move to bed. She grabbed me and started kissing me and we went for round 2 but this time the sex was amazing at it lasted way longer. She kept giggling afterwards. We went to bed and she cuddled to me and fell asleep.When I woke up around 7:30am as i had to go to work. I started rubbing her and she was getting wet but she was still half asleep. I got over her but she said that she really cant do it because she needs to wake up properly first. I told her no worries and got up and got ready to leave. She giggled and fell asleep. I then woke her up and told her to come lock the doors after me. She was like ""just leave them open"" but i insisted since its a dagerous neighboorhood. She could barely get up, her eyes were still shut as she walked to the doors to close them behind me. As i left i gave her one last quick kiss and told her to text me or call me. She said i will.Today is 2 days after we met but i still got no message or a call from her. I really don't understand. We really have great connection, we feel super at ease with eachother. I can tell that she is very comfortable around me. I've had girls text me after a date always within a day and nothing in last few years even came close to this smooth date.Id love to hear your opinions on this guys. Something feels really weird about this. I'd be incredibly happy to hear from her. She really is a girl that you meet once per few years and she checks everything that i wanted from in a girl. And I keep replying the date in my head but I cannot imagine it being any better.""

3rd date - cancelled:""So, we had our last date last sunday. I called her the thursday afterwards and she agreed on a date for today. I asked her if she is taking good care of my balloon as another guy here mentioned, she laughed and said she did and that it is still inflated. I told her to plan her tuesday free to come over to my city.Today I called her to change location, since i didnt get a reservation for today. She said she forgot about it and thought that I will come over to her place. I told her to just come over to my place.After 2 hours now i got a text: ""Hey, im sorry, i need to cancel this today. It was super being without you but i got along very well with another guy. I thought about it and i dont want to date 2 guys at once"".Damn, I didnt pursue, text or anything. This one stings. Any idea what i should do. I thought just about replying something along the line of ""you are a great girl and if anything changes between you two, hit me up""I know i did the right thing following Corey's advice of only setting dates once per week but i do not know how could I have pulled this one off better. I was being mysterious, i set date once per week with few days in advance, i made her laugh, i wasnt lovey-dovey. But this girl really was special, the way she talked positively about everything, her relationship with parents, etc... what could I have done differently. She checked top 15 attributes that Ive had on my list of top 30 i want in a woman.It feels like she had this last date with the guy this weekend and since i postponed it 9 days after our last, which is about 2-3 days after the probable last date with this other guy, i lost heredit: i just wrote to her ""Hey, you're a cool girl and if I'm still single later or it doesnt work out with this guy, text me to rekindle the romance ""

"I'm an almost 33f working on myself, particularly on parting ways with online dating which has made me feel so much better about myself!!

However I met a guy on Saturday night with my friend. My friend kissed his friend and he kissed me. OK we were all a bit drunk but from the very start my guy made a beeline for me.

So me and my friend were staying in a b&amp;b and let them stay with us. We didn't sleep with them but we did do a few fun things, in separate beds I might add!! So anyways, my friends guy adds her on Instagram on Monday afternoon,  she accepts his request a few hours later and they have been chatting.
My guy adds me at 9pm but I decide to leave it until 1pm the next day to accept his friend request because I felt it was a bit late to be adding him. But he un follows me on Instagram at 2pm!!! And hasn't accepted my request to foolpw him!! And I'm really wondering why the hell did he? I start thinking all sorts that he felt I wasn't  attractive enough in my photos bla bla. He has a lot of followers compared to me I might add. Did he get annoyed that I didn't add him soon after or what?
It was playing on my mind that I probably should have accepted his request sooner. But I have tried to salvage the situation by messaging him and asking him why he has un followed me? Not in a desperateway just in a jokey way?

"For context, I (30M) got out of LTR of 8 years back in April. My ex was an alcoholic with BPD and she physically abused me and monkeybranched to another man. I was absolutely broken but worked really hard to get past it. I'm still not 100% healed, but I started feeling good enough and like my ex was in the ""rearview mirror"" in my mind to be comfortable dating.

Fast forward to now. I've been on a few dates from dating apps, and none of the women have really interested me all that much— I ended up cutting things off with them after two dates max. Now I'm on the receiving end and I guess since I've been out of the game so long I want to see if this is pretty normal, or if she was just narcissistically looking for sex and validation.

I saw her on Hinge and used my free rose to engage with her. She’s absolutely beautiful, definitely my type. We talked on Hinge for a couple days and she offered me her number. We texted, albeit with large hours of gaps in between, throughout the week. Finally, we decided to have dinner on last Thursday together. I thought it went amazingly. We have a similar weird and dark sense of humor, and pretty much align politically and culturally. She is a behavioral therapist who specializes in trauma and substance abuse, BPD, and utilizes EMDR. Coincidentally, my ex was an alcoholic (big reason we grew apart), had BPD, and I’ve been using EMDR therapy in my own trauma treatment. What are the fucking chances?

We exchanged pictures of our Halloween costumes, and she complimented my arms— I then told her I had been making a lot of progress on a cut in the gym and she asked for a picture for ""research purposes,"" and I sent her one. After that, she said ""damn, you're very handsome"" and that she felt nervous to meet me because of that. I responded by saying she was intimidatingly beautiful and that we could be nervous together.

Anyways, on to the first date. We talked for three hours at dinner, laughed a lot, and conversation flowed naturally. The only thing I noticed was that she pretty much only talked about herself and didn't really ask anything about my background or life— fine, I thought, the first date I'll let her do 80% of the talking anyways. Afterwards, she invited me back to her place where we watched an obscure show she loves, which she was pleasantly surprised to hear I also liked and knew about. As I was leaving, we kissed, which started evolving to something more, but nerves got to me (this was my first intense physical connection since the breakup), and I told her “we have to save SOMETHING for next time”. She agreed, but she clearly was wanting more. However I said we’d meet up again the following Friday, but she said she ""might have plans,"" as if to dodge it? Idk. But she did agree that we could meet Friday after all.

Then, on Saturday day she told me she was sad she had to wait until Friday to see me. This seemed like a clear indication she was really into me. She asked if I was busy Sunday, and I wasn’t so we agreed to hang out. She came to my place, I made us dinner, and we went downtown to a cocktail bar and we both had non-alcoholic drinks since she had to work the next day (such a huge fucking green flag for me). She also didn't really ask about my life at all on this date and only wanted to talk about herself. We came back to my place and not to get graphic but we had some amazing sex. She even gave me a compliment on my shredded physique which I’ve worked so hard the last 8 months to build (""you have a nice body"" is the only compliment she gave me irl, not even anything about the dinner until I asked her how she liked it...).

I was cautiously optimistic. She seemed really into me. Yesterday we texted a little bit, and she seemed lighthearted and still interested, even randomly sending me a meme at some point. I asked how her day went and gave apologies if she was tired in the morning because of how late she stayed at my place Sunday, to which all she said was ""today was good but I was tired lol"". I then told her it would only be fair if I came to her next time, and asked if she still wanted to chill this Friday. That was around 9 or so last night. I resolved that I'd not be the first to text and leave that ball in her court this time, as I'd initiated all previous times.

Then of course, today I got the text from her saying that she ""appreciates the time"" we spent together but she ""had time to process"" and decided we aren't compatible for ""long term future stuff and I have no interest in wasting each other's time."" What? Firstly, she never even made her dating intentions clear, and second, I felt a lot of compatibility on so many fronts with her, and she was genuinely having fun it seemed. I guess something in my gut told me something was off with her, but I was stupid and didn't trust it.

I guess I'm confused because the conversations were good, we have aligned political views, similar dark and weird sense of humor, the sex was great for her (by her own admission), and she seemed into me ostensibly (despite not asking questions about me). I feel like she was using me for narcissistic supply almost, and that's the only reason she even came over for a second date. If I'd fucked on the first date, I think she'd have cut me off sooner.

Was she put off when she looked at my bookshelf and saw books about psychology, BPD, self-help, attachment theory, etc? Did she judge me very Spartan rental house with little decor? Did she not really find me all that attractive but just wanted sex? Idk. I guess she probably was talking to multiple people and just decided on a different one besides me.

I want to ask her if she can elaborate a bit on why, just so I have feedback for future dates, but I know that just looks weak and lame. I know I'm not owed an explanation, but it would really fucking be nice.

"There’s this somewhat influencer/scholarly guy I’d never met, on X, with a properly-functioning moral compass and loads of courage to speak the truth to power, with tens of thousands of followers - compared to my 100 followers. He also periodically posts photos of himself, which I have periodically liked and reposted with some joking but not-so subtle hints that I find him very attractive. This has gone on for the better part of this year. I never actually expected him to respond. 

Except, on Saturday, after me publicly drooling over one of such photos, he sent me a direct message 😵‍💫🫠!

We started chatting, exchanged numbers and met up for coffee yesterday. He made a good first impression, seemed curious and interested, and said we should do this again sometime.

"Two weeks ago I (21yr) started talking to a girl (19yr) from my university. I knew she was from there as she is taking the same course as me, she just started it and I am finishing it. We had already talked as she sent me a message asking if I had anything to help her with her study for a test. She sent me that message from X and after a while I noticed she was posting some strange tweets and decided to ask her if everything was ok with her, that's when we started talking.  
  
She said to me that her boyfriend had cheated on her and a lot of other things he had been doing to her during the relationship. So I stayed ""listening"" so she could vent everything as pretty much most of her ""friends"" disappeared after breaking up with him.  
  
After two intense weeks of talking and a lot of common interests between us, we ended up having a date. I was kind of not expecting it, because she had broken up with her boyfriend recently and I assumed she was not ready for any relationship. We went to lunch after classes and went for a walk before I left her at the train station so she could go home. Everything was perfect. We talked a lot, laughed a lot and exchanged a lot of eye contact. When she arrived home she sent me a message saying she had just arrived and I said that I liked her company and wanted to keep knowing her better. She said she felt the same way, however, immediately after that she sent a message saying that she was not looking for a boyfriend.  
  
The thing that stays on my mind is, I knew that for now, she would not be looking for any of this as I understand her situation and respect it, but saying this after having a date just makes me think that she is already pushing me away. During the date, I had never shown any interest in a relationship now, because I knew her situation. Not saying that I would not be looking at a relationship in the future, but for now, I understand it.  
  
What should I do? Because I don't know if I should just stick around as a friend and see if anything happens in the future, or if I just should let it go.  
  
All the other experiences I have had when a girl says that, is to understand that she is just turning me down softly, but they had no recent break up or something similar.

"I haven’t been on dinner dates for a while and need your opinions since I don’t know what is right or cheap or red flags or me just being paranoid now. 

First of all, I (f) always offer to pay on the first date and I always suggest to start with coffee or something small and affordable for whoever so there is no pressure on either both pay their own or if anyone wants to pick the bill.

Met this person online and chat briefly. He asked a bunch of questions and then asked me if I am good to meet for a drink. He gave two location options, I picked one. Both are within my budget range for a drink. 

We met and talked. Overall it’s going well. He seems genuine. He asked me if I want to eat anything since he hasn’t had anything all day. I said I can have some bites and share the food with him.

I had one cocktail and total probably 5 bites of some diced meat amongst all the dishes we’ve ordered. He ordered a few drinks and pretty much ate most of them. 

When the bill arrives I put credit card to split, the total is about $200. I paid $100. He watched me did all without saying anything. 
I later realized (when I was home feeling hungry and tried to remember what I ate) those few bites are too expensive.

After the first date, he has been initiating the communication and soon suggests to get together again. 

I have this weird gut feeling of the dinner bill situation but not sure what it is. Is the person lack of consideration? But from his talk and planning, he does not seem so.  
I imagine if with friends in similar situation, anyone  may still suggest to not share the bill 50/50.

I am not sure if I want to go a second dinner like this with him and I am not sure how to bring it up (since it missed the moment).

"There’s a girl who just recently came back into my life, who I’ve had a history with. I’m a 28yo male she’s a 29yo female. 

Backstory:

A couple years ago we worked together and she was very obvious about coming on to me. We started spending a lot of time together, hooked up a few times but it became clear that she had no intention of being exclusive. At the time it was rough because I started to really like her and she made it seem like she felt similarly. We had never labeled it anything so I wasn’t mad or feeling cheated, but It became hard to work together and eventually we had a mini falling out one night after having a couple drinks. However, we bounced back quickly and became friends again. Just to note here that we are very very similar people but opposites at the same time. She’s from the east coast and has a loud outgoing personality, but is also sensitive. I can be outgoing but defiantly more chill and relaxed. We can disagree on things but have great conversations around why and we genuinely enjoy each others company, so there is a physical and intellectual connection there. If you’re into astrology **** I’m a Pisces and she’s Aries. 

Fast forward a couple months and I reconnect with a girl who I was a mutual friend with from years back. We go out and basically fall in love immediately (at least we thought). We moved in together pretty quick and for 2 years I felt like I found the one. Long story short she was not the one). 

Fast forward 2 years. We break up and this girl (the one in question) reaches out to me cause she heard my girlfriend and I broke up. We decide to meet for drinks and dinner and talk for hours about how the last 2 years had been for both of us. We essentially both had a rough go at it over the last year, especially her. She admitted that she did really like me before but that she was not in a good place and had toxic traits that she wasn’t proud of. We meet up for drinks maybe once a month for a few months after that and recently she asked me to give her a ride home. She invited me up to her apartment and we talked for a few hours, she admitted she was still very attracted to me and asked if I wanted to stay the night. We didn’t have sex (because she said it was her time of the month) but we cuddled and held hands, all that.

It was that night we also found out that we live in the same apartment complex as one another. CRAZY! Since then we’ve been spending a lot more time together, just chilling, talking. Even tho we’re very different I feel like we’re kind of mirror images of each other and I can’t help thinking there’s a connection here. Also, just the fact that our paths keep crossing years later is intriguing to me in and of itself. 

I guess I’m just curious if anyone had an opinion on what she might be thinking/feeling or if I should even pursue this. I do like her and It’s cool we live close cause we enjoy each others company, but it also makes taking a shot risky out of chance of making it awkward.

"So, after around 5 years of me trying to find a good girl for myself I thought a little bit.  
In a span of around 3-4 years, I tried to establish relationships with around 80 different girls with different backgrounds, education level and personality types. I tried both off and online, in a close circle and outside of it, in community events and outside of it.   
During this 3-4 years I have a relationship ONCE. That lasted about 3 months and was incredibly toxic and traumatic to me.  
So, lets go by simple math.   
If we take 80 as 100%, that means, 1% is 0,8.  
That means, for me, chance to have another toxic relationship in 4 years is about 1,2%...

I had been talking to a girl on a dating app and we share a lot of interests and hit it off over text. I asked her out and I went on my first ever date for drinks. The first 30 minutes I was awkward, spilled some of the drink on myself and had a basic conversation going when I thought this is going horrible but then things changed and we spent the next 3-4 hours talking and laughing about all sorts of things and completely hit it off. The bar closed so we decided to walk for another hour or so during which we made plans for the second date and high fived. At this point we were pretty close to my home so I invited her over and she stayed the night. We did not have sex as both of us thought we should take things slow and she also mentioned that in bed. But we had a really nice time with everything else and cuddled. The next morning she had to leave for a lecture so I suggested we text and decide on a time for the next date and she agreed and thanked me for having her over. She got an uber and I texted after asking if she reached safe which she replied to. I then messaged saying I had a really nice time and didn't get a reply for over 24 hours. I then texted again asking about our plans and she said she's feeling ill and trying to rest. The plan eventually got cancelled because she said she wasn't well. I then asked if she wanted to keep talking and meet up after the holidays since we were both travelling and she said she has been extremely stressed out with uni stuff and doesn't think she has time for dating. She apologised for not texting and mentioned that she had a nice time too. I then replied to this expressing my understanding of the situation and asked if she still wanted to stay friends. I haven't gotten a reply since and it's been a week. I feel sad that such a good connection is going to waste and I have no control over it. 

I really thought we hit it off, so I'm not sure what went wrong. As I haven't dated much this affected me and I feel like I received a strong blow to my self esteem.

I can't just keep running away from this lust, it will never go away untill I actually find a partner.

I have tried using dating apps, but most of these women who I match with ghost me because I ain't the best at texting and socializing. I am very introverted and prefer it that way, it's not just social anxiety.

I have also tried cold approaching a few times which was extremely hard for me to do + how rare I actually get these opportunities because I live in such a small town.

As there is many posts on this same topic I won’t bore anyone with useless info.
But recently I became pathetic and caught feelings for a very close friend.
Generally I have a strict no dating friends policy that I messed up here.
We hung out a lot generally once per week, would talk from what we like sexually to how to handle life in general. She would also flirt too.
She would ask about hanging out solo and with friends alot, but has recently stopped reaching out as much (here is probably where my answer is)

Useless backstory below:

Known her for over 4 years now feelings didn’t come till about 2 years into the friendship.
I originally caught feelings when she went to see one of my favorite obscure bands with me (knowing she didn’t even like the band in the first place).
After that I was gonna ask her out but we both ended up catching c-19 and her ex showed up and got back with her for about 5 months, so killed that first level of interest and remained a absolute solid friend to rely on.

Well recently she broke up with him and has mentioned she was single pretty much out of nowhere while we where out hanging (probably not a hint, but I don’t know), she now recently mentioned she is starting to talk to guys.

When I was hanging out with a group of friends talking about shows we went too, I mentioned her a lot during the convos and all the good memories of us came flooding in, and now I’m hard crushing cause she loves all the things I love too after getting to know her even more recently.

I really need some advice especially cause I’m sure many of you have had similar situations, Do I tell her how I feel and that I should probably back away to get my head on straight while avoiding a lovebomb, do I keep it to myself continue life and ignore it in hopes of it going away again, do I ask her out on a date straight up, my therapist said I should figure out the answer for myself, but no matter how much I try to wrap my head around it I’m just going in circles. I know pretty much all but ignoring it will possibly end my friendship but I think I can live with that.

"For some context, I met this girl back in June via bumble, we connected almost instantly, had aligning interest, and similar goals in life. It was a whirlwind romance and everything was going great. In Late October I left my job before going on a vacation with my family to visit my aging relatives in another country for probably the last time, and I had another job lined up before I left. I had done my background check and it came back clear and I was assured that I was going to start my training as soon as I got back. 

Long story short, I got back from this trip in mid november to find that the job fell through, and the company wouldn't reply to my phone calls or emails when I reached out to figure out why. So I just chalked it up as a loss and started looking for more work. Since then I've put out well over 100 applications, I'd been calling the businesses after applying to introduce myself, I was emailing some of these businesses asking questions too. I had interviews for a few of them but none of them panned out and I never got any of the jobs I went for. This took a huge toll on my mental health. I decided at that point that maybe going back to school and getting certified in a trade would be a better option and open more doors for me, but found out I still had student debt from the last I was enrolled. (I dropped out due to addiction but have been clean for about 8 years since then) So back to the job hunt I went.

 Also, to backpedal a little bit, while I was on the trip, my then girlfriend was dropping hints that she wanted me to propose, so I ended up doing so, with a ring that was gifted to her by a family member because I loved her, and I wanted to spend my life with her growing and building a strong relationship. She's been voicing concerns about my not having a job since I got back from the trip and I assured her I was trying to find one. She wasn't a saint either though, she had racked up a lot of credit card debt and was still spending money on different credit cards while complaining to me that she had no money and that she couldn't afford to feed the both of us, which I completely understood. For example there was a point where she only had $50 until the end of the next week, but that same week over $200 was spent between Ulta and target, and then another $50 on top of that thrift shopping. And then another time when she traded in a phone for a brand new one, dropping her old carrier and getting stuck with a $500 bill that went to her PARENTS being due to payout the balance on the old phone. 

I completely overlooked that, I saw it as a problem, I told her I saw it as a problem, but I wasn't going to let something like that deter me from being the best partner I could be, regardless of not having a job. Doing the dishes, laundry, cleaning, making the bed, taking the dogs for a walk, cooking dinner, etc when I was there. Just to get thrown away regardless. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do.

Out of my desired age range (26-34), here's my findings from  20M women in the US:

1. Increasing income from &gt;$50k to &gt;$75k reduced eligible mates by ~50%
2. Not having kids was worth about 60%
3. Exercising at least 1 per week was worth about 50%
4. Race preferences were not a huge influence, unless you don't like white
5. If you must be Poly you eliminate 96% of your dating pool
6. If you don't ever want kids, you eliminate 85% of your dating pool

So, knowing the above I can pick what has the best cost-to-benefit ratio.

"So I recently did a show opposite this girl where we played each other’s romantic interests. Now normally I’ve played in these types of roles before and have not caught any feelings towards my scene partners. I’m usually just friendly and always try to be professional.

But this show was different. We had chemistry from the get go; we’d always flirt with each other between scenes, joke around, make each other laugh backstage. She asked me to coffee early in the rehearsal process, and I asked her to grab some food two other times after that.

So it sounds like it’d probably be a good idea to ask her out right? I like her a lot, I think about her all day, and I feel a vibe between us. However, there are a few things I’m worried about.

I broke up with my ex-girlfriend earlier in the rehearsal process (which has been tough but it was for the best as the relationship was really draining), so maybe it might not be a good idea to pursue another girl right after. I also feel like maybe us playing romantic counterparts might’ve led me to becoming attached. Which is why I’m almost leaning towards waiting a few weeks to a month after the show is over before reaching back out to her.

Once we were halfway into tech week the vibe between us suddenly went from really good to her becoming hot and cold all of a sudden. Like she started distancing herself from me really suddenly, taking a while to respond to my texts, etc. But then a week later things were great again; flirting, initiating convo, touching my shoulder/playfighting and overall being playful. And it was like this till closing night. And then all of a sudden during set strike the next morning she was more distant again. So her being hot and cold has been a bit frustrating, but in the case that maybe she’s unsure about her feelings, I don’t want to misinterpret that as being uninterested.

So right now I’m torn between “striking when the iron is hot” and waiting until maybe intense feelings that came from seeing each other subside and then asking when I have a levelhead.

"This year I decided to take more control of my life and quit vaping and drinking all together. 
I’ve been in my professional career for 2 years now and I felt like now was a good time to leave old college habits behind and to start healthier ones. 
I’ve officially quit drinking and vaping for 5 months now! I’m extremely proud of myself and I never thought I would get to this point. I’m finally holding myself accountable and I feel so much better physically and mentally after stopping. 

My boyfriend asked me how he could support me at the beginning of my sobriety journey and I told him that I would really appreciate if he could stop vaping and drinking as much around me to have less temptation to vape or drink. I told him it was his life and his body and I wasn’t demanding him to stop if he wanted to do so around his friends. But he told me he understood and he quit buying vapes and alcohol for around 2 months. 

We found other ways of having fun and we have supportive friends who don’t care if we’re not drinking, so fortunately it didn’t affect our social lives too much.

Recently, I’ve begun to smell fruity stuff coming our closet (it smelt like burnt smoke/stale fruit). I asked him if he smelt the same things I did and he said “no I don’t smell anything, maybe it’s coming from the neighbors.” But it kept happening every time he would leave our closet. I’m not stupid but I let it go. 

The other day we were hanging out with our friends and he chose to have some drinks (I wasn’t upset bc I’m now at the point where I  don’t feel as triggered or tempted to drink) but he got drunk and confessed to me that had bought a vape and started to smoke it around me. He kept apologizing and asking if I was mad at him. I said no because I no longer have the cravings anymore and it was his life. He could do whatever he wants to his body. 

I am upset he kept it a secret from me and I’m starting to think it was maybe disrespectful that I asked him to support me by not vaping or drinking around me originally? or am I just crazy?",I’m upset that my (24f) bf (24m) continues to vape after I told him not to.,18m90qx,1703011149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18m90qx/im_upset_that_my_24f_bf_24m_continues_to_vape/,

Now he’s saying it will be different and I just don’t know if I believe that. Why now?

"why do people always lose interest in me so quickly?

Since I (f28) started dating I’ve been getting a lot of attention from men but it never lasts.
It’s always the same, they always seem to like me and want to get to know me, tell me how great I am, talk about the future and then the replies start getting slower or they go straight to ghosting. 
I had 9 (!!) failed talking stages in this year alone and I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. I tried so many different “strategies”. I tried being myself and it didn’t work, I tried being nonchalant and not care was much - didn’t work. I tried to be upfront about looking for something serious from the start - didn’t work. I tried pretending I wasnt looking  for anything serious…… didn’t work. I tried dressing up and dressing down on dates, I tried paying for the date and letting them pay but nothing seems to work? 

It seems like they just want to jump from talking stage to talking stage always looking for something new.  
It also seems like they lose interest more and more rapidly. In the beginning of my dating journey I was at least able to keep someone interested for a few months, now it’s just a couple of days and then they just ghost? And in the beginning they’re always so keen to talk to me and it’s always them taking initiative too. As soon as the connection starts to deepen they just leave and move on to the next person. Even those who say they’re looking for marriage or a relationship.. 
it’s really discouraging. Whenever I’m starting to warm up to someone and like them and become excited to talk to them, they get turned off. And it’s not like I’m super obsessive or blowing up their phone but it still happens every single time. 
It’s also very mentally draining to always be left with no warning as soon as you start liking someone because you’re constantly mourning the loss of a person you felt a bit connected to. Has anyone else experienced this or am I just super unlikable?

We are open about our past with each other and welcome questions when have them. I asked her two simple questions last night because conversations I was having with a coworker about dating someone that’s “involved” in our line of work. I asked her if she has ever slept with a coworker of mine of if she has slept with a client of hers or a prior inmate.

 
She was honest with me and I apricated it. She told me she hasn’t slept with a deputy, but she has slept with a prior client of hers which was a inmate in the jail I work at.

I told him i saw his profile and he can be honest with me if he’s still using it tho i don’t think I would want to continue seeing him if that’s the case.

"I am not going to list all the bad thing and even horrible things about online dating. I am sure everyone on here already knows them and most have probably experienced at least some of these themselves. I also have a few moral and ethical issues with online dating. So you may be thinking why am I doing the whole online dating thing? Well, I have a really bad social life. And I do not have the kind of courage or temperament to ask out women I do not know. So basically, online dating is my only option to get dates and to try to achieve my primary goal of marrying someday. And yes, I have tried the asking friends, parents, even aunts and uncles to try and help get me dates.   
  
With this ambivalence toward online dating, I have set up a hard list of rules I follow. These rules allow me to use online dating and hopefully meet the right person to date and even marry someday.   
  
For starters I never pay for any apps or online dating sites. Not even a dollar. I refuse to directly pay other people who try to make money off other people's loneliness and the fact that some aspects of our society are broken.  
  
I swipe right on everyone. Well at least every woman. I swipe right as many times a day as I am allowed to for free on every app I am using. I will not play the game where I pick and choose who is worthy to chat with me. Everyone is worthy to chat with me and I am happy to chat with them.   
  
You might be thinking don't I get messages from people whom I have little to zero attraction to? And yes, I do. I chat with them and treat them the way I would treat anyone else. Don't worry if I know I simply have no sexual attraction to them I let them know this (in the kindest way possible). And if they want to keep chatting or getting to know each other great. I have enjoyed that immensely. It is possible a real life friendship could develop. But like I said if I realize after a day or so that I have no interest in going on a date with them I let them know right way. That way I do not force anyone to waste their time with me hopping for a date.   
  
First dates are always just going to be a daytime coffee/tea/hot chocolate date. I never thought I would be a coffee date guy but I really do see the benefits of it and maybe even the necessity of it. I am going to try to expand whom I am willing to go out for coffee with as much as possible. And try to see how well we match in person then. Even if it is just a 20 or 30 minute light coffee talk.   
  
I never list my real height. If the app allows you to not list your height I do that. If the app requires you to post your height I select the shortest height available on the site. Like say 3 foot 2. Obviously as soon as my date sees me in person for the first time and she can decide whether she wants to have further dates or not.  
  
I also never list my job (something super generic like 'worker') if I have to list what my job is. Same goes for money as well.  
  
Those are the big rules I follow that allows me to continue to online date with a clean conscious. ",Do people think I am crazy for having these rules for online dating?,18m7vcg,1703008244.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18m7vcg/do_people_think_i_am_crazy_for_having_these_rules/,

I know I confessed my constant feelings for you and stuff like that. But I know how you feel now. I didn't know before because if I did then things would have been different. I didn't mean to leave you like that. I didn't mean to make it seem like I forgot about you when I did not forget you. I had some good flashbacks to the times we had and how amazing they were.  
  
I am not trying to be the type of guy who comes back after someone they used to date and who used to like him just to use and abuse them.  
  
I am not trying to manipulate you or make you feel bad or sorry for me. In fact, I should be the one who should tell you sorry. I am sorry for everything. I think I am the cause of all of this. It isn't your fault. The whole time I was gone felt like a blur. When I heard that you cried sometimes, it was sad to hear. I didn't know you felt like this. If I did, then I promise you I would have been better.  
  
I know it is too late and the past is the past and I cannot change that. I realized how much I missed you when I finally got the chance to play with you again recently. It was very fun and I enjoyed every second with you.  
  
The overall lack of communication and transparency were honestly some of the main reasons this all unfolded. I wish I could go back and change my past, but I can't do that. I absolutely would if I could.  
  
I don't blame you if you hate me. In fact, with everything you told me, about how you felt and everything, I am extremely surprised that you still even keep in touch and hang out with me after all of this.  
  
You were the best girl I've ever been with. I don't know if you know that or if you believe that but it is very true. The longest relationship I have been in and the most enjoyable! Honestly, whoever gets to be with you is a lucky dude.  
  
Again, I am not trying to manipulate you or make you change your mind. I respect your opinion and decision. I just wrote this letter to you to explain things more.  
  
You are pretty much everything most people I know want in a relationship. You have an amazing personality and never fail to make me happy and have fun.  
  
If you told me how you felt about this stuff before then I would have been more aware and more active. Having one app to contact you makes it a challenge, especially only using that one app (besides IRL stuff) on which I haven't been the most active to say the least lol.  
  
I am not trying to blame you, but I am just trying to tell you the likely reasons why things went the way they did.  
  
I'm so sorry for everything I have done to you and your sister (who was one of my best friends) too since my inactivity affected both of you. I hope I can be forgiven. I am trying to get back to 2021 and 2022 not only with you two but with other friends I made online. I think 2024 will be the closest to those peak years lol. I should be more active and you will see, talk, and hang with me more often. That is if you want to because I am not forcing you to do anything since I don't like to force people to do anything.  
  
School was also a major factor in this. It made me very busy as well as other real-life activities. I graduated high school in May of 2023. Worked hard to get good grades and I did. It was fun and now I am in college lol.  
  
There are so many thoughts about things like ""What if I did not become super inactive?"" And ""how would things have been if this was not in the way?""  
  
I can only think about that but it will likely always and forever remain a mystery.  
  
I want to make things right with you. How can I make things right? What can I do to make you feel better? Is there anything I can bring you or help you with? Please let me know and I will try my best to do that.  
  
I hope this message helped you or was worth the read.  
  
I promise to at least try my best to not repeat the bad things that happened.

"So it’s been about a month, almost two since he initially asked me for my number. We take the same bus, though we don’t often see each other. One day when he saw me he decided to ask for my number and we have chatted everyday ever since. He is nothing like I’m use to (this is a good thing) and he’s four years older than me.

He is not big on texting but if I initiate a text he always responds, and he calls me every night when he travels back home. Whenever we are on the phone we talk for hours, never under 30 mins and he has slowly made me a part of his routine. We have hung out once so far. He took me out to an Italian restaurant and we ended the night in his condo where we gamed for two days straight. I can tell the interest and chemistry is there but I suspect he is an introvert. After our weekend I told him I loved hanging out with him and he said he enjoyed it as well. He likes to be around me but he also likes being alone majority of the time. This isn’t a deal breaker for me because I am often busy (I have a daughter who takes a lot of time from me, obviously) but it’s been a month since we last hung out and he hasn’t initiated or dropped any hints of hanging out again. Our routine hasn’t changed, I was just on the phone with him last night for over 2 hours but I don’t understand why he hasn’t asked to hang out again? 

I’m not sure how to bring this up to him. My daughter is with her father this weekend and I’m hoping he will drop a hint soon because I’m beginning to think he doesn’t want to hang out /:

"So I met this lady recently, she has the most amazing personality I have ever met so far. We have so much in common in unbelievable way that we can even work together. Similar culture background, beliefs, sexual kinks, she is so kind and supportive and wise basically everything I look in a woman for a potential wife . 

The only issue is that she not hot enough like my ex who was a Russian model who was 9/10 and my close friends who range from 7 to 8 but my current gf 6/10 me personally I believe I am 6/10 too however I have attractive personality to attract girls . The issue is that i just cannot stop comparing her beauty. I get instantly hard kissing her and we made love many times but i find it difficult to say you are the most beautiful woman I have seen or give compliments about her look. 
I have seen many beautiful girls with shitty personalities and this is the first time to find a matching personality but the look is so so.

"Hey,

I dated this asian girl for a month from an Asian country I'm from UK. I basically was travelling we met whilst I was backpacking she offered me to come to her city. I went after talking for a few months. 

After spending all our free time together she works everyday so it was limited has a great time but things sounded a bit strange. She would say her mother makes her have a curfew which in the county doesn't sound so unusual.

 But after a month she said she has a child and a husband who she doesn't love. Doesn't speak to and they don't share the same bed. She can't break up with him currently as needs to save and without the childcare for the child she can't work.

She didn't want to get with me but after I pursued her we ended up getting together. I left the area afterwards and we kept talking. I came back but she wouldn't leave him and I wouldnt stay with them together. We came to an agreement she needed time. 

Her family knows about me and her closest friends but no one else even knows she's married. As he got her pregnant and they were made in a way to marry because of culture. 

She says she will leave him in the future when as shes a teacher all classes end for the year as she doesn't want to let them down and once I've made it clear to her family I will be with her for the future.

Her husband hit her and she left him a few years ago but got back because of needing help to look after the child. It's been a few months since I've been away and I'm due to go back soon.

"I(22f) broke up with my first boyfriend(22m) about 3 months ago(we were long distance) and after thinking about it for a long time, i downloaded a dating app and started putting myself out there but it seems like rn is not the time for me to be in a relationship because i still have feelings for my ex and i’m not emotionally available. I went on a few dates with 2 person. The first guy(28m) was sweet but i was not attracted to him. The second guy(23m) seems more interesting and more attractive. Also when i was talking to the second guy that why we are using dating apps and i told him just to meet new people and explore and he told me for the 50% he uses it for the same reason as me and the other 50% he uses it for sex(he was very honest about it, but i got a little awkward when he said that)we met once at a coffeeshop and the conversation was good, i liked him and he also suggested to meet again. We’re both international students, he will be here only until the mid January and i will study here for 1 more year.

So i’ve been thinking and since i’m young and full of life awaiting in front of me, i just want to live in the moment as of right now. I’m not into hookup culture, not my thing. But rn it feels like the perfect time to have a casual sex because the guy i met won’t be here for a long time, i don’t have to see him again and also probably in a few months i will stop feeling this way. Recently, i’ve been also thinking about i feel like i would regret it when i’m over 30 years old and with no interesting experiences in the past like hooking up with someone(dw i’m a person with many hobbies and goals and very active around people) just in sexual aspects, i don’t have any experiences except with my first bf. 

So how do you ask from someone to have a casual sex? i feel so awkward about it.

"So I’ve been talking to this guy for almost a month now. Texting all day and FaceTiming some nights. He lives 6 hours away in my hometown and we’re both in college. I met him when he came to one my college’s football games. So i came to my hometown a few days ago and we’ve been planning for Monday to be the day we were going to hang out. Sunday night i asked him what the plan was and he pretty much asked when i was free, i told him, and he said okay. I still didn’t know what the plan was. Monday comes and we were talking but i still didn’t know what the plan was so i asked again. He pretty much said that he was really busy helping his mom with their business stuff and wouldn’t be done until 7:30-8. That’s kind of late for a date and i assumed he’d have something planned earlier since he initially told me he was free Monday but i said it was fine. Then at 8:30 he said “yea i cant hang tonight do not hate me pls”. I was annoyed and disappointed because i had been asking all day what we were doing and felt that i couldn’t really make plans with anyone else bc i thought we’d be hanging out. Anyways i liked his message and the rest of the convo went like this:
Him: u hate me

Me: No i don’t I’m just disappointed bc i was looking forward to us hanging out before i left for my trip

Him: wait when do you leave for your trip - i thought u left not soon

Me: i leave *hometown* on Thursday

Him: okay how bout wednesday we go to the park? what do ya sayyy :) 
(don’t hate me)

Basically, idk what to do. He sent that last night and it’s the morning and i still haven’t replied. I really do like this guy for some reason and i usually don’t get like this with guys. The fact that we’ve even been talking for this long, especially having not met in person is really unusual for me. But i also feel like I’m not being prioritized. I usually wouldn’t mind a park date but it’s cold and he fucked up our first date so i just feel he should be redeeming himself and the park is not it. I could really use some unbiased opinions.

"I (M33) was with my wife (F33) for the last 20 years. Long story short, she is asking for a divorce because she realized she is gay.

In my efforts to get over her more quickly, I decided to sign up for Facebook dating and Tinder. I know I need to spend a lot of time on myself before I even consider serious dating. But I figure talking to some women on apps would help to distract from the shitshow that is going on in my separation and impending divorce.

"Long story short, I met someone online in October who I became strongly attracted to (which is rare). We also are very supportive of each other since we're going through rough times.

I have asked them out twice. The first time, I didn't know he had a partner and that was that. The second time (which may have been unnecessary), I asked after he was flirting with me and said he was thinking of splitting from his partner. Playing this back in my head, I realize he was flirting while having a partner which is 😬. I asked if he wanted to be with me and that he could take as much time as he needed to heal his heart (probably bad timing as well). His response was that he has feelings for me, but not enough to act on them. I don't know what that means...


I haven't been in a relationship, but I'm sure this intense feeling I have is love. I want to be the best that I can be for the both of us. I want to accept all of his good and bad for what they are and love tf outta him. If there is anyone who'd be my life long partner, I'd want it to be him (or someone like him).

I would love for him to say yes. Though, if he gives me a straight up no/not interested, I can stop those feelings of love for him and stay as friends.

To be more details, I found out that there is a strange female name in his contact list while he just saved like 5 contacts in his phone. I asked him and he said it is a friend in his group but he assumed that he isn't even close to her, just saved her phone just in case, he's just close to other guys who he doesn't even save their contacts. When i asked why he had her phone number, he said she just shared her document in their group including her phone number and he thought he should save, it was nothing. He deleted her number right then, I kinda belief in him but still watching. I noticed that he searched her facebook and instagram after that and her name is still on the search tab, he said it was just random. There are more clues i noticed that she usually tag him in group chat and usually sent icons after what he texts. I asked him that if this girl has ever known about me and he said he mentioned once. I tried to tell him to keep distance with her because I think girls who don't keep distance to other's boyfriends are considered as pmg. Then, a week ago we fought and he said to me that ""you're suck a pick me girl, not my friend"" 
This crossed my line, i had to break up with him but I'm still sad, feeling unconfidient after all. Tbh, i sneak peak to his instagram account and saw he added her number again as well as search her name on search tab.

"So I was seeing this girl I met on hinge last year in the fall. I broke it off around this time last year, and ended up reaching out again earlier this year and long story short, we sort of picked back up dating for a couple months but never really having a conversation about what we were doing. Over the course of the second leg of dating, I sort of rediscovered why I had broken it off to begin with, and I don’t think we’re a good match long term. Part of that is she plans to move in half a year.

The tricky thing is that she’s not a huge texter, and after we saw each other last, I didn’t hear from her for like 10 days, after which we exchanged a couple texts and snaps throughout the next couple weeks. She went on a conference trip and we haven’t really been texting. So it’s been like 2 weeks since we’ve communicated and like a month or so since we’ve seen each other. All in all it seems like the writing is on the wall, but it feels so awkward to me to not have a breakup convo. Am I supposed to reach out suddenly after multiple weeks and say it’s not working (obviously) or do I just let it be? I feel like ghosting has a place in dating but also just innately feels bad.

I’d like to put myself back out there but I do definitely feel like it would be scummy without an official split, even though it’s been this long communication drought &amp; we never had a talk about exclusivity in the first place. I do feel like it’s on me to say something though but I have no idea what that’s supposed to look like in a situation like this.

It was going really well.  We are super honest with eachother about everything, which is something I really value.  I've grown a lot because of it.

Then randomly one day she calls me crying and is afraid to speak her mind.  I find out that she was drinking wine and watching romantic movies, and she started second-guessing if our connection was real.  She told me it's a pattern.  She fell for her ex in a very similar way, and then stopped feeling.  She says I am a much healthier partner than he was, and I check off a lot if boxes, but that she still pulled back emotionally.

She had also had an issue in the past where she would fall for people, but they wouldn't fall for her.  And then they would mistreat her and play with her.  She's definitely traumatized from that.  Also, turns out she's been through a lot of men this way, and that sex was a way of feeling like she was ""adding value"".

I've also recognized that she is used to being emotionally abused.  Things like, if I lost something and spent like an hour to find it, she was surprised that I didn't take it out on her.

All of this are things she is aware of and speaks to.  And now she says that she thinks because I have been a healthy partner that she's pulling away.  I've heard of stuff like this, but don't have experience with it.

She said ""I love you"" first.  But now she wants to be friends. She booked a flight to come see me for New Years and see where it goes.

Hi! I just went on a super fun date with a guy who could potentially be right for me. But he talks like a girl. I think I have a lower voice than him. I'm worried about the sexual/chemistry dynamic bcz I don't want to be the masculine figure in a relationship.

Guys with high voices out there: are you gay? Or is this completely separate and just a stereotypical assumption?

"I was resting between sets and suddenly this girl approached me and asked for help with the most basic thing ever - to adjust the angle to flat on a fitness bench. Now, I think she's a regular since I've been seeing her somewhat regularly during summer, and I've seen her use a flat bench for hip thrusts multiple times.

Could that have been her attempt at initiating a convo with me? There were plenty of other people around us, but she chose to come to me, smiling and everything. She didn't say anything else other than if I could adjust the bench for her, but did she want me to start a convo with her?

Everything I've described took place a little over a month ago. Since then, I've only met her once (I go in the morning she goes in the evening) which was 2 days ago. She was exercising on a bench right next to me, and I had the perfect opportunity to talk to her, but I ended up not doing anything because I lacked the cojones.

"I’m 19m in uni. I met a girl in one of my classes. We would chat for a few minutes almost everyday before our class.

"Starting to care less now about things. I was talking with someone off of Hinge, we moved to text. I was matching her energy when it came to texts. We chatted literally all day. I even apologized for sending all many texts earlier in the day and she said it was cool that she texts a lot too. Now, I'm not a great texter, stresses me out but we were talking about things that I have huge interests in and I didn't want to seem uninterested. Anyways it seemed like a good first day of texting.

The second day it slowed down, was overnight a lot and didn't want to come off as boring. By late evening I sent a few too many. I had a few..a lot of drinks that night and probably should have stayed off my phone but I did make that stupid mistake. 

The next day I didn't hear from her. The following day she said while she texts a lot she felt like she needed space from the amount I text and felt overwhelmed and since she felt that she basically wanted to part ways and wished me the best. I mirrored the sentiments and apologized. I accepted that I fucked up when I didn't hear from her on that third day. I didn't dwell on it and told myself okay we're getting closer to finding that person. She has a lot of interests that I share and it was fun for once to actually have someone chat with me the way she did. I've never experienced that, I don't talk to a lot of women.

I woke up today kinda wishing we could still chat, I'm all for slowing down the communication and not rushing things. Not a big texter anyway. Idk what's too much or too little. Sometimes in the moment I could get excited and overdo it. I'll probably accept the L and move on but part of me wants to reach out later on to see if reconnecting is on the table. I'll never text while drinking ever again lol.","Wondering if I should just let this go, probably will",18m3up6,1702997960.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18m3up6/wondering_if_i_should_just_let_this_go_probably/,

"I've been talking to a girl for about a month, everything was great and we regularly talked at school. We've been on 3 dates and vibe really well. After the 3rd date (which she initiated, I asked the first two times) which was past weekend she has become kind of distant and uninterested. Texting really dry and taking long to respond and in school we previously often just met on the hallway but I feel like she is avoiding it. We talked today and it was only a brief chat.

Now winter break is coming and I asked her if she wanted to go on a date but she said she didn't have any time which is weird because we talked about our plans for the holidays before and it sounded like she had quite  bit of free time.

It could be that I'm just overthinking it, especially because I know there is a lot of other not so nice personal stuff going on in her life right now.

However I want clarity before going in the break. I thought about asking her and telling her that she should just say if she doesn't want to meet anymore, and that would work great if this actually is the case. It would hurt but be better than wondering what's wrong the entire holidays. But if it is her personal stuff it would be kind of akward making this about me when there is more important stuff for her right now.

"She was a part of an old friend group I used to hang out with a few years ago. We never hung out or talked to each other 1 on 1 or outside of that group. Recently we started messaging each other and hanging out after she reached out to me on social media. The thing is we live in separate states so I never really saw any point in pursuing anything. 

Because of that I never saw a point in making a move when we did hang out. But she decided to invite me on a trip out of country just her and I. The trip didn’t work out due to scheduling but I was planning a solo trip a few months later and decided to invite her because I was interested in possibly seeing where this could go. She said yes and now we’re on the trip 

I can admit the trip so far wouldn’t have been as fun if she wasn’t here. Throughout the trip we connected really well and I started gaining a bigger interest in her. She even invited me to visit her where she lives  and stay there for a weekend. But I was picking up the vibe (through conversation and lack of physical contact on her end) she only viewed me as a friend. Which I knew was a possibility. So I’ve just been focusing on making the most of the time and having fun. We’re mostly through the trip and now she’s talking to me about the guys she’s into and asking me advice about them.

Thanks for being here and giving any well rounded opinions or advice 

I (25F) started seeing a guy (27M) for almost 4 months now. the first 2 1/2 months very consistent with calling me every night and seeing eachother once if not twice a week, usually staying the weekends with each other. 

after about 3 months we had a minor issue that caused some rift (imo normal for progression of a relationship) long story short he said he was coming to my house and didn’t. I got upset about this as it wasn’t the first time he had went back on plans but the fact that he said he was coming and then went ghost for 3 hours brought cause for me to be upset. I said something the next day and he said sorry that’s about it but didn’t talk to me for about a week after. I texted him 4 days into not talking and we texted about it back and forth. he wasn’t responding but once every 24 hours or so (mind you before this we talked everyday on the phone) after the not talking/a text every day or so for a week he calls me and we talk through things. he made clear in this conversation that we’re not dating but he really liked me a lot. 

today is about 2-3 weeks post this happening above. now he doesn’t call but once a week or so to see me or I text him and ask him to come over and he does. I’ve still seen him just as frequent we just don’t talk in between. 

i’m having a hard time understanding if this is him deciding he doesn’t want to pursue a relationship with me or if he’s just stepping back to gather himself as a person and make a decision. I keep trying to hold out and just see what happens with this but it’s hard for me bc I have been on the back burner my whole life in relationships and I will not accept that or wait around on someone else to make up their mind about me. but I also have a hard time calling it off bc in my head - if I give him some time, since he’s still around, he might come back closer - you never know what someone is going through and people operate differently, the grace I give to this causes me to not really know what’s going on and as you guys will say “talk to him” I try, the man is very slow to open. on top of all that - it’s been 3/4 months and it takes a lifetime to know someone and it’s been such a short period of time, and i’ve been single consistently 3 years, idk what to think about any of it.

"The guy I've been dating (29m) gave me (33f) a copy of his apartment key to keep. 
I told my best friends and they screamed. They said that's a huge deal. I've only had 1 relationship, it lasted 16 years. I dont know what the hell I'm doing and in too embarrassed to ask this guy to spell it out for me. What does this mean? 

I don't know if its anxious attachment, my history of being love bombed, or self esteem issues but I had convinced myself he wasn't serious about me because he hasn't made me his girlfriend or said he loves me (its really early for that). We've been out 11 times in less than 2 months, see each other every weekend (sometimes more). He buys me things, says sweet things. Sends me money for transportation. 

In terms of communication...We determined we were exclusive 4 dates ago (I asked if he was dating, he said he has no time for anyone else and laughed, i asked if he was sleeping with anyone else and he said no). I think I made it clear to him I was only seeing him, he's never explicitly asked me. I think he just assumes. My stuff is all over his apartment (earrings, hair ties), so I know he really is just seeing me there lol. I once asked him if he has feelings for me and he laughed and looked at me in disbelief and said 'you're joking right this is our 8th date'. He's also mentioned how if he just wanted sex, he could be with a girl in his city and wouldn't be seeing a girl who lived an hour away. He has a point. 

Anyway. That's how it's going. I need him to spell it out for me but he's just really not that type of guy. But he takes care of me and now I have access to his literal home.

"I (32M) have been dating (pretty much wholly via Bumble) for around 12 months following a pretty shitty end to a 4 year relationship around 15 months ago. I'm bald, (greying) black beard, 5'11, lost a load of muscle in the last 18 months but still slim and wirey.

My dating's been quite intermittent - I was very active at the start of 2023 but have gone through numerous, often several month at a time, periods of deleting the apps. I got a lot of attention initially but think after tweaking my profile a bit too much, I've lost whatever that initial cause of success was. I reckon I've probably had 25-30ish significant conversations on Bumble in that time, maybe 15 that progressed to WhatsApp, and probably around 8 dates. Sometimes it's clear they lose interest in me but genuinely I often lose interest for various reasons (just realise they aren't actually my type, I've struggled intermittently with depression for the last 18+ months and haven't thought it fair to drop that on someone etc.). There's been a couple of dates where I've ended up having sex but I'm genuinely interested more in finding a connection and relationship. Most of the dates I've had (bar one which she clearly didn't enjoy but I did) either I've ended things or it's been mutual.

Just over a week ago I was half-arsing Bumble again, I'd just finished talking to a girl around my age due to realising I CBA with being the one instigating all the dialogue anymore and I didn't really like how quickly she was sending dirty and suggestive pics. The same evening I got a notification that 41F (right at the top of my age bracket) had liked me. I wasn't sure she looked my type but matched and long story short, over about a week I became intoxicated by this woman. I was talking via Bumble and WhatsApp for a few days and had a 2.5 hour video call with her (at her request) before we went on a date last Saturday.

We went to a chain restaurant for a bottomless brunch before a bunch of other bars/pubs and a Christmas market. I felt like I'd known this woman way longer than 8 days and found her so easy to talk to. She made me feel so good about myself and told me how attractive I was and that my profile pics didn't do me justice and that she liked my teeth (my worst and most self-conscious feature as there are some small gaps and I certainly don't have an influencer smile). There was lots of passionate kissing and she commented a lot on what she liked about me etc. The night ended when we realised my last train had been cancelled. 

I offered to get an Uber (which would have been astronomical) but she insisted on me going back to hers despite saying that she didn't want us to have sex on a first date and if we went back, she knew we'd end up having sex.

We did go back and she did end up instigating sex. I've had occasional issues with ED and between that, being somewhat drunk, the condom (pretty much all my previous partners from my ex onwards have had the implant or been on the pill) and honestly really liking this woman and not just wanting this to be a ONS, it didn't work out too well. We later went to sleep but I woke up with her again instigating sex but I didn't want to disappoint again so just gave her head (she said before we even met up that she hasn't had an orgasm in 5+ years though and despite my best efforts I wasn't able to achieve this either).

We went back to sleep and cuddled and chatted in bed in the morning. She dropped me at the train station and despite thinking how well everything had gone, I just felt that something was off. I knew she was going to her friends party later but the comms definitely dropped. I messaged her a couple of times yesterday in the morning and got distant replies before I just asked her when I could see her again. She came back with this 

""You’re such a lovely guy, which makes this even harder, but unfortunately I’m just not feeling it. Annoyingly I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly, but I feel like something is missing. I have been thinking about it a lot as it’s such a shame to let a good one go. I thought about maybe seeing you again but I can’t see me changing my mind so I think it’s better all round just to draw a line under it. I’m really genuinely sorry. The right girl is out there for you somewhere, but sadly it’s just not me xx""

I messaged back basically just saying how disappointed I was but thanks for the good time and being up front with me etc. and she came back with this:

""I'm really sorry. I’m quite annoyed by it all! It’s just bloody typical, a genuine guy is finally into me and I just can’t get to that place. Urgh!!

I’m quite damaged from a lot of bad treatment by guys so I just struggle I think!

You are a lovely guy though, so keep doing what you’re doing! x""

I'm honestly just so dejected. I feel ridiculous saying it and I know I can be prone to get attached quickly but this is the only woman in over a year, perhaps even longer given the state of my last actual relationship that I've actually thought 'yeah, this could definitely be right for me' about. I enjoyed her company so much that knowing any chance of anything more is over is actually so painful. I respect it has to be a two way thing but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

I guess I'm just looking for an outlet here so apologies for the long post but what have I done wrong here? Is there any glaring fault or ick on my part from what I've described? Is it really just that I'm 'too nice' for her given previous relationships where she's been conditioned against that (she has been cheated on, controlled etc numerous times including by her ex husband)? I have been told similar before. Can she not cope with someone who doesn't treat her like that, but what does 'too nice' even mean, is it a euphemism for some other shortcoming? I find the 'keep doing what you're doing' line particularly hard to swallow given that it didn't work for her.

Deep down I struggle a lot with self-confidence, self-worth etc. but do a pretty good job of masking it generally. I felt in a pretty decent place before matching her and on top of the world when I was talking/with her.

"Hey all.

Last week I (23 m) met a girl (23 f) at a holiday party and she gave me her contact information. In a previous post I mentioned I was nervous to ask her out but eventually I just sucked it up and did it. I said “Hey! I thought we really hit it off at the party and would love to get to know you some more” and offered a place and time to meet. She enthusiastically agreed and we met up, and I thought it was an awesome time. We both had to go back home for the holidays, but we’ve already made plans to grab Ethiopian food when we return. We had great chemistry in person and getting to know her was super nice. 

There’s some indications I’m seeing that she is interested. When we went out, neither of us touched or looked at our phones the entire time. We ended up going for an hour longer than anticipated and at the end she mentioned how the time flew. Right before she gave me her contact info, she said she has yet to download any dating apps and had asked me if I had used dating apps in the area (we are both new down here) and I expressed my frustration with using them here, which made me wonder if she was tacitly gauging my relationship status. The content of her texts are full paragraphs with smiley faces and emoticons, so I also appreciate she has put effort into them. Also, we made definitive plans for next time instead of just saying “let’s do this again” which makes me think she actively does want to see me more. She was very attentive to our conversation, she asked me a lot about my life and she would bring up things I had off handedly mentioned 20 minutes prior to inquire more about them. It made me feel very appreciated by her. I also have tried to make my intentions explicit. I said I was super excited to see her again, called our next time “going out,” and both things have been responded to positively.

Only thing that’s getting to me so far is there are little things that are making me wonder is she also viewed this romantically. Firstly, I covered for our drinks, but she Venmo’d me back the money for it, and when I offered to cover for our next outing she said that would not be necessary. She was playful about it and said “haha found your venmo &gt;:)” when she sent it. I know some girls don’t like to have others pay for their dates but I was just unsure of what to make of that. Secondly, texting is not a constant. We texted only 2 times since Wednesday, she takes a while to respond, and she kind of left me on read the other day. We talked about hiking and I sent a text about how I liked hiking in high school and asked if she was a big hiker at home, but that was the end of the conversation and I never got a response. This is slightly less of a concern for me as I have only seen her in person twice and known her for about a week, and I am trying to not come off as a creep or overbearing. I guess this is just from my only dating experiences being online, where texting is the basis of interaction and people communicate their level of interest through text. The content of all the texts has been great so far, with a lot of effort on both sides, but it’s just something that’s thrown me for a loop after 2+ years of only online dating.

Am I going crazy or is there romantic interest here? I am planning to rip the bandaid off at our next outing. I was either going to do so by making sure to call our next outing a date beforehand, or just being candid and expressing how I feel at the end if it all goes well, but I haven’t decided which would be better to do.

"I(32f) have been with my ex husband for almost 14 years and finally left because of mental abuse. I have emotional trauma and have zero confidence from it. 

I met someone at my job and we’ve been hanging out for a few months and have a great time every single time. Even if we’re just sitting in the car listening to music and talking. He texts me after every get together to tell me how much of a good time he had and he is always complimenting me. He makes it a point to see me at least once a week outside of work. 

With my trauma I can seem very closed off, and I’m terrified of rejection, so I have a hard time “making a move” or being flirty. He’s made jokes about it but also said he would love to help me heal and open me back up. He’s extremely respectful and kind. 

I really want to be more flirty and show him I’m interested more before he thinks I’m not because we haven’t even kissed yet. We hold hands and he will put his arm around me.  But I get bad anxiety thinking about it and i think I’m not attractive enough and my brain can’t wrap around the fact a decent guy may actually like me.  We haven’t discussed being anything serious, haven’t added on any type of social media and sometimes I can’t tell if he has intentions to be exclusive or what the situation is.

"Some quick advice for women who use the term emotional intelligence when complaining about men in the dating pool.  I understand your frustration.  But, it's a two-way street.  Women also have to learn how men work emotionally.  Because men are socialized to not speak of their emotions it's actually a harder task for women to figure men out.  They have no chance if they don't accept that they have a role to play in expanding they're own EQ.  Classic examples are women getting upset when men get angry with another man and inserting themselves into the situation by telling them to stop.  That feels nullifying and can escalate the situation.  Also, insecure women who want men to talk more because they're missing all kind of other cues about how he's feeling or what he's thinking.  I took a road trip with a friend.  We chatted the first 45 minutes.  We then stopped, snacked, nodded off.  Sat in silence.  Resumed the conversation two states later, right where left off.  We had a great time and briefly touched on some things women would find to be relevant.

A few years ago I went on tinder, made a profile and after swiping the whole town I got 0 conversations and stopped. I also tried bars and going to clubs and such but I feel very awkward there and I got shut down pretty hard.

so how the important thing is that lately i have come to notice that we don't really have many shared interests and that we're completely different persons and that isn't really satisfying as i for one prefer having meaningful conversations which we barely do. so i decided to call him up and talk to him. he again, responsed in a plain, meh energy and that actually was a bit sad considering the fact that i can totally breakup with him before I move out of here next year and find someone with whom i can have meaningful conversations with but it's only because of him that I want to try. but that's understandable ofc as he had a long day but yk there's another thing it's just that he complains soooooooo much I don't know i am already missing the entire point i am sorry i just can't deal with it anymore ifkfmcmfmmg but okay wait *phew*

"So I went on a date with this lovely guy, spent hours hitting it off. Wasn’t completely certain if he was romantically sparked or not, however we shared a few pecks on the lips and he gently stroked and held my hand as we parted. 

As someone that has been out of the dating game for a while I was expecting the post date silence for a few days to see if he’d like to meet up again. However, I was happily surprised when he sent me a text a few hours later to say ‘let’s find a time soon to get dinner and drinks’. 

Knowing he has a crazy work life working night shift for the next few days and again from Christmas until  New Year’s Day I figured I’d suggest having a little walk and a coffee, something casual and not overly time consuming given it will be Christmas Eve and kept the option open for dinner and drinks when works for him. 

His response like most of his texts was quite brief and lacking emotion with this such one saying ‘Sunday is an unknown at this stage’. 

I realise that he may obviously be keen to do other things like see family, however I thought a brief hour would be nice given the length of the holidays and as he is a bad texter (not pushing the conversation along much) that communication may drop off before we’d be able to see each other again for a second date. 


My question is how as an emotive texter that tries to display enthusiasm in tone respond and match the energy of someone like this?

I feel that I need to match the nonchalant energy to save myself appearing too eager.

"I was seeing someone for about 2 months, it started amazingly, we both wanted a long-term relationship but it ended sadly because we couldn't solve some issues: he had a few ex-partner and ex-fwbs close, whom he referred to as ""precious"" and ""roots of his life"" (but at the same time told me there's barely any contact with them and I shouldn't worry about them), and in the end told me he's afraid he's not good for me and he's not what I want.

After saying goodbye 2 weeks ago, he reached out a few days later with some texts explaining what he meant, that those bonds would have changed over time when in a relationship, but not really anything about getting back together, more like mourning what was lost or justifying it.

Last week he texted again asking if I want to travel with him for Christmas. Traveling for Christmas was what he asked several times while we were dating and I had told him if we're in a relationship we can make plans and travel together, not if we're not. I told him the same thing when he asked it over text last week and he said something like ""then we have a week to make it work"" and ""I want us to be a couple"". I thought he was regretting his previous actions and choices, but he didn't say anything like that, it felt more like he was giving me a chance to regret mine.

The text conversation didn't go the best, it seemed like he was avoiding subjects and changing topics, not giving clear answers (which was what I always disliked about him and told him several times). So in the end I told him the main issue I see between us right now is ""communication"", he needs to work on that and this is not something to talk over text. I said he should take the next couple of weeks to think and reflect and I'll do the same and then we'll have a talk in person. He liked the idea and agreed. I asked him if we are exclusive and staying exclusive, to be on the same page. He didn't give a clear answer (again, like always), I assumed it was a ""no"", which made me super sad but I still don't know if he really meant no (or maybe I'm giving myself false hope). There was silence then.

Last night he texted again telling me what he's booked for the holidays and asking if I really don't want to join him, not as a couple yet but as friends!

I haven't replied yet. I really don't know what to think or how to think and what to do. The logical part of me tells me he's lonely and only looking for someone to spend the holidays with, and I'm the closest easiest one. Probably his ""precious"" friends or whoever he had on his mind when he didn't say a firm yes to staying exclusive didn't have time for him and that's why he's asking me.

The emotional part of me says give it a chance, what's there to lose, maybe this trip will actually bring us closer and together. The dreamy wishful side of me...

I don't see him putting any effort here. He generally believes in taking life easy and not making it hard/complicated, enjoying the moment and being happy (probably why he's been avoiding the hard talks most of the time).

It's probably super stupid that I'm even spending time thinking about this so much while all he's done is send a couple of text messages. Please tell me how this looks from the outside. Is it worth a chance? Should I give in to my emotional side and go with him? Or should I listen to the logical voice which says he only wants company for the holidays/trip and he's not serious about me? Help me please...

"Hey, so I need some advice. 

My boyfriend and I are long distance. He lives in America and I live in the UK. It's a 5 hour time difference. 

He works a long job with 12 hours 4pm until 4am his time. (9pm until 9am UK time) and he works Saturday, Sunday and Monday with these shifts. The rest of the week he has off. 

I wake up at 9am everyday to be there to talk to him over WhatsApp because I'm generally excited to talk to him and I am always around about my 8pm ready to receive a message that he got to work safe and to talk to him a bit before he starts his shift. 

He doesn't really message me much before he starts work. He didn't used to message me at all before he started work. But I've convinced him to at least message me that he got to work safe. In the morning. I wait for him from 9am until whenever hes arrived home, so we can call or message. Just chat a bit before he goes to sleep. In which, the cycle repeats. 

Sometimes he doesn't really want to message me after his shift either. He's tired. I get it. But I wait all day for him. I enjoy being around him, I enjoy playing games with him. But I really wish he would talk to me more. I am always on time, waiting for him to message at the scheduled times before and after work. 

But then I get frustrated that sometimes he just wants to go to sleep. So he works over the weekend. Tuesday he wants all day to sleep. Wednesday he wants to have that day for hanging out with friends and family. So that leaves only Thursday and Friday for us to actually do something together. Even on those days. I ask him to wake up at 3pm his time for me. Which is my 8pm. Sometimes, he can't manage that and wakes up at 9 or 10 my time. In which I normally sleep around 11. 

Him waking up later, causes me to get stressed and upset because I want to hang out with him. But he spends the day sleeping for 10+ hours and wakes up too late for me to really have time with him. So I normally get mad at him, I only get 3 or 4 hours with him if I'm lucky. Other then that, we can't communicate because he's asleep or at work. He's not even the best communicator by letting me know what's going on. 

This guy is my form of happiness. I get so excited to see him. To be around him and I know he loves me a lot. I'm just finding it difficult that we can't communicate much. I want more love from him. But I don't want to demand it. 

I don't know what to do. Do I leave him alone for the weekend and learn to be less dependent of him and not be here on the minute that he might wake up or get home from work. Do I keep messaging him as I am? Do I keep waiting just to get sad when he tells me he just wants to go to sleep? Or get on with my own thing as if he will never get online on his days off? 

This is upsetting me and I don't know what to do. We've met irl and it was the most amazing time we have ever had. We love each other a lot. I'm just finding the time zone and his work hours hard. Especially because he doesn't really want to talk much on Tuesday or Wednesday. 

Can't he just message me on those days? Or at least try and make a bit of time for me? Even just an hour of video call?

" io (F25) studio all’università e attualmente non sto lavorando (mi sto dedicando agli ultimi esami e per una mia scelta ho deciso di non lavorare per qualche mese) vivo in casa con i miei; a inizio dell’anno i miei genitori si sono separati e mi sono trasferita con mia madre e i miei due fratelli maggiori in un’altra casa più piccola…appunto condivido ora la camera con mia madre, invece lui (M26) lavora e vive con i suoi e ha camera sua.
Ci vediamo domenica e lunedì, durante la settimana non riusciamo a vederci (se non rare volte) per impegni universitari e per i suoi orari lavorativi.lui  lavora in un negozio inizia alle nove ma finisce alle sette di sera e non abitiamo nemmeno vicini abitiamo a 30 km di distanza…
Stiamo assieme da circa otto anni, con alti e bassi come ogni relazione, ma negli ultimi 2/3 anni abbiamo iniziato ad avere problemi nella sfera sessuale.ovvero sono sempre io a prendere l’iniziativa, lui raramente lo fa… anche banalmente a proporre nuove cose,giochi di ruolo, o farsi bella per l’altra persona. io e lui né abbiamo già parlato molte volte, ma la sua risposta è sempre stessa “ io ci tengo a te, e vorrei farlo anche più spesso. Cercherò di impegnarmi di più…”
Anche perché quello che mi viene da pensare è che se io non prendo l’iniziativa finiremmo per non farlo per mesi …
Non dovete pensare che ogni volta che gli propongo di farlo finiamo per farlo davvero, magari fosse così, un sacco di volte almeno la metà o più finisco per avere dei rifiuti. Mi dice che è stanco, che lo faremo stasera e poi finisce per rimandarlo al mattino seguente e così via e poi arriva la settimana dopo; questo è un ciclo che si ripete.
Vivendo entrambi con i genitori e in più quest’ultimo anno io condivido la stanza con mia madre (casa mia è off limits) l’unico luogo in cui possiamo farlo è a casa sua.
Inoltre, sua madre ha subito un intervento a settembre quindi per un periodo indeterminato rimarrà a casa e in più sta soffrendo di ansia sociale ed esce raramente, a gennaio dovrà subire un altro intervento.
Da qualche mese non siamo più da soli a casa sua e non lo saremo per un bel po’,Non riusciamo più ad avere privacy…ma quello prima non era un problema riuscivamo a farlo anche con i suoi presenti in casa semplicemente cercavamo di essere più silenziosi possibile ma ora lui sta soffrendo d’ansia che si senta anche il minimo rumore e quindi non riesce a concentrarsi è distratto e io lo percepisco e, ovviamente, finisce per passarmi quest’ansia e non mi godo più il momento.
Per i suoi orari lavorativi finisce,che quando ci vediamo dobbiamo fare un sacco di commissioni e non stiamo fermi un attimo e forse l’unico momento in cui potremmo essere soli a Casa non riusciamo sfruttarlo.
Alla fine da ottobre non siamo più riusciti a fare sesso, Ci siamo fatti forse una sveltina a novembre di 10 minuti scarsi perché poi dovevamo già uscire.
Questa situazione mi sta pesando molto, sono molto frustrata e non so cosa fare .

"I’m 29F and dating a 33M. 
It’s been going well and he’s been very intentional with me and reassuring. We are exclusive but when I bought that up he was l surprised that i would think that he was not being exclusive. We didn’t get into a long conversation about it but basically i got the understanding that he never would have felt the need for that step because it was understood based on how we were with each other that we weren’t seeing anyone else. I agree that I don’t care about the step of being exclusive (it just came up in a practical setting not an emotional conversation setting), but I do care about the label of boyfriend/girlfriend and it’s important that he would ask me. 

I don’t have an issue with being direct and talking to him about the fact that this is important to me and when he thinks we are ready I expect him to bring it up and ask, but I also am just really looking for any other way to bring this up casually and not seem like I’m hinting about wanting to have a dtr conversation.  I feel like it ruins the romance a bit for me to have to ask for this, but I still want him to know that he does need to ask me if that’s wants. And im not sure if he hasn’t brought it up because he’s not ready or because he assumes he doesn’t need to and that’s is really what is weighing on me now even as I try to be present.

They never want to share their life with me. 

No matter how much I take care of myself, and work on myself, and raise my values, I always end up in the same situation. People ask me why I’m single, but I am just no one’s favourite person. People do like me, but not enough to be one of their favourite people. 

I don’t have any family members in Canada. I don’t have many close friends. My work is my everything. I probably give off more calm/serious energy than bright/bubbly energy. But that’s me. I don’t hate who I am, and I cannot change who I am. But clearly - I am nobody’s relationship material. I’ve always ended up being used, and I don’t know how to live the rest of my life like this.. 

Today I found that the man I have liked for 2 years got a girlfriend. He chased me very hard enough to surprise other people around me, but then he also said he didn’t want a relationship, and there he goes - he now has it. 

I have a home, job, career, hobbies, and I think I really take care of myself, but I feel that there’s a roof in the sky that I can never break. I don’t know how to live the rest of my life alone. No one has been serious with me for 7 years, and I think I’ll just live alone until I die alone. I do have a therapist, but my life feels same. Lonely and dark.

"For two months now I’ve had a huge crush on this regular customer at the McDonald’s I work at. This is the first crush I’ve ever had at 21 years old. I don’t even know his name.

It’s going to go absolutely nowhere because I’m like 270 lbs and he’s a thin ass Timmy Chalamet lookin mf and like idk. I’m not ugly, but it’s the weight issue. This has quite literally inspired me to be on a health kick ever since this started. 

For a month I haven’t seen him and then yesterday I was serving some fries through the window to these two girls, and then, the back window rolled down and it was HIM and he asked if the fries were fresh. Not in an asshole way. I got so nervous that I said yes even though I wasn’t sure. I wish so badly I was like hold up let me actually make some fresh for you. Then I also would’ve seen him again. 

Then tonight he came inside and unfortunately his mobile order had to be changed because we were cleaning the frappe machine. I handed him his replacement items and I was so jittery. He asked me if they were really cleaning the machine and I assured him we were (again; not in an asshole way, it was actually a rly valid question)

Dudes I’m so frustrated. Realistically I know nothing will happen. Does it mean something that he asked himself about the fries? He could’ve asked the people in the front seat to ask me. He has to recognize me because he used to come through all the time. He also asked me specifically about the frappe thing, as if someone else would’ve lied about it. He also always tells me to have a good night before I can even say it to him.

"Had two good dates with a girl and was excited to go on a third. The vibe and conversation were good and wanted to get to know her more. Had some hesitations but nothing too concerning. We started to plan the date and she really wanted to grab dinner at this college bar she went to. The idea of going to a college bar for dinner didn't sound appealing but seems like it's something that's important.

Anyway, get to place and it looked liked a college bar albeit recently remodeled. We sit down, have a beer and order shitty cheeseburgers. The next forty five minutes I can hardly get a word in and get the almost complete history of the bar and why it's so great (there's one on every campus) in addition to stories of people I've never met or cared about.

After an hour I'm exhausted about hearing about the bar and her college friends. I go to the bathroom and there's a news article that has been framed. The original bar burned down like 7 years and the owners sold the land to the university and an alumni group bought the rights and built a new version in a new location.

"As the title says. My most serious relationship was with a man who love-bombed me in the beginning, I was only like 19 and thought he was just suuuuper in love with me. I had no idea lol. It was a very abusive relationship. 

I've had shorter relationships since then, and they also did a tiny bit of love-bombing, but not as heavy as the first guy. They just wanted to talk to me all the time, hang out whenever free, make future plans *very* early on, etc. 

Since then, I've taken a long time off of dating, and have done tons of research about relationship trauma, red flags, staying safe while dating, stuff like that. I met this really nice guy on Bumble and we went on a first date a few days ago. He planned the second date right there at the first, and said he had a good time talking with me. I like him! 

My problem is, how do I tell if he is interested in me if he doesn't love-bomb me? He is a very respectful person and I got safe vibes from him at the date. But our chats have so far been very normal I suppose. Just getting to know each other. But how do I tell the difference between him being interested and him just wanting to be friends if he isn't toxic and doesn't love-bomb?

I have always been apprehensive about wearing cologne when going on dates out of the fear that the girl may not like the particular fragrance, thus backfiring and turning her off.

"Lots to unpack here. I (20m) have been dating her (18f) for barely a month and honestly don’t know what the goal is long-term. I haven’t communicated any of this to her yet as it’s still so early in the relationship, and I’m trying to get it figured out in my head before I go jumping to conclusions and making any irreversible decisions. 

The first thing is honestly the biggest, although it admittedly seems selfish. My love language is mostly physical, while she is generally made uncomfortable by other people touching her. Not a great pair. We’ve watched a few movies together and on two occasions she’s seemed not opposed to me having my arm around her, but no real “cuddling” or anything or the sort. Whenever we go our own separate way after hanging out or whatever we had been doing, a hug is the most we do (however, this much is consistent and she’s communicated that she normally doesn’t like hugs but is comfortable doing so with me). I obviously respect her boundaries and won’t ever try to force her to do anything she would be uncomfortable with, but at the same time, that affection is essential in my mind. I believe it’s one of the primary things that makes a romantic relationship different from a friendship, and that sort of base level intimacy (cuddling, kissing, etc.), when and where appropriate, is important.

Secondly, she’s very wholesome/innocent. We’re both virgins and plan on staying that way until marriage, which I appreciate since we have similar values, but she does act a bit on the childish side at times as a side effect. For context and justification, she did just graduate high school and we’re both in the military. This is also her first relationship and my third. So maybe it’s just a lack of life experience in a variety of ways, but she seems very distant sometimes.
It’s also worth noting that I have very strong religious values, and she seems almost indifferent in terms of what her partner believes which is mildly concerning. 

Additionally, she is very introverted (I swing both ways depending on the environment) and as a result has a VERY small social circle. She’s been at this base for only about two months and only really has one close friend outside of our relationship, who is also her coworker. And one of my roommates. (Side note, this roommate is nearly 10 years older than her so there’s no concern that they’re fooling around at any point. He’s also a flaming homosexual so it’s double safe)

So, if the situation were more traditional and I had more time to make a final decision using sound logic and reasoning, let’s say I cut ties. Normally, it would be fine, we’d both move on in due time and go on with our lives, business as usual. But this situation is tricky. She is also a very anxious person, and as forementioned only has one other good friend… who lives with me. She can’t stand living on base (new people have to live in dorms on base for several months before getting a housing allowance to live off base) so she’s always at our place. I don’t want to break her, especially since it would be worse than I’ve been broken in the past. Thing is, I don’t even know if I even want to end it at any point or if these are just growing pains/issues/doubts that will go away with time and trust. If it does end up continuing to worsen and I end it, it may also degrade my rep with both my roommate and the community we both work with. 

Another social issue: she’s met my family already and both parties are amiable to the other. I don’t want to have to tell my family “yeah we broke up after x weeks because our time together was basically just a friendship anyway so we’re better off as just friends” and I also don’t want to disappoint her family. I haven’t met them in person yet, but again I would feel terrible as it would destroy her and make me look like the bad guy. 

At this point I’m just looking to get other opinions to help my overthinking brain process everything and make the best decision possible for the both of us. I know my next step is to bring my concerns up in conversation and actually communicate, but there’s obviously a lot more to it. I really did fall in love with this girl, and it’s not like I *want* to end it all over this. I just see strange signs and things that aren’t lining up quite right and it’s genuinely concerning for our future together.

We went on our date, and he chose the place, time, and what we ate after agreeing mutually he complimented me multiple times and also paid for the meal.

She was in a 5 year toxic relationship up until 10 months ago and since then we have gravitated towards each other and talked when out with a large group of people.

After singing karaoke together which she signed us up for, we went back to our house and she immediately went to my room and sat on my bed.

But we crossed paths at some point and decided to talk and he ended up at mine (coz i lived closer to where we met). We exchanged contacts that night and he ended up staying over at my place. We didn’t kiss, or have sex but we did cuddle up (a little bit of touching was involved but nothing really sexual; was rather romantic i would say) in bed and talk most of the night. Later that afternoon, he went home and we started texting over insta. A few days later he decided to see me again and this time, took me on a drive, got ourselves some fast food (coz i hadn’t eaten anything all day) and had it in his car (because i kinda hate eating in public sometimes). Once again, we didn’t kiss or anything that night but we hugged when he was leaving. And then later that weekend, he came over to mine late at night (he was at a bar with his mates but left early to come to mine) and this time we kissed while we were cuddled up in bed and later he f*ngered me. Again we didnt have sex but i told him that i had a history of being s*xually a*saulted in the past year and it’s been tough for me to have sex with anyone after that. After that he was very respectful and told me if I wanted to, i can tell him and he wont unless i tell him to. And we basically cuddled all night with some kissing here and there. Later in the morning when he had to leave, he kissed me goodbye on my lips. And we are still texting and might be hanging out again soon.

Isn't directness, stating your intent and being confident attractive as well though? Or is it more important to build a neutral friendship first? Does it just depend from person to person? Especially interested in answers from women. 
  
For example: 
 
Direct:   
It was nice to meet you, I like your vibe, I find you interesting and cute, it would be good to get to know you more etc.  

Indirect:   
Alluding to flirting and being suggestive whilst still keeping it somewhat light and neutral. Joking, teasing, connecting over shared interests, being somewhat ambigious, and more letting her come to her own conclusions without expressing your own intent too much?",When flirting and creating attraction- is it better to be direct or indirect?,18lsk1x,1702958222.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18lsk1x/when_flirting_and_creating_attraction_is_it/,
"I have been with my now fiancé for almost 3 years. Our anniversary is on December 25th. He had a relationship before ours but it was not very serious, and other than that, he didn’t really date/didn’t have much luck with women. I have always said that he’s the best guy I’ve ever dated. I’ve never felt more loved, appreciated, and respected, and I trusted him more than I’ve ever trusted anyone before. Fast forward to yesterday. I was holding his phone for him when a text came in from a woman whose name I didn’t recognize. My fiancé does not have female friends aside from his coworkers and his best friends’ wives and girlfriends so I did something I never have before and read the messages. There were a lot. No good mornings or good nights but lots of back and forth and some flirty texts too. I asked him who she is and he said she works with him (I found her on LinkedIn and can verify this is true). I then asked him to read all of the messages and he said yes but swore to me that nothing has ever happened. The texts weren’t great but also not awful. Mostly she was flirting with him and he wasn’t really reciprocating but there were a few suspicious texts from him—the only one I can think of off the top of my head is him being out and drinking with coworkers and asking her to come out. I told him I was so disappointed in him and asked him how he could disrespect me like that and he swore that there is nothing more going on but acknowledges that the texts are inappropriate and he already texted her in front of me to tell her they should only talk over email moving forward. Since yesterday I have been crying nonstop and don’t really know what to do. He has been begging for my forgiveness, crying as well, and assuring me that nothing has or would have ever happened between them - he says he considered her a friend as she is also engaged and he speaks to her a lot for work. He also acknowledges that some of the things they said crossed the line but he didn’t mean anything by it and swears to never allow himself or anyone else to get to that level of comfort ever again. He says I’m the love of his love and he hates himself for making me so sad by doing something so stupid and thoughtless. I do believe him but I also can’t stop thinking about how much I trusted him and never thought he would disrespect me like this before I read the texts. I told him it will take time for me to trust him again, and we are going to our first couples therapy session on Friday. Am I being stupid for believing him? What would you do in my situation?","HELP!

"It was a drunken kiss that he initiated after a night at the wine bar.  I have liked him for a long time but believed he only saw me as a friend. In my insecure mind I believed he thought my crush was creepy.

When he kissed me I basically shared every insecurity I had ever had about his potential feelings for me. For example ""why now"", ""I feel like your last choice"" , ""why were you interested in other people"", ""why do you never respond to any of my texts"". 

I had received intel from a mutual friend that he was interested in me in the past, but had started seeing another girl if that helps give context to my questions. I was also drunk... 

He had reasonable responses to all of my questions, but now I fear that I came off as completely insecure and desperate. I believe it was a big turn off for him. 

When I tried to discus it sober, I was able to blame it a little on the alcohol and told him I had been confused about his feelings and read into things too much. But he didn't have much more to say than, ""I didn't know you felt that way"". 

Now I'm thinking a drunken kiss was just that and nothing more.

Is there any way I can come off as less desperate after this debacle. I feel like a total fool and I kinda just want to text him and say ""forget the other night, I just want to be friends"". Cause that would be so much better than forcing him to reject me by asking his feelings. He hasn't shared his feelings, but I feel like the silence and his actions are so loud. This is all so awkward and I just want it to be over, but I don't want to come off as a total loser.

"Ok so I’ve been on 3 dates with a girl now and there is a genuine connection (at least from my end). We both agree on the same things, have the same perspective on relationships, same interests, same political view etc. Basically personality wise a big match. Ever since our first date shes been very very long with replying to texts (she has explained before that this is a bad habit of hers, she even once sent me a screenshot of her doing it to friends). Sunday one day after our last date, arguably the most fun we’ve had and she stayed 2 hours longer “cause she had the time” (4pm to 11pm) and we did some wholesome stuff. We went on to walk all evening she met my father and was very enthusiastic about him, we listened to music while sarcastically singing together, basically just wholesome stuff. I asked her at the end of the day if she wanted to do something for Christmas together, she said she was busy (obviously) but she did offer to meet up later on in the Christmas break, even though she was busy with school she said i can make time in an afternoon. Sunday (day after that date) my mom told me she wants to plan stuff in for Christmas Break (next week). So i sent her a text saying “hey my mom just told me she wants to plan stuff in, do you mind sending me your availability so that i don’t make a mistake in planning” but after 1.5 days i still have no response even though she is online all the time (this has happened before but its the fact that its an urgent text why i want to double text) its just frustrating cause an answer to this question makes all my overthinking go away. Like i said before she even said herself before we started dating this is a bad habit of hers. Shall i double text? (did this before by sending an outfit and usually got a response 3 hours later, we still went on a date so it seems she doesn’t care that much about it) and what do i double text? Wait it out?

"In my early 40's and for example Hinge matches me either with women in their early 20's or mid 50's when I'm really only interested in women about 10 yrs younger than me or around the same age as me, also I have a thing for tomboys or women that are into shooting guns, camping or have those similar interests which I've seen a couple on OLD apps but they're mostly flooded out by women promoting their IG profiles lol.

Also, it would seem inappropriate for me to hit on anyone at any sort of social or hobby meetup.

Am I just being picky?  I've never been really into gaming or nerd culture and don't know anything about modern video games or anime, not really into the yuppie Stacy types neither, I liked goth women in my earlier days but that subculture seemed to have fizzled out or I guess everyone just grew out of it.

There really aren't any sort of homesteading or permaculture groups in fn Palm Beach County lol.  The social group I affiliate with are just a small tight group of couples around my age so pretty much everyone that knows one another are already mutually exclusive.

"I met this amazing man, 28, several months ago. We hit it off right away. I really like him. He is very genuine and caring. We were physically after a few dates, but then decided to just remain friends due to where we were at in life at the time. We still continued to hang out, but just as friends, however, I believe we still have some sort of connection and emotional relationship.

Last week, while crying, he told me he thought I was incredible but that he just isn’t ready to commit, therefore he wants a break to reevaluate things. Obviously this hurt because I saw him as a friend too. I do still like him, and if he was open to it, I would 100% pursue more with him. I did tell him before that I have feelings for him. The fact about not having him in my life in any way hurts. But I understand. This is probably one of the most aching situations I’ve been in, including actually relationship break ups.

I think there is a part of me that is delusional and believes we will end up together. But also I am learning how to accept the fact that we may just have to cut ties.

- Anyone been in this situation before?
- Is a break a good thing or a bad thing?

I always initiate first when he’s free, and he normally replies a day later and then we make plans. I just don’t like how he responds a day or two later, but maybe it’s because he’s busy?

we do have great conversation in person and laugh a lot.  He has opened up to me about his family, and work and cultural differences (he is English I am American).

He decided that it was a dealbreaker because my mental health was similar to his previous relationship that he gotten out of as it was traumatic for him and because of that, he decided he does no longer want to pursue a relationship, so I’m not sure if I was wrong for being to transparent and honest about myself so soon.",I think I messed up after my second date,18lqq2q,1702952689.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18lqq2q/i_think_i_messed_up_after_my_second_date/,
"I feel like there is a steady stream of relationship advice out there talking about how to improve/change to better find a partner. Where is the line between becoming more dateable and inherently changing yourself? 

For example I've been told to ""not take it so seriously"" , ""just have fun"", ""don't show too much interest"", ""play the long game"". 

And I do feel that when I don't follow this advice, my potential relationships crash and burn. 

However, I'm not sure I can change these parts of me that maybe share my feelings to early. The part that doesn't just want to have fun with the person I'm interested in but wants feelings to be mutual. The part that doesn't want to play some game to convince someone I'm cool enough to like.

But is this what must be done? Or have I just had a series of bad matches that were never meant to be since they couldn't handle those parts of me?  

Do I need to change? Or do I need to wait for the right one?

"I gave a girl (22f) I have a soft spot for a gift for Xmas, it was a necklace. It wasn’t overly expensive but she’s an Asian exchange student at my uni. 

She’s a pretty popular girl but always makes time for me. The other Xmas gifts she’s got from friends she’s posted on her social media, however with mine she didn’t. She does this with all of her female friends. I know she’s not friends with that many guys at uni (maybe 2) but not as close to them as she is to me. I’m okay with this. 

I’m also aware she’s got a VERY possessive ex who she still talks to every so often (she doesn’t have feelings for him, he was controlling and wouldn’t let her have anyone else close) and they split up not long after she met me. 

However she did send pictures of what I got her to her mother, as well as pictures of us together, they’re aware me and her are good friends and want to meet me if they get the chance.

I guess she’s trying to avoid posting guys on her socials to not aggravate her ex?

"Hi guys, this is the first girl I'm dating. We're both \~ 25 yo, in grad school. I don't know if she's dated before or not. We're in the same department (not same lab), so we've attended the same classes for a year now. Our third date is coming up (after 2 weeks of seeing each other), and I've got some questions.

The first part is something that bothers me a lot, and I was wondering how to bring it up in a friendly/non-offensive way. The first 2 dates we've been on (both on the weekend), she's late by 20 mins - 1st was a restaurant and 2nd was a stroll through a park w/ Christmas lights. Both times she gave me the time to meet. It was really cold at the park, and I was waiting at the entrance for a while. It's a distance from my car, and I would not have been able to see her arrive if I stayed in it. How do I bring it up to her that I value punctuality, especially when she was the one to set it?

While we're both busy with graduate life, I would like that a future partner I may have also values my time. I'm willing to put in effort for a third date, but if she's also late for this one, I don't think I would want to keep trying with her.

Punctuality aside though, I do like her. A common hobby we have is riding our bikes. Would riding our bikes on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning be viable for a third date?

We’ve even hung out with just my cousin and his girlfriend and you could pretty much call that a double date. 

But super recently it kinda switched up. She would be really invested in a conversation I would try to have with her and take long to reply. “Long” as in a day or two or even longer. Got to the point where I didn’t even know what to start for a conversation. I really like this girl and the moments we got to hangout with friends and get out the house a bit were fun while they lasted but now it all kinda just dropped in less than 2 weeks.

"  To give someback story ive known my friend from high school for a couple years now we are not 23. She has always had a history of being super jealous and insecure and lacks boundaires as a result of this she has become a bit jaded. She started dating this dude 2 years ago and at first everything seemed fine. But as time went on i can just tell that they bare extremy codependant and cannot live without each other. I feel like i kind of lost my friend but im not really sad about that because i understand we are adults now and things do change.

  
 I moved to the big city and so she sometimes comes to visit but it seems like evertime she comes to visit or we go out to a bar or anywhere really her boyfriend is always bound to as some point blow up her phone and accuse her of cheating or lying. I recall she posted a picture on instagram of us before going to dinner then he saw that and got upset because he had never seen that dress because it was to short. He basically wasted our night by keeping her on the phone for an hour for damage control. She apologizes then they are back in love again. 

  
The last Time she came we went to a bar i made sure she was comfortable even when guys would talk to us id say we have boyfriends or ask her if she was ok because shes not good with boundaires. Meanwhile she was texing her bf saying i was talking to guys and she would rather die then do that when she was talking to them aswell nothing inaproperiate. Her bf texts her i thought no one would bother you there mind you we are at the bar. On our way home from the bar he called her to bitch at her and ask what she was doing when he had said previously that he had gone to bed. we got home and he proceeded to fight with her for the next 2-3 hours . I offerd for him to pick her up so they could resolve this privatly because im so exsausted of this constantly happening everytime she sleepsover.   
My friend said he was not gonna come hes lazy and just wanted to waste her time being controlling and fighting. It seems like shes not allowed to have fun without him. He tells her things like im runing their relatinship when i point out the truth to her. And when he gets like that she agrees and says yes hes crazy and he wont let me go and cries. He wouldnt pick her up and demanaded that she had to be at his house by noon the next morning when she was still drunk and hungover…he cares more about her following his rules then her own wellbeing to get some rest then they can resolve it. 

  
I pointed out these things to her the next morning but i guess he had already convinced her otherwise because she said that i think i am an expert on their relationahnip and i only see her once a month so i dont know anything and that its not fair that i think they are doomed forever and wont change. She also said it was her fault why she was mad and she gets shellshock when he calls and her and that makes him suspicious. Her bf doesnt like me because i see throiugh his bs and im everything he hates in a woman strong boundaires , independant ect that that threatens him so he doesnt like when she comes to the city to hangout.

"Hey yall. I'm a white washed Filipina living in Toronto, Canada. I have dated 2 guys so far but both did not last really longer than 2 months. I am still quite new to the dating game. One main thing that contributes to this is that I am a 4'9ft or 145cm in height. I understand that my height can make people worry they might be dating someone under the age of 18 which is fair. Sadly, can't change that tho. Not sure if being chubby like a teddy bear could affect that too.

I know they usually say its best to get to know each other first as friends then blossom into something more.

"I made a post a few days ago about the fact that I was about to had my first kiss ever at age 27. It happened! And now I'm more confused than ever. I'm seeing this guy I met on a dating app. In his profile he put something about wanting a long-term relationship. And that is exactly what I want (I put the same on the app). We had a very nice first date, he is a real gentlemen and that makes me happy because it's exactly the way I want to be treated. Not like a princess, but with gentleness and respect.  A bit of chivalry never killed anyone. We got along super well, but I'm thinking there's something about this whole thing. I don't feel particularly excited to talk to him, It's more like a quiet feeling of comfort and tranquility. Is not a total lack of excitement, but it's not what I had in mind before when I thought about love. Mind you that I'm not a complete romantic, I don't particularly believe in love at first sight. But I do believe in a ""spark"" or something like that. I don't know how to identify what I feel for him in that respect. 

So, he's living in another part of the country for a few months, but he'll move next year to the same city as me (that's the location he put on the dating app) so we have been talking almost everyday since the date (this was around a month ago) and we went on a second date a few days ago. We spent almost all day together, and it went almost exactly like the first date in terms of ""vibes"". We talked about more serious stuff, but I can tell he is a bit reserved or shy. He answers whatever I ask, and asks me back, but not always his answers are as elaborated as I want. I don't think this is particularly bad or ""a red flag"", because we don't know each other yet and he seems like an introvert person. I never felt like he's not paying attention or he is put off by something that I say. He is just not as talkative as I am.

So, he kinda tried to kiss me once that day, and we were interrupted by a street artist (seriously), and in another occasion the same day, he tried again and we kissed.  It was a nice kiss, I didn't feel too weird about it. The second time was better. It didn't put me off, but I don't think I'm super excited to kiss him again, is that normal? I feel like I should be more excited, or feel some sort of extra enthusiasm about him physically. Is not that I find him ugly, but I can't understand if I really like him or not. I find myself wondering: if I found him more attractive, I would be asking myself this question? I don't want to waste his time, but we haven't seen each other enough to assume he is head over heels for me, so I don't know if it would be harmless to keep going until I feel more certain? Or should I close things here and be grateful for a good first experience?  I'm wondering if maybe knowing him better would make me want him more physically (again, I'm not disgusted by him or anything, I'm just not particularly excited for him in that way either). I liked when he touched my shoulders and his hands are super nice, what the hell is going on?

"I [25] was a week away with friends and some people I didn't really know at the beginning of the tri.  I quickly started to develop feelings for a girl [20] who was travelling with us. When I first talked with her, everything was fine, but my feelings got quickly extremely strong and I really didn't want to fuck it up with her. But that's where my problems started. I started to have trouble having a real conversation with her and think that I began to act unusual around her. I only managed to explain my feelings and situation after the trip over a text message. But she told me she didn't have the same feelings for me. I at this moment, of course, I was devastated about that, but I thought that I would and have to move on. Since that moment, almost three weeks have passed, and I didn't really move on. I can't get her out of my head and can't kill my feelings for her. I often have the thought about what might have happened when I didn't have my problems and she got to know me how I am really. This and some other thoughts combined with my strong feelings are killing me at the moment and I can't really sleep and it makes me cry every evening. I somehow want to meet here again so I have a chance to show my real personality.  But on the other hand, I also don't want to sound desperate.

"TLDR: Ex-coworker and I admitted we like each other, but he lacks investing in dating. See text exchange at bottom.

More detail: l used to have a huge crush on my coworker. We'll call him Derek. We worked together for about a year and a half, sitting next to each other. 

A few months ago, I had told Derek I liked him. He told me he liked me back, but was unsure about what to do because we work together. He said he doesn't feel comfortable doing anything because we're coworkers. I understood and we were still friendly. Two weeks ago, he left for another job. I thought he'd ask me out after quitting, but that didn't happen.

Now we’ve gone out with mutual friends but he still didn’t ask to hangout alone. So I texted him asking him out! 

His text… seemed SO nonchalant and like he didn’t even care. Should I take this and see to it that he doesn’t care to take dating me seriously and move on? I like him so much 😭 I don’t want it to be the end but I can’t invest in someone who doesn’t invest in me. 

Now, please don’t roast me 😣  I had asked advice to r/AskMen and they called me names and said I was trying to manipulate Derek. This is not my intention, I just want an opinion on the situation.

needless to say I never received anything from him for Christmas because “someone always has my gift” I was thinking about getting him some sneakers he asked for and a ps5 and controller he also asked for.

I (29f) went on a date with this guy (30m) I matched on hinge at the end of October. And we have been consistently hanging out and seeing each other pretty regularly since then. I have lost count at this point. 

We regularly have sleepovers and he has even given me a key to his apartment so I can leave at a later time since he gets up and leaves for work much earlier than me. 

Today almost 2 months into us hanging out I asked him are we exclusive? And he repeated the question back to me and said idk I haven’t really thought about it. I was preparing myself for either a yes and even a no so the unsure as through me for a bit of a loop. I said ok and because I was already in the process for leaving for work and stuff I did leave. But not before we hugged and he kissed me on the forehead and he confirmed if we were still meeting tonight? Yesterday before the talk we had planned to see each other today and the day afterwards. 

Once I left, he did text me and asked if I was ok and I did apologize for catching him a bit off guard and that I was thrown for a bit of a loop by his response and I’m not sure what he thinks. He did say that he was caught off guard a little and that maybe he needs some time to think and asked reschedule for tonight. 

I responded and said ok because I felt it was probably best not to see each other tonight and then followed up with me saying I’m not asking for a boyfriend or girlfriend label at this stage and I am fine with continuing to hang out and getting to know each other but wanted to at least confirm if he was seeing other people as I am currently not interested in that. I also said no pressure if we aren’t on the same page then we aren’t on the same page. He hasn’t responded yet.

"Hello!
I (m, 24) had a date with a neighbour (m, 21)
Info: I live in a residential complex with about 10000 residents.

I texted a guy from Tinder in May and it turned out he was one of my many neighbours.
A few days later we met at a restaurant here. It was really nice, I enjoyed it and we had a lot in common. We were there for about 2 hours. He paid the bill for both of us and then we went for a walk in the park.
After that it was time to say goodbye. He asked me if I want to go to the sauna with him for our next date. I knew what he wanted to do and I told him that it's too early for me personally and I want to go on a normal date once again. I also told him we can go to the sauna together for our third date. I saw that he was kinda pissed and sad afterwards.
Anyways, it was a very nice date and I enjoyed it - except the sauna thing.
In the next couple of days I texted him a few times, but his anwers were always very short and he never started a conversation by himself - it was always me. The day after our date was my birthday. He knew it, because we talked about birthdays on our date. He didn't wish me happy birthday, which made really sad.
I got tired of texting after a few days. It seemed like he lost interest in me.
I never texted or saw him ever again since May.

Now I'm still scared to see him in the neighbourhood every single time i go outside. What should I do if I see him in public?
Should I ignore him? Or should I greet him? I have no idea.
I know I shouldn't be scared to see him, it's just a random guy and somehow still a stranger, who I only met once in my entire life.

"hello! looking for advice on how to approach a conversation. i (29f) matched with a guy (32m) on a dating app and we hit it off by messaging and have been having great, consistent conversation. the conversation turned into sexting shortly after, and we’ve continued to have both natural conversation and sext every day. we won’t be meeting up for a date for another week because of travel. 

our conversation almost explicitly says we’ll be having sex on the first date. but the more i get to know him, i think there’s potential for something serious and i want to get to know him a bit (estimating 2-3 weeks, but will feel it out) before adding sex to the mix.

"Just to preface this, I'm autistic so please go easy on me if I'm a bit unaware of this kind of thing. Thanks.

I have had a crush on this girl for a while now. I thought that she may be attracted to me as she was showing a lot of the signs that she was, so I asked her out. She said yes but later approached me and said that we should go out just as friends. I went out with her anyway and it was great but it's just made me more attracted to her.

There's a few things that make me think I still have a chance with her. One is the just friends thing may have been a question. I panicked and blurted out ""yeah"" as soon as she said it and I can't remember exactly what she said or how she said it. The second thing is I'm not great at showing attraction, I worry she may not know I like her and she wanted to confirm that's how I see her. And lastly we were only talking for about two weeks (I've known her for a lot longer than that mind you) when I asked her, maybe I was just moving too fast?

It's currently the holidays so I'm just wondering if I should spend them moving on and getting over her or keep in touch with her, keeping my feelings for her alive and keep things going next year?

"3 month “situation ship” ended. Do they come back?

My 3 month situation ended today. Was seeing this guy since September. Both of us were out of long term relationships. And agreed to not get too serious too quick. His job, which required him to work late nights and weekends, allowed for us to take things slow. Typically we’d text each other day, not non stop. And we’d see each other weekly/twice a week. But every time we’d see each other, it would typically be late at night, and only to watch a show, followed by hooking up. In the beginning, we’d go on a few dates. But I did notice lately, effort on his end was dwindling. I took it as him being super busy with work and stressed. 

At one point, around 2 months, I asked him if he liked the pace we were going. He was very vague about it. But said yes. And asked me how I would want to progress things. I said simply by seeing each other more and doing things other than late night sleepovers. And he agreed. He informed me that at the beginning of the new year, he’d be able to since work would slow down.

Well this morning. He informed me that he “doesn’t feel the spark.” And doesn’t think it would come back like it did in the beginning. Yet, still felt attracted to me and comfortable being with me. He asked how I felt, and I said I agreed somewhat that the spark dwindled. But also wasn’t ready to throw in the towel since we only really know each other in the confines of each others apartments. And that we had a lot to still learn about each other in different environments. He did agree with me. And also thought the same. But said he was afraid the spark still wouldn’t return, and we’d have the same conversation again.

 I told him I liked him and wanted to continue on, but only if he wanted to. As I was not about to force him to be with me or beg him. He suggested a “break.” Which I wasn’t fond of. I asked when this “break” would end, as I do not want to be left hanging. And he said “you’re right, let’s just end it.” 

And that was that. I do not plan on reaching out. I kept my calm and remained stoic.

We are both confident and comfortable with each other, but haven’t shared a kiss since the first drunken night.

I think he might like me back because during the date he indirectly told me he was single and he asked me if I was seeing anyone, to which I said no. I also asked him to go see a band we both like next year so he should know I'm interested in spending more alone time with him. We continued to text after the date but since he went home for the holidays he hasn't replied to my texts despite watching my instagram stories. (He's always been a slow texter but when he does respond he seems really engaged and always asks me follow up questions, compliments me, shows me he remembers little details about me etc. The point is there aren't any red flags except for the slow texting.)

Today I went out alone with another uni friend (21M) who I've known since I started uni 3 months ago. We've both friendzoned each other and I'm actually helping him look for a girlfriend. I posted a picture together with him on my instagram story: it was a mirror selfie at a merch store, there wasn't any physical contact between us in the photo, I was standing slightly in front of him. However, a lot of my friends asked me if he was my boyfriend and one friend told me it looked like we were dating. I initially laughed it off at first and thought that it's because I come from an Asian culture where a girl and guy hanging out alone might hint at a more intimate relationship, and since my crush is European I thought it would be more normal to have male-female friendships and not have it mean we might be dating. But eventually I got annoyed and worried at the amount of people asking me if we were dating and I also got paranoid that my crush might think I was playing games with him to make him jealous. So I deleted the story, but my crush has already seen it. Do you think he will think I'm playing games and be turned off? Or since I already told him I'm single 5 days ago would he just brush it off and trust me when I said I'm not seeing anyone?

"*Reposting because I accidentally posted this on the wrong account* 

I currently work 2 jobs, my weekday job and my weekend job (cost of living crisis is real). I’ve been at my weekend job for about 2 years and there is a male colleague who I really like and I think he might like me too? 

I’m a receptionist but he’ll always stop and chat to me, and if he has to go and do work he’ll tell me that he has to go and do something and when he’ll be back. He always asks me lots of questions about my life, offers to buy me coffees and will come and stand behind the desk to talk to me whereas most people will talk to me across the desk (aka getting in my personal space, which I don’t mind). His job requires confidence and charisma but he always gets shy and awkward around me. 

We have a really significant age gap -just over 10 years but it’s not my first rodeo with older men and I want to ask him out, but I’m nervous and don’t want things to be awkward at work.

I only do one shift a week there so it wouldn’t be the end of the world if he said no, but I can’t tell if he likes me or is just being friendly. Do I have enough evidence to say that asking him out is a good idea or should I just leave it?

"Hi all, question is pretty much the title -- but here's some additional context to flesh my question out.

I (male) recently moved back to the large city where I went to college after several years of living out of state. Last week, I was invited out by two women I've known through mutual friends since college -- usually we really only hung out now and then together with said friends, but they heard I moved back recently and invited me to get dinner &amp; go to an event they were attending, also got drinks after as well. It was us and a few of their other friends who I didn't know, all of them living about an hour away.

Anyway, while talking I came to learn that one of these two casual acquaintances actually moved back to said city I'm now in in the last year as well, very close to both my place and a street I frequent because it has a lot of bars / restaurants / businesses I love -- we got to talking about our favorites, there was some mention of ""we should go together!"" etc, generally good conversation. I figured hey, even though I'm not ""new"" to this city, most of the people I know have since moved away so I certainly won't turn down an opportunity to make it a genuine friendship with this girl, vs previously where we mostly just hung out via mutual friends.

All that said... I'm wondering if you guys have any advice / experience on possibly turning this into something more. I thought the vibes were great between us that night in a way I'd never felt hanging out before -- most of the other people there were friends of the second acquaintance we were with, such that this first girl &amp; I naturally spent a lot of time talking with each other instead. Lots of laughs, easy conversation, lots of her touching my arm and whatnot while talking. Like I said, also passing mention of how we should hang out, at one point she mentioned having trouble making friends since moving here (in a way that I felt implied she wanted to see me more), and at the end of the night she gave me her number -- mostly under the auspices of sending some photos from the night, but she also kept light conversation going into the next morning.

Anyway, long story short, any advice for gauging if there's something more there vs just friendship? It's not like I'm head-over-heels lovesick for her; mostly just that finally getting to spend some time with her one-on-one made me appreciate that she's cute, fun to talk to, smart, etc. I've had plenty of terrible dating experiences in the last few years, especially with women I've cold-approached in-person / through apps, such that I'm hoping taking a swing with someone I at least know isn't a terrible person would be a better experience. I'm just a bit in my head on how to approach it -- as I said, she already gave me a light yes to hanging out again, but I'm not sure if I should make it a casual thing (like lunch at one of the places we both love) and feel it out from there, or make it a bit more explicit such that she doesn't feel like I'm coming out of nowhere escalating later on. Like I said, I certainly wouldn't mind just being friends if she's not interested in more, but I know sometimes people would rather just cut and run in that case to avoid any potential awkwardness.

"I met this girl a few months ago and find out she used to hook up with a friend of mine. This “friend” is someone I knew for years but we were never close. We just start hanging out this year but I asked him if it’s okay if i pursue her and he said she was just a fling and I’m good. Recently I get a text from her to hangout, nothing has happened b/w us up to this point, and we had a great time.

The next day, my “friend” finds out via my ig story and brings it up. We chatted for a bit, he asked me how it went and I gave some details. Which I never do usually , but I was hoping to get some feedback because hes known her longer than I have. 

The next morning I get a text from her asking did I say stuff that I specifically told my “friend”. I admitted to it and she pretty much cut me off saying I can’t be trusted. Which is fair on her part.

I then confronted my “friend” and he told me his intentions was just to investigate because he found it suspicious that she was trying to hook up with his friends. 

Few questions: 
1) why would “friend” do something like that if he didn’t have feelings for her?
2) should I cut him off?
3) besides keeping my business to myself, what should’ve I done differently?

"Hi guys, I’m 26, female, engaged to my partner of 6 years. Growing up my dad would compliment us for everything when we got ready, our nails, hair, clothes, even if we were just natural. 

And I would actively compliment my dad as well, he grew up in a house of all girls and I just enjoy making people feel good and noticing when they have gotten a hair cut or new clothes for example. 

Because of this, I think I grew up thinking this was normal, my partner does compliment me but when we first started dating it wasn’t something he really did, sadly enough his friends complimented me more and I used to hate it. As the years have gone by he has improved a bit but he doesn’t really notice when I’ve changed things like my nails, hairstyle or when I get ready he doesn’t always notice.

"After several failed relationships and serious dating experiences, I'm going through another broken one. Thinking a lot these days, going over what happened, how it started/evolved/ended.  
I've been complaining why I keep ending up with men who are not emotionally available, who are avoidants, who don't want the relationship and closeness I want. Today I realised all of those might have been me (too)!

I read something on Instagram that made me think about this. It was something like ""if you're constantly attracting emotionally unavailable people look at how you yourself might be emotionally unavailable"", and that made me think and think and think... In my latest dating attempt, things started amazingly, not like any other start. I went with the flow, but a part of me was constantly worried, scared, hesitant, doubtful, cautious. Mainly because of his past, for a while I had to fight the thought that he was a player. We spent long wonderful hours together, I was there, but not entirely. I wanted all in, but I wasn't really being all in. I wanted more, but it was me who was holding back! It was my fears. Fear of uncertainty, losing control, becoming emotionally attached, and the biggest fear which was ending up heartbroken.

As an anxiously attached person with fear of abandonment and not the best self esteem, knowing how hard and deep I would love and care once I'm there and how broken I would be if it doesn't work out, I was constantly scared of things ending. Being in a committed long-term (hopefully life-long) relationship is what I want. But every time he mentioned ""becoming a couple"", my brain went directly to what I saw as ""blockers"" between us: the things which were not as I wanted them to be. Creating scenarios in my head and overthinking and feeling even more scared of all the things that might happen in the future. What if I'm not enough for him? What if he doesn't make me feel safe and secure over time? What if I cannot trust him as I wish to? What if he thinks I'm too much? What if he doesn't want the same closeness I want? What if the excitement wears off after sometime and he cannot cope with the real me, the boring me, the sick me, the depressed me (life is not always happy days afterall)? What if he falls back into his old habits of casually dating and meeting random people and hooking up and cheats on me? What if he generally never wants to get married while I do? What if he wants to have a third person in the relationship or have an open relationship because he said he's not entirely ruling it out now for the rest of his life? What if he's still after his ex because he said he never loses hope and he would still like to sleep with her and maybe someday the existing issues won't be there anymore? What if he's just looking for something temporary to not be alone and I'm the closest easiest one? What if ... What if ... What if ...

I did mention some of them to him briefly, naively hoping for some clarity or answers. He was not the most secure available man either, holding back, raising questions in my head, vaguely saying things about the future that would show incompatibility from now on. Maybe he was also partially to blame for not giving me clear answers and communicating clearly what his intentions were and what his chain of thoughts were when I asked or for not being patient enough when we had discussions or for not being open to repairing after conflicts. All of which left me more scared and hesitant. Every time he said ""why do you make it so complicated? why do you think so much? it's just a relationship, it's not getting married right away!"", I had more fear and insecurity. Now I'm thinking maybe he was right and I shouldn't have put so much thought into it, maybe I should have just jumped in when he said ""relationship"" instead of having a hundred thoughts on my mind... But is that really how it's supposed to start?

I thought I was protecting myself from getting hurt again and having to start all over again in my mid 30s. But now I'm thinking of all the times I could have just jumped in blindly, risking it and seeing what time brings. Is that how it should be done? Is that how people start relationships? Was I looking for too much safety and security and assurance too early? I have been questioning myself so much these days. I don't know what he's doing, maybe he's already seeing other people although we said we'll talk again in a couple of weeks, but he didn't sound like he was going to stay exclusive, which is another fear of mine now: how could he move on so quickly? Was he really only looking for not being alone and have company for the holiday time? He did ask me to join him on a trip after splitting up...

I don't know what to think or do anymore. I've been thinking a lot, I've been trying to talk with a therapist but it seems impossible to find a spot. I've been talking with a couple of friends but they cannot help much either. I'm blaming myself a lot, thinking I was the avoidant one here, I was the emotionally unavailable one, I was the one holding back when he wanted us to take a step forward despite the uncertain unknown future.

I(26M) had an argument with someone that was going to be my potential long term partner but she just recently kept telling me she was going to leave but not to leave out she kept asking me if I wanted her gone but I reassured her. Then back to the argument part that happened early morning she left because I just stood my ground and felt as if I couldn’t have a voice and it should be respected for both parties and seemed like she didn’t care. I was respectful and calm till she kept telling me she wanted a better man and so I allowed her to have the option to go and just escalated when she just kept repeating the same thing so I walked her out with her things.

Anyways long story short, I met this girl recently and we really hit it off. I don’t kiss or have sex on the first date. She said she doesnt either. 

We had great laughs, conversations, and we held hands and stuff. Shes the first girl to give me butterflies or a spark in years. So at the end of the date i told her, that i had a great time, that i dont care if shes seeing other people and i let her know that i’d be deleting the dating app - indicating that she didn’t have to. She told me she doesn’t have any dates planned but she would like to take it slow. Obviously it would’ve been nice for her to say she would delete the app too but she didn’t. We held hands and enjoyed the rest of our date, i told her to text me when she gets home and she did, also saying that she had a good time. I said i did too and from here no response back.

We planned everything and it was basically supposed to be rlly cute and just basic couple stuff and she always reminded me how close is the date getting and how excited she is BUT three days before the date she texted me rlly excitedly that after my driving lession I should text her and that i better be safe. And I knew something was off since she called me a different nickname than she usually did and after I came home she texted me that she doesnt want anything and doesnt feel anything and shes sorry for vibing with me like this even tho she said she never met anyone like me that im the most special person ever. She basically said that she isnt looking for any type of commitment and that and that its better to block each other and go no contact and blocked me everywhere.

So i just planning on sleeping with him. during the time we hung out, it actually turned out to be really nice, we talked for hours we even took a cute polaroid.  but after he left, he kept texting me and we continued to text for the next couple of months, sending cute pictures, asking about our days, and how we slept. I evetually asked him why he kept texting with me, his reply was that he really liked talking with me. so we kept text and asked me if  I wanted to play a few video games online with him. Eventually he told me he put in a request to where I live. I was really starting to catch feelings, but that scared me so, I told him I wanted something serious and someone to be here with me. but he said he couldnt right now cause he lived across the country and is in the military so it wasn't guaranteed to be transferred there. mind you, when we were first talking he said he really liked me  and that he wanted to do the distance but, I said I didnt want to after the trauma of my ex boyfriend.

I see her again and we start talking more and she leaves early and then requests to follow my on Instagram. I then dm her later that day and end up getting her number. 

After I get her number we start texting and after about a week. I decide to ask her out. But she says “I’d love to say yes but I recently got out of a relationship so I gotta chill for a bit. Thank you for asking tho” 

But after that we end up seeing each other like every other day during the week for the rest of the semester and talk about whatever and it kept on happening. 

Now that we are in Christmas break and live in different states. We already planned on doing the same thing next semester. 

She sends mixed messages like coming out to get a drink with me and then leaving me on read when we text and like ghosting me.

I’m in therapy and have been for years, and feel at least somewhat self-aware about how that trauma affects me and my relationships both past and present.

Another time this guy I was seeing for months but not exclusively (this was communicated and we were on the same page) had a lot of really deep, vulnerable talks about our lives, and I told him about my past. Prior to me telling him, he shared about his past drug abuse and rehab. Before I shared anything, I asked him point blank if he wanted to know because he wanted to understand me better, or if he was asking about my past only because he shared his. After that he really backed off and basically ghosted me like 3 weeks later, which hurt.  My most recent boyfriend I never even told, partly because he did some pretty triggering things, hence why he is my ex-boyfriend among other reasons.

And we had few ""interactions"" where I was like ""is he flirting?"" ...

And just the other day he literally jumped from behind me and tried to squeeze his bag over my head while I was busy typing something on the computer, literally suffocating me, it made me so angry afterwards that I hit him with a paper... he laughed.

It's not like he spends all day everyday texting me.. he hasn't yet asked for my number !  nor that he is a social media stalker (he is not much into social media to begin with), he hasn't made a ""move"", nor asked me anything about my private life.
One day showed me a girl's photo and said look how pretty she is, and I was like ""okay?""... yet he made no comment after that. 
The other day he did make a casual comment about him being single  (he said something like - I wish I had a girlfriend to care about me when I am sick..).. yet afterwards nothing... Nada !

"Started seeing this woman (26f), off Tinder around early November. She came on strong initially, writing me first and asking about a time we could hangout. After four attempts to set a date to hang, she just didn’t seem interested all of a sudden. Always busy or tired. 

I wrote after two weeks of little communication and said I was respectfully bowing out and that I wished her well. She asked why- I told her because she went from hyper interested to barely any response in two weeks and that if she’s busy, or no longer interested, I don’t want her to feel like she has to let me down. 

She appeared bummed and asked if we could try again. I said sure. We met for coffee a day later. Instant chemistry and sexual attraction. She makes it clear she wants something more steady and relationship oriented. We met again a few days later for cocktails, almost having sex in her car and she’s all over me. It was wonderful. We decide to make sex the first time special. Thanksgiving happens and again, I wrote her and didn’t hear anything back for 9 days. Finally she replies and I had once again sort of moved on, even though my feelings were a little hurt. She explains that she’s busy with work and her band (she’s in 3 bands). I simply say “no problem, thanks for letting me know” and she initiates another hangout for a week later. After we set the next hangout we didn’t text at all. The day before the date, I confirm and ask if it’s on- no response. I send one more text saying I need to know because I do have a schedule and would appreciate the respect for my time, and hers. 

Three hours later she replies “yes, tmmr see you then!” (We had yet to set any meet up plans). I ask her where she’d like to go- we meet for drinks and end up at my house. She informs me she doesn’t want to have sex and we just cuddle. I was stoked. Well, ten min later she grabs my hand and has me grab her ass under her jeans. She’s moaning like it’s one long orgasm. It was kind of odd. She hops on me and we have pretty much stellar sex. She leaves, no communication for 4-5 days. Nothing. I wrote her asking if I did something and she goes with the “been busy” excuse. I ask what she thinks our relationship is because she says she wants something serious but kinda ghosted me for a week. She got offended and made it clear she’s “vibing and having fun right now” and doesn’t want to be tied down. I decide to just not pursue farther despite being heavily attracted and I definitely caught feelings. She invited me to concert her band was playing, I go. She barely hugs me or says anything to me the whole show. I leave after her bands set and she seemed sad, “you’re leaving? Oh! Well, hit me up soon, we need to go have dinner or something!” 

Two days later she writes- “on my way to Arizona for a few band gigs. Miss you, wish you could come ☺️” 

But every time I ask to hang, she’s always busy and takes days to reply.

"hey guys, I've been dating this guy - let's call him jay - for two weeks now.
we matched on tinder, where he chose the ""long term, open to short"" option. he asked for my insta pretty quickly and we continued texting there. since then we've met twice and we're great when we're together. last time he stayed overnight.

after the first date I noticed his profile disappeared from my tinder matches. he said he deleted the app and showed me the next time because it randomly came up.

his texting habits confuse me. sometimes he answers within a couple of minutes and sometimes it takes hours for him to answer. he's been sick for a week now and now he texts me like 1-2 times a day, last text was saturday. 

I'm very insecure so I texted him before that if he was no longer interested he could just tell me, no worries. he apologized and said he's extremely sick. afterwards we continued texting and he told me that the both of us need to get better quickly (I've also gotten sick) because he missed me. 

so it's a constant roller coaster with jay. sometimes he's saying cute stuff and then the next second it takes a whole day for him to answer, leaving me in the dark. 

last time we saw each other I also asked him what he's doing all day that takes him ages to text and he couldn't really give me an answer except for ""nothing much"". jay also said that in previous relationships this has been a problem as well. he explained that most of the time he doesn't feel like texting.

now I am a person who likes to text a lot when I like someone. is not feeling like texting (for hours to days) actually a thing or am I getting played? cause I feel like I am.",is he a bad at texting or is there something going on?,18lgtyc,1702926831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18lgtyc/is_he_a_bad_at_texting_or_is_there_something/,
"Seriously it’s anxiety inducing and stressful more than talking to them face to face. I spend long periods of times going through my message figuring out what to change and worrying how it can be perceived as something wrong. For example my ex canceled on a plan and I replied with “it’s alright” and that short small answer led her to think I was pissed about it thus causing a fight between us. In my new relationship, I’m always stressing over what to text to her. And when I do and she takes a little too long to answer I get anxious that she must’ve took it the wrong way and is now ghosting me. I understand people are busy sometimes but I can’t help but think of the other possibility.

"I (31F)am pretty independent. I'm introverted, have my own place, and overall, not particularly affected by what people think (unless I notice a trend in feedback, then I'll take it more seriously).

I was talking to someone about this and how in my last two relationships, the guys basically said they didnt feel needed. When I was in my early 20s, I was in an LTR in which I did **not** get that feedback. but I thought about it, and at the time, I really did need him. I was lost in terms of my career and had some fracturing going on within my friendships after college. He was so amazing in supporting me through that, guiding me, giving me advice that I took, and am glad I did. So in that case, it's fair to say I did need him, and that he felt needed. I just want to say, I'm not someone who is always talking about how independent I am, a career woman (I have a career but it's not an aggressive, highly involved one), gets made at chivalry, etc. I do often say I'm introverted, because thats true. 

I just want to say, I totally understand this desire and in fact, I think it's rooted in a good place of wanting to provide ""value"" to my life. I appreciate that, and I want to nurture and ""fulfill"" it.

However, I am older now, more established, more introverted, more self sufficient. I am trying think of ways I can make the guys I date feel more needed. My first failed attempt was trying to express this through sex, because that is indeed something they can provide for me that I cant provide for myself, so to speak. but I quickly learned that didnt quite solve the problem.

I'm dating someone now that I like and he pretty much expressed the same. So I did actually ask for his help getting a Xmas tree, for his thoughts on a work politics problem I had. i worry it's not enough. I mean I have a lot of stuff around the house I could use help on, like you know, fixing broken stuff. but like sex, I dont think actual tasks address the problem either, and indeed, it feels weird asking. I think the ""needs"" in question are more of an emotional nature, not so much like installing a faucet (I dont expect that, I'm just thinking about possible ways to address this)

Please don't take this as good or bad. its just an observation, and also, a generalization, so its not the case for everyone. I have observed that a lot of guys sort of like ""wounded puppies."" its coming from a good place...they want to help, be needed, maybe have some form ""savior"" complex (again, these words have connotations, because they are often spoken about in extremities. but I dont think it's a bad thing and can actually be rooted in good motivations).

"M20 like friend a lot f20

I think I am going to send this message, is this a bad idea? 

Long story short, I am best friends with a girl at uni and we do everything together. She’s also my housemates sister (who’s one of my closest mates), but I’ve known them both equally as long so it’s not weird when I’m with her but not him and vice versa, we also have the same interests and do same stuff with our days so everyone (including our friendship group , as we are all part of same one, her, her brother and me ) kinda expects us to be together.. 

I recently have started to like her which I didn’t think I would. We have a lot of fun together but I am entirely out of her league and she has lots of other options. But we complement each other so well, have the same life goals/plans, enjoy each others company etc etc. I know her parents well also and we get on amazingly. 
I am contemplating saying something to her that I’ve started to like her as we get on so well, but I’m 99.9% sure it would be a no from her side and I don’t want to risk ruining my relationship with both her, and her brother (my best mate).. 

But honestly, we’re like two peas in a pod, just one is ever so slightly (a lot..) more attractive .. 
whenever she sees boys who are bad for her and treat her badly, I can’t stand it because I know I would treat her so well and we’d have such a great time.

"I,(M19) fell in love with this girl (f19) and we ended up dating for 6 months. She was everything I’ve ever wanted desired and more. The reciprocation was huge. This relationship was getting serious! I had been her best friend for 6 years previous to dating her. The 6 months I spent romantically with her were the greatest times in my lifetime. But just recently we broke up. It all started on Halloween. I woke up to a horrible mood. The sadness of this Halloween irked me. I was being a negative Nancy. I know, but this was the first Halloween with no friends or candy or anything so I was pretty upset. I had also recently gotten a job and unfortunate events just kept stacking up with that. It was one of those days… She came over and it brightened my mood but I’m pretty sure It was just distracting me because over time I just started feeling so shitty about the day. It was like my brain was telling me what a bad day it was but realistically it was fine. 

Anyways… it was later on in the day when kids just started to trick or treat, me and (F19) were chillin in my living room doing nothing. I had nothing planned because I was just upset about the whole Halloween thing. But this did not help my mentality at all. I was stuck in my head and really probably did not look approachable?

 She recommended we go to Walmart get some candy and snacks and watch movies and I was instantly down for it. We got up and left. Whenever I’m very upset I love to take it out with a nice fast car drive with the windows down and music blasting it takes the shit out of my head. She did not like this at all she actually was very scared and thought I was going to crash. This was not the case. I knew I had full confidence and control of this vehicle but it is understandable that she didn’t know that. She did not say anything about her being scared of the way I drive until we broke up. 

So when we got to Walmart I had started to rethink about my job and how I would have to work on my birthday and I was just getting stuck in my brain. My behavior really scared her and I didn’t even know it did. 3 weeks later is when she told me she can’t do it anymore because she cannot handle me acting like that ever again. Which is understandable but I really just wished she communicated that with me sooner. 

When we broke up she told me I was perfect in every way shape and form except for Halloween night. I was accepting, but fuck man in my head I was so angry at myself for acting that way, really wanted to make a Time Machine. She told me she needs time for herself to charge her battery and get her help and wants me to get my help I need which I am getting. I just want to know if there is a chance of me and her getting back together as she told me after time she would be up to the idea. It’s been 3 weeks since we’ve broken up. Ive been on a 2 week hiatus from her.

"I'll put you in context: She (20) and I (22) knew each other by sight but we had never spoken until a little over a month ago. She was the one who approached me to study for an exam on a subject that we both repeated, to which I accepted (but without the intention of flirting, just studying). In the end we ended up getting to know each other instead of studying. From that moment she already showed interest in me.

  
The conversation flowed as the days went by until she asked me to meet outside the university for dinner one day. I was surprised by her initiative and even more so when she told me that if it was needed she would go to the city where I live (she has a driver's license and I don't). Everything was perfect and we even had our first kiss (and also my first kiss in my life, yes, I know I'm a little late). We had a great time and I saw her attracted to me, so I wanted to get to know her more.  
The days passed and we started making daily video calls and meeting more often.

  
So far so good, until I screwed up a week ago by asking her ""what are we?"". She got nervous and didn't answer me; I realized that what I did was stupid because these kinds of things happen on their own and, besides, we had been meeting for a month. I guess at that moment I already felt in love and since I've never gotten this far on dating I got too motivated.  
Later she sent me a voicemail saying that she had been thinking about that question and that she liked me and loved me but that she didn't want any kind of relationship because of the commitment that comes with it and that she also needs her own time alone.  
I tried to tell her that being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to be there for the other person all the time and we all need our alone time, but she continued with the same answer.  
I tried to dodge the bullet that I had fired at myself (I refer to the question) and we continued to meet up even so and she let me know at all times that she liked me (even before the first meeting to ""study"") and there have been multiple dates and kisses.

  
Until suddenly, last Saturday she tells me that she feels strange, ""as if she had an empty heart."" I got worried and wanted to talk to her to support but she didn't want to talk.  


Today she sent me an audio explaining that she was still mulling over the question of what we are and that last Saturday she noticed that she was in love with me and at the same time she started crying because she didn't want to go any further and according to her, that ""it would end badly"", commenting that he previously had a bad time because of this type of thing.  
  
I know that when they usually tell you the typical thing of ""I like you but I'm not ready for a relationship"" it is usually a subtle rejection but I don't know how to react to this because she is the one who showed more interest from the beginning, even after the awkward question.

  
I'd like to know your point of view about this story because right now I'm a little devastated and I don't know how to act; Whether to give ourselves some time (taking advantage of the fact that it's Christmas holidays and due to work issues we won't be able to see each other until second week of January), whether to leave each other as friends or move on...",She shows great interest in me but doesn't want a relationship.,18lg437,1702925089.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18lg437/she_shows_great_interest_in_me_but_doesnt_want_a/,

"I went on a date in August with this girl I met at speed dating. We had instant connection and we went out on a date. We talked for like hours like 8 hours straight. Even after the date we kept on talking. We went on a second date and it was even better. Again spent like 8 hours and before she left, she grabbed ,e and kissed me and she said she didn’t wanna leave at the end of the date even though she had to things to do after. Anyways the next day I told her how I felt and how I liked she kissing me on the cheek as well, though that was romantic. She texted me a day later, saying she doesn’t see it going more than that. Her exact wording was “we have a strong mental connection, but do not feel a strong enough romantic connection to offer more than a friendship.”

Not gonna lie, I took it hard. I mean I’ve been on dates and been in relationship and situationship, where I never felt this strong. It’s just I was left so confused with the entire situation. Who goes and shows that much emotion and then just disappears. We did talk after and we were supposed to meet up, but she cancelled and never rescheduled. I did know that she came off a long term relationship of 7 years like 6 months before we met, but I just can’t stop thinking about her. Like I see her in my dreams sometimes and all the dates I’ve be on since do not feel close to what I felt with her.

"Well, if either of them see this post the ages will give it away!

My ex and I were together for less than two years and broke up nearly two years ago - we've remained friends (we were friends before dating) and have both had other relationships since ours ended. 

I don't need to recap the morality of dating friends' exes or exes friends because I have been SO judgmental and strict about that throughout life - I think unless it's love then it should not be done as there are so many people in the world - and on the same token usually you won't know it's love unless you've already crossed a line! 

Well, my ex has a friend (let's call him Y) and after a rocky start (we would often argue) we are now friends - whenever we see each other it is pretty much always with my ex around or in a group - and I realised a few months ago that I have a crush on Y. I pushed it aside because of my feelings about friends and exes etc and thought the feelings would lessen as I have never lusted after someone who did not want me or that I couldn't date before - I would always get over it very quickly. 

That hasn't happened here, and instead of being turned off by knowing him more and seeing his 'flaws', I feel like I am in love with him or at least have very strong feelings for him. We do not flirt or anything like that but I have noticed that I often am getting upset or feeling down by the fact that I cannot tell him how I feel. I usually am very upfront when I like someone so this is completely alien to me.

I am at the point where I desperately want to tell him. I have no idea if he likes me romantically at all, I also suspect he has a similar line about friends and exes etc so I'm not sure he'd even admit it if he did. However, how do I go about this?

I feel like the moral way would be to tell my ex before I speak to Y, however, there is also part of me that thinks I am being selfish doing that because there's a massive likelihood Y does not feel the same so why pre-warn my ex and cause him stress or discomfort for no reason?

I know the most 'moral' thing is to do nothing about this, but I feel like I am going to burst and I have cried thinking about how much I want to be with him and show him he is loved so I think I'm past the point of doing nothing. 

I prefer being honest and I am totally and utterly afraid about this whole thing but I just don't know what to do. Any men I meet I compare to Y, he is everything I am looking for and I want to talk to him all the time (which is rare for me).

Any advice would be appreciated. If you think I should do nothing then I understand and generally agree but please be kind about that in the comments as I already feel awful about this entire thing.

"I met someone abroad, and we really liked each other. We're trying to make a long distance thing out of it, but she's got an extreme case of ADHD.

Texting is impossible, I might get a response within a minute or within literal days - and there seems to be no clear pattern to it. Talking over the phone / facetime works a lot better - ONCE we manage to set up a call, which might need a heads up from my side two days in advance or a call when I happen to catch her being online on her social media. When we talk, I get super clear signs of interest, she opens up about her life, her traumas, her successes at work, ... whatever, and she'll tell me every time that she's sorry she's so hard to reach and that she's trying, even though I don't even talk about the subject anymore. 

I thought she's clearly not interested at first, then I transitioned to a nerve-wracking phase of ""what are those mixed signals"" and now I'm easing into a ""as long as she reassures me she's trying, I guess I just need to give it time and assume she's still trying"". She also has a lot going on right now which I guess is adding to the stress. 

On my side, I don't have much to loose right now. I am loosely seeing someone plus the occasional one night stand here and there, but don't need to make any immediate decisions relationship wise, so I'm fine with giving her attention and space and try to slowly figure out how to make it work - because one thing's clear, I really like her. 

I am hoping that things will pick up speed once we get to see each other again in about a month, which should also be the start of a more regular visiting schedule. At the same time, whilst I have no doubts about her as a person at all relationship wise, I do have some doubts about the long term run -  right now, I am quite happy to be dating someone a bit distanced, as I have a lot of work and social events.

I really like her and she likes me, but as of now, I'm still seeing other people, even though I think she's the one I want to be with.

Last night we were talking and she said that she has to confess that she went on a coffee date with some guy that she planned a while ago and that nothing happened and that she didn't even like him but felt bad to cancel on him.

"Hi everyone! 

I (M27) have recently been dating (M33) for the past 1.5 months consistently. He’s incredibly smart, driven, motivated, attends an incredible school for a high-earning graduate program and did undergrad in another prestigious school same field. He’s also very well off. Currently, things have been wonderful. He’s attentive, a gentlemen, protective, warm, and kind. 

However when we first met, he did let me know that he went to rehab for meth a while ago. At the time I kind of brushed it off but as I’ve been slowly doing research, I’ve come to realize that this is a bit more serious than just “pot” or “alcoholism”. 
I’m very new to this substance/addiction. In the short time I’ve known him he has treated me with NOTHING but respect and care. But the more research I’ve done the more worried I’m starting to become. 

I’ve also noticed that he does have a lot of prescription medicine. He also still has no problem drinking like a regular college student. 

I’m a very caring and understanding person. I don’t judge others. But he is a much bigger man than me. I haven’t felt in danger with him but as I’m not used to this addiction/drug could he possibly hurt me if he relapsed? 

Am I judging him too harshly? 
What questions do I need to ask him to find out if he’s fully recovered? 
What is a serious dealbreaker? 
Should I have him go through his medications with me?

"TL;DR - GF and I were friends for a year before we started to date. I want to introduce her to my family but my family can be alot, especially my sister (read below for more details). Im from a close knit family and to this day all my cousins are with the first person they introduced to the family. All of them introduced their BFs/GFs pretty quickly as well (within 2 months) so the bar has been et a bit high in my family. MY GF is from a big family but they are not as cloe or hectic as mine can be. I live far from my hometown so it has been easy to keep family out of it, but we have started talking about the possiblity of us introducing to each other's family.  When is a good time to introduce my GF to my family?

&amp;#x200B;

Me(M28) and my GF(F30) were best friends for a year befroe we started to date. We were FWB towards the end of the summer and we made it official last month. Im from a very big close knit family. I only have 1 sister but have many cousins that are my age or close to it as well as many uncles and aunts. My GF is from a family with many siblings but she doesnt have many cousins or uncles/aunts. And the few cousins she does have all lived far from her. Her and I both live in a city far from family (she is a 5 hour flight away and I am a 3 hour flight away). Some of my relatives knew about her when we were best friends but just that I had a really good female friend I hungout with. Since we've been official for   a month we know it might be a little too soon to introduce to parents. Both our parents and siblings know about each other and that we have made it official. I've met a few of her siblings when they have visited but this was before we were dating. She hasnt met my sister yet.

My parents are planning on visiting me in March, so by then I obviously will have them meet her if she feels comfortable and we feel we are in that place by then. Tbh I have some worries about her meeting my family. First thing is my family is very big and close knit. All of my cousins who have introduced the first person to the family are still with that person to this day (some have kids). So right now the bar is pretty high in my family. Because my family is so close knit, whenever someone is introduced to my family they immediately get incorporated into everything (group chats, events, family gatherings) by the cousins. And the families tend to meet and become best friends. These are all good problems to have. But I've seen problems occur in this from some couples. Where one of my cousins and his GF were having trouble and my sister told me that almost broke up but didnt because the families were so close and they liked each other's families. THis wasnt the only reason but it was a big reason. I wouldnt want to put that pressure on anyone I date. I dont think this would be as big of a problem as our families live a day's drive apart. Also my cousins have introduced their GFs/BFs fairly quickly. One of them introduced his GF a month into them dating and a month later the families had met. I've kept most of my dating life pretty discreet because I know if I mention someone im seeing, the family will want to immediately meet them. Im worried this could be too much for her so I want to give it some time and see how far we go before she meets most of them. I have explained my family dynamic to my GF so she can get a basic understanding and even from me explaining my GF says that sounds like my family can be alot. She says her family is more casual, her siblings have interest in knowing who she dates but they wouldnt try to ""investigate me"" or try to figure me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason is my sister. My sister is older than me, she is great but can be alot sometimes (very demanding, controlling, likes to gossip, and will stick her nose where it doesnt belong). I moved away from my hometown last year and the ditance has made my relationship with my sister better because I dont have to deal with her BS everyday. She knew about my GF before we made it official. Then when I made it official with my GF I mentioned it to her, and my sister's first question was""when am I going to meet her?"". To which I just responsded that I havent given it much thought and Im just taking it day by day. Everytime I talk to my sister, if my GF comes up she says that she wants to meet her to which I respond that all given time. Last time I spoke to my sister she literally said ""I expect to meet her soon"". We literally just made things official last month and again my sister can be alot. She is someone who can be discreetly manipulative and tbh I didnt move away because of her but it was a little icing on the cake to get away from that. Another worry I have for my sister is that she likes getting into my business and uses the ""im just tryig to be a protective big sister"" as an excuse. Me and my GF have healthy fights and we will be laughing 2 minutes later. We dont fight much in front of others but knowing my sister if my GF ever gives me tone of voice my sister doesnt appreciate I feel like she is going to try to come at my GF for it and grow to resent my GF. My family (especially the women) tend to have alot of petty arguments over the dumbet things and my sister has been in the center of alot of it. She has a love-hate relationship with all of my dad's sisters (4 aunts) because she heard that they didnt necessarily approve of my dad datig my mom and this was 35+ years ago and my mom at the time said she felt they tried to put their noses into their relationship. Unfortunately this is something that I think my sister adopted from them because whenever my mom says a story of how she felt they tried getting in between her and my dad, I always think that sounds like something my sister would do. Even my mom has forgiven them and moved past it. My sister tends to have trouble with people who basically dont follow her ""orders"" and I feel like if my sister and her ever have a difference of opinions, my sister will grow to resent her. My mom is a little bit like my sister in some ways. Both my mom and sister liked getting in my business and felt they had rights to make changes or decisions in my life without asking me. Theyve improved as I've been very vocal through my adult life about their shit and has caused alot of arguments but old habits die hard sometimes. And I know they both will secretly try to find things out that are going on in my life. My mom tried friend requeting my GF before we made it official and were just FWB. A the time we were in a weird place and My GF was weirded out by it and when my sister found out she just laughed like ""yep that's our mom"". I like that my sister and mom take interest in my life jut not how they like approaching it. I've seen my sister try to manipulate some of my cousins through their GFs as well and that's something I want to avoid too. My GF can stand up for herself better than my cousins GFs can so im not too worried about that.

Part of me knows  Im  probably blowing this out of proportion. This is someone I can see myself with for some time so I feel maybe I should jut get it over with soon. Part of me thinks it's too soon, but another part of me thinks that we were friends for so long that it wouldnt be soon at all.

"So this girl I’ve been hanging out online and chatting with briefly at work has had rumours that she’s talking to someone since her phone has been broken and not fixed (due to not having enough pay) and I was wondering if what she did with me seems like something out of kindness or feelings.

We used to play video games for hours every other night which both of us regularly ask for, she’s very busy and always has something going on like other activities like sports even though she still finds time to call me.

Every one of my friends were convinced that she liked me from these indicators but I just didn’t see it. At work she either says a comment on my looks or playfully punches, kicks me. Other than those interactions during break, in the periods I’m with her I try to keep eye contact which she starts to smile and return when we talk.

But recently I’ve been out of work due to health reasons and the only other girl I’ve talked to says that her phone has been broken for a while and that’s why she’s not responding to any messages. (It was broken before I left for a while). The same girl says that she’s been talking to someone which sort of disheartened me a little since I thought we had a tiny something. I’m about to return to work and I don’t know if I should confess or ask her privately if she’s talking to someone.

*EXTRA INFO* She’s told me over text that she thinks that I should talk more and come over to where her friends are a little more but I’ve said I don’t feel very comfortable with her other friends too much even though we’ve known each other since we started. She likes to tease me a lot and playfully punch/kick when we walk past each other (is that something girls do to someone they like??)

I’ve been single for a few years, and I’ve used the time to work on myself, done a lot of self reflection and therapy. I finally feel like I’m able to take my walls down a bit. 

He’s very nice, respectful, hardworking, funny. On paper he’s a great match. In person I wasn’t immediately attracted to him. But his personality really pushed it over the edge for me. He’s very thoughtful and kind, and how he treats me is so different than my past relationship. 

He has been persistent, and I’ve cancelled plans a couple of times and he always takes it with stride and reschedules.

This is where the question comes in. From the beginning I have said I would like to hold off on physical intimacy until I feel I’m ready, and he agreed. We actually talked about it quite a bit and both expressed that sex is something that we would like to wait to have until we are both ready. 

We had a date. He was romantic, and showed me what it could be like in a relationship with him. I got to know him more, he opened up to me about things. It helped me to understand him better. 

We both expressed having a great time after the date. But now I feel like I’m having genuine feelings for him, and really am starting to feel insecure.  He is so nice and not what I have experienced in the past. Part of me wonders if this is an act. And why he would want someone like me.

"I (F26) have been trying to find the right guy for a couple of years. I have been in one long-term relationship before in my life and it turned out to be emotionally abusive. It lasted 1 year and ended on New Year's Eve of 2023. I am still going to therapy trying to work things out, with my previous relationship, my family trauma, etc...

Just for context, I was both physically and emotionally abused all my childhood, by my brother, and it stopped a few years ago. I am now still living with my family and the abusive brother, but the abuse is now only psychological, nothing physical. 

Now to explain my question, due to my abuse I guess, I have these facial expressions that are usually serious, and I create a lot of boundaries, especially with men, because I worry about their motives for even looking at me. I side eye any man looking at me from a far, unless he looks super cute to me then I would start acting like a kid lol.

Also for context, I have a good job, in my country, I am considered well-paid, and I am financially stable and independent. I can't leave home because that's not an option in my community unless I marry or find a job abroad -which I am desperately working on. But yeah, I dress well, and people tell me I am pretty and have a nice smile and personality, but of course, I don't believe that a bit, and I believe I look super ugly and pathetic (Zero self-confidence).

When people get to know me, and I get to trust them, they get to see how bubbly and extremely sensitive I am, they are always surprised, and they never fail to let me know how strong I look on the outside.

I am now worried, what if my demeanor is what is pushing good guys away, and pulling in the narcissists? could this be a thing? I AM TIRED of attracting either narcissists or people whom I trauma bond with them.

He doesn't show up til about 30 minutes later, and doesn't even tell me what made him late.

And then during the actual date, he didn't even ask me about myself! I was the one doing all the questions and getting to know you aspects. It felt like an interview. I had to offer up information about me. In the two hours we sat there he maybe asked me someting twice.

And he kept saying females... ick. He kept saying 'females' this, 'females' that. ""My experience with females is Yada yada"" ""Last female I was in a relationship with blahblahblah"". Maybe this is more a pink flag than a red one, but every man I know that uses the term females instead of women or even girls, they verged into the 'nice guy' trope. Which he admitted to being in the past.

Idk. Maybe I'm bugging. Idk If I wanna even go on another date with him. He seems really invested, and it's nice to have someone like you, but I'm not gonna drag him along. I just don't know if I should give him a second chance.

I have a girlfriend and she has a boyfriend both long term.

One night we got out with her car and we start touching and kissing and the next night we had sex which she didn’t had for a long time with her bf.

Now we see each other pretty often but she didn’t let me smash her again saying we will get feeling for each other. One night I told her that we kept seeing but we only kiss and touch nothing more and she agreed on having sex again in other night. Since then every time for an about a week when I call her to my place or I say that I will come to her place which I’ve been a lot of times she keep getting reasons to not come or invite me, suddenly her bf stays often at her place which until then didn’t.

I have a lot of issues with relationships because my childhood trauma is that i was emotionally neglected, so you can guess the type of men I've been going for my whole life. I want to change this so I'm meeting this guy I met on hinge who seems very sweet and also kind of super eager to meet me. I've not been available to him for months but every time I reach out he's there. I honestly don't know what to make of that, does it mean he's desperate? Does it mean he thinks I'm worth pursuing and he's just being patient? I really want to give this a try because I'm tired of my trauma and my ego blocking love to my life, I want to be in a stable loving relationship and I know I have to fundamentally change what I'm attracted to.

"So a quick background, I've been dating this person for nearly 3 years and we've been living together for nearly 2 years. Things are good for just about everything but one big problem, they hardly work. 

I met them during their last year in college and they didn't have a job at that point but that seemed pretty normal to me. After they finished their last year of school we moved in together because things were going well. They then started a job only to quit it a month in due to pain. I thought okay. Reasonable. Let's go to a doctor. They then get steroid injections for their back pain. (Takes a week to heal from) 

They said they were feeling good and started looking for a job. They didn't get a job for another 3 months. Mind you during this time they are borrowing money from me and their family to pay bills. 

They then find a job things are going well and then after 3 months they complain about pain again and then got sick so they didn't go into work for 3 months. Luckily they didn't for them so they went back to work for 3 months. 
Unfortunately here we are again. They left work due to pain and not being able to work. This time they were fired and it's been about 3 months and they aren't going back to work. 

I really care for this person but I'm struggling financially trying to support both of us and it feels like I'm in a tough situation with no idea for solutions. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

"TLDR: I have this friend and I suddenly developed feelings for her. I’m not sure if I should tell her that I like her or just wait for her to reciprocate these feelings.

For context, we’re both in our senior year and it might be the last time we see each other. Me, a very introverted person, suddenly fell for this girl who is very outgoing (and sometimes flirtatious). I’ve had confessions before (which I rejected) and my friends would say I am oblivious to those I’ve charmed.

Every time someone confesses to me I feel weird about it because it’s out of nowhere. Hypothetically, if I say yes to those who have confessed to me, it wouldn’t really be sincere of me to love them (also because it felt like they were infatuated with the idea of me). 

Now that I’m in the same situation of having a crush, I don’t know what to do. I don’t intend to have the same situation placed on her. But at the same time, I don’t intend on leaving these feelings pilled up (yes it is very conflicting of me). It felt like the more I bottle it up, the more I feel infatuated by the idea of her instead.

"Hi, I have a situation that has been on my mind for months now and I have come to the conclusion that Reddit is my only hope left at this point.

I (F19) started University this fall. I knew absolutely no one before coming here, but I have ended up finding a group of four girl-friends I feel very close to already. One of the girls, I'll call her Brittany (F19), is someone I've gotten particularly close to. I'm a pretty closed off person and I've always had a hard time talking to people close to me about stuff going on in my life, especially the more difficult things in life. However, since we met I've had a lot of deep and meaningful conversations with Brittany, she relates and understand me more than anyone I've ever met. I know that sound dramatic, but it's true.

I have dated one girl before, a relationship that lasted for about a year, however with her it was pretty clear that she liked me romantically, and I didn't really have anything to loose if I was wrong because we weren't friends before dating and we we weren't really in the same friend group. With Brittany it's different, we started at a new school in the same year and everyone is there to make new friends and we ended up in the same friend group. If I act upon this crush and she doesn't like me back I would be worried I was ruining the friendship we have now.

The obvious thing to ask is of course ""does she like women?"", and the answer is yes, both men and women. Of course I know her liking women romantically is not enough of a reason for her to like me romantically, and I think the small belief I have of her actually liking me back comes from those several deeper conversations we've had. I haven't had those with my childhood friend, my best friends form high school of my ex-girlfriend, like I said: I'm pretty closed off, but it was so easy for me to open up to her. And during one of our conversations she also said that she had never really talked to anyone about what we were talking about. That gave me hope that she was feeling the same way.

So, Reddit, do you have any advice for me?

"I’ve been dating this girl for almost a month, and I really, really liked her. We had so many shared interests and the chemistry was (honestly) better than I’ve ever felt before. This may have been the strongest I’ve ever felt about a girl (this soon, at least). But recently, I found out she has been seeing multiple other guys while dating me (including a “longtime FWB”). To be fair, we haven’t had the exclusivity talk, and I don’t judge her for this. But I can’t lie and say it didn’t make me feel pretty bummed.

My takeaway was that she must not want a relationship with me and probably doesn’t like me *that much*, or at least as much as I thought she did based on our time together. So I told her “something came up” and I couldn’t make our next date, and then I began backing off completely from her, thinking she’d get the hint.

She started texting me, I would say with escalating levels of frustration. The first text was something like, “Where have you been??”

That evolved into texts like, “Wtf dude, I’m not trying to be clingy, but what’s going on??”

The most recent text today said, “Hey, I thought things were going really good with us. I’d just like to understand what went wrong?”

I don’t really understand why she’s texting me this much if she’s not interested in a committed relationship. I think I made it clear I wasn’t looking to just be added to the rotation like this. But now I feel like I need to end things more formally. Since I’m already moving on, I don’t think there’s any need to get into the details of “why.” So I was going to text her, “Hey, it wasn’t working for me anymore, but I wish you the best of luck.”

How does that sound? Is it too cold? Is a phone call required? Do I even need to let her know? I’d be open to hearing any advice on how I should end things.

\---

EDIT/UPDATE:  I still feel like I don’t want to pursue anything further with her. I did, however, take all your advice to heart about how I shouldn't ghost her, and I should be clear about why I was ending things.

I texted her the following: ""Hey sorry, but I was pretty hurt when I found out you were seeing other people still, and I needed some space. I think we were looking for different things, and I'd prefer it if we go our separate ways at his point.""

So i met this girl on the weekend. Im sure i was meant to be staying at hers as the week before she wanted me to stay over that night. Anyway the day of the date comes i go to see her things are normal about 2 hours into it i asked her “what time you kicking me out then?” I asked this just to be sure i was sleeping that night and she replied with “idk yet” i was pretty confused as i thought i was staying but didnt say anything. 
Few hours later we decided to go out for food. Whilst we were walking round sje said to me “have you checked train times?” And i said “what” in a very confused way. Then she was saying i told you earlier i had had placement even though she didn’t but i didn’t argue with her i just said alright.
I took her for a meal then she said have u checked to see what train ur getting then she i said yeah the one at 48 past them she was like there is one at 15 past isn’t there but i didn’t see it. So anyway the meal ended and i got the 15 past train which was 15mins after we had our meal. 
Since we met i hadn’t had a response from her the rest of the night straight thru to tje following afternoon where i was hit with sorry this is not gonna go any further. She was also saying i was rude, looked like i was gonna fall asleep and didn’t seem interested

"I have a very strong intuition or gut instinct because it happened a lot of times and ended up im always right.
But my boyfriend right now is a very sweet and a very nice person (well from what he've shown me the first couple months of our relationship). 
Now i feel like that person is gone. I mean, he's different now. Not as sweet as he was in the beginning and im trying not to think he's not nice anymore because he still is. But it's really different compare from who he was before.
He used to randomly message me random sweet words, something like, ""thinking of you, can't wait to see you later today"" or just a simple ""i love you"".  Now, he always say he's busy or ""extremely busy at work""... which is ok and i've been trying to understand (no more time/a minute just to txt me anything sweet) and i've been wondering why?... 
If someone really loves and cares for you, HE WOULD MAKE TIME to at least message you quick. Am i right?..
He's not the same person anymore and lately i've been having this GUT FEELING that there's something going on with him behind my back. I didn't think about it and i don't wanna think like that of him but it's my gut instincts that's been telling me ""there is something"". Sometimes i wake up with fear and anxiety which I ONLY FEEL when the person i love is doing something wrong behind my back. So all i can do is cry because everytime i ask him if there's something going on, ofc, he just say, ""nothing is going on. please stop asking that question"".
Then ofc after he says that, i feel bad because i feel like im just accusing him. But what happened to my gut instinct? WHAT IS IT?.

"I went on a few dates with this woman I met at a bar (sorta). We were really hitting it off. There were really good vibes. There seemed to be a lot of sexual energy between us, but she would only let me touch her, hug her, and kiss her. She wanted to take things slow and have a real deep relationship, to fall in love, and to have romance before falling into bed together. I was totally cool with this despite my desire because it meant she was more mature than I thought, and I went from thinking it would be a fun fling to maybe something more. Our dates were different than others I've been on. There was no awkwardness (well, very little). We had deep open conversations, and despite my best judgment, we both even shared a bit about our failed marriages. 

Then I had the death of a close family member, and she said she wanted to be there for me. So, even though things were so new for us, I thought I'd see how real she was. I figured if she was just stringing me along she would politely bow out and I'd know a little more about her, but if she was serious, she would be there to comfort me and listen to me through the grief and maybe I had found someone worth taking it slow with. Well, she came over and was amazing, and I started catching feelings, and she said she was too. We made out some, with heavy petting, and were really very sweet to each other as we continued to share the intimate details of our lives. We continued to text some the next day, and we continued to be sweet to each other, and I started to get my hopes up about her.

We went to a group meetup a couple of days later, and only three (the two of us and someone new neither of us knew) of us showed up. I kept my distance. I didn't try to be ""a couple,"" but just let her have her space in the social setting and give her a chance to see me interact with other people. At the end of the night, I tried to walk her home, but just like before, she wouldn't let me because she was nervous about me knowing where she lived and wanted to take things slow. We talked for 30 minutes in the pouring rain as she asked that we slow things down because she didn't want to fall in love so quickly and if she slept with me and I left it would break her heart, etc. She shouldn't have come over the other day to comfort me because it felt too much like a relationship, and it was too soon, and she didn't want to get her heart broken. I told her I didn't want to be strung along, that I didn't want to be ""just friends,"" but that I could be patient. I also said I got where she was coming from, but that my perspective was that I like her and it was exciting to feel all the feelings we were and with the death of the family member in mind, I could be dead tomorrow and why would I let fear of being hurt get in the way of pursuing something that could bring me great joy in my life. So we agreed to slow things down. I texted her after and said:

""I apologize, I shouldn't have asked you to come over or shared so much of me so quickly. There's something about you and me that I dropped my guard with you. Anyway, I'll give you a call sometime.""

She responded: ""How big is your dick?""

I said: "" There's an easy way to find out.""

She said: ""Yeah, if you send a picture.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss, what the fuck just happened?

Edit: Update for the curious

It gets weirder. So without going into too many details, the whole time we were dating she brought up a Discord group that meets IRL that I was part of that we sort of met because of and that she was interested in joining. Today, she was chatting with me and others in Discord like nothing ever happened, and also seemed to pretend that we didn't date at all. So I decided to DM her in discord and ask,  

""Just to be sure, did you lose your phone, or did you let a friend use it last night or something?"" 

She had blocked me on Discord. So I texted a couple of friends from the group. One straight-up didn't answer me. The other answered me, heard my story, and then told me that she's telling everyone in the group that I'm sketchy and shit. I'm half convinced that she was trying to infiltrate the group and break it up because we're quasi-political, but we're so inconsequential that my assumption is that she's just crazy. Reflecting back, she did point out a couple other guys and tell me they were stalkers or abusive to women, and one lady said hi to her in the street, they hugged and then she told me, ""don't talk to her she's crazy."" 90% of the people she talked to seemed to love her, though, including people that presumably knew her, so I took it all with a grain of salt, but maybe this is a pattern of behavior. Whatever is going on here, she's not what I'm looking for.

"Hi there, I (F22) have been seeing this girl (F22) for one and a half months now, we saw eachother almost every other day and the dynamic was so nice. she says she really likes me and that she is super busy with school, so thats why she texts less than prior. Then i went home for xmas break and its totally turned, she doesnt at all seem interested in me, never asks about how i am or how my day is, only talks about her own day. Flirts with meanness, which is not my style, and ignores my hurt reaction to it.  She doesnt dive into anything i say, unless its to joke about it, and even when i say i was super sick with a fever she gives no reaction at all.
Its so strange. People tell me to wait it out to see eachother again in real life, but if this is what its like when we arent physically together then it feels super toxic and unbalanced. 
I get the feeling emotionally shes not interested in me maybe..  
Whats keeping me on is how nice it was when we were together and that she says she really likes me, but it just doesnt feel healthy this way. She will randomly show an effort to show interest, but compared to the rest it seems completely out of balance.

"I’m going to try to long story short this:
Myself (F 30) and my current partner (M 25) have known each other for about a year, we met on a dating app and were in the “will they won’t they” stage for a long while, often discussing what we would want from a relationship if we did decide to make it official - so we both very much know what the other is seeking and what their boundaries are. During this time we were not exclusive which we were both fine with as we weren’t together (to make it very clear, this did not bother me at all). 
About a week ago we made things between us official, as in a monogamous relationship with the intention of it being long term. I know about the girls he had sex with during our “unofficial” stage and made it clear before we started dating that I wouldn’t be comfortable with him actively chatting with them if we were to peruse something as they were girls he simply met to have sexual encounters, they didn’t seek each other out to be friends, they sought each other out to fuck. One of them he had most recently had sex with  less than a month ago. I asked him tonight if he was still talking to women online and he said that he was still talking to these two girls that he initially was having sex with (up until recently) but now they are just friends and they talk often. He has known them both probably about 4 months or less. 
I told him that it makes me extremely uncomfortable and that he already knew I wasn’t keen on being in a serious relationship if he was going to keep messaging with other women (if these were legitimate just friends I wouldn’t be bothered) but he says that they are his only friends and if he stops talking to them he won’t have any and he doesn’t want them to get hurt. Is this red flaggy?? Am I dumb? I dunno, I just can’t see how someone you have known for less than four months, who you only initiated contact with was to have casual sex, can be your only friend and that you couldn’t go on without having to talk to them every day. It’s a big bummer cause it took me a bit to feel ready for a relationship again and I ended up really feeling like this had a lot of potential, but I just don’t want to end up feeling like an idiot who’s boyfriend is flirting with and being suss with girls on Snapchat.

Update: we spoke again today and he showed me one of the conversations that he was having (he only showed me the things on Insta because snap disappears) and even then it only took a small scroll to see things that were inappropriate that were said after we decided to start dating. I basically said that there’s no way I’d be comfortable with him continuing chatting with them and that he needs to decide if he would rather pursue a healthy relationship with me or if he would rather be able to continue these types of relationships with other women. I think he genuinely doesn’t know what he would rather and tbh that’s probably my cue to exit. This guy isn’t a bad person and I genuinely could move past this if he was willing to give up chatting with ex-sex-friends but my gut is telling me that’s not going to happen and that I should probs just move on.

I have started to develop a bit of feelings for him and I'm now wondering if he might feel the same way, but I have no idea about the differences of when a guy likes you or if he just really enjoys being friends and nothing more. 

He will text me about random things, but often it is also just to ask me for help with things that he could easily do himself, which makes me wonder if they are just excuses to see me. He asks to cook together often (even though he never cooks with anyone else, but his friends do live in different buildings). He will also ask to hangout and we will talk for 5 hours straight sometimes, he has also invited me into his room and we just played some games. Whenever I mention going to the gym he will invite himself along, or when I mention going to a store he also wants to join me. Even though he usually does these things alone. But then again, he did mention that he loves our connection and he could just be really happy to have a friend to do these things with. 

So yeah, we spend a lot of time together but as far as I know there has been no flirting and he has made no attempt to make a move at all... He has however mentioned that he never really flirts directly and that he's just not that guy.

"Okay, this is kind of a rant but it has to be written down so here we go. 

I (18nb) was friends with a guy we will call Bob (18m) for the sake of the story. 

Bob and me met in the first year teacher of secundary school. We were both 12 at the time. 2 years later, after I transferred schools we still met up like, once in a half year. Well, this summer we became closer, like, we called a lot, texted a lot, hanged out the whole time, and I really didn't have any feelings for him. I liked his presence and I could be myself around him. 

Then one day, something changed in the way he behaved around me. Like, he started teasing me more in a playful kind of way. For example, we were sitting on my bed and I was playing a game on his Nintendo, and then put of nowhere he pokes my cheek. He never did that before. I worked in a city 30 minutes with the train from where his school was, and he would come all the way from there just to hang out with me while I was working. 
So I didn't know how to handle that, so I ignored my feelings and was like: ""we're just a good company for each other. Everything is alright."" 

Anyways, a couple weeks later I moved to the capital city in my country to study, and he stayed over a couple days later. Long story short, we were not sober, and at one moment he said, ""I want to hold your hand for some reason"". So my high ass thought: ""there's nothing weird about that"", So I said, ""sure, go for it"" and ofcourse the rest is history. 

So the next evening we talked about it, and I thought we were alright, until he texted me, and I quote ""You should go to the gym, then you'l be hot"". I asked him why he cared about how hot I was, and he said that it's natural to wanna be pretty and that kinda shit. That kinda hurt me. He knew about my insecurities and I still don't know why he became so mean. He never said shit like this till now. Yeah, he was someone who always told me the truth and I really liked his transparency and honesty, and then he pulls this fking shit. Anyways, when I told him to quit it, he said it was a joke. After that, the topic didn't come up anymore, so I let it go. Then out of nowhere, he blocked me, and I never heard from him again. 


I don't really know how to feel about this situation. I'm kind of hurt, ofcourse, and at the same time I miss his presence. Like, when I walk on the street and I see something funny, I want to take a picture of it and send it to him, but I can't. 
Idk if someone has any clue what happened in with his brain, but yeah, I'll get over it one day I guess.

"24(F), 27(M) randomly messaged me on IG a month or so ago. My ex and I split up almost 6 months ago, I had this guy on my IG while I was with my ex as I knew him from school, we never spoke, he was just one of those folk I knew. 

When my ex and I split, I removed our photos together - there was quite a few. This guy messaged me “this is going to sound forward but I need to know if you’re single or not so I know if I’m wasting my time or not. Been wanting to message you for a while now.” So I replied saying I am single and he said “that’s the answer I was hoping for” then he said he liked me and wanted to talk to me, that there was “something about me” and that he never normally messaged girls out the blue like that.

After that he never really said anything else. We matched on hinge and he said I should add his snap, we sent a few messages but not much. I made a joke about us going on a date and he said “you’ll have to work for that” so I asked him what he meant and he said “I’m sure you’ll think of something.” Then ignored me. I guess I just don’t get it, he messaged me out the blue. He’s an attractive looking guy, all the girls used to fancy him at school, I wouldn’t say he’s a player either. 

I’ve had this quite a few times now where a guy has said he likes me and spoke to me for a bit but when it comes to actually putting in the effort or planning a date they don’t seem to bother. It makes me wonder what I’m doing wrong, it’s so confusing. I have been told I can come across as being quite cold (I’m quite reserved until I get to know someone more) so maybe I’ve accidentally gave him the idea that I’m not that interested in him, but I don’t exactly want to come across as desperate and say ‘wow you’re so attractive I really fancy you let me take you out on a date’ I feel like that comes across as weird. 

He blanked my last message so I just replied ‘🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️’ I don’t really know what to say. It sucks, this whole dating thing sucks. I wish folk were just open and honest with what they want… don’t randomly message someone saying you’re interested in them or like them if you have no intentions of taking it further or maybe I am missing something.

TL:DR guy messaged me out the blue in IG asking if I was single and telling me he liked me and had been wanting to message me for a while but barely makes an effort and won’t take me out on a date.

I putted all the colors myself with my alcohol markers. I cleaned up my room, took a shower and waited for her. Before she arrived, I searched for one of her fav movie and as soon as she got at home we watched it. We talked for a little bit, she told me she's having a good moment, we kissed a few times too. And even if we wanted to further, my family was here T-T (they didn't bother us 'cause they were all tired after church). She had to go earlier because she was helping a friend with a party he organized and she already promised so she got to go.

"I went on two dates with this man I met on a dating app. The dates have been fantastic and it felt like we were on the same page on how interested we were and where we want to go. Two big caveats: 

1. I’m going away for 5 weeks on a holiday I booked before meeting him 

2. The day before I left, I found out and confirmed that the person I previously dated gave me HSV 2. Finding this out has been really hard given the deception I feel like I was put through. When I was dating this previous person and we started sleeping together (which I believed to be exclusively), I got myself tested and shared with them that I was all clear of anything. I feel so stupid for trusting when they told me the same. 

Obviously as soon as I found out I called the man I am currently seeing. I told him to get tested to be sure and that I want to be any help that I can. 

He has been incredibly gracious and kind about it and has even mentioned that he would definitely like to see me again when I’m back. 

I just feel so anxious now that the other shoe is going to drop at any point. I already felt bad to be leaving so abruptly when I just met someone. I just feel like the timing is so awkward and inconvenient.

But with finding ing out that I now have to live with HSV 2 that has made me feel even more insecure over the situation. I know it’s stupid but I feel less than… 

He’s such a catch I am confused and anxious that he would just rather cut ties and find someone who isn’t away for 5 weeks and doesn’t come with all this complications.

"TLDR : would like to become FWB with friend who’s too much flirty with me. 

Hello guys, to put it simply, I've known this girl who we'll call X for almost 3 years. 

When we met, I was in a relationship, it was at the end of my high school years and we were just friends. When I broke up we talked a lot and the flow went very well, there was always this flirting side to our conversations without it really going anywhere. 

We both go to universities far from each other but we still talk. However, on our first year of uni she found a guy and we stopped talking and we didn’t sent the other a text during her whole relationship. But, I was one of the first people to know that she had separated from him. 

Since her break up (2 and half year ago), we've always exchanged slightly silly messages where we compliment each other and talk to each other as if they were our life partner. 
In addition, when X and I see each other during parties, we are very tactile with each other and have gotten into the habit of sleeping while spooning or in each other's arms when we sleep together, there’s a huge sens of physical comfort with the other. However, she also sends me mixed messages that would make me think I'm in the friendzone. Particularly when she talks to me about the guys who come to talk to her, she often says to me ""I'm not going to tell you too much because I know you don't really like me talking to you about that"". Especially since most of the guys who chase him are losers. 
The problem being that she and I are studying far away from each other and that she and I are categorically opposed to the idea of ​​a long-distance relationship, and that the situation I'm in doesn't bother me, it's without any hassle and I would like us to become friends with benefits.

"Hello everyone, I’m having difficulty sleeping due to a dating problem. I (30F) met a guy (37M) at the end of June, and it felt like we really clicked. However, he’s never been clear on defining the relationship. During a local event, we attended together in October, I saw one of my friends there and introduced him as my friend to her. I am not going to lie; I probably accidentally emphasized the friend part because I think I was nervous, and I was a little upset that we weren’t exclusive. That same night, I made a huge mistake. During intimacy, I said that I loved his “cute little” genitalia, which was completely unrelated to me referring to him as a friend earlier, but I’m sure it was all connected for him. I felt so bad and cried on the way home, and a little off and on the next day. I do not believe his genitals are cute or little; it was merely out of adoration and because I have a bad habit of complimenting people like I do my dog (I’m in school, and I don’t get out much, but I’ve been working on it). Anyways, shortly after, but probably too soon,  when I thought we were good, I asked if he was happy with our friendship, which was a terrible way to start a define the relationship convo. He replied, “I’m still figuring it out,” which I respected, letting the topic go. 

Since then, it’s felt like he’s been able to distance himself from that event, and it seems like we’ve become closer, which has made me become more attached. So after a great date on Friday night, I decided to revisit the relationship/ what is this convo, starting with “It’s fine if you’re seeing other people, but I  don’t want to be a placeholder if you plan on exclusively dating someone else,” because I had felt an awkward/distant vibe from him and saw he was active on dating websites. Again, he replied, “I’m still figuring it out.” However, on Saturday, I realized I wasn’t happy with the answer, and I sent him a text asking for some clarification because I felt like I deserved it, considering we’ve been seeing each other since June. He responded by saying that he thought we were dating until that event in October and that calling him my friend hurt, and then also referencing my comment from the night of and yesteday’s comment. I immediately apologized, telling him I didn’t want to assume he was my boyfriend/never wanted to hurt his feelings, and that I’ve wanted to be exclusive for a while but didn’t want to pressure him. However, I still wanted to be exclusive if he did. 

After three hours of no response, I decided that I was approaching this convo from the wrong platform and that a face-to-face meeting would be better. So I texted him that I didn’t expect an immediate response, and that I think there may be miscommunication on both our parts and I would love to meet to clear the air in person. 

I still haven’t received a response after 36 hours. Should I have expected any response before now? Like a confirmation that he received my message. Should I drop my feelings for him? I feel pretty confused about the situation.

"I feel so shit, I (f18) kissed my best friend of 2 years’s (f18) (let’s call her Angela) ex (m18) (calling him John). context, I was friends with John first and become friends with Angela a few months after, we grew really close. John at first liked me but I rejected him as I liked someone else and we stayed good friends, then a year later him and Angela got together, but after a month, John broke up with Angela. She was so hurt and I stopped being friends with John for a bit after that. 

After she recovered and got a new guy, John and I slowly became friends again. I dated my first serious relationship, and it lasted 9 months. After he dumped me, both me and John had recently been rejected by the ones we love. So we decided to hang out and just watch a movie, but things got worse, we held hands and cuddled during the movie, it was like a mutual agreement that we are just doing this cause we are lonely and sad. 

So to clarify the times, this is more than a year after John and Angela broke up, and since then Angela had moved onto liking 3 different guys and currently likes the 3rd one. I felt so guilty but I didn’t know how to tell her, John and I decided to not do this anymore. But after 3 months, we decided to just hang to study, we did and since there’s nothing to do we went to watch a movie (i know I really shouldn’t have) and in the movie we kissed and did hand stuff.

"I've had opportunity to solo travel extensively, particularly in Asia, Europe, South America, and it's been eye-opening to see the contrast in how dating dynamics play out in different countries.

Sweden is my home country, and here my dating experiences have been quite underwhelming. In Sweden, I often feel almost invisible when it comes to getting attention from women. It's like there's a different social code here which I can't really pinpoint if it is something with me to do or I just cannot really change, and I struggle to make meaningful connections. It's not just about romantic pursuits; even casual interactions seem more reserved.

The contrast couldn't be more stark when I travel to countries in Asia and South America. Here, the way women interact with me changes dramatically. I've noticed a genuine interest and a different level of warmth in their approach. Whether it's cultural or just the novelty of meeting someone from a different country, I can't say for sure, but the difference is palpable. There's a certain eagerness to connect, to learn about my background, and there's a kind of openness that I rarely experience back home in Sweden.

In terms of around Europe, I see slightly difference in southern parts of Europe where interests increases but it is not at the same level as it is in Asia and South America.

"I, F(22), went through my boyfriend's M(35) following list, and I noticed that he started following new women since we made our relationship official. We met three months ago and instantly hit it off. Since then, we've been in a long-distance relationship. I acknowledge the significant age gap between us, which is something I usually don't go for. I actually have a negative view of younger girls dating much older men because, let's be honest, we often lack their life experience and can be more easily manipulated in my opinion. However, I decided to give it a chance because we get along so well. He's a successful plastic surgeon who works a lot, but he always ensures I receive enough attention from him. He made it clear from the beginning that he wanted a serious relationship with me. So far, he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him, but his following list is starting to concern me more than I expected.

He isn't very active on social media; he rarely posts and only follows around 50 people. Among those people, there are new girls with small followings whom he started following after he followed me, and they follow him back. All these girls seem quite similar, a bit unusual-looking and blonde. I've asked him in the past if he has a specific type, and he said he doesn't, but I can't help but notice that these girls give off the same vibe. Objectively speaking, I am quite attractive, and I often receive attention from guys, so I'd say I'm more attractive than these girls. My self-confidence is usually strong, but when I fall in love, my anxious attachment style tends to become more prominent.

Yesterday, I asked him about one particular girl he follows, and he told me he initially thought she was a patient but realized she wasn't. I didn't press further, but it did raise more doubts. If he thought she was a patient and then he realised she wasn’t why did he still follow her? He doesn't usually give his patients his private Instagram, and it's not easy to find. Now, I'm even more paranoid. Additionally, this girl doesn't follow his clinic page, which makes it even more peculiar.

I generally trust people until they give me a reason to doubt that trust. I'm not actively waiting for something to happen, but that's just how I function. I have this gut feeling that something isn't adding up, and I don't know what to do about it. When we discussed it, he seemed avoidant, saying he doesn't understand why we're even having this discussion. I don't want to confront him because, aside from this, he hasn't given me any other reasons not to trust him. However, it feels like a ticking time bomb for me now, and I can't help but feel like I'm expecting something bad to happen.

"Well this is my first time ever posting on this site, so here goes. 

I'm a woman in my late twenties and I've been hoping to find a romantic partner for many years. I know it sounds cliche, but my biggest dream in life is to have a husband and kids. But despite my best efforts, here I stand creeping up on thirty and I've never even been kissed. I know relationships take time, and I'm not necessarily saying I expected to be married by now, but the lack of any romance in my life has left me feeling downtrodden and discouraged. I don't know what it is to love and be loved in return in that way. 

I feel like at this point I've tried everything: blind dates, online dating, going out with friends, conventions, local community activities, you name it. I have hobbies, a close knit and supportive family, a small but great group of friends, I'm back in school to finish my education and am loving my subject of study. I'm introverted but very friendly and I enjoy getting to know people on a deeper level. I've been heavily working on myself in my singlehood and yet remain painfully lonely. As my friends and family are finding partners and getting married, I am left with a paralyzing fear that ultimately I will be left alone as they move on to their new lives as I've seen many other friends go before. Not to mention the pain and shame I feel when I see them in happy relationships. I feel like I have so much love to give and nowhere for it to go. 

So many people have told me I'm still young, that I shouldn't worry about it, that I should get over this. I've heard it through the lense of religion and practicality. But my emotions aren't practical and none of this helps me deal with the deep ache in my heart that only grows larger by the year.

"As title says I’m a 25 year old woman who honestly told myself I wouldn’t have sex unless in a relationship, and have been sticking to that rule until I recently realized I haven’t been in a relationship in a while and do desire to have sex more frequently. To be transparent I am genuinely looking for a romantic connection or partner, but in the meanwhile would love to actually be able to sleep with someone. 

For context, I have only had sex 4 times since 2020 and my last relationship was summer of this year which only lasted maybe 2 months. I did have a period in my life where I was able to have casual sex when I was 20 years old (pre covid), but its been hard to get into that mindset lately. I’m not sure if its because I do want something greater than just sex and have the desire for someone to view me as more than that, or the modern dating scene has changed since I was 20– where I had a very casual mindset on the dating/hookup scene. 

It’s also hard for me to meet people in person because although a good amount of guys hit on me at bars or make it known they’re interested, I feel like it never goes anywhere because despite me wanting to have casual sex I genuinely cannot go about it without feeling shitty that the guy literally only wants me for my body and nothing more. Similarly, when I make the first move towards guys I find attractive it never seems reciprocated, maybe they feel the same as I do, or they may be able to sense my hesitancy. I’ve also tried dating apps, and if its obvious a guy is on there solely for the purpose of sex it comes across cringey and turns me off.

"Hello Reddit community,  
  
I’m a 25-year-old guy who is at a point in life where I’m genuinely seeking a meaningful connection with someone special. While I’ve had relationships in the past, I feel it’s time to explore and build a future with someone new. I often hear people say that love finds you when you’re not looking for it, but I’m skeptical because I have no clue where to meet that special someone.  
  
I’m generally a calm and composed individual, and I take pride in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by regularly hitting the gym. Professionally, I work and spend most of my time at home. I’m not the outgoing type, so the question arises: where can I potentially meet someone? I’ve tried dating apps, but it seems challenging to find something genuine in today’s digital landscape.  
  
Moreover, I’ve encountered a recurring issue with how women perceive and handle relationships. Despite being myself, I’ve noticed a trend where things take a serious turn, and suddenly, interest dwindles. I’m not overly affectionate or clingy; I just value authenticity and being accepted for who I am. It’s disheartening to witness the need for masks to make an impression, and it bothers me on a daily basis.  
  
Additionally, should I happen to establish contact with someone who seems to be a good match, there’s been a frustrating pattern. Either they back off after a few days, disappear altogether, or fail to keep their promises. This continuous cycle has left me feeling exhausted and disheartened. If anyone has tips or advice on navigating the complexities of modern dating, especially dealing with these challenges, I would genuinely appreciate your insights.

So a few weeks ago my crush was at my job getting some items at this retail store. She had a cute little ponytail but her bob hairstyle she had on the other week. A manager had me take care of some errands but when I got done she was already gone out the retail store.

I was so nervous looking at her in the face. She couldn’t see me because she was looking down.

Then today comes around.. I said hey she said “morning.” She goes into my retail store then comes out I make eye contact with her while smiling. I say “are you a thief? Because you stole my heart.” She says “Ah that’s funny.” Then she goes into her car texting..a few minutes later she pulls off making a right and I’m outside she smiles at me kinda like a embarrassed-blushing grin.

I told him he was hot but I felt insecure because he sports an 8 pack and has fancy cars I’m like this guy isn’t real lol. He was around my age to and just I kept him in my matches for awhile. I didn’t even say anything because I’m not going to lie it’s rare these kind of guys never go for me! I’m ok looking I get told I’m beautiful buttt that’s another story. I thought maybe he was fake because no verification mark. I decided finally after a month and just no really finding matches I want to try I decided the “sexual need thing” I’m not like religious or etc I’m too shy and scary to begin with and I live freely. i was horny and decided why not which I did not listen to me I figured he was just one of those guys that prefer not to let girls around first because of what they have (I live in Hollywood) nd my intuition that day said he has a girlfriend because he would just make me come over but still was going with the first thing I suggested lol. Anyways we planed for a Friday he shows up, and I’m like this is weird I don’t do this. we go to my room chat a little and he was saying things like from a different era, I asked how old he was? without me realizing he may be older than his profile but he tells me 34. I’m like I’m 32 he calls me young anyways he throws me into his arms faster because I was catching on to him in his mind but really I don’t think I was exactly!! he looked exactly like his profile but there’s a catch he catfish. Skipping forward during sex he was aggressive which honestly i didn’t mind. it was fun. he was experienced. After he finished he def rushed out which is expected. I figured this was a one night stand so I didn’t hesitate to just walk him to the door kindly and he was saying I made a new friend but I didn’t respond I was irritated coz I didn’t cum he’s selfish! So he started speaking In French to the door and I asked him what he was saying? And he was saying I enjoyed myself and we should be friends (I was thinking he wanted out I was following his lead) ok anyways skipping forward I waited to see if he texted me all week and literally he did not so I hit him up and he said he was out of town for work so I figured he was just hardworking. I decided to further the investigation only because he wanted to be my friend but he has all his social media accts blocked when I found HIS REAL NAME which was not matched to his tinder I was like damn.. then a pic of him married to a girl for like 5 years and In relationship with a 41 year old woman I’m like he likes cougars then I saw he’s 46. It’s crazy coz he looked young. After finding that out I sent him a reminder about me coz now I know why he didn’t text me or have time. I was gonna talk to him about it so once again I texted him to come fuck me and he texted me on thanksgiving he wanted to come see me! But this time I was out of town so he said when I get back. After thanksgiving I was horny after our text and thinking about the sex I’m like is it worth it he’s a liar I doubt he’s in a open relationship and is this me. I felt attached after the night we hooked up so I sent him a long text about how it’s me and if we hooked up respectfully I’d just make this worse for me without him knowing I know he’s married and how we shouldn’t be friends because I am craving more intimacy and the sexual need isn’t for me!

"There's a girl, A, I've (24M) been, simply put, in love with for a very long time. We went to school and college together, but due to COVID and graduation, we see each other much less. We text now and then but not as much as we used to. We're both on the shier side so that's partly why. We've been friends but never dated. I always wanted to ask her out but never did because I had a lot going on in my life for a while.

I know, I really really fucking wish I did because she eventually started dating another guy. This started sometime around COVID so because of not getting to talk to her as much, I didn't know for a while. She's generally reserved when it comes to dating. She posts very little with him on social media, besides one anniversary post (which was how I found out), and whenever we talk, she has never brought up relationships.

Because of hormonal irrationality, I kept holding out, waiting for them to break up. This is very unhealthy and has led me to a mental block preventing me from dating anyone else, and I need to get over it or I'll live my life like Severus Snape.

Well, recently I noticed A deleted her social media posts, including the anniversary one. Probably doesn't mean anything given that it was all the posts and not just the one, but I can't control the thoughts, you know. So I thought I may as well try to find some closure on this now, to see if they really are still dating or not. Even regardless of the social media thing I've wanted to do this. I just want to, if not date A, then set this chapter behind me for good.

I have a couple options.

* Ask A directly. Obviously the most straightforward way, but like I said we never talk relationships so it would feel awkward bringing it up. She would most likely know what I meant basically any way I could bring this up. If she's happy in her relationship now I want her to be happy. I don't want to get in the middle of anything or throw feelings out there I can't corral back in.
* Ask another girl (B) who is a close friend of hers. We are friends too and still text now and then, and once a long time ago I touched upon the topic of dating A with her, so there's conversational precedent for that. I'm thinking if I ask her, then to kind of spill a more succinct, less unhinged version of this post (basically saying I've liked A for so long and really need some form of closure there)

I'd still really like to stay friends with both A and B in any case. I've been scared to do this because of taking the friendships to a point of no return level of awkwardness. A, B, and I have lots of mutual friends and if this somehow goes wrong enough, I really don't want word of this to spread.

He honestly hasn’t given me any red flags, but the one big problem is that we do not talk or text unless we want to see each other that moment or making plans to the day of. It wasn’t this way when we first began talking in August, but ever since the first date in September, it’s been sole communication with the intent of seeing each other. So in some cases, that could be a few days or up to a week and a half with 0 communication. 

He is away for a couple of weeks right now, and I think I miss him? It’s only been a few days since he’s left, but I had a great day with him when I last saw him a week ago. He views my social media, so he usually knows what I am up to, but outside of that we just never text or talk. I will admit, I too am to blame, but I’m only truly putting out the energy that I am receiving and guarding myself.

"I'm 23yo, never had a GF, never kissed a girl, don't think I've ever had a friend who was a girl. The only women I interact with is my female coworkers. I just don't know how to even start meeting women.

""Go out and socialise""

90% of my friends are gamers and that's basically all we do together. Some of them go clubbing/raving but I don't enjoy those kind of activities...do I need to force myself to go?

""Use dating apps""

I don't think there is any point trying. I am not ugly but not good looking either. I know that only attractive men get matches so I don't think there's any point in trying.

"Hey everyone!  


I (24F) have a dinner with (28M)  tomorrow night and I am so anxious about it all.   
When I met him, it was after being stood up a few times and I was in a ""I hate men"" sort of mood, so when we first met, it was just for a hook up. When I got there I was genuinely surprised about how lovely he was. It really caught me by surprise. (can go into details about what surprised me in the comments if people want more information).  


He told me that he wanted to catch up again. Because I am going away for the holidays, I moved some things around to make time for us to go out. I suggested going out in public after I finished worked and he agreed. (I also want to make a note that he is travelling down to see me, I live towards the city centre, and he is like 30 minutes away)  


Since then I have had so much anxiety and nervousness and yes, also excitement about it. But, I have also had a lot of past trauma resurfacing as well. For context, over two years ago I came out of an abusive engagement, and have actively been going to therapy and working on myself since. I am very comfortable in casually hooking up etc, but not in actually dating people. And honestly, I don't even know if it's a date.   


My friend did ask if I am ready to date again, and I said before I met him I would have said no, but I can see myself with him, and that scares me. My therapist is away for the holidays, and I am leaving the day after the dinner, otherwise I would have asked my therapist about it all.   


I feel so out of my comfort zone, and I am not entirely sure on how to deal with all the anxiety about it, so I am open to any advice about it.

 I f(25) work in health care and was working alongside the same guy m(31) for almost a year and overtime developed a crush. He was working there before I came along. I knew he was attractive right away but didn’t think too much on it as he’s not my usual type. He was often quiet and task focused and I’m the exact same way so we worked together great. Deeper conversations and eventually started joking/teasing each other frequently when working together. I soon developed a crush. I built courage and debated on if/how to act on it for a few months because I never felt like I knew for sure that he felt the same. He abruptly had a great opportunity for a different job and gave notice. I was surprised and accepted that it’s a sign to let the crush die. Wished him well and pushed him out of my mind. Fast forward six months and I got drinks with a different coworker and she said she had a burning question for me. She said her and some other coworkers all thought this dude and I were dating when they worked with us and asked if it was true.

This girl from my workplace shows great interest in me and shows a lot of excitement while texting although she didn’t initiate one she showed effort to continue the conversation when I ended it after a platonic conversation.

I offered a movie to catch up during the Christmas break and she said yes and we decided on Godzilla and she didn’t text me back to finalise the time of the show the next day. Then the next day I was near her suburb for some shopping and texted her if she is interested to join for the movie in the evening as we have planned the day before. She didn’t reply until 10 pm at night where she mentioned ‘sorry I slept and woke up just now if you are free we can meet for coffee tomorrow’ 

I don’t mind rejection but I find it very disrespectful for not replying and lying about it (according to her she slept 12 hours during the day)

"I’ve never actually posted on here because I usually just read others stories but I genuinely need advice in this situation so please help. This is gonna be long so bare with me. So there’s this guy that I work with. We’ve worked together for about two years (he left for school and came back a few times). Ever since I met him I thought he was so cute and definitely had always had a little crush. We have always gotten along well and even have flirted a bit here and there. About a year into working there I started getting close to my other coworkers while he was away at school. I soon found out that he had hooked up with two of the girls that we work with. In both situations the girls shared how he took of a condom without their consent. Obvious this is a very awful thing to do and I have had similar things happen to me by guys that have been extremely traumatizing. One of the girls (one that I’m particularly close with) was really effected by the situation and was scared to work with him. This all happened before I ever worked there but many of the coworkers know about this and strongly dislike him because of this. Since then he hasn’t been with anyone else (as far as I know). Throughout our time working together he had done things that make me feel like he’s changed and it seems like he likes me more than just to hook up. Like he went up to my parents when they were visiting the restaurant and introduced himself. Recently he started asking me to hang out and we went to the gym together. The whole time I felt so guilty about it because of how my friends feel about him. He is completely my type and honestly exactly the kind of guy I’ve been looking for. He’s kind, charismatic, smart, and driven. He keeps wanting to hang out more and I don’t know what to do because I want to but knowing what he did and how this is effecting my friends really pains me. Also no one we work with knows I like him or that we have been hanging out. I feel like he really likes me and that I would be stupid not to pursue because I feel like he would be a good partner and he makes me want to be a better person.

"So, I've recently had a ton of luck on hinge and managed to lock in a ""date"" if you will every other day for this upcoming week. Some include the full dinner, drinks, and activities. Others include just drinks or just dinner. However, I do not really want to go spending a $1,000 on women who are potentially not good buyers (future commitments). My question is, as a guy, do I need to feel obligated to pay for every drink the woman orders, or offer to get her first and see how much and what she is drinking and make an assessment from there? I know for the dinners that, I as a man, am obligated to pay that and I fully accept that. 

Also, I know there is going to be bitter responses on how I'm playing the field or whatever. Again, these are all first time dates and may not even turn into second time dates, a trial run if you would.

I am in my late 20, only dated 3 time (literally just dated 3 girls for not more than 2 months each all back in my 16 and mid 17)

Only had sex once in my 17's and was a mediocre one (dint felt good in anyway)

From the 3 girls i dated one was stolen (it hurt but i really was impressed that something like that could happen) by another guy in the school, i think you would call him a ""jock"" i think.

The last two girls only got close to me to get to my cousin (bcs his from Portugal) soo got cheated and dumped by both

So since my late 17 i have tried and never find anyone to date or someone that had any interest in me, most is the same as everyone being rejected in any shape or form and basically humiliated for even thinking so i just stop trying after 2 years trying.

Been alone for more than 5 years. I have been on reddit and youtube a long time and sometimes i see a idea similar to stoicism, like you just shut you emotins off basically to just stop caring about any of that and when you finally shut of the feelings you will see ""true freedom and happiness"" 

So my question is..... Is this really true?
Can i just shut myself of and stop caring will work and find this true freedom?

With the 2nd bf, I even communicated these crush fantasies, and I don't think he took them seriously. He just brushed it off, and thought it was cute.

"We broke up in March and I haven’t seen anyone since and messed me up pretty good. I have revamped my life and took a lot of therapy since then. I still think about her a lot but not in the same light. She found someone else around May and has been with him ever since. I never blocked her or anything because I feel like it’s petty but I get the reasoning why people do it. 

In June I finally got unbanned on snap chat and as soon as I reactivated my account she messages me. “I see you got Snapchat back!” I replied “Yeah, I know right.” Not much after that. Then she sent me a facebook friend request since I did remove her. I accepted this, not because I thought it was a chance but again I’m friends with way too many people on it anyway. I did make it where I didn’t “follow” her on there so I don’t see what she post or anything. 

She would reach out every so often with something I posted or comment on it. Still with the same guy. Curiosity got the best of me once or twice and I did check her page out and it seems they were having the time of their lives and what knot. I’m happy that she is happy. No ill feelings. Now it’s been twice that she has gotten really drunk and has to hit me up and talking crap not as in batter but we use to talk shit to each other in a funny and jabbing manner. Nothing personal or anything like that. Always through Snapchat. She offered to make me banana pudding when I said I wanted some on a facebook post. Has called me at random a few times and the last time to see if I would met her at a place kind of close by while she waited for a meeting. I told her I just got off work and wouldn’t make it in time. 

We were really good friends before we started trying to have a relationship. I’m sure it’s to keep that for her. I was with her for some really rough times in her life and never turned my back on her. She left me when I was at a really rough spot and when she left it was the icing on the cake. I apologized for any thing I did or said to her when she left and left it at that. She always makes the effort in reaching out, calling me, snap chatting me, anything that involves contact she puts in the effort. I will not reach out at all.

One of the main factors is that in order to be ready, I shouldn't be wanting to be in one, I should just not care and be content by myself, which I am to some extent, but I do crave physical touch and it's almost unhealthy at this point.

"So I (25M) have been dating this really fun and interesting woman (26f) recently. I’ve been dating different people on and off over the past several months but never really felt too connected to any of them. They were good people just not my match. Well, for the first time in a while, I’m starting to have feelings for the woman I’m seeing. 

I’m usually not the nervous type because I know what the reality of online dating is and I’m pretty good at guarding my emotions until I can be 100% sure that we’re both committed. This time, however, I’m feeling a lot for this girl and it’s making me nervous because I keep thinking about how easy it would be for things to go wrong. Which I know isn’t great but it’s kind of an unusual circumstance. 

She is a very successful content creator and has over 6 million followers on her preferred platform. Trust me, I get that social media is not real life but the reason this is making me nervous is because I keep thinking about how many people she’s exposed to and how between that and frequently going to LA, wouldn’t be hard for her to find other options. I will say, I think I have a pretty good gauge of peoples interest and I genuinely feel like she’s into me (aside from her telling me that many times already), I keep thinking of what could go wrong. 

I understand the reality of dating anybody with that kind of following in anything will inherently come with everything I’m talking about here. But I was wondering if anyone had advice for the overthinking I’m doing here because I’m usually not this way with people I’m dating and for the first time in a while, I really want this to work out. I don’t care about the fame or anything, I started to like her as a person before I even knew about that and that’s who I’m really after. so yeah, any advice would be great:(",I’m dating a very successful content creator and the fact that its going well its making me more nervous than usual,18kzqcn,1702872223.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18kzqcn/im_dating_a_very_successful_content_creator_and/,
"Hi! So I (19F) am a freshman in college. A few weeks ago, I started hanging out with a guy, (19M,) who I really enjoy seeing. We can call him David. He is very sweet and funny, and I like spending time with him. I have spent the night at his apartment multiple times and we haven’t had sex yet, which I think is pretty impressive considering he is a college boy in a frat. One night we had a conversation and he told me that sex is just not the most important thing for him, and he doesn’t want to have sex with someone unless he is committed to that person. We have done other stuff, but we have put off having actual sex because we are not in an actual relationship yet. Last week, winter break started. He lives about a hour and a half away from me. We talked about meeting up at some point during our month off, but we both will be busy working a lot. Before we left for break, I asked David if he could see us having a relationship or if that’s what he is looking for at the moment. He said yes and that he really enjoys hanging out with me and that if it goes somewhere it does and if it doesn’t it doesn’t. However, he did say that it felt like a kind of weird time to be getting into a relationship now as we were about to each go home for a month. I understood where he was coming from because I didn’t want to rush into a relationship just because we felt like doing it before break. The main not so great thing about him is that he is not very active on his phone. While this is good because it means he isn’t talking to a bunch of girls 24/7, it can be annoying for me when I am left on delivered for hours and hours before getting a response. One night, I texted him on iMessage instead of snap and asked if he’d like to FT over the weekend to catch up. He never responded, though he snapped me on Snapchat.
 Anyway, the other day, my family’s cleaning lady who I have known for 10+ years since I was in elementary school mentioned to me that she knew a guy, (20M,) I might be interested in. She told me he has friends at my school and I decided to get in contact with him. Let’s call him Joe. I was feeling a little frustrated about not getting a response from David.  So I texted Joe and introduced myself. He seemed very sweet and we ended up going on a date last night. We went to a restaurant and then to an arcade to play games. He paid for my meal and the arcade. Afterwards, we cuddled in his truck and ended up making out. I could tell he wanted things to go farther but I put a stop to it. Not only did I not want to have sex with him on the first date, but I couldn’t stop thinking about David. He told me he really enjoyed hanging out with me and he wants to see me again a couple times before I go back to school. I told him yes, but I am not sure how I feel about that. He is a very sweet guy but I kind of regret going out with him, and especially kissing him. Literally 10 minutes after I got back from my date with Joe, David texted me and asked if I wanted to FaceTime before bed. I guess he had seen my message after all. We talked for almost an hour and it was really nice to talk to him. I didn’t mention Joe, but now I am wondering if I should. I don’t want to potentially start a relationship with any dishonesty or secrets, but I also don’t want to risk jeopardizing things with David. I do really like him. Since we aren’t technically dating, I didn’t cheat on him. However, it still doesn’t feel quite right.

We didn't talk much back in the middle school, but she went to a high school pretty close to mine, and she wrote me a birthday card when I was freshman year in high school.

We talked on and off, and we just kinda stopped talking at some point, and we haven't been talking ever since. It's been roughly 8 to 9 years.

"For context I’m f19, and have been getting into dating apps recently as I have never really had anything more than some dumb situationships. But I notice that most guys that I talk to immediately want to meet my housemates?

One guy I invited over while all my housemates were at work, and I was telling him some stories about them whilst I was showing him around, and he said he wouldn’t mind waiting around until they got home to meet them. Bear in mind that this was my first time meeting this man (I know inviting someone over without meeting them first is poor form, but we had been in contact for a long while over snapchat, so I wasn’t worried about him being a catfish at all). Things didn’t work out with him though.

Similarly I was on the phone with a guy I met on Tinder (this was our first time talking) and he asked if my housemates were home for him to say hi. 

Is it just me that considers this weird? I feel like we’re obviously not at the point of introductions to my housemates on our first interaction?

When thinking about it, this even dates back to highschool, I remember talking to a guy I liked over the phone and he insisted that I told my parents that he said hello to them, when we hadn’t even been on a date yet.

Is it a guy thing that they want other people in my life knowing that I’m seeing someone? or am I reading into it?

Obviously I’d want them to meet my housemates eventually, but I feel like after a few dates would be much more normal, as it seems weird to me to introduce them to someone I have barely met and aren’t considering a long-term relationship with yet.

"I went out with a guy 30M that I met on instagram. I love his talkative personality, but it seems too good to be true.  
Backstory on him: has used almost every drug in the past (not anymore) and not he only smokes weed about once a month. Has 40+ sexual partners of both genders, transgenders and everything inbetween, is very sexual but not all the time because i am not (he's adapted to me). He lives alone, works as a bartender, his family is a trainwreck and he's shared lots of sad details to me about his life and growing up, dissappointment from partners etc.  
Before we even went out he started using ""baby, babe, love"" nicknames, he's been so nice to me too. When we went out it was freezing but he still decided to walk with me ( i wasnt cold, he was)  
He also said he'd love to make me lunch and dinner, take me out and try wine with me.  
He was hypersexual with me at the beginning of the texts but he turned it very innocent and sweet once he saw I prefer other types of affection over sexual things.  
He complimented me so so much, which was my favourite because i did spend a lot of time in my outfit and makeup.  
He also hinted at us being in a relationship right now. Like he would send a cuddle gif and I would jokingly be like ""oh yeah i demand that"" and he'll say ""you dont have to demand it, thats typical gf treatment!"" (this happened around 3 times)  
I have been in abusive relationships that started off nice and turned ugly, and i really dont want anything to happen with this guy. My family is mostly out of the picture and I have no one older to talk to about this. I always just wanted love and care from a partner. His treatment makes me feel so appreciated because this is something I've NEVER had it genuinely from my family or previous partners. I feel like I matter for once, i feel seen.

"**TLDR because boy issa lot : Supervisor increasingly being more close to me, letting me ride home with her, giving me nicknames, letting me smell her, etc. What do I do with this attention? What's it all mean?**

  
So I work at this supermarket, big company, smallish store - I'm relatively new, shy, loner guy type. When I started working, my supervisor ""Rae"" was very hands-on in helping me since I struggled a lot. She's very extroverted, playful, and nice with people, so I thought Rae's just a kind soul. And that's all it was at first.  


By chance, we happened to share the same bus route home. And we got to know each other a little better outside of work. I saw a more quiet side to Rae for once, found out one of my eccentric colleagues was her sister who was mentally challenged which is why they were always on the bus together.

  
Within a month, after I overcame a big learning curve, she rewarded me with gift-money (employee-reward thingy) directly, and started giving me multiple cutesy nicknames. That rhyme. Or end in 'ee'...like Jacky, Johnny, Benny, etc. She'd sit with me during break even though I'm literally the most awkward plank-o-wood virgin you could imagine, but Rae grew really interested in my art that I'd make during break.

  
Once the buses began missing our stops she started offering uber rides with me and her sis - since we live along the same street. I started to notice she'd go out of her way, even if she barely catches me out the door after work, Rae would somehow sense my presence and call out for us to ride together. And almost every time she'd make her big sis sit up front in the uber, so her and I could be in the back alone together... OR on other days, she'd squish all three of us together in the back - oddly making sure I'm always in between her and her sister. (Yep. Her and I were practically on top each other back there.) And in a twist of events, two nights ago Rae even let me smell the scent on her arm, asking my thoughts on the perfume a friend gave her.

  
As of most recently, I got off work earlier than Rae, so I said ""Bye Rae"". After letting my long hair down, I got ready to face the ol' bus again when I remembered I made a deal with a coworker to meet up in our store over a gift I made for him. So I stayed at the row of tables next to the bakery so I could give it to him and chat.

  
I miss my bus...of course. And after a while I notice Rae's big sis at the other end of the tables, so it's only a matter of time before Rae'll see I'm still around. Then **BAM**, Rae appears with her sis. I try not to peak at her, opting to enjoy the moment with this friend I've made, but the next time I *do* look up, I notice Rae's sister is pacing around the shop all alone. Rae's gone. I think, *'huh? No way Rae would catch a ride home without big sis???'* I continue chatting with my buddy for another 5 minutes when I notice Rae's back - approaching our table. Her hair down, like mine...Neither of us usually let the mane out, but the ONE day I do, she copies me? It was as if she noticed me from afar and went off to fix her hair to match me. (And yes. We rode home together again, cozy af in the back of the car.)

  
I don't know, but ever since the uber rides, that's when it hit me like: yeah Rae's nice to everyone, but I'm the one she goes HOME with. Why? Why me? I appreciate her so much looking out for me (I might even have a little crush on her) but I don't know how to reciprocate this...this THING. Is this a bait?! Am I being ambushed to catch me doing something naughty?!?! Nah... I DO know she trusts me in the very least. but for the rest, idk anymore. TT

"A few months ago, my best friend was looking for 2 roommates but was coming up short on candidates. I offered to move in this July and she happily accepted.

I matched with this girl on tinder in September. I had a friend pass away the same week that we matched so I sent one message to her, she responded and I stopped talking to her because I was dealing with my friends passing and funeral services/family. 

I messaged this girl back this month and told her I was sorry and that when we matched I was not having the best month and I apologize. She read my message and no response. This girl is exactly what I look for in a girl, and from her profile we have a lot in common. I have tried reaching out to her twice and she reads the message, but doesn’t respond. I am conflicted if I should just unmatch her? Do you think there will ever be a chance when she will respond or did I basically lose my chance, and it’s no longer worth pursuing?","Matched with this girl on tinder, but I am unsure of what I should do?",18kxzas,1702866533.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18kxzas/matched_with_this_girl_on_tinder_but_i_am_unsure/,

So I just straight up asked her has she lost interest cuz realistically you make time for stuff you care for and if you’re active on social and don’t respond that raises some flags. She said something like “omg no sorry im just really busy”.

This man… messages constantly and instantly and it feels like he is  just sitting by his phone waiting for me to text back. Personally, I don’t like to message all too often because I get overwhelmed easy and like to keep texts at a minimum because I’d rather get to know them in person. Before our first date, he was trying to schedule a second and third and I’ve only known him for less than a week at this point…

We went on our first date which was at a restaurant and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed and felt like I should cancel beforehand, but I didn’t. It wasn’t bad. He talked about himself a little too much and didn’t ask me questions, but it wasn't bad.

"Hi all,

I’ve been really struggling lately with not being able to find a partner. I have tried all of the dating apps and have attempted to meet singles in person with no luck. I am generally considered attractive and am in great shape. I’m highly active, professionally motivated, communicate well, and have a great sense of humor and broad interests. I have been to therapy plenty to prepare myself to be a good partner. 

And yet, I have nothing to show for it. I cannot find a woman that both doesn’t want kids and is looking for a relationship. I understand that not wanting kids (or not being able to have them - I am sterile) has been the biggest deterrent. But surely not 100%  of single women want children. As the obvious common denominator, I cannot for the life of me figure out what I am doing wrong. I am most frequently met with women who desperately want to be pregnant, women who are not looking for anything serious, and women that are emotionally unavailable (“if you met me at a different time in my life, you’d be the perfect partner”). When I was in my 20s, no women I knew would touch a man who wanted to get them pregnant. Now, no woman will touch a man that can’t.

Im a F (22) and ive been chatting with this guy (27) for about two months or so, ive grown quite fond of him, he has  a great personality and a great sense of humour too, we get along and kind of like each other    
  
Weve never seen each other in person despite living closely because hes bussy working and taking care of his nephew, but we arranged to meet in two weeks or so when he gets more free, so whats the issue here¿ I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GUY !! He wont tell me whats his job, i dont know if he has anny hobbies, he wont send me voice notes, he even doesnt like to send me photos of his dog and avoids to do it, and of course i dont know his face   
Ive adressed the fact of not knowing his face or appereance in some opportunities mostly in jokes and he brushes it off quickly to change the subject.   
Earlier today, we where talking and he said a joke or shomething that gave me the entrance to start asking about his features, so i asked if he had any piercings, how tall is he, whats his voice like, and some other few things, and he got kind of nervous and asked me if this was an interogatory and if i was going to ghost him !!!, i wanted to be assertive with how im feeling on this matter so i told him that i understand if he feels uncomfortable showing himself and that no, i will no dissapear with no explanaition, but that i dont feel entirely comfortable with this situation or dinamic because, being honest, im running with dissadvantages here, i show my face, i send him pictures or videos of me when im having dinner or something like that, i sent him voice notes, i told him what my job is, im pretty much more exposed than he is, and that i asked him those things because if he doesnt feel comfortable sending pictures i thought questions were a good alternative, he laughed, answered two or three of the questions quickly and then changed the subject. And this is really getting me uneasy, because he has told me he wants to fill me with kisses, that im pretty, and stuff like that, and honestly i reall like his personallity, i have a great time talking with him, and ive said things like this to him too, thats why im worried too, having said those things was wrong and its entirely my responsabiliy, and i feel guilty becase what if we meet and i dont like him physically¿   
I know it sounds shallow, i swear im not, is just that i find physicall attraction as well as mental attraction important in trying to form a relationship or starting to meet someone whose not for friendship   
  
im growing uneasy with it and i dont know if i should  tell him i want to stop talking or not, because oh well ill go to that date i have nothing to lose, right¿  I have nothing to lose indeed but we have talked about kissing and cuddling and watch movies and stuff like that (which again, its enirely my fault) so it will be very awkard if he tries to do something like kiss me and i end up not wanting to and i feel like bursting into tears with the mere thought of making him feel bad or sad   
i feel like shit and like a shitty person.   
So, thats why im seeking advice

What are the  best pictures for a woman (27F) to put on  her dating profile? I’ve heard a clean headshot, candids, and pics of you in your hobbies. Would you agree?

I plan on asking her if I can try to teach/help her to skate, but I'm not too sure what to say.

"Hi. This is my first post ever and I don't even know where to start. I (23f) have known this guy (23) for a couple of years now. We met through a mutual friend and always seemed to kind of like each other. We usually see each other when we attend pub quizzes as a friend group and he is the one who usually organizes that (and asks our mutual friend to invite me). We went on a group date about a year ago and it didn't go so well due to the fact that he is pretty shy and i'm also really uncomfortable in those kinds of group settings. We remained friends and things really didn't change much. For reference, he is kind of an introvert and I'm more of an extrovert. 
However, about a month ago we were really hitting it off during one of the quizzes and he DM-d me. We started talking and going out. I got the feeling that he really likes me because he shared some really personal stuff with me and did a couple of nice things in front of our friend group. We see each other frequently and I had a feeling we might be going to fast, but I wasn't really bothered by it because we seemed to click. It's also probably important to mention that his father passed away when he was younger so he doesn't open up to people and he is usually reserved towards new people like myself. So, naturally, when he shared stories about his dad and his family, I felt connected and shared some of my stories with him. We kissed a couple of times and all of our dates were pretty chill. 
Our last date was yesterday and I thought we had a good time. We went for drinks and just walked around the city. He was acting totally normal and everything was fine. That was until today.  
Both him and I aren't really great texters so we don't usually have some crazy conversations via text, but I could feel that something was off today. I asked him about it and he shruged it off by saying he has family over (I knew this was stressful for him because it is his dads side of the family). I asked again and he said that he didn't want to talk about this via texts, but he felt like we were going too fast and would like to remain friends at the moment. I told him I respect that decision and asked him if there is anything in particular which led him to this decision. He replied by saying that he really likes me and just isn't in the right place right now. 
I feel bad and worried. I am grateful because he decided not to waste my time and shared his thoughts with me, but I don't understand what's going on. We were flirty and happy yesterday and he just switched up on me today. I think the holidays are super hard on people who lost a family member and he told me a couple of days ago that some other family members made him feel nostalgic. I don't want to be pushy but I'm confused. He is not the type of person to play somebody.

"So mr guy (M25) and I (F23) met back at the beginning of August on tinder. He's been driving an hour and a half to see me since then. We usually hook up, and do fun stuff like baking, and he sleeps over. I mentioned that I'd probably be okay to be fwb for 6 months max, but I  wouldn't want to be fwb longer than that (as it can lead to spending too much time together and I rather it be short-term). We've also talked about being okay if it led to a relationship, but I said I'd need a few months if anything. He usually tends to talk about the future a lot with us, so I'm not sure if he's interested in me romantically which might make things worse because he's a really great guy and I don't want to make him feel bad. 

The thing is that recently I haven't really felt like hooking up with him, and I'm not sure I'd want to be in a relationship with him (either due to not wanting to be with them or bc I'm not emotionally ready for a relationship or bc I'm self-sabotaging, I'm not sure which it is yet honestly). I'm also not sure if I'm feeling like this because of the possible transition from being fwb to something serious and romantic, since typically a fwb just wants you for sex. And I might find it difficult that they'd want something more after just wanting that in the beginning. 

I just saw them today. Should I text them, about possibly ending things, in a few days or wait to see them in person a month from now?

"Long story short - I [32F] met a guy [30M] off an app, exchanged messages and got on a phone call almost a year ago now. He seemed to be serious about finding a life partner, and expressed wanting a “partner, not a project”. Green flag as I am looking for sme one who wants marriage and kids. I didn’t realize that I may have a lot of things to work on until after speaking to him, and I’m grateful for how he communicated with me. He called out some things about me that I had never fully internalized or considered before: that I was joking with him too much before building any rapport, signalling emotional unavailable and immaturity, and that wanting to be high achieving in a career and in motherhood is next to impossible, and I was just generally not warm for a dating exchange. Because of how frank he was with me, I told him “I’d never spoken to someone like him before”, which he likely took as disrespect. 

Because I was intrigued by how forthcoming he was (and projected onto him an idea of who he is), I left the phone call wondering why I was so defensive and emotionally immature and wanted to understand myself. Over the course of a year, I did a lot of reflecting and looking inwards. I’m a lot kinder and mature in dating because I’m aware of my natural tendency towards defensiveness and emotional immaturity, and generally much more ready to entertain a mature relationship. Fast forward to the present, I am interested in reconnecting with him because I’ve idealized him in my mind as someone who knows what he wants out of life and someone with purpose and direction. Though, I recognize I don’t know enough about him to idealize him. Anywho, 2 weeks ago, I send him a message along the lines of “hey, this may seem a bit random, I’ve done a lot of reflecting this year, was wondering if you’re interested in reconnecting.” He says, “I like random. I’m curious though, what sparked this desire for reflection?” I explain I don’t think I can cover it over text, and he says we can talk over the phone. I say let me know when. After two weeks of trying to find a time to speak over the phone, we keep missing each other because he fails to set a specific time, but he would text me regularly to call him whenever he was free. I message him one final day, after sustaining the back and forth of trying to find a time, saying I had some free time that day. He said he was running some errands and that he should be free later. He wasn’t. 

I don’t know how to interpret what happened - 
I personally don’t think he needed to make it a priority to schedule a time with me but also don’t know if the texting died off because he was not interested enough OR just tired of trying to make the call happen and is still open to receiving a voice note about what I wanted to say.

Please advise - can you tell me what you think happened, and what I should do? On one hand I think my interest in him is baseless apart from the phone call we had, and that I don’t have much info to make this a priority. On the other hand, I’m like, you never know unless you try.

"Well, how do I start with this one...

30M here. I've been single for \~4 months now after a multi-year releationship ended. And im slowly getting serious about meeting new people again.

So. 2 months ago, a new colleague came to the company I work. She is a very pretty girl. I've talked to her a few times, at least I'd like to get to know her a little bit better. But... She works for a different department-team and in a different floor than me. I barely get to see her (only if I happen to meet her at the cafeteria during a break). I see that she is already making company with people from her office. I also know that she along with the guys from her office have gone for beers after work.

So I guess the train has already left? She is probably getting more attentions than she can handle...

P.S. I work in an engineering company where \~85% are male, \~15% are female. Yeah, female engineers are hard to come by... So even statistically, the odds aren't in my side.

The only way I can see getting to know a girl in my work is if you are lucky and a new female colleague is placed in your office-team-department. So that you can talk and get to know eachother during the work day. In the break area in the cafeteria, its too crowded, and any new girl attracts too much attention from too many guys what circle aroung like bees.",Approaching a colleague at work,18kvr2u,1702859545.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18kvr2u/approaching_a_colleague_at_work/,
"I f14 have a family friend m18.
We hangout a lot because we do similar things. We exchanged numbers a while back and his texts have always been weird and flirtatious.

Recently his friend admitted he has a crush on me. That's already kind of weird but I found out that he has a gf. He's been asking me over text if I'm fine with him dating her and if I want them to break up. 

Our family's are close so we hangout a lot at bbqs and other events. My family has started shipping me with him and asking me how he is, and when we're going to start dating. If I haven't made it obvious I don't like him and I want to distance myself from him.
I can't block him because I would get in a lot of trouble with both of the family and I don't want to explain why I blocked him.

"So I've been seeing someone for the last 1-1/2 months.  She's younger, responsible, works at a diner and an actual single mom (dad is no where to be found), unlike a lot of people who try to claim that title. 

We've both been taking it slow, a 180° difference for me but Im a willing participant and do not mind. 
So read, we haven't had sex, official titles etc.

With Christmas being next week would it be odd or inappropriate if I got her a gift?  

This isn't something that I've ever felt inclined to do in the past, but I genuinely think that she's a good person. I genuinely admire her. And I'd be lying if I said that I didn't feel pity for her growing up in a similar situation.  (With a single dad, dirt poor).

Money is not an issue. I made just shy of $400k USD last year to give you an idea what I mean, so for me to spend a few hundred on a gift it's not a big deal. 

So far she doesn't know that I am pretty well off. She just knows that I'm in insurance.  I don't drive a flashy car, wear flashy clothes and all of our dates have been at low key places that even though I've paid for them all, wouldn't give one the idea I have money. 

She also doesn't seem the type to care about money or be a gold digger. 

Like I said a big part of me feels for her and,  growing up like that. Looking back as an adult and seeing the stress my father had to endure and he never did anything nice for himself etc. same as her. 

Seeing how militant and accusatory people can be on the Internet, I'll go ahead and say this ahead of time:
I'm not expecting shit from this.  

She could turn around 5 minutes later and tell me that she's no longer interested in seeing me and while that would stink because I do like her, there's no quid pro Quo mentality or anything of the like. 

There's a high end spa near where she lives, I was thinking of buying her a package there so she can frankly enjoy herself. She sacrifices so much as a mom,  she's selfless and if I can give her some joy for one day out of the year, I'd be happy to do so. 

I hesitate for a few reasons:

For starters, this is not something I've ever done before or have ever seen myself as capable of. 

I also don't want it to come off the wrong way or received negatively. Or send the wrong message perhaps?

"Hello, so I've been talking to this person for a few months now and almost right from the start we appeared to have communicated openly about our wants and expectations. I asked him to tell me if he ever lost romantic interest in me and to not lead me on, he agreed. He would sometimes avoid questions important to me for seemingly no reason, and I found it strange, but didn't think much of it. One day, when I confronted him about what he said that hurt me, to try to let him explain he told me to ""Chill"" and ""Relax, stop overthinking"". After an hour or so he responded again by saying an unrelated thing, clearly switching the subject. When I confronted him again about the same subject, he got upset and annoyed. By further asking questions, he finally admitted to having lost interest in me. I still talk to him as a friend and the topic of dating came up. He mentioned that he had a date recently and I started asking more questions.. He said that he told me that he might not respond for a day because of the date, but I looked through the conversations and the only thing I found, as I suspected, was the time he mentioned he might not respond because of a slumber party with friends? Despite disagreeing and saying that the date happened after I already knew he had no romantic interest in me, he did say that he got ""lovebombed"" by the person around 1month before we still had romantic interest in eachother.  Keep in mind we weren't technically ""together"", but we were clear that we both liked eachother and we started making plans with one another, had petnames, etc. It was basically like dating, just not ""official"".

"So I met this guy originally in high school and we had minor crushes on each other back then but nothing came of it as we both entered relationships shortly after. 

Just recently he sparked up a conversation with me about one of my posts, and about a week later, replied to a post of myself saying I was pretty and he wanted to talk more. He came on a little strong (saying things like “be my wife” and “please talk to me more 🥰”) and I told him this, he apologized and I said “I forgive you ( : haha”.

He continued to snap me and I replied saying I don’t prefer snap as a means for communication and so I gave him my number. We introduced ourselves on there and then nothing came of it.

"Hi everyone, hope everything is well with you all!

I’ve fallen into a bit of a dilemma and need your opinion!

Bit of a backstory first:

So I’ve (20M) known this person (20F) for over 4 years, we’ve always been close to each other and very comfortable with each other since we met!

So the thing is that the last couple of months we’ve actually been coming even more closer to each other and I’ve developed feelings for her.

 I decided there and then to come out to her and tell her this (while being scared of destroying our already fantastic relation). But instead of her taking a step back we became even more closer so we kinda have a situationship going on.

The bad part about everything is that due to college, we both have a bit of distance between each other (approx 4h car) which is not super long compared to other LD relationships but still a distance.

We talk with each other almost everyday and we always have deep and long chats and she has told me multiple times that she values me very high and that I’m safety to her and worlds best person which helps her stress down etc etc, we simply have a great connection 

AND NOW TO MY QUESTION/DILEMMA:

So Valentine’s Day is coming in less than 2 months and I’ve come up with an idea 

So I know that she likes stuffed animals, and there is a mini-tiger that I really like myself, so my idea is really that I want to surprise her at Valentine’s Day by sending her a copy of that tiger with a hand written letter as like to show my appreciation and as a memory of me to her and thank her for lightning my spark and make me wanna be a better person everyday

The cost isn’t a problem, fun fact it’s probably going to be cheaper than sending flowers today (thanks inflation)

So my question is really, is it a good thing to do and is it worth doing?

The thing I’m like nervous or scared about is the risk of it going completely wrong and like destroy more than it boosts if you guys know what I mean

He still had so much baggage and wasn’t ready to move at the pace I wanted to move at so this brought up a lot of arguments. He didn’t even end up filing his divorce with the court until after we’d been together for a year.

After that, he ended up trying one last time to make things work with his ex.. they have children together so I get why he tried again but it still hurt because I thought that was over. They tried a few months and clearly it was irretrievably broken because he moved out again just a few months later. I know this because he contacted me, told me he made a huge mistake, filed his divorce again, and that he can’t control what I do but hopes that I would value our connection enough to give him the space to finalize his divorce and start fresh with me the way he wished we would have in the first place. I asked if we could communicate but he is adamant that it will turn into the fighting that it was before if he doesn’t sort things out before we start a relationship again.

I was never given love in my life. By my family, by my friends, no one. No one ever showed me any live or appreciation growing up, ever

I went to go see a girl yesterday. I was supposed to see her Friday, but there was the slight incident of my grandma fucking dying. So I pushed it back till today. I got to her hometown after a 90 minute drive, 40$ worth of plushies and the mint chocolate olate she loves, and she texts me that she’s sorry but she’s super sick and can’t come. She then blocks me on everything. 

At this point I’ve already accepted unconditional love is not real. Love is a transaction where I have to give monetary value and emotional security. Now I’m believing that love for me is not real. That I was put on this world to only long for it, but to never experience it. After 3 years of dating both online and in person, this is the only girl that has shown interest to me. So tell me why should I believe that it’s a real concept?

Also if you tell me some bullshit that “I’m young” or “it’ll come along eventually” you can fuck right the hell off. The first part is stupid and the other one is a blatant lie.","Why should I believe that love, especially romantic love, is real anymore?",18kub5k,1702855362.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18kub5k/why_should_i_believe_that_love_especially/,
"So here’s my delima,
Back story:
I have had this guy best friend for 8 years, we met online but have already met in person. our relationship has always been semi sexual and flirty while still always being there for each other. Except for a 1.5 year pause on our Friendship that i initiated because 1.) my bf at the time had a problem with him (toxic relationship) 2.) he just was being a bad friend.

About him:
It’s been a lil over a year since we’ve been reconnected. My friend has been around since before, during and after my 3 year toxic relationship with my first boyfriend (ended a year ago). I reached out to my friend when I had a very close death in the family and my bf broke up with me.My friend has changed COMPLETELY  since the last time we spoke; he did all his inner work(and still working on it), has medication for his now diagnosed adhd, journals, extremely reassuring, can take criticism, tells me upfront when he’s bothered or upset with something I did, really easy to talk out conflicts, praises me, not afraid to show me his undying love, etc. 
complete opposite of my ex..

5months ago:
he came to visit me over the summer (I FORGOT TO MENTION HE LIVES 2 HOURS AWAY VIA PLANE) and we definitely checked all the boxes as far as getting physical. I’ve always been curious about him;romantically, sexually,etc. and it was nice to finally know. we truly act as if we’re in a relationship and  even tho I told him I’m not ready to commit to someone again, his response was, “it’s okay,bc I  just love you so much as a friend and more that I want you to experience what a good relationship looks/  feels like even if it doesn’t work in my favor”.   UGH! WOW! He’s a great and amazing guy, truly! I wish I was ready for him and  didn’t have the hesitations I do.

Fast forward to just the other day:  
I just visited him for 3/4 days and I loved every second and our families get along great! he told me he wants to ask me to be his girlfriend.. I REALLY felt what it would be like to be in a relationship with him and I really liked it.

My hesitations are:(in order)

-I’m just finally starting to(barely) heal from my ex, he and I  still talk and Ik it’s cringe and horrible but I think it’s a trauma bond and I’m working thru that( friend HATES it but deals with it bc he respects my growth). 

-Its a selfish want of mine but I just finally emotionally moved on from my ex I was excited to have my ‘wild girl’ dating phase but if I got into a relationship, that would be over before it even started.

-Bc I was excited to try all kinds of guys , specifically, tall guys. I never used to care about height but my ex had a huge insecurity of being shorter than me which put a bad taste in my mouth when it came to guys shorter than me I.e. my friend, he’s like an inch shorter.

-Me and this friend are like 80% compatible sexually but for some reason we has an issue finishing or staying hard during sex which is fine but just makes me feel guilty and is complicated/uncomfortable to work thru

-THE DISTANCE this is a huge factor bc1.) it’s horrible and 2.) having distance makes all of the above hesitations so much worse. I went thru having distance with my ex for the entirety of our relationship. a relationship via phone and in person is so much different ! It’s heightens all the stress. And lessens the daily emotional connection 

All in all, I hate that I feel conflicted. I want him now AND later but it just doesn’t work that way☹️I think if distance wasn’t an issue this would be way less complicated",am I (F23 )ready for him(25) or for a relationship in general?,18ku4n8,1702854875.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ku4n8/am_i_f23_ready_for_him25_or_for_a_relationship_in/,

"long story short, ive been on and off with my feelings with this one coworker.  We went to grab ""dessert"" she thought it wasn't a date at first or ""she would looked nicer"".  she said somethings that I thought she might of been hinting at and maybe I thought she might of wanted a little fling at least. Because she told me at that time she wasn't looking to date.  ever since then we got pretty close, talking to each other through FT, calling each other,  and texting even during our job except the FT part of course. Then until one day our boss said we can be on our phones while doing our job we grew distance from each other. I see her in the morning and he vibes felt like she was avoiding me but she told me she's just trying focus on her job and I do say hi every single time and she says it back. Sometimes we would even chat but we didn't talk or text like we use too even though I would text her first too. I've did the cringy thing and try to look at her to get her attention but look away because I would get nervous but sometimes she would look back... I just get to nervous to say hi to her if she makes eye contact with me when I feel like I want to flirt. and sometimes she'd get mad ( yeah I know its creepy now I think about it?).

Until one day I've notice this one coworker who at one point thought was flirting with me talking and being close to this one coworker I got a bit jealous and idk why I guess I developed strong feelings for her. I texted her on haha I see you talking to that one guy. My bad if I got jealous. She then texted me that seem so far fetch I didn't want to reply lmao. No hes just a friend . I don't date coworkers because it can get messy and weird. But I can have coworker male friends... and I replied oh hahah okay my bad and that's when i learned she had a boyfriend . since then things got weirder I got to nervous to even talk her and part of the reason is because I didn't want things to get weird between us so I tried to be cool  and it seemed to get her nervous when we have to work with each other. she had a instance where she ran to her car and speed off and I am hoping I didn't make her that nervous.   I would be messing up big time at my job because I would overthink things especially since I would already be beefing with my Mangers in a stressful job.  But I thought to my self damn I acted pretty weird that one night maybe I should give her some space.

Ever since then I gave her space and just focus on my job sometimes I would catch her looking at me when I go walk around and do my job. Like once I had trouble pushing a cart full of stuff and it had a bad wheel I got a lil annoyed and try to fix it and she watched me do this. And I thought to my self does she want to talk to me? or is she watching every move that i do? should I just talk to her just to let her know there's no hard feelings between us?   I just don't want any tense energy between us and maybe we can work to be cool again lol I wouldn't mind a fling though in the future if she's single but hey that's just me.",confusing interaction with coworker what should I do?,18ku171,1702854613.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ku171/confusing_interaction_with_coworker_what_should_i/,
"So today I went shopping at our local mall with my cousin and an employee. While we were in the candle store, I noticed this gorgeous Asian woman running a kiosk just outside in the middle of the mall walk-way (it was visible through the store window). 

While my cousin shopped, I stepped outside just to stay out of the way. I tried to look “busy” (I guess?) by looking at my phone. It appeared that maybe she was looking at me (in the corner of my eye). Of course I lacked the confidence and guts to walk up to her and say anything. And the two guys I was with are 29 and 35 and have had little to no success with women ever (which isn’t the case for me - I’ve dated a lot, been in relationships, and have gotten to know women in public before, like exchanging numbers, going on dates, etc.) They would not have waited around for me to chat it up with her anyway. 

Question is, since I screwed up, should I go back to the mall and actually approach her this time? If so, what is the best way to do it? She was probably in her 30s.

"Question for men:


I'm a girl in college (21F) and this was during a school wide event. This cute boy (24M) I met during the day he was reserved and did not give off fboy vibes at all.  we had a short convo and then at night there was a huge event at the club all the students went to.

We didnt really talk but I saw him at the club and said hi then went our separate ways. I had a great time dancing with my girls, and he sees me and starts dancing near me then asks if I want to go home.

Is there anything else he could have intended other than just hooking up? 

Edit: 

I thought he was cute but I was having a good time with my friends so I stayed and he just went home on his own. Fast forward we would still talk and I would invite him out to hangout with friends (he never invited me to anything) and we were friendly with each other, but that's it.

I am also someone who only does relationships so I was 
I am not somebody who goes clubbing often, and he said that he isn't either, which is why I kind of felt thrown off by the invitation to go home. A few weeks later there was a big clubbing event again and almost everyone at my school went, myself included even though I don't go out much.

I saw him there and we danced for a while then he went in for a kiss, which I rejected since I value building a connection before getting physical.

He never reached out to me, so when I saw him a week later I went up to talk to him as if nothing ever happened and dropped a hint of interest (that men would be able to pick up on) but he never asked me out or anything. We now both pretend like nothing happened, still friendly. We see each other now and then around just bumping into each other by coincidence around campus but that's it.

"I [34m] have been spending years in therapy trying to overcome trauma and cptsd from an emotionally unfulfilling upbringing so my interpersonal skills and dating experience is distressingly sparse. I had a short term fling with a woman I met online a few years ago and I was surprised by how normal dating and sleeping with her felt but I have always struggled with seeing myself as the slightest bit appealing to women.

About a year ago a new girl [28f] started at work in my department. During the occasional shift we had together I felt her being particularly flirty and handsy with me and complimentary to my clothing and hairstyle. It's obvious in hindsight but while I was flattered internally and hopeful that this meant that something could happen, I also felt stuck in my mindset that there's no way at all she's actually into me, even though she asked me if I was going to a event as work (I was) and met me there, introduced me to her friends she was with etc etc.

Seeing as I never knew how to reciprocate that attention, I think she lost interest in trying. I would do my best to talk and start conversations but felt like I was hitting a brick wall (I'm more likely not conveying enough genuine interest). 

One time at a casual work event she let slip a line that ""we don't really have much to talk about"" which made me feel that maybe I've conveyed a lack of interest over time that's upset her or something and my therapist has made a similar suggestion. We're not in the same department but she's still friendly enough to me and I'm still living in the past of how things were when we first met. 

After taking new medication, I have recently felt a lot more clarity and have less of a restrictive filter these days and want to give myself permission to be brave and give back that flirtatious energy we started with but I have no idea if the 'rejection' is a real thing, is something that she might want to bring back or ultimately a ship that has sailed.

"Hi!

Recently I (male grad student, 30) met another female student (early 20s) at an academic conference. I was organizing a workshop and she was participating in it. We met via the workshop and also have a few mutual acquaintances from working in same field. We interacted a few times throughout the week.

At the end of the workshop, we ended up chatting for quite a while, and I learned that we had a lot in common (e.g., one of her parents is originally from a country where I am from). We both laughed a lot and I had a lot of fun talking to her. I won't read too much into this though, as she seemed like a friendly person in general, and I know guys (including myself in the past) can misinterpret signals all the time, especially guys like myself who don't frequently interact with women (being in a male-dominated field).

But the important thing for me is that \*I\* liked her a lot---particularly her personality. In the past, I would have brushed it off as my clinging to any positive female interaction as I have very little dating experience. But over the past year and a half, I've been on dates via OLD (not many, as I'm very picky), and with people that I definitely found attractive and had stuff in common. So at least on my end, it felt like definitely felt something special/unusual. I don't think I had felt as much butterflies since since my high school crushes and my ex-gf from early 20s. I haven't been able to stop thinking about her since leaving the conference.

The conference is now over, I'm back home, and I'm left with a question: Is there any reasonable way I can ask this lady out, given we live on opposite coasts?  If we were in the same town, I could just more casually ask her for a coffee or lunch or date, but that is not feasible obviously.

Some things to note:

\- I have a sibling who lives close to her, so I'll probably have a few opportunities to visit in the near future

\- I am also likely to move to her coast after graduation, given our industry, but nothing's set.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential reasons for why I shouldn't ask her out:

\- We work in the same field. Not exactly same things, but academia is small. (Though unlikely I'll stay in academia.) At the same time, I've seen many relationships begin in grad school, so I don't see this is so bad (if at all) as long as the parties involved are mature.

\- Our age gap? Although I think this matters less and less as I get older, perhaps it's different from her end and I forget how different stage of life I was in my early 20s.

\- Just not clear what the objective is given the distance? Do we become friends remotely first?

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, my thoughts are:

\- I think now I've lived long enough to know that opportunities in life come by very rarely, and as they say, I regret 100% of the shots I didn't take. I still occasionally about the girl I didn't ask to prom my senior year of HS, what might have been.

\- In the past, I would overanalyze the situation and try to gauge if the interest was mutual. This time I'm not doing this (apart from seeing if she had a disinterest, which I didn't feel), as these things are really hard to read and:

\- More importantly, to me this is not just a choice about her but more broadly about how I want to live my life going forward. Turning 30 this past year, I realized life is really short. After being this shy guy my entire life, I want to take all the shots I can (both dating and non-dating wise). 

If the interest is not mutual, too bad, but at least I won't have what if's and at least I met a great person. I think I am definitely mature enough to not act w/ any ill will if I were rejected (which surprisingly many guys seem to do).

I want to know---for my own sanity and well-being---that I put myself out there and did all I can (without making her feel uncomfortable, of course). 

Perhaps the interaction wasn't that special, and I'm just falling for someone too easily? Maybe, but the important thing for me is that I did like her initially, so I want to find out what more potential there is, and to let her know how I feel (again, but without being too aggressive ofc).

Also, not completely sure if she's single, but no hint yet so far throughout our lengthy conversation. But again, I care little about this, as if it turns out that she's not, I can just move on, but at least I'll know I've given my shot (and she will know that I was interested).

&amp;#x200B;

Thus:

What's your recommended course of action? Tell her how I feel? (how do I do that w/o coming off too strong?) Try to stay friends remotely first? 

If I could ask her out on a physical date, we can start things more casually, but it's not clear how to do that remotely? (e.g., it seems weird to just say ""hey! I enjoyed meeting you and want to get to know you better"" without any follow up course of action)

The main difficulty is that my country is highly bigoted and has governmental anti-LGBT propaganda all around. So me being non-compliant to ""traditional values"" makes it hard to find someone irl, because I really don't want to face hatred from people if possible. 

 I figured I could try dating apps but there are many that are straight up blocked in my country, but most of those that aren't only give two gender options and as I'm looking for a long term relationship I really don't know what to present myself as now.

I (male 27) and (female 27). So i seem to keep running into the same issue with different women. But I live in this apartment building and this girl moved in like a year ago. We exchanged numbers one day and started talking. The conversation was good but she would always go ghost on me randomly and I can tell she was ignoring me because I would come home from work and hear her on the phone. I didn’t pay anymore to it really but long story short. We agreed we were attracted to each other and she gave reasons (excuses IMO) about being bad at keeping contact but also said she wasn’t looking to date and just wanted to stay friends. So I understood and stepped back. We would hangout here and there play video games and what not. But nothing physical at all. Still very wishy washy with sticking to plans tho and left me hanging a lot. She also had just had a baby so I didn’t care much and slowly backed off as she deff has a lot on her plate but being raised by a single mom I was comfortable with it and understood and deff have a soft spot for single moms. Then I notice she was having a guy come over. And then ghosted me for about 2 months. I figured she started dating and later on when she finally felt like talking to me again she said she did but I lost interest and tbh a real friend wouldn’t just ghost me. But basically I called her out on not giving me a chance and choosing someone else over me and wanting me to just be friends and she swore that wasn’t what happened but I told her it’s not fair to me that you get what you want out of me and I have to be okay with not being what I want with you and I said it’s better we stop talking. She played a big guilt trip “you deserve better I have too much going on don’t want to bring you down but don’t want to date or lose you” and I said okay but you basically lost me. Then the next day she texts me saying she’s going to hurt herself and I’ve had friends actually do that so I was worried and then she says “my cars in the shop and you not being friends with me just made everything worse” but I held my ground on my stance and we don’t speak anymore.

"22F who was dating a guy (who has been my friend for over a decade) for the past year. It’s very complicated, at the beginning I couldn’t commit because of studies, when I finally could commit, he wasn’t committing, kind of a toxic situation, bad communication from both ends too I have to admit I’m not great with expressing my feelings, we’ve never even had sex (basically from the lack of commitment I didn’t want to go the full way). 

I feel like the more I gave and opened up the more he pulled away, he got distant and wouldn’t even text me for a day or two. Whenever I would say it to him he would reassure me he still likes me etc, I found out he was spending time with his ex, took a step back, he reassured me they’re not back together, I’m not stupid he obviously still loves her, he then stopped replying to me for two full weeks, would still send me memes on Instagram or TikTok, but radio silence otherwise.

"I'm a thirty-year-old guy but I look 18. 

I'm sure a lot of people are going to spin this around to be a positive (especially the women).


But it does make me admittedly very self-conscious.

I do get a lot of attention from women but here's the thing — they're all minors clearly assuming I'm around their age. 

Women my age are likely profiling me as 10 years their junior. 

Even my work colleagues make it a corny party trick to have people guess my age.

I’m suspicious because I texted something like “have a nice trip. I’m excited to see you when you get back!” And she just said “thank you have a nice holiday” or whatever. (I would’ve liked a “im excited to see you too” 😭)

"Story: I started to text on ig and we have some random common friends (i know many of her faculty people). I made clear that im asking her out she seemed at first a bit hard like a wall and suspicious (she didnt trust me). We text for almost a week until the date. She mentioned shes excited.

She came late to the date, but she put effort, she came quite fancy, she was distant, but slowly with conversations i manage to cut the distance and flirting. I kissed her and after this we kissed later again. She wanted to move place, we went to another place where we kept talking and kiss again. At her place (inside the building) we say goodbye and we kiss a lot and she even said ""delicious"". I made clear i dont want first night sex as she also was a cautious person. I left and she was at the stairs staring at me in love. She also held my arm to walk during the date, warmed her hands etc. She took a video of her and pointed at me too and wanted a photo together. I paid for everything, I also gained a lot of points for knowing a lot about her culture and her native language.

Same night shes very loving and calling me handsome etc and wishing me a good night.

Next day she works at night and the texting becomes weird. She sends me video tho of her at work. I ask her when is she free next week to meet. Her reply: i dont know i have to check schedule. She asked me what i do that night so i reply I dont get a reply until next day morning and I texted over my text good morning and sent her a song i promise to send.

She replied later saying she was very tired and went to sleep early, and told me her plans for the day (studying)

She becomes more dry to my flirting, I use every chance I can. She likes chocolate and send me a photo of it. Later she wants to learn a recipe (already we talk on date how good i am making chocolate)

I tell her dont worry i will teach you how to make nice chocolate

Her reply: hehe

???

Before to compliments and flirting she would say something or react a certain way like thank you and emoji or kisses. 

Now seems dry and the date was very positive and i felt like she was a little girl excited about me all date.

(I know from people from the uni that she had a crush on me for some time but i was dating someone)

I really dont understand why she became dry. i was too invested? Texted everyday and thats a mistake? She just wanted to agree on the date to see how i am and she changed her mind the next day?

"Hi there,

I (M27)met a girl in a language course I am taking. We sat next each other on the first day and we hit it off and she was laughing her ass off. For the next couple of times we would talk and laugh til her uber arrives. The thing is she does everything that indicates that a girl is into you.

She is always standing very close to me holding eye contact, she always brushes against me when she is laughing and always laughing at everything I say and she doesn’t do that with anyone else. She remembers everything I tell her and she always follows up next time we meet on what I said and asks about personal details. Later she even changed her seat to be always sitting next to me. 

All this is good but when I tried to arrange a study date with her, she canceled twice ahead of time and she was overly apologetic and that she wants to meet with me and she is really into us hanging together. The first time she gave me a warning ahead of time that she may not make it coz an assignment came up and the second time was that she was gonna be very tired at the end of the day so I cancelled.

The question is, what do you guys think of this?
Is she flirtatious by nature or is this my bad luck setting up a date?

Things were going really well over text and the date went okay, in my opinion. There were a couple awkward silences, but I feel like we had quite a bit to talk about, for the most part.

The day after the date, we texted a little bit and said we both had a good time. Then, radio silence for a week. He finally reached out again and said he didn’t think we had chemistry and wouldn’t work out well.

"
So there is this guy that I have been having a kind of talking/dating situation with. We are both in grad school and co-manage a lab together. So inevitably, I see him multiple days in the week at school and we need to stay in touch very frequently for lab work. I fell for him first and told him how I felt, around the 1 month mark of getting to knowing each other (this was around 7 months ago). He politely said he thought we should keep things professional, to which I agreed and said let’s be good friends (so we can work/go to school together harmoniously). So since then he has been giving me mixed signals and doing things that make me feel like he is interested in me. I have been trying to move on from him, but it is difficult when I have to see him so frequently. Before, I used to text him first more often, and he would also take a while to respond. But recently he has been making sure that not a day goes by without at least texting. We have been having a pretty balanced and organic dynamic where we both take turns initiating conversations. And also in the recent past he has been showing signs that he is more protective of me - 1) when we went out to a mutual friend’s party, and I had to leave early, he was super concerned about me going back home and making sure I get home safe, 2) when we were with a group of friends at the dining hall, another guy offered to get me some food, and he said to that guy “I’ll get her something, don’t worry”, 3) and if we are with other people, he singles me out to say something to me specifically. We are from different cultural backgrounds, and he keeps consistently showing interest in my cultural activities and taking part in these things. He has also introduced me to to his parents. He is doing all these things but has not shown any signs of wanting to progress the relationship to something more solid.. 


This weekend (the whole of Friday and Saturday), he didn’t initiate a single message, and I just assumed he must be busy with final exams prep and other end of year stuff (as I also am..). Today he sends me this message: 

“Feels very strange that we didn't talk at all Saturday 😂 we're both clearly busy”

What am I supposed to make of this? 

I really like him, but at the same time I don’t think this will work out long term so I am trying to stay balanced through this all. Please advise!

"So I have made another post on this sub before, you can check it in my profile.

I was seeing this girl, I feel like she was just using me for casual sex. She disagreed. I told her that we simply wanted different things. I wanted a relationship and dates and conversations. She wanted late night rendezvous and casual encounters.

After nearly 2 weeks she messages me at 1 o'clock in the morning. Saying:

Her: ""John""

Me: ""Yea?""

Her: ""You awake?"" 

Me: ""Yea""

Her: ""I need cuddles""

Me: ""I don't""

Her: ""Ok damn""

After that she unfriended me of snapchat. I don't know, I feel like I did something wrong but did I? I mean I told her I wanted something more, and she responds weeks later asking me to come to her place at 1 am?! 

Did I do the right thing? What if I just kept seeing her, maybe then stronger feeling would've developed. Or we would've started going out on dates etc. 

I still have her on Instagram and a part of me wants to message her saying ""we should talk"". But I feel like that would undo all the strength it took to see my own worth.

But anyway, he kissed me. I was a bit shocked so I pulled away and stared at him. He kissed me again and I pulled back again. I literally had no words. Usually I’m able to speak but for some reason I just couldn’t.

We reunite again in August, and have sex. This time… the roles reversed. We had sex, and she said don’t cum inside of me. I said ok no problem. She was on top of me again, and I tried to get her off but I couldn’t in time. I was immediately apologetic and said “I’m sorry about that, it’s been an entire month I haven’t seen you, I tried to get you off”. I was apologetic, and based on the situation that happened in June I did not want to do that. She was taking her BC regularly so I trusted that everything would be ok and we had accidents before. In this situation, she got very angry at me and said “you raped me”. Long story short, we don’t speak again for a good few weeks we talk it out and she agrees that she went to far with what she said. 

Given the situation, was I sa’d?

Yes pls no use condoms and don’t be an idiot comments, I am doing that now, and have learned from my mistakes.

First one was when i was 25 then and fell for a colleague. at first i didn’t realise he was sending signals he was interested bc i didn’t even think anyone could be interested in me more though i had a chances with him. noticed far too late when he already got a girlfriend. Me being a naive dumbass thought I could make him dump her for me since all he did was complain about her (yeah i know that was dumb). Ended up that he dumped her but in the meantime started getting interested in a girl that claimed to be my friend but who secretly also had hots for him. When I told him i like him and if there was a chance he would be interested in dating he said he never loved me and that was the end of it.

"Gonna try to make this short and sweet. I'm in my second year of uni going to into my second semester. In my first year second semester I met this girl during a group project. We got along well and there was some flirting (like holding eye contact silently and looking at lips etc). Got her number during the group project and talked mainly about the work and some other stuff. 

First year then ends, I wasn't sure I liked her at this point but I knew there was something there. During that time though, due to the nature of our course being male dominated, she has two close guy friend's which I'm cool with. But one of them gave non verbal cues that he was annoyed with me during the project, assuming cuz of how close I was with her. Btw never spoken to the guy and have no relationship with him.

Second year came around, without the excuse of the group project and the guy always around we haven't talked much. Though I've caught her staring at me a few times and would look away when I'd look, pretty adorable. I'm pretty sure she likes me too.

Anyways, if I'm to ask her out I'm obviously gonna get closer with those in her social group but I don't know about this guy.

"Hi ya'll,

I'm a 21M, senior in college. In terms of dating history, I had a relationship of 1.5 years and got emotionally cheated on and was dropped for someone else by my ex not even a month after we broke up. I developed severe anxiety through that breakup, likely creating my anxious attachment.

I didn't seriously look to date for about a year after that breakup. Worked hard on myself, gained 40 pounds in the gym cause I had lost so much weight, and although it's cliché, used the pain I endured to become a better and more confident version of myself. It's an incredible feeling to get to the point where you're grateful for what you went through. I'm at that point and have put that ex behind me. But the anxiety with dating still lingers...

Fast-forward to today, I fell for one of my close girlfriends this semester in the fall. We went out for a month and a half, built fantastic chemistry, had great dates. This felt like the first time I had built a solid friendship as a foundation towards a pending relationship. ""Date your best friend,"" all those sought-after relationship styles. It felt right. It felt good. I was excited.

She was honest with me as we went out about how she has trouble discerning her feelings. She has never been in a relationship before or had many things with guys. But, she gave me the confidence to keep things going because she always reciprocated interest through her actions and she always expressed enjoyment of spending time together. But, after 1.5 months, she was unable to firmly state she had feelings for me. At this point I was pretty burnt out on planning dates and putting effort in if she wasn't going to be able to get there emotionally. It was sad but we decided to end things. No hard feelings. Mainly just confusion.

Keep in mind, I see this girl everyday, so we continued to interact regularly after we ended things. I decided I'd leave the door open, continue to flirt with her to help her realize what we have. She never got upset/annoyed that I was being persistent. And *voila*. She comes back after another month and a half to confess that she has really thought about things and that she likes me and wants to make things work. This is all I had wanted. We were both excited. Things never had been toxic after the initial breakup. I could tell her intentions were genuine and that she had really thought things out. 

This happened about 3 weeks ago. Sadly, as we start getting back into it/going out again, I developed severe anxiety about the situation. Something didn't feel right. I thought our interactions were off. I figured it would pass because we were getting used to it again but the anxiety became debilitating. I was extremely nervous to see her or spend time with her. I finally decided to trust my gut and call things off because things didn't feel right.

l felt relief from my anxiety but now have been left with pure sadness. Why couldn't I feel good about things. This had seemed like everything I wanted. I felt *good* about it initially. I got the girl back. But then I spiraled. And I have no idea why. I miss her and truly wanted things to work out. But I knew I couldn't live with this consistent, gut wrenching feeling. I feel like a mess with relationships. I'm hoping if I can figure things out then maybe I can talk with her again and see where things go. But at what point do you just call it?

"I met this guy at a game night meet up with friends. We all hung out after the meet up and went out to eat. One of my guy friends kept asking the new guy stupid questions at dinner and when the check came my guy friend announced he was broke and his account was in the negatives. It was embarrassing. The new guy picked up his tab. 

The new guy is cute, intelligent, funny and kind. Even after that event we all exchanged instagrams.. I’m texting him on ig but idk if it’ll be alright if I ask him on a date? 

Here are my fears: 
1. Before the embarrassing moment I told the new guy that my guy friend and I are good friends. I know people judge others based off who they keep as company. 
2. I don’t wanna look desperate and I was taught to let the guy ask first. Idk I’m tired of waiting for a guy to ask me out.. they never do or we end up talking for too long and just become friends or never talking again. (I’m not ugly, or fat btw lol 😂 ) 
3. We are different ethnicities. That could be tough but idk he seems chill. 

…. Would that be a bad idea? Did claimingg my broke friend as being my good friend ruin my chances? Should I just talk to him until he asks me out? What’s the verdict?

"My gf and I met in a dating app, and we are 10.000 km away basically, im from Spain, and she is from the US, we have been together for 3 months (we talk everyday and do video calls kinda often), because of work and university (and saving money) we are gonna be able to meet at the beginning of 2025

not gonna lie, we are doing SO great so far right now, but there are some problems when it comes in terms of personality and my personal taste on that (from now on i will be referring to her personality only)

she has things that i LOVE, when it comes to the way she expresses love, how hardworking she is, common hobbies, some basics values and ethics we share (monogamy, cheating) as also basics things any serious relationship should have to last (communication, support in each other, trust, etc)

I know no one is perfect but at the same time there are things i dont like, like i feel she doesn't have the level of ambitions im looking for and fits with mine, she is someone with a lack of emotional intelligence (impulsive, lot of insecurities in general, etc), someone who gets influenced very easily (have friends i dont consider good people for the things she tells me, and in general she doesn't have strong mind), she is very emotional, have way more sexual experience than me ,etc

this will sound a bit cruel but trying to be honest is the best thing i can do for my partner, im looking for someone who is more male ish ? i somehow feel she is just too feminine, and i feel she share things that u can find easily in the average woman in terms of that girly personality and insecurities, so i dont feel she is someone special, i feel we just share some common things and visions but its not enough, plus let's say my english skills are 7 out of 10, so still gotta improve that (she only speaks english)

"Hi everybody!

Dating in NYC is tough. There’s so many options that people become disposable really quickly and it gets frustrating.

I left a long term relationship over the summer and got back on the apps. I did decently on there for a little bit, going on multiple first dates a week for about a month. 

casual sex is not my thing. I just felt shitty and lonely during that period. I met a girl who said she was looking for a relationship and stopped going on other dates! All of my friends said this was a bad idea and that I should keep as many backups as possible but that just seems scummy to me.

2 or 3 months later and we see each other a couple of times a week, she sleeps at my apartment most of those nights, and we’re exclusive. She introduced me to all of her friends and her sister and is always holding my hand/arm in public. I even met some of her coworkers at an event. By all accounts she would normally be my girlfriend and we would have feelings for each other? Right?

Here’s my problem: she isn’t comfortable with any sort of emotional or romantic talk and it’s starting to hurt me.

I referred to us as a couple half jokingly and she seemed grossed out/annoyed. I tell her i “really like her” and she just changes the subject or says something like “aww” or “thanks”. I take her to dinner a lot, we act like a couple in social situations, but she is totally unable to express any sort of affection towards me. She even told me her friends really liked me before admitting that she likes me. 

Is this just the era we’re in? do people just not want any sort of emotional intimacy anymore? Should i accept that and date somebody who makes me feel unwanted? 

 I want her to be my girlfriend because we have a great time together, she’s beautiful/brilliant/funny, and I don’t want to go back to first dates or casual sex. She’s the first person I’ve genuinely liked since my ex of three years. I just don’t think she’s interested in me that way despite her actions showing otherwise.


any advice? what’s your read on this? do i have a chance to ever have my emotions reciprocated or am i stuck in the land of situationships?

" I recently got a date with the most beautiful girl (literally) and surprisingly she was the one who approached me. We both are in second year in different colleges. And trust me, I am literally mesmerized by her and her great personality (great talents too). But as our date comes close, and we gradually text, I came to know that she is from a rich background and lives a luxary lifestyle, won't say spoiled because I don't know what appropriate means to her folks. I came to realise that with all my funds, it would only suffice 2 dates and after that I just can't pay and I can't ask my parents to cover the expenses (even if I don't tell the truth).

"30M making 70k in VHCOL nyc area as a teacher. 

I know there are competing philosophies on  the importance of income. 

My understanding was that as long as you have a good job and enough money to support yourself with a solid and executable 5 year plan, the dollar amount doesn’t matter as much. 

Lately however, I’ve had a lot of pressure from family and well meaning friends suggesting that my income is considered unattractive to women, and blame this fact on why my recent dating experiences haven’t been very good. 

I’ve had no problem getting dates at 25 making 55k, but they say now that I’m 30, women are looking for someone capable of taking care of them more. 

I’m working on my masters, which will earn me more money in the long term, but realistically my cap is going to be 110k in 8 years + cost of living raises unless I get a new career or a job in admin, which I’m not interested in. 

Even 100k doesn’t go all that far here, but my schedule as a teacher does provide me with more opportunity to spend with family than if I worked a corporate job with a lot of overtime, (as I used to as a legal assistant)

"So Im currently a single person 29M last major relationship i had was 7 years long, and we broke up... two years ago now.  Since then ive booped around and seen a couple people but nothing serious.  Last person I tried dating was 3 month long distance thing but it didnt last.  

Recently while some friends were visiting from out of town we went to a local friends house for a pit fire.  While there we were all joking around and laughing.  We ended up taking about BG3, now I shot it out there id like to have someone to play that with cause i get stunned by choice. 

 A friend of mine 29F replied that she would play it with me.  Now back in the early summer of this year she had offered to come on hikes with me as well but that fell through cause we both forgetful and shy.  We both are fairly introverted and shy, but damn was i going to let that go by.  So we've been playing for over a month now, and having a blast.  Laughing, staying up late, and hanging in person.  We saw a movie together, I went to her place before dnd one night and we baked cookies and exchanged christmas gifts.  She also came to my place and we went out for dinner before I left on a trip to see my parents,  which is where I am now.  I'm usually a huge anxious person but with her i havent been feeling that, and just been naturally booping her through texts and laughing while we play games or hang out in person.  We play BG3 once or twice a week.

I kinda started feeling that maybe there was the start of a spark between us but i havent done this in over 7 years, even thought of like trying to take the steps to date in person.  Shes been receptive to every hug ive offered, she got me a puzzle box for christmas and stuffed it with lots of neat little gifts.  I Plasma cutted, painted and welded her a little thing.  When she came over last i told her that us hanging out meant a lot to me, which she said Awe but then also teased me and laughed in a happy way.  At dinner i also awkwardly complimented her usual style of dress as it came up in conversation, which made her smile and laugh similarily to before.  She didnt lean away when i leaned close to read something she was showing me on her phone.  I dunno... i havent done this in a long time.

"The gist is, he is moving out of his place and into my apartment. 

Why? Because his place wouldn’t allow me over more than a handful of nights a week (per the lease,) and my dog wasn’t exactly welcome by the landlords. 
My apartment is month-month, and $1000/ month cheaper than his current place. 

He wants to save for a down payment on a house for us, so we agreed it makes more sense for him to move in with me and then save the difference he would be spending for rent at his current place for our future house.

We also agreed he would take over paying rent for my place when he moves in, so that it feels “ours” and not mine anymore, and that he would pay for any groceries required for meals we would be sharing( mainly dinners,) or lunches for him to take to work ( I was formally a private chef, so my culinary skills are often above casual local restaurants, and we both have dietary restrictions which is why he’s asked for this and I happily agreed.) I’ll be the primary cleaner/ household chore person as he works a lot.

My concern is that he keeps bringing up that he’s covering rent “for me” and that his grocery bills will go up because it’s more than what he normally buys for himself… I’m trying not to panic over these seemingly small comments, but it makes me feel really uneasy, and I can’t help but flag that he either doesn’t want to, or can’t fulfill the role of a provider for a stay at home wife lifestyle.

Currently, I still have to work to cover my other expenses. He only pays if it’s trips he ask me to join( Im unable to earn when I take time off, and have to pay for dog care so in a way I’m still paying for these trips,) dates, or groceries for when I cook for us. I’m really not an extravagant person and have never asked him to pay for my upkeep/ my bills/ or spending money in our relationship. 

I’ve told him I won’t stop working full time, unless I’m engaged to him and he has taken over all of my/ our basic living expenses( rent/ utilities/ groceries/ insurance/ dog related food/ insurance expenses as my dog would then be “our” dog na not just mine.)

I feel this is totally fair, considering I am afforded no real safety net for cutting back my earnings/ potential earnings, until I am married to this man with a signed pre-nup protecting us both in the event of a dissolution of the relationship. 

We’ve gotten in some arguments over it because he feels the covering rent and some groceries means I can and should cut back on working and worrying about my own survival… am I the one who’s overthinking this, or am I right to be concerned that he may not be able to protect and provide to the level a stay at home wife requires? 

He wants a wife who will devote herself fully to him, be able to travel on all his business trips, have meals ready, and maintain the home and herself, and I’m happy to do that, but not as a GF, who is still paying her own way through life…

"I(25M) basically want to get advice on how to find GF/dates. I am having a very hard time with that topic. Let me talk about myself a bit. 25 yo male, working from home, financially doing great compared to most people in my country, average looks I would say(though when I put on my glasses it adds a nerdy aura which I don't like tbh), 190cm tall and a fairy fit looking body.

In the past, I spent most of my time at home and WFH made it even worse.  I would call myself an introvert. Talking to people, going out tires me a lot. Do not have any dating experience mainly due to these reasons. I go to events abroad or different cities monthly due to the nature of my work and had few hookups in these places in the past years but I am looking for something serious.  I have been trying really hard in the last 6 months but no chance.

Here is what I have tried so far

* Asked my girl friend to introduce me to available, nice girls in their circle
* Dating apps(wish I did not)
* Approaching to girls and engaging in small talks

The problem I have is how difficult it is to meet girls and date in my country. Here are some reasons

* Unbalanced supply-demand in the dating scene. There are 100 men chasing 1 girl.
* It is frowned upon if you approach girls randomly
* Increasing domestic violence and abuse towards women. If you are a stranger, you are a threat in the eyes of women. Sometimes they even call you creep for talking to them
* Dating apps are full of OF girls, scammers who wants to get free drinks etc.
* I would say ego level &amp; standards of the women here(no offense, just stating my observation) is high mainly because of the supply-demand unbalance. Local men dm and try to flirt every female being.

It's not like I am not familiar to talking to girls. I frequently visit abroad for business trips and managed to flirt and hookup with girls who were way above my level in terms of looks. Same goes for friendly talks too. I talk to a lot of women and men at the events in a friendly nature. It is just that I cannot just go and talk to girls here. I used to do it like that in other countries like Japan, Ukraine, Germany etc.  I would be thrilled to visit other countries and find suitable partners there. However, it is not feasible unless I live there. I am looking for LTR/serious relationships.

Sharing hobbies, interests, showing off our art, having 4 conversations at once, etc. Everything seems to have been exciting, fine, active, and fun up until a few days ago where I brought up a topic we had previously discussed around gaming together and suggested we play a game she recommended to me that I have been trying out (she had previously said she'd like to get online together sometime after I had asked and even added me on a gaming platform and I've been sort of updating her here and there on my progress and she's given advice). She mentioned that it's hard to find time. I said that it could be cool and sympathized with my own experiences of never having time to play online either. In the same messages, I also thanked her (sincerely) for providing a resource for learning more about a minor mental health issue we share, and that I was using it per her suggestion and it's been pretty invaluable filling in gaps in understanding.

Edit: I also watched their story and responded to it because they were listening to something I'm also fond of. This has all been super typical of our conversations up to this point.

She opened my messages and for the first time, left it on read. No response whatsoever. And I'm genuinely confused. I can see how maybe I was being pushy?

My boyfriend (mark) does enjoy to party and hangs out with his friends alot, since the school year started. Ive noticed a few changes around this stuff such as, his constant want to go clubbing. We have had discussions before about how neither of us are comfortable with eachother going (nothing to do with trust) and we promised we wudnt. Last time i saw Mark was 2 weeks ago and he brought up the topic about how he would never go etc. 

Last night was the night his friends were going. It started as him calling me, claiming how bored he was and straight away i knew where this was going. He told me he doesnt care about what promises he made and how its not worth him being bored for 1 night, than making me happy and respecting our boundaries. This was followed by a one sided argument which he proceeded to insult me, mock my anxiety, and obviously made me cry. He told me im crying like a r***** and that its all fake to manipulate him. He told me if his friends knew how stupid i was they would hate me. I told him to relax and i asked him to listen to me remind him of the conversations we have had prior, he told me i had 1 hour to decide if i wanted to “let” him clubbing or he would break up with me . I tried to call him a few times to which he all declined and it turns out he spent all his night on discord playing video games. It has been over a day since this happened and ive heard nothing from him. 

He never went last night but he told me he would before i see him again. After telling me that i will never see him again. 

Should i wait for him to contact me or i text him and should i stand my ground with the clubbing or just pet him break boundaries???",Please LDR - boyfriend advice,18nu493,1703184464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18nu493/please_ldr_boyfriend_advice/,
"Hi so I'm 19M and a couple weeks ago I made friends with my Neighbor a few doors down 18F. Now I'm a bit of a loser for a 19 year old as I have no friends and haven't had friends for about 6 years when I left school. I've always been a bit depressed about this fact but I'm an introvert and don't go out anywhere to meet anyone and even if I did I am to shy to do anything about it. So this girl I'm freind with now I have met her before when I've seen her down the road but we never spoke much until one day I was doing something and she approached me and asked if I could teach her a bit of what I was doing as she is training to do the same job as I am. So I said yes and got her number and since then we have become really good friends and we both really like each other. I know her parents well as I spoke to them before I even knew her and they like me,they even keep hinting about us possibly getting together in the future which I would really like as I do really like her and would honestly consider spending the rest of my life with her if she feels the same way. Now I haven't told my parents everytime we've gone out somewhere together because of how they react but I have told them about 3 times we did but I only told them after it had already happened so they couldn't stop me. Anyway those 3  times we went out together as friends my parents were trying to embarrass me about it as I've never had a female friend before which is annoying but I can deal with it. But today when me and my dad were alone he basically put me on the spot and started asking questions about us because we went out yesterday which I did tell my mum about but not my dad because I never had the opportunity but obviously my mum told him which I have no problem with at all. But my dad did this at a time where there wasn't alot of time to have a proper conversation about it and he basically made it really clear that he didn't want me to see her but neither of my parents have actually met her. They keep telling me I need a friend because I have no one, and now I have a freind and possibly soul mate it seems they changed there mind and want me to be lonely instead. It feels like my whole world is collapsing on top of me and I don't know what to do about it. I'm not just gonna not see her anymore just because my parents don't want me to for unknown/unclear reasons but at the same time I don't know what I can do about it. And I can't move out of my parents place and be away from them because I just don't have the money to do it.

"Hey y’all!
I met this lovely guy on a dating app and we’ve been talking nonstop for about 4 days now. I mean we put our attention towards each other almost 24/7 and we can we talk about anything. 

First we were getting to know each other, I like his lifestyle, interests, and his goals aligned with mine. Our conversations just flow smoothly, we can be making jokes towards each other and the next thing you know we’ve ended up on the topic of politics or religion. And it’s funny, we’re both in our early 20s still trying to figure ourselves out and we’re acting like two teenagers who are obsessed with each other.

I would say we both are opinionated but we can have a cordial, respectful discussion about things and agree to disagree, which we haven’t done a lot. A lot of his options I agree with anyway. I can talk to him about anything and everything and vice versa. He flatters me a lot and I really like him. We’ve FaceTimed for hours and sometimes we get to the “awkward silence” part but it’s not even awkward it’s just soothing and nice. I feel like I have a special connection with him. We already have a date idea planned just trying to see where it’ll fit into our schedules. Honestly never met a person so perfect he is everything I look for in a guy and not to mention he is very handsome too.

It’s honestly scary because I have never liked a person this much before like I told him I was willing to love and take care of him and he would do the same for me. I really want to go ahead and start a relationship with him, he’ll be my first boyfriend ever. But part of me still wants to wait until we meet in person a couple of times and see how things can hit off. I read somewhere texting is fake intimacy but I don’t know, I feel like we’ve created a special bond and we have technology for a reason so we can communicate with each other.

Love is scary but I like the feeling it’s so new and refreshing, it feels kind of magical.

But after I moved to denver I had 1 date and since then nothing more. Idk what changed? I do date for long term so I'm not being a fuck boy but seems like when I try lately I get nothing. 

I use dating apps like bumble and hinge and tinder. And lately they all have been dry when normally I have a few dates lined up to either see where it goes or make friends.

"Hi, need a little advice/ cheering up I guess.
Little context because I think it is relevant and important: I'm poly, I have a ltr with a partner of multiple years. I'm also bisexual, afab/nb in my late twenties. I'm also leaving the country for an extended period of time soon. (Please do not lecture me for being polyam, that's not why I'm here, everyone here is consenting and fully aware of everything.)

So I went back to the dating scene and apps 2 months ago, after a very failed first relationship in the context of my polyam adventure.

I wasn't expecting anything, initially it was more of a joke because with my ltr we wanted to see how tinder was fucked up when presenting as a woman.

Then I met a very VERY cute person (MtF), and we had like, I dunno, more than 7 dates in the span of 1 and a half month? They are amazing to my eyes. Cute, beautiful, unique, smart, the whole thing.

The other night we were drunk at their place and had sex and cuddles, it was so so great.

She was here last night, but no drinking this time and... I was just stuck. I wasn't able to initiate, I wasn't able to read the room (so I just didn't do a move cuz I was scared as hell). We had a good time watching movies and cuddling, but nothing else. Not much kissing, just little cute ones. I said sorry this morning for being shy etc, and hoped I would know what she was thinking about that nothing happened, she just said, that's ok. I jokingly said I was horny as hell tho and that I felt stupid, and she just laughed. 

All my partners until now were huge chatter boxes, and her being less chatty (also over text, she's busy and has her own life thank god!), throws me off. I guess I equate the number of sentences and replies as to how much a person likes me back.

I'm usually not insecure, but this new dating experience made me... I'm scared of hurting the person, going too fast because I know I can get attached, making them feel uncomfortable, asking for too much too soon. She never really stated that she didn't enjoy anything I've said or done up to now, but it feels like she is not 100% interested? I think she's really different than me in how she communicates appreciation and I have to learn all of that.

Also me moving away makes whatever was happening until now... well, uncertain. Maybe that scares her too? When I said I was sad about going away she just said... yeah me too in a very neutral tone, but didn't elaborate, and that threw me off again. I guess it's really a learning curve to get to know someone's communication style when I'm used to such a precise way with my LTR.

I dunno, am I overthinking folks? Why am I so insecure? I mean it's been a bit over a month, but the idea she might not like me, and I might not see her very soon again made me ugly cry after she left.

"I (29m) have been seeing this girl (27f) I’m interested in for close to 2 months.

It’s been going great in that we meet once/twice per week, have great sex, and seemingly have similar wants/expectations/boundaries.

However I’ve hit an issue I didn’t really expect and could use some input on - she’s backpacking for 4 weeks halfway across the world. She planned this well before me and am very happy to see her live her life. I just didn’t really plan to feel this way about her this soon and have a concern about how it might affect us.


I’m not 100% clear on where she is with me at this junction. We’ve expressed we’re not seeing other people, and keeping options open in the context of ‘seriously’ dating someone (before exclusivity) just isn’t what we want, but I do feel exactly what this means is a bit vague when I spoke to her about it - which is exciting while actively dating, just not in a 4 week absence.


This is the bit I’m struggling with - I don’t mind direct communication and getting rid of the vague. I do feel she may be a bit different in that it makes her uncomfortable. 

So I would to somehow address the vague/keep progressing with her while avoiding two scenarios:

1)  that I’m ‘pinning her down’ before she leaves just to satiate my insecurity here.

2)  the situation is purposely left vague so she can fully explore her trip the way she had originally intended.

Advice/similar experiences and how they resolved appreciated!


Extra context: she’s highly ambitious, high sex drive, but a bit closed off about past relationships/encounters, somewhat awkward when initiating sex. I personally don’t subscribe to the explicit exclusivity boundary - if I want to see someone, I’ll focus my effort -  but I know that’s a losing battle in modern dating.",Backpacking during early dating stages - help!,18ntrlq,1703183552.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ntrlq/backpacking_during_early_dating_stages_help/,

We slept together first date (which is SO unlike me and I know it wasn’t super smart). Sleeping with someone is a bigger deal for me and like I said I probably shouldn’t have but things happen. I am a very anxiety ridden person and struggle with anxiety a lot (I’m trying to get on a new medication). I find it very difficult to find someone I connect with that and have the same interests and stuff with so I was really excited to have had an amazing connection with him. He is such a sweetheart and talks to me like we are dating and always has the biggest smile on his face when we are together. I asked him the other day over text if he was talking to other girls and he said he is. 

He has JUST gotten back into dating and I was the first person he met and he said he has narrowed it down to a few girls he wants to meet bc he didn’t know if we would match as well as we did and he just wants to meet them before he commits to me but I’m his favorite. I am split here. He says once he meets these x number of girls he will decide. That makes me feel like a cattle at an auction. BUT at the same time we have only been on two dates and he really doesn’t owe me anything. I’m not talking to anyone else bc I am more of an exclusive personality type and I also don’t have any other good options lol. 

I guess what I’m asking here is, am I being anxious about this for no reason? What would you think? I don’t want to be stringed along while he goes and sleeps with other girls (which he claims he won’t do but I wanna say umm you slept with me just fine so?). To me he is either being a sneak and just wants to play around with girls and then maybe get into something serious. OR he is just anxious about jumping right into something with the first girl and feels like he owes it to the others to give them a chance just to meet them. OR he finds something he doesn’t like about me so he is looking to see if he can find someone better. 

I told him that’s fine I understand your perspective and thank you for the honesty and ngl I do feel a little not good enough or like I’m being compared (cause he said he understands if I feel those things but it’s not like that) and those feelings are valid just like your feelings are valid.

 have been in a long distance situationship I'd say for almost 4 years. The minute we started talking there was a undeniable connection between us. He's never been ok with the distance but he also couldn't deny how great we got along so we continued this thing. We'd see each other 2-3 times a month and we really aren't super far from each other. Only about a 1 hour and 20 minutes sometimes less sometime more depending on traffic. I on the other hand was ok with the distance only because I honestly feel this is the person I am meant to spend my life with. We've both tried dating other people closer which has been unsuccessful for both of us. I am just tired of trying to convince him to try for a committed long distance relationship which would mean I'd be able to see him more but still not enough for him. I asked for space to figure things out for me and he fought me on it.. Just doesn't understand why we can't just stay friends but finally he agreed so we are on a break/needing space. Do you think the space might make him reconsider things?

I just don’t understand. I’ve been over-analyzing everything to try and figure out what happened.

Could it have been something I did or said? Could just be afraid of having a relationship or an LDR? Could she be playing games with me? Is she just mad that I didn’t give her my phone number?

"For some context - I was in an 8 year long relationship that ended 3 years ago and left me with huge anxiety around trusting people. In the last 3 years I have had one FWB, and have been on 2 dates with 2 different guys that went as far as one date, and then I never saw them again due to the feeling of liking them but then freaking out.

I have been on 3 dates with a new guy and they have all been very successful dates. We have a lot in common, he is super sweet and makes me feel calm and relaxed. Nothing thus far should be scaring me off but last night we did get a little bit intimate (no full on sex) and I have spent today as an anxious mess.

My definition of an anxious mess is being on the verge of tears all day, not having an appetite, lots of negative chitter chatter in my head, heart palpitations, the shakes, feeling like I could puke in spite of not having eaten. I forced myself to go on a walk with my friend but have since curled up in bed and cried. I want to be able to enjoy a nice thing and to not feel scared but I feel like even the slight thought that for whatever reason the relationship could end I'm like - what's the point? Why put myself through getting to know someone and develop feelings for them just so they can eventually leave me?

"Alright, 

Been talking and dating this girl. Things got really weird. She went distant and I thought I lost her but she would never “leave” me for real. She would still talk like we were going on dates. But she would be afraid to meet up with me and cancel last second. 

I said enough was enough and ended it. Not even a week later she finally texted me. And things became clear(er) for me. 

She said she thought I was too good to be true. That she didn’t think I was actually real or would ever find someone. She never expected our dates to go so well and never thought she would find a relationship because she has been looking for a long time and she was always disappointed. She said she never had been on as many dates with anyone else and grew so attached. And she basically had asked if I could forgive her for her actions and how she treated me after nearly being ghosted. 

And so I did forgive her and we talked some more. The summary of it is, is that she wants to be in a relationship with me and I am everything she has been looking for. HOWEVER, she said her mental state is off. She said if she jumps in right this second that she is afraid she will hurt me and be breaking up/coming back a lot(sounds like commitment/trauma/trust issues according to my therapist). 

So we both talked it out and agreed it would be best for her to take care of herself, and I could go and work on myself and some other things in the meantime time. I had asked for space for awhile, most likely until she is “ready” to give it a shot. Because I don’t want my feelings to be hurt, as I am preparing myself for the possibility of being hurt if she never heals or never comes back. (She is going to therapy now since she met me, so she could work on herself). 

I thought it was very mature to realize not wanting to hurt me and also being self conscious enough to reach out for help. I just wish she took care of this BEFORE meeting me. But in her defense, I guess she never expected to meet me. It was the first girl I met up with since breaking up with my ex of 8 years. So naturally I’m just good at listening/ relationships/kind and caring and things in that regard in general when in a relationship. Plus I’ve been doing work before dating and such by going to therapy myself. I guess she just really didn’t expect to meet someone that was able to have a relationship? I don’t know, that’s what it sounds like. 

Anyway, now I am here heartbroken. Because it was right there at my fingertips. But I’ll execute patience and also protecting myself and my feelings. It just hurts, but I hope we make it through. If not then the silver lining is that I helped someone reach out for help.

"One thing I saw coming down the pike for many years is the greater focus of younger women on careers over having families, and there was a lot of talk how patriarchy and marriage were repressive. This is in spite of the fact that my mother is a stay at home housewife and married and was the one enforcing purity culture onto me, and my dad was doing work he didn't necessarily always want to do because he valued other people more than himself. I always felt unsettled when the feminists called this oppression to them in some way.

I always wondered like okay, but then why all the focus on career when the women are likely to drop out of the workforce when they have kids? I was seeing this on LinkedIn today - the discussion about how childcare was prohibitively expensive, and in the comments half the posters mentioned that one partner dropped out of the workforce. I've heard this many, many times.

For me personally it feels like a catch 22. You have to hold out until you can take the classic male breadwinner role, you are looked at as creepy in some way to date significantly younger, and to date women your age means you don't really have much benefit from all the time spent in career preparation if she is going to become a person to look after the kids anyways...

Like okay as a single male this is difficult, because realistically I don't see much of a benefit of dating women my age if that is what they are going to do versus women that just want to have kids sooner, but then I'm seen as creepy or weird in some way for thinking that. It seems kind of like a raw deal if you are a guy interested in having a family

Who do you feel gives better dating advice to someone who is single:

-in a long term relationship or married and has not been in the dating scene for a while

-single person who actively dates but doesn’t typically have long term relationships

I argued that on the topic of relationships and marriage, the opinions of someone who is single is not invalid. Their perspective is of someone who experience something that didn’t work so now they know what to look out for, what to avoid.

"I’ll try to keep this brief. Essentially I (f early 30’s) matched with a guy (m mid 30’s) with whom I have a lot in common. We live a bit of a distance apart but he was willing to drive to me to go on a date recently, which I very much appreciated.

The date went very well! There were no awkward gaps in conversation, the topics flowed and there was a lot of joking back and forth with one another as well as flirtatious comments made, though nothing that crossed a line. There were questions beyond the typical surface-level “what’s your favorite…” type asked and discussed and it seemed like we both genuinely enjoyed ourselves. 

At the end of the night after walking to my car there was a kiss and he seemed very eager to see me again, asking if he could once again drive to me within the next three days, which I said worked for my work schedule. We let one another know when we’d each arrived home as agreed, and there was minimal conversation the day after which had carried over from the night before. Then there was a tiny bit of conversation the day we’d said we were both free (three days after the date), but no mention of another date and we did not end up getting together that day.

I’ll be the first to acknowledge that I’m getting back into dating and have not necessarily had the best past experiences in dating, so my perception may be a bit off…. but I’m at a bit of a loss here. We’re both busy and we both have our own lives, but why be so excited to see someone again then barely respond to texts? If interested in another date but not texting intermittently, that’s fine.. but why not say something to the effect of “I’ve got a busy week ahead, but I’ll reach out to you about that second date in a couple days.”

At this point I’ve been left on read for a couple days asking about a hobby of his. Is this the point at which I’m supposed to give up? Or is this more likely just a case of someone getting busier than anticipated and not thinking to communicate a change in schedule? Is it worth trying to reach out after another few days to strike up another conversation?

I’m not daft enough to say I see a future with this guy after a single date, but I definitely do see potential and have an interest in continuing to get to know him to see where things potentially could go.

I'm definitely into her but the signals she is sending me are mixed. I truly cannot decipher if she's just not very interested or just a poor communicator. Even when we first matched, she was slow at responding and not giving me much to work with over text. But when we meet up the conversation is always great and we seemed to have solid compatibility on all three dates. I'm guessing this is an issue many people have dealt with before so I figured I'd ask my reddit friends for advice. For further context we both live in NYC where the dating pool is massive and people are constantly very busy. 

Some signs that she could be into me

* I called her a couple of days ago and we talked for 40 minutes
* She texted me ""have a safe flight"" out of the blue the day I was flying out of town 
* She asks me some questions about myself over text and call 
* When I told her that I'd like to see her again after our last date she responded ""I'd like to see you again too!"" 
* When on our dates she seems to ""touch"" me, indicating attraction 
* The conversation is great on our dates and when we call 
* She's agreed to three dates 
* Kissed me 

Some signs that she could not be very interested 

* She updated her dating app profile sometime after our third date (I'm also going on other dates, just to keep my options open but haven't updated my profile) 
* She rarely initiates conversation with me over text and I have been the one to call her every time we've talked on the phone 
* She hasn't tried to schedule any dates, it's been my initiative for all three dates. (She did tell me that she prefers her dates to make the plans but still)
* For our last date she only had availability for around 2.5 hours for a short coffee date during the last weekend. She told me she had plans with her friends both Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday (a little suspect, however it was the last weekend before the holiday and she's grew up in the city which we live so she has lots of local friends). Still if I was really that significant to her I'd like to see more effort. During the date she did seem to be on her phone a little more than usual but I guess with all the plans going on she had to coordinate and be available. 
* I asked her if she would like to come over to my house next weekend on Friday the 29th to make dinner and she told me that ""she's not sure if she'll be back into town by then but will let me know"" and ""if I don't remember to let you know by mid next week, please text me and ask again, I'm very forgetful"". This seems suspect because if I was really that important to her she would remember but I guess it's good that she wants me to follow up with her. However, I also understand that family comes first during the holiday season (very confused by this situation in particular). 

I guess I would just like to know sooner rather than later so I can move on if she's not interested. Also is it acceptable to just ask her if she's interested?

"Hey everyone, I apologize for the long backstory, but I'll try to keep things brief. As the title implies, I'm (28M) starting to fall for my (29F) roommate. We've known each other for the better part of two decades and have mutual friends. While objectively she is attractive, I never really saw her as someone I wanted to date or more. Two years ago, I started spending more time with her because she was going through a rough patch, and it was then that I started developing feelings for her. After a few months I told her how I felt, and while she didn't exactly reject me, she also didn't say she felt the same towards me. All she said was, ""I have a lot of issues, and I'd want to work through those before I date someone and bring them into that mess."" I respected that, and then we continued hanging out over the next few weeks. During that time, she became more distant. I caught her in a few lies such as saying she was too tired to workout together, but would post videos of her going out dancing and drinking the same night. I took that as she wasn't interested, so I respectfully distanced myself to get over my crush on her and to better myself. After a few months, I was in a much better place in life and I felt that I was over her. We didn't see each other over the next year and half, but kept in touch here and there, mostly keeping things short.

Fast forward to earlier this year, she was looking for a place to live and asked one of my roommates if her and her younger sister could move in. My roommates and I talked about it for a few weeks, and despite my hesitation, we agreed on them moving in. Initially things were a little tense, and I'll admit that was on my part, but once she started asking for my help studying for nursing school, we started getting along again.

Surprisingly, living with her has been great. Normally I was the only one cleaning and organizing, so it's been a huge relief to have someone help me around the house. We catch up, talk about life, and it's gotten to a point where she gets upset when I clean or run errands without her. When I talk about eventually buying my own house, she jokes about living with me and shows me things we could buy for the house. Lately I've been stressed with work and she's taken notice, offering to help out anyway she can including offering to cook me food, give me a back massage, and lending an ear to talk about what's on my mind. Whenever she has to run errands, she always asks me to come along with her. When she's stressed about school or something else on her mind, she comes into my room and we talk into the early hours of the morning. Before this, she never really opened up about past trauma or her dating history. Now that she's finally opening up and we've been spending more time together, I've been starting to feel closer to her. I can tell she's changed and grown up since two years ago.

The issue is I'm not sure where to go from here. We haven't talked about what happened a few years ago, and frankly, I don't know if she remembers. She could be faking it, but she has admitted a lot of her memories from past few years have become a blur because of recent trauma and it shows. I'm also worried I'm reading too much into her actions. She is naturally a nurturing and caring person, and she could be doing all of these things with me because that's how she is, but she doesn't do these things with our other roommates. I don't want to make things awkward since we live together and I'm scared of potentially ruining a great friendship, but I'm also scared of not taking a chance and her ending up being ""the one that got away"".

"So about a month ago my then girlfriend decided she was no longer interested and broke of our relationship of three years. Things ended on relatively good terms but as one could expect I was still disappointed and hearthbroken. During our relationship we both got a (student) job at different departments at the same company where we are still working.

 When we where still together my ex and I  always sat together during our breaks. However the first work day after our breakup I walked in the canteen and suddenly realised I had to pick a new table. I looked around for a bit and then noticed a girl, that had just started working at my department at the company, was sitting alone. This girl is a solid 10/10 almost unapproachably hot. I wasn’t really interested in her at the time I just broke up and couldn’t care less about other (or any) girls but I figured it was a nice way of showing my ex(and myself) that I didn’t let the breakup effect my confidence. So I manned up and decided to sit down with the new girl. 

To my supprise we hit it of great she has a wonderful personality and we are now having all of our breaks together. And even though it wasn’t part of the plan (it never is is it?) I fell for her (and I fell hard). And I think that she might even be interested too!

 The problem with dating is that everything is easy once your not interested but pretty damm difficult once you actually care. Today is our last working day together before the company closes for Christmas and the new year. And I feel like I have to make a move, however I’m now very afraid to make things awkward with this work “friend”. 

Should I just ask her out, go for her number or insta or wait around a little longer(so another guy can sweep in and I can regret my life choices)

"I started dating a woman (39F) last month and my AA is being triggered. Unsure if I should attempt to use this as an opportunity to try to heal it or if it's just a situation that can't work for me.  
  
I haven't been in a legitimate ""relationship"" in a few years - mainly working on myself and whatnot, but I guess there are some things you just can't work on solo.  
  
She finalized the divorce of a long marriage earlier this year, and has joint custody of 2 kids.  
  
Things are intensely affectionate whilst in person, but overall we're taking it slow - she needs the time and space to understand her life post psychologically-abusive marriage, as well as to build confidence in the long term potential of our thing before even thinking about fully folding me into her life. I understand and accept this, and currently we see each other on a weekend here, a weeknight there - kinda sporadically.  
  
When not together, communication is sparse and somewhat impersonal. I don't know if this is normal for the situation, or if I'm being irrationally anxious about it. I think I'm trying to find a way to communicate a need for more attention without adding any pressure to her end - like more than one text a day, but I don't need or want a play-by-play of her entire life; I don't want her feeling like she needs to go out of her way to assuage my probably unfounded insecurities. At the same time, while I'm trying to, I guess, play it cool, I'm trying to not come across as deliberately uncommunicative/manipulative.  
  
I suppose it doesn't help that earlier on, after 3 dates, 2 of which led to ""sleepovers,"" she told me she was going to go on a date with someone she'd been talking to before we met who'd ghosted her and suddenly reappeared and asked her out. She said she wanted to ""see what the deal is"" and later said her view on it was more like a business meeting or whatever. This kinda wrecked me initially, but after some solid communication she said she was essentially sabotaging our thing, as she sometimes does with people she likes. Red flag, I know, but this whole thing led to deeper discussions about ourselves and further bonding. So, good overall, but I still get this nagging paranoia - what was she up to the other night when she was MIA until sending a generic text at 11pm? Was she legitimately mistaken about her schedule when she initially told me we'd be able to spend new years eve together, but now she's saying she has the kids, or...?  
  
Keep in mind she doesn't have a ton of experience dating as she was with her ex husband for her entire adult life. In my dating past, I've certainly pushed women away by being a needy pile of noodles.

"I have been casually dating this guy since late july, we agreed to keep it casual as he’s moving to another country next year. We message regularly, maybe 1-2 messages a day and usually respond to each other within a day and we’ll meet once or twice a month. He’s a very lovely guy, out of all the guys I dated he was definitely the nicest and he’s handsome although I wouldn’t say i’m physically attracted to him. I was okay with our arrangement up until recently as I realised I caught feelings so I’m thinking of ending it but I think maybe he already has. We met last saturday and had an amazing time, afterwards however the communication felt a bit off, he’s taken longer than usual to reply, I used to not get stressed over stuff like this but it’s all I’ve been thinking about lately. Idk if it’s bc I’ve been off work and have more time on my hands, when I didn’t care before I was usually distracted by something else like work or just other things I had to do but now I have some free time before I go back to work in the new year.

He is a busy guy and works quite long hours so I thought maybe he’s just preoccupied with work, I’ve asked my friends what they thought and they think I should just make the most of my time with him and just relax. I am also thinking I should just relax and let him respond when he wants to as it’s just general chit chat and nothing that requires an urgent response but I couldn’t help but feel that maybe he’s pulling back after our meetup on saturday. If that was the case I’d be really disappointed as I thought he’d be mature enough to tell me if he’s not interested in staying in touch anymore.

On the other hand I realised i’ve caught feelings and maybe I should end it.

"Basically this. I am dating someone where I initially found her pretty but as I kept getting to spend time with her, I realize she’s not exactly pretty but not ugly either. She’s just not my physical type.

My brain is so rotten out because of social media. I’m not a catch either and I find that if I kept going with my unreasonable standards, I’ll just end up alone. My standards are just too unrealistically high.

Her personality is cute though. I do find a lot of her mannerisms as cute and I find that typically initiate kissing with her, hugs and everything. And that I want her when we are being a bit physically intimate. I get turned on when I kiss her or when we cuddle. So I do find her attractive? Also, I absolutely adore her voice.

I feel like a complete ass. She likes me a lot but I have these thoughts and doubts and we have been dating for 4 months only. There’s a lot of other reasons that’s causing some doubts but that’s a different conversation.

Also, a few weeks ago, when she cried, I knew something inside me broke and I absolutely hated seeing her cry but now, it doesn’t affect me as much anymore. Idk why this changed or why I go hot and cold on her.

His teeth looked slightly yellow-ish on the first date (but maybe it was the lighting of the place) and much better (white) on the second date. I noticed he wore similar outfits on both dates and he definitely wore the same zip hoodie thing with his company's logo on it both times.

So I’m a female in her 30’s who recently matched with a male in his 30’s on bumble. We matched almost a month ago, went on one really good date and since then I haven’t seen him even though he lives 5 minutes away from me. We went on our first date a few days after matching. Everything seemed great but then he told me he was having family problems and that’s where problems with us started. 

He asked for space and didn’t text me the entire weekend even though we were texting everyday before then. Honestly thought he ghosted me. Then texts me that Monday saying he still wants to see me but flaked out due to a headache. I then asked to take things slow so he can focus on his things and then he guilt trips me into thinking I don’t wanna be there for him. I told him I would and that I’m still attracted to him and would even just do casual since it felt he’s not ready for a relationship or dating seriously given his family issues taking a toll on him. 

We agree to meet up on a Wednesday and after confirming he stood me up. Next day texts me he is not in a good emotional or mental state. So basically since then we’ve been texting everyday and sexting but he never wants to see me and always makes excuses. We are finally supposed to meet up this Friday but I honestly don’t think it’s going to happen. I’m talking to other guys now but I’m still thinking of him. Just seems he’s not interested in anything besides sexting and texting me. I’ve never been in this kind of situation before. I almost think he has another girlfriend but he still texts me everyday nonstop and sends me sexy videos of him at home.

"I don’t really know what to do with this relationship. Basically, I met him in July.(i told him my age within like 5 minutes of meeting him). Ever since I met him, my life’s been super eventful… ESPECIALLY at the get-go. He said he’s never been with anyone as young as me or around my age. It was also new to him as it was to me. Anyways so we both connected a lot through art and music and psychedelics. We have a lot of great sex. (im already pretty hypersexual.. bc of s/a experiences. i hate it sometimes). Anyways hes a really cool guy. Hes known among the ppl of the city pretty well. Hes very spiritual, friendly, smart, and popular. When it was the beginning of our relationship he was telling me he could be my manager help me get my music out which HE DID he got me a couple gigs through his friends in the industry and he’s introduced me to some other producers and artists. He took me out a lot since i hadnt rly explored this city much in the past year of me living here (i’m in my home country. I was basically deported from US last year august. i’m alone here withjust my sister. everyone else ive grown up with are in the states). I’ve had so many new, fun experiences since I’ve met him. Spiritual ones as well. The thing is, as time has passed things have changed a bit. I mean, i know naturally everything must eventually. But I mean, he admitted that he tried to be my manager so that he can get close to me. Hes also very sexual. Honestly kind of a sex addict. He said to me  last night (i guess in a joking matter) that I’m basically his human sex doll.

"Happens all the time even with women who aren’t catfishing per se but they’ll obviously use their best photos and then I’ll get them on Instagram (I refuse to have a blind date with someone without getting them on social media first after being fat fished for real) and realise that they’re using photos from a few years ago or they’ll have been tagged in some photos that lead me to realise that I’m unfortunately not even attracted to them.

How can I then cut contact without hurting their feelings and causing them to assume that it’s because I didn’t like what I saw (which is the case but I’d rather they didn’t know)?

My strategy so far has been going a few days without contact then telling them that some stuff has come up and my life is chaotic at the moment I’ll message them in a week or two, then in a week or two telling them that I’m not in a spot to date right now and I don’t want to lead them on so I can message them when I’m in a better headspace if they like - however whilst some of them have been understanding I feel a bit deceitful doing this as well.

Why do I have to carry the conversation? 


Yes, it could mean they are not interested in me. I get that, and yes, there are men who do the same, but when the woman initiates the conversation and talks actively in long messages, or she flirts back, or she asks us for a date but still doesn't ask questions back during it, then I have to wonder what she is expecting from me. 

I don't even ask yes-or-no questions. But I don't get even a ""How about you?"" Or ""What do you like?"" Sometimes not even a ""How are you?"" Or a simple ""you?""


Yes, maybe they just want sex and don't want to talk that much, but then why did they match with me or go out with me in the first place? I clearly communicate that I don't want random hookups. I want to get to know you. 


There is no sentence with a question mark at the end. I have to carry the whole conversation. And then I see in her profile that she is ""looking for a guy that can hold a conversation."" Well, believe it or not. I try! But the otherwise empty profile, does not help. 

At some point, I just start talking until she joins in. Like throwing cooked spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.

The date went pretty well and she said she had a good time but when I was dropping her off I got out and gave her a hug (which I have a feeling she felt awkward about that), and I said to her “text me when you get home so I know you got home safe” and she said she would, but it’s been over 30 minutes now and she hasn’t texted me.

He didn't respond to what I wrote, he didn't even open it. The thing is that he sent me some snaps (as a streak I think) of basically nothing.

"I'm 27M and I really have been working on myself this past year and it has made me feel so much better about myself and I'm more confident than ever. 

I officially became an engineer although I'm honestly pretty stupid but I'm working on it, I got a decent job, I dress well (up to interpretation but I think and have been told so), I'm a bit of a clown and don't take myself too seriously but I have been told I'm funny, all my coworkers and friends seem to enjoy my sense of humor.

However I essentially spent my early 20's being a good for nothing degenerate, no confidence, not very talkative and so on which made me not even try to pursue relationships because I didn't see how anyone could like me for being me when I couldn't even love myself. The last time I was in a relationship was in senior year of high school.

But things have changed although now I have another problem, my lack of experience, I feel bad at the thought of having to find a girl who would be willing to essentially teach me like you would a child about all the things a relationship entails. 

I always am confident and even flirty around girls, however when my behaviour actually gets challenged I turn into a 5 year old who doesn't know what to do. I don't know what kind of an answer I am looking for and I know I just need to tough it through and embarass myself as many times as it takes to obtain actual experience but it just feels like an impossible task and makes me feel guilty about disappointing any girls I might end up trying with.

Now that I am at a different stage in my life with responsibilities, like university and a job, I feel like the effort to find anyone to date is not that worthwhile.

I could spend hundreds of hours talking to women, going on dates and ultimately get rejected. I could also find someone who also likes me back, but in my experience that is not very likely. This almost becomes counter productive. I could clean my studio, study, or work some extra hours, which will bring me some clear improvement to my life compared to dating.

"I (F28) have been noticing that in a dating context men don’t like me whenever I’m kind or nice to them.
In the past, whenever I complimented them about things that I liked about them or replied to their text messages quickly or listened to their problems or tried understanding or connecting to them I always ended up being ghosted. It’s like they’re super repulsed by me being nice to them even in the slightest. 
I’ve seen a lot of TikTok videos of people saying that the only way to get a guy to like you back is by being mean to them as it activates their desire to chase the woman. Women who are being nice are seen as too easily attainable and don’t really have any value in the eyes of men. This has happened to me countless of times. 

Since I am looking for a relationship and being nice never really worked out for me, I tried being a bit more cold and not as nice to the guy I’m currently speaking to. I forced myself to ignore him for days and not to point out things that I like about him like I normally would and pretend like I don’t care about him and that I am not looking for anything serious. And things seem to go a lot better with this person. 

But I am starting to really struggle with this as not only is it very counterintuitive to be extremely cold and nonchalant even after months of talking, but it takes sooo much effort to keep up this whole “act” as I am a very warm and affectionate person by nature.
I would really like to have longer conversations with the guy I’m currently talking to because I am really excited to get to know him but I know from past experiences that whenever I express my interest in a person, it makes them not like me anymore. Therefore, I am basically forced to give him dry one word replies to keep him interested. 
I really don’t understand why being communicative and showing you care about a person is (subconsciously or consciously) such a turn off to most men. It’s really exhausting having to tone done my naturally bubbly and lively personality all the time.

For context this is the first time I've felt like this towards a member of the same sex. We met a few years back during Covid and clicked quite well; we enjoy the same hobbies, have a passion for travel and I was able to educate him on my home country (which he relocated to from South America for work). He has since move to mainland Europe to work in 2022 and from late 2022 until December 2023, I've visited a handful of times. We chat almost daily and very cutely, we send each other TikTok's of animals we know we love, or music we think we'd like.

  
Lately, I've walked away feeling confused. But now I know I do in fact have a crush on him. He's funny (intentionally and unintentionally), how he talks about his friends and family is incredibly respectful, it's clear his loyalty and love for them is unshakeable. He's also just a super nice person! He has a lovely outlook on life and is serious about building a successful career for himself. He's gay and to my knowledge not dating.

  
During my most recent visit I just wanted to hug him a little longer, be closer to him when sitting beside each other and if I'm being very honest... kiss him after we had a few beers.

  
I'm very unsure what to do next. Do I tell him - and risk a friendship if he doesn't see me in the same way? Or it could go the complete opposite way, he could be open to exploring something with me. He isn't the type to wear his 'romantic feelings' on his sleeve, so if he has flirted or shown any interest to gauge my reaction, he's done it incredibly subtly (typical of him) and I have therefore not picked up on it. But... the unknown, the uncertainty and the potential rejection frightens me because I really do not want to lose him in any capacity.

After that I've attempted to invite her to hang but she's declined saying she needs some time before we could hang again, which is fine fine as I don't mind waiting until she's comfortable but at this point the quality of our friendship has deteriorated as before we'd chat and respond back and fourth and now it's turned more one-sided from my end.

"TLDR: cut ties with a person I matched with after she got obsessed with the sexual aspect of the POSSIBLE relationship despite seeming not all that interested. 

I (22m) have only been in a handful of relationships in my life. I've had flings here and there but those usually end quick as they show their true colors after about a month or two(meaning strong distaste towards groups of people or interests and I shut it down immediately as those weren't prevalent when they talked to me originally). I seldom like using dating apps as people are finicky often. I make it very clear that I like to take things slow, get to know someone first and decide from there whether it'd be a good idea to pursue something with this person. I'm looking for an actual, long term relationship and not just a fling. The only dating app I've talked to some cool people on was Hinge. I matched with someone on there back in July, 21F. We had a lot of things in common, similar interests and passions and had the same mindset when it came to dating. We didn't talk everyday, maybe once or twice out of the week. About 3 weeks in, I asked her if she wanted to see a movie and she expressed wanting to get to know me better first which I was cool with and respected. Aside from the base conversations when we first matched, conversations wouldn't really go anywhere past ""wyd? "" or ""how was your day?"" or ""how was work?"". If the day was bad, she'd reply back in a manner that screamed to me ""back the fuck off"", where she'd say ""No, the day wasn't good. No, I don't want to talk about it."" At this point, I'm feeling like she wasn't into me. Randomly, this pattern would change come mid september. We switched from talking on hinge to talking on Instagram. I recognized that every time I would post a picture of myself, she'd reply to it and start complimenting me either calling me cute or sending heart eyes and fire emojis. She starts texting me on a daily basis but still keeping the same type of conversations. She asked me if I wanted to hang out as she was finally feeling ready to and we planned to do so in October. We also expressed that the first hangout would not be a date but just to test the waters as we had never seen each other in person. I use voice messaging a lot as opposed to texting as it's easier. One day, she asked to call me so we could have an actual conversation in real time since we hadn't met up yet. I like to stay light-hearted and use comedy a lot so we were on the phone for about 20 minutes and I was making her laugh when she suddenly started asking deep personal questions. And I don't mean questions like"" what was your childhood like?"" Or anything like that but she was asking questions unprompted like "" what type of porn do you watch? What were your past relationships like? How many times have you ever masturbated in a day? Have you masturbated today? Do you plan on masturbating today? Have you had sex before? What type of sex have you had?"" It caught me completely off guard and I used sarcasm or stayed quiet to avoid the questions. I'm normally an open book but considering this was only the first ever phone call I've had with this person, I just found it weird. She also told me in the first phone call that all of her friends knew about me because she gets ""excited"" every time we talk and smiles at the phone whenever I text which would be really sweet if this wasn't happening at random. I kind of slowed down on talking after that. Not long after, I saw a movie that I wanted to talk about with someone and I called her just to chat about it but she didn't answer the phone. Later that day while I was away from the phone, she called me. By the time I saw it, my phone had literally just gone dark from it ringing the first time then she immediately called me back and something inside me just said ""Don't answer it"". She left a voicemail to my phone and then a voice message on Instagram, just saying that she wanted to talk and that nothing was wrong. I just told her I was busy. With every conversation past that (and there weren't too many more), I couldn't get past ""what you doing"" without her turning the conversation sexual which I never reciprocated. She would send random posts on Instagram asking me what my kinks were and expressing not being able to leave me alone because she found me so attractive. We also never met in person! The hang out never even happened! I stopped talking to her for almost 2 months before she asked me if I was still interested in hanging out and seeing where it goes because she was. I promptly said no and blocked her not long after. I kind of feel bad about it but at the same time, with how random and how strong she came on, I just couldn't see it boding well for either of us. And her telling her friends about me before we even talked about hanging out and starting up this expectancy from all of them that we were about to be together, rubbed me the wrong way as I've been peer pressured into a relationship in the past because the person's friends knew that she liked me.

"In my experience with dating a girl I have been seeing for the last 7 months, sometimes the question came up in my mind ""should I pay in this situation"". Usually it's clear but sometimes it's a bit of a gray zone and I wonder what all of you think about this. There's three situations that I can come up with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The man takes a girl out for food/drinks or to some event etc
2. The girl asks the man to go to some experience like the cinema, zoo, theater etc
3. The friends of the girl ask the girl and the guy out to go for dinner, drinks or to some event etc

In my opinion, in case 1 the man should always pay because it's on his initiative.

In case 2 however, it's the girl's initiative. I think if it's something not too expensive, like anything below $20 it's fine if the man pays because it's not a big deal, but if she wants to go to let's say the theater that's $30 each, it would be too much to assume that the man just puts down $60 for something that is her idea.

In case 3 it's also not the man's initiative so I think the girl should also pay for herself.

"There was this girl at work that was recently hired. She was in training in the morning shift and I was in the night shift. I talked to her once before she went to training. And for 3 long weeks I didn’t see her again.

Fast forward last week, I realize she’s met a guy from the morning shift, he didn’t waste any time and took advantage of the matching shifts and asked her out. Literally never had a chance to even try.

How would you feel if you met someone during morning shift but when you get changed to the night shift you meet a handsome, funny and overall attractive fella. I feel bad for her for missing out on this when I had my eye on her from long time ago, and she decided to settle for this other guy.

Man I’m such a douche for saying that but thinking that way makes me feel better with myself. Me and her are now very close and I can feel she has a great time with me, she took the time to get to know me. But I feel defeated and can’t seem to understand what to do.

"A week ago I (30F) had a date with this guy (32), we had deep meaningful talks a month ago but haven’t in a while but finally met in person. 

At first he acted super into my appearance, constantly calling me gorgeous and “out of his league” and was very physical, making out with me, etc. but he wasn’t super emotionally connective. He kept putting me on him and basically was dry humping me, but no emotional questions or getting to know me. Eventually at the end when we were saying goodbye he was kind of quiet and didn't make much of eye contact and was just like ""oh hey text me when you get home safe"" And I never texted him because I wanted to see if he’d text right after I left. And he didn't text me at ALL after I left which felt like a sign he didn't actually like me.

So hours after that ""date"" I finally had sent the texts breaking off the next ""real date"".

The first texts are when I broke it off and then I finally texted him last night which is in the other half of the text thread. Does it sound like he actually is interested in me?? 

THE TEXTS:


ME: Hey! Thanks so much for having me over, I think you're so amazing. I feel like I may be having a harder time with the effects of my previous relationship than I realized, and I really have loved our connection, but i'm not sure if I feel the vibe I had before.
I do feel like it's just completely not fair to you that I can't really loosen up and be in the moment


HIM: Ok. 
So should we cancel our Wednesday
date for now?


ME: Probably


HIM: Ok. Well I enjoyed our time together
If you think about it over the holidays and decide you want to get together again, maybe we can revisit at some point. I think you're great but will give you space

ME: Well maybe let's not cancel
Wednesday. Idk maybe dinner and stuff will give me a better feel


HIM: I'd rather wait until after the holidays if you felt a different vibe. It makes me nervous to hear that. Give me some time to process as well


ME: I think you're right. Thanks 🤍

ALSO ME: I just want to apologize because I think you're great and I don't want to make you feel lesser. I could have been wrong in my judgment of it feeling too physical off the bat and the lack of emotionally connecting in other areas…but either way, I want you to know that it wasn't for superficial reasons at all

HIM: I am sorry too then. I thought you wanted to kiss me and it felt like the culmination of a lot of previous talking but I appreciate you saying that.

ME: I did and it was genuine. Just a lot of time had passed from our previous talks i think

(No response since)


Two nights I finally texted him: 


ME: Hey just thinking of you. I hope you're doing well and just wanted to say have a safe trip 🤍


HIM: Thank you! I hope you're doing well too.
I leave Thursday!

ME: Ohhh okay so fun!


HIM: Yeah! How are you? You popped up on my hinge as my most compatible today lol
Thought of you


ME Haha aw that's cute. I'm good, excited for the holidays 🤍

HIM: 😍 (heart face emoji)

(End of convo)

And finally tonight I texted him 

ME: Hey! Thinking of you 🤍🫶🏼

HIM: Awww, thanks. How are you?

ME: I'm good thanks!

(Hours later)
HIM: Any fun plans for the holiday?

ME: I'm spending it at my moms, and going to stay with her for a little next week! Are you doing anything fun with your family?

HIM: Not sure yet! I think so

ME: Fun! Well cool

Lots of family time tho

"tldr at the bottom. i just need to articulate my thoughts and feelings. thank you in advance if you decide to wade through everything i word vomit up.

i (f20) hung out with a girl today. ive known her for a while and she’s never indicated any romantic interest towards me until recently (like. super recently. a few weeks ago?), so it caught me really off guard. especially because… i dont know, i guess i dont feel like ive ever shown her a particularly desirable part of me. like its just me. which i guess can be seen as very romantic and whatever but it has been fueling a small “why me what the fuck” fire. ive never been in a romantic relationship before.

clearly, im reciprocating some level of interest towards her because im hanging out with her and letting her flirt with me. im just afraid that i dont actually *hold* the same level of interest, and am instead using her??? for validation and ego boosts or whatever the fuck. ykwim? im struggling to draw the line between my interest in a new thing vs. my interest in *her*. i dont want to continue this if i dont want to start a relationship with her. its not fair to her. am i attracted to her??? sure????? yes…? im very confused and frustrated as to why its so hard for me to answer this question.

i met her a few years ago and i remember describing her to my older sister. i said, “she’s like. really cool.” pause. “like. really really cool.” my sister looked at me kind of funny and it gave me pause. weird, it kind of sounds like i like her. do i like her? i dont think i like her. she’s really cool; if anything itd be kind of a pipe dream to imagine her dating me.

before any of you begin to claim im in a glass closet or whatever: i know im queer. ive known for a while. i have no issue in finding an individual of any gender attractive as long as they hit whatever checkboxes my ‘type’ requires. 

so maybe she’s just not my type? physically? is that superficial of me? maybe she’s just not what i envision in a partner (physically???) when i envision myself w a romantic partner? thats not to say finding her attractive is impossible. i must find her at least fairly attractive now to be so riled up(??) by her romantic attention. im just saying its unexpected. i dont know. its 3 in the morning and i have to get up in 3 hours but i cant sleep because i keep thinking about her. that sounds really romantic, lmfao. i mean moreso that i keep thinking about whether or not im being kind and fair to her by hanging out with her and letting her flirt with me when im so unsure about this.

i guess i get flustered when i think about doing anything physical with her. she made a super flirtatious comment and it flustered me. she backed off and it sort of made me feel disappointed (but still fairly relieved, lmfao dont get me wrong). a nastier part of me says that i wouldve reacted the same way if she were anyone else; therefore whatever i feel towards her isn’t good enough. 

ugh. this is all so new and i think im acting like im expecting us to get married next week. my god you guys 😭 i sort of feel like something is wrong with me because im having so much trouble articulating what i feel. i feel gross because im having trouble disproving the theory that im using her for attention and validation *because* im having so much trouble articulating what i feel. i try to disprove the theory but then my brain sort of goes a million places and then fizzles out like an overheated pc. or is this just an excuse?? is this normal? or do i have a lot of growing to do?

tldr; how do you differentiate between interest in a *relationship* vs interest in a relationship *with them*? is it okay to let someone flirt with you when you’re not sure whether or not you’d begin a relationship with them?","how do you know if youre genuinely, romantically interested in someone?",18nj7kx,1703151310.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18nj7kx/how_do_you_know_if_youre_genuinely_romantically/,

"Hey so I am a 29 year old male, and I can’t stop being obsessed with meeting and hooking up with different woman. At this point I have had sex with 98 different people.  And trust me I am not trying to flex and don’t think it’s cool, and I don’t tell anyone that number either, friends or dates. 

I always end up dating someone but get bored extremely fast and want to meet someone new, to experience that excitement again. I never cheat, I break things off fyi. Am I broken and never ready for a relationship with one person?! 

And the woman I meet that I am obsessed with and wanna date seriously I think I move super fast and scare them away and make them uninterested/ or they just aren’t interested romantically. 

Basically I don’t know if my obsession with meeting new people sexually and romantically is a psychological problem or just a normal thing. I just feel like I should have grown out of it by now. 

Or even further idk if I am a sex addict or a validation addict type of thing.

"Coffee or drinks?

Hey guys 

26F here, recently matched with a guy on Bumble, a few days ago. We spoke well over the app, spoke about intentions expectations (basically we are both looking for something long term). He’s 33 btw. We are both old school, hopeless romantics etc. He asked if we could exchange IG or FB.. I said no at least until we first meet and he respected that. 

Today we did a phone call and we spoke about seeing each other this Saturday. He asked if I preferred drinks or coffee. I told him to choose and he made a joke saying all the pressure is on him but we ended it saying we will decide as the week goes. Now I’m still going to try my max to make him pick. I get it coffee is “low effort” for some people. But if he ends up telling me to pick. Which should I choose? 


I only ask because we had the discussion of what a “perfect date” is. He said he doesn’t care about the activity or location as long as there’s a natural connection and my answer was pretty similar to his.

"I am 28M from Delhi, India, introvert, misanthrope, atheist, jaded, paranoid. I want to get into a serious relationship. I have never been in one but I want to. I have had too many bad experiences with people which makes me not want to start dating. For me, I don't see the difference between any gender regardless of their sexuality. For the last couple of years, it's become extremely difficult to trust people. College life was the worst. I had to abandon my honor, self-respect, and pride to survive college. I have a good stable job thankfully that pays well. Before I got a stable work-from-home job I was working in a company where I was not on good terms with my colleagues. I had a lot of unpleasant arguments with my colleagues which mostly resulted in me being called in by HR. The only reason I was not fired was because I was very good at my job. Then, last year I quit voluntarily because of all of my colleagues' disrespectful attitude and rudeness. When I got a stable job I started online dating but I had no luck. I am totally fine with rejections. What I am not okay with is people not treating me as a human being. I might be desperate but I don't want to start dating to get rid of my loneliness and relieve my sexual frustration. Lately, I have realized that I want a real genuine emotional connection.

All I need is good advice from introverts who have been in a similar position. How do you move forward in life? How to start dating with utmost caution.

"So I won't go into my background too deep just to try keep the story a bit shorter but I'm 35 (M) haven't really tried finding anything for quite a long time as I was pretty well scarred from my ex maybe 10-12 years ago now, resulted in a lot of depression and a couple of suicide attempts. Have tried dating apps but those have just made depression even worse so I refuse to use them again to me past is past now I don't try to dredge it up anymore and I'm focusing on the future, I've lost about 50kg or 110 pounds through just purely forcing myself to walk everyday and eating a lot better and I've been seeing a psychologist to help through a lot of the previous issues. Suffice to say I been feeling quite good about myself and seems to be now I have a few women in my workplace that from my eyes are showing interest in me. Although haven't been in the dating game for a long long time so I am still really uncertain and over-analyzing me keeps thinking is she into me? Is she just being nice? etc etc.  


Rewind a couple of months ago this girl who I find quite pretty I met her gaze maybe for 2-3 seconds before I kinda just snapped out of it honestly didn't think much of it but she was smiling when I looked back again. To put this also into a bit of perspective I haven't really gathered the confidence to say anything to her because whilst I am feeling more confident in myself I'm still terrified of opening up to someone who could be like my ex so bare that in mind for the rest of this. So to continue on she's been doing like some really weird things to get my attention (I think?) over these couple of months. I'll catch her glancing at me quite a bit and she's always smiling when I do. She seems to walk stupidly close to my desk when she walks past like almost trying to brush into me? There was a stint where she was also taking lunch breaks at the same time as me for a couple of weeks so I'd be sitting in the break area on my phone she'd be sitting in the corner on hers. Couple of times she's dressed up really nice too in more makeup than she'd usually wear and she wears these really lovely dresses. She also seems to make it a habit to say she's single to other colleagues like in earshot of me.   


So fast forward back to the present. She's still dressing really nice, still letting it known she's single, still giving me a genuine smile when I see her leering at me or me leering at her but she no longer goes in the break rooms or tries to brush past me. I sorta developed a bit of a crush on her and just yesterday she was the most dressed up she's ever been, gotta say I had to clean up a bit of the drool seeing her and I saw her constantly throughout the day even though we sorta sit on opposite sides of the office. When I caught her glance she was smiling like always. I feel like I missed a golden opportunity to tell her that dress looked really nice on her but it feels like I've built some kind of mountain of communication divide and everytime I see her I just go full deer in headlights mode. I have been trying to psyche myself up enough to talk to her even just saying hi or something. I can't tell if she's being nice or she's playing the long game or something with me coz I've never talked to her so I can't tell at all. Like my thought is she wouldn't be smiling at me if she thought I was weird I guess?  


Another awkward part now is another girl is in this mix too I've talked to her a couple of times walked her to her car and she's sorta doing the same stuff but the girl I am 100% set is the girl I got the crush with. I don't think I'm leading this other girl on or anything have just been friendly as far as I'm aware so it was easy enough talking to her coz I didn't view her in any other way but yea doing similar things to the girl I got a crush on smiling when I see her, when I talk to her she'll stop everything and face me, dressing up really nice as well, letting it also known that she's single to colleagues within earshot.  
To top all this off as well today I had psyched myself up enough to say hi to my crush but didn't see her at all today and I sorta by accident flirtily said hi to a girl who looks similar to her and felt like an absolute goose lol and now this other girl keeps staring at me and smiling too. Almost uncomfortably staring at me like she sits 2-3m away from me and she rotated her chair and just stared at me whilst smiling a few times.

It took a few weeks for me to actually meet him because it was my first time hooking-up with someone and I didn't want to accidentally let a psycho into my home. That day I met him everything seemed to be going well, we ordered pizza, watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, and did the deed. He seemed so nice back then and very attentive as well, I think that's when I decided to give life another chance. I instantly had a crush on him and I thought he liked me too; he would sometimes message me saying stuff like ""You hate me"" to which I responded saying that I didn't, that I really enjoy his company. He'd often tease me about my crush on him which I honestly liked too. It got to the point where he would come over whenever my parents weren't around and we'd spend time together, one of those times he's asked me why I like him and I tried to answer honestly, but looking back I must've sounded like an idiot. But despite that he started crying and I held him, I admit it was awkward and I felt guilty for making him cry, but my feelings for him never faded even now. Fast forward a few months and I start playing games online with his friends, they're really nice people, but they would often make jokes that I didn't like. His male cousin would, and still does, often make pedophilia jokes which I don't like, I asked him to stop and even explained the reason why I hate jokes like that. I was SA'd at an early age and ever since then I've felt nothing but disgust for people like my abuser, and the same goes for people who make light of a situation like it. I tried talking to my ""bf"" about it but he didn't really care, I guess he just didn't want to force his cousin into doing something he didn't want to do. Another incident happened when the group was discussing about trauma, everyone's trauma was taken seriously except for mine for some reason. I told them how I had attempted to take my life a handful of times and how I hurt myself as well, I even mentioned my diagnosed depression. What my ""partner"" said next shook me to my core; he said ""just because you tried to kill yourself doesn't mean you have depression."" It hurt so much to hear him say that because he too self-harmed, he even cried into my arms twice by that point, but my situation wasn't bad enough to him and I don't know why.
He's not consistent with his ""love"" either; one moment he'll tease me like he used to and we'll tease each other back and forth, but then he'll say something along the lines of ""okay the joke ended a while ago."" There were multiple times where he told me to just shut up while we were playing games with his friends too, all because I was talking about how I feel. He'd get upset if I left the party early and sleep the rest of the night, he gets upset if I don't want to send him nude pictures of myself, he gets angry if I tell him how I feel down and how he makes me feel sometimes. In November of 2022 I was diagnosed with a rare subtype of liver cancer, 1 in 500 million apparently. Because of this cancer I have a tendency to vomit a lot, no matter what I eat or drink it would not stay down and so I ended up losing a lot of weight. As I started immunotherapy I started getting better and I was able to eat more with the help of medications, all that and I honestly feel like I look way better than I did before. It was a silver lining for me that I could finally fit in a 2XL, but not for him. There are times where he reminds me of how I used to be chubby and how he misses it. He'd even send me pictures I took where I was fatter. I don't like sending him pictures, I've always felt ugly all my life, even more so back when I weighed more, so the fact that he often tells me to gain more weight hurts me so much. 
He's nice yes, but he's also very mean. I sometimes worry about playing games with him because he's a perfectionist and if I don't do something right he just yells at me even though he claims he didn't. I grew up with a father, mother, and brother who would yell at me for any mistake I would make as a kid so I know what angry yelling sounds like. He took me to go see Beyoncé and Doja Cat, I didn't have to pay for my ticket because I don't have a job at the moment, bit after the Beyoncé show I started having a panic attack because it was dark and there were so many people around, people that could potentially hurt us. Whenever I'm having a panic attack I tend to go nonverbal, mostly because it's hard for me to form sentences and I stutter lots. But my panic attacks always make him mad, he thinks I'm upset with him even though I've explained to him that I'm not. I'm scared that I won't make it home even though I finally want to live again, but he doesn't see it that way. I've had many panic attacks, one of tge worst ones was when we went to the state fair and we were having difficulty getting home, I kept asking him how are we going to get home, I guess I got on his nerves because at some point he just stopped talking to me entirely. He didn't tell me the plan at all, I just followed him stressed out of my mind. When I saw him get on a bus I followed, I asked if he knows where the bus is going but he didn't answer, nor the bus after that.
I'm a crybaby, I'm too sensitive, I get emotional easily and that makes him upset. But it also makes me upset when he talks about other guys and how he wants to have sex with them, fictional and celebrity crushes I get but straight up saying that one of his straight friends is so hot that he'd do anything for him while I'm in the party just hurts, especially since I know that if I talked like that about one of my friends or if someone talked like that about me he would get angry. 
I'm not good enough for him and I see that now, he needs someone with tough skin who doesn't freak out at public events, he needs someone who doesn't bother him with their depression or emotions.

"I just started dating someone who kissing in a way I’ve not been kissed before - they put the entire mouth around mine and leaves it there! I have no idea what I’m supposed to do in this situation and I get a bit in my head and uncomfortable- neither of which i enjoy just before sex! 

I want to talk to him about it. I hope I can learn a bit about how he enjoys kissing so I have options in the above situation and then I do the same for how I enjoy kissing so we can change things up a bit!

 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL GO!! Any suggestions? 


So far, this is my plan on our next date, before sex:

- Ask him to share what he likes verbally 
- Demo on my with out me reciprocating (30-60sec?)
- Demo with both of engaging (30-60sec?)
- Then suggest I do the same. 

However, I’m trying to think how I’d describe kissing verbally or kiss without reciprocation and it’s seems hard; and d I’ve had days to think about it! Since they would have no prep time, am I setting us up for failure?  Should I chat after sex instead?

I asked him why he hid her name and he said he felt wrong sharing her name without her permission. Which doesn’t make sense because he shared photos of her to me without her permission, when he could have simply verbally told me what she did.

"He met my friend for the first time. The night before and the day of he was calling himself fat, a loser, but then saying he’s number 1. I made a joke and said I’m number 1 and he’s 2 but I don’t think this is why. 

I was leaving but I didn’t say bye and hug him and he was sad. When I got home he said he’s sad because of it. I told him I can come the next day, he said no and goodnight and I think he blocked me. 

I texted him on instagram and I texted his friend. 

He’s self sabotaged on the first date and maybe 5th date. We’ve been dating for 2 months. On the weekend he told me he is diagnosed with bipolar 2 but doesn’t take meds, only therapy. 

What should I do? I like him but he thinks I don’t. I say he’s weird but I’m joking, I told him I appreciate him and he’s kind. 

TLDR. It was after he told me I deserve someone better than him and he wants to give me everything and knows I deserve more that I got ready to leave (for the night, not the relationship), but didn’t say bye and left. I didn’t do it on purpose, it was bc my friend wanted to leave.

"Hey guys I am a 24(M) and I have began dating since I've ended things with my ex in the beginning of 2023. For the most part I have been successful. Out of the dates and Dms on instagram I have managed to created. I have been successful with about 6/8 of them. When I say ""successful"" I mean i slept with them or we went on additional dates. Hearing about other men's success rates kind of scares me because I question what is so good about me? My struggle right now is I have around 3-4 girls interested in me and these women are beautiful to me. They are just my type and I am happy with the women I attract.  
The question that sits in my head is that. Am I just lucky? I am around 5'9ish with shoes on and I do use lifts because I struggle with my height A LOT. With a minor shoe lift I am easily 5'10+. I do not overdo it on the shoe lifts but it does make me feel confident. I am insanely skinny but I do work out. I have dealt with a specific eating disorder and am still somewhat recovering from it. I somewhat have a nice shape with a v-line, my shoulders do pop out, and my chest is not birdlike. I do have a strong jawline due to my underbite, and my skin color is a nice shade of brown.  
Everyday I question to myself why these women like me? I was looking at the followers of this girl I am dating and I saw some men who were jacked, some men who were better looking, and some men who seemed more grown than I am. For being 24, I somewhat look like a kid. I also do drive a decent car, so I am constantly in my head if women are using me. Financially I am not doing that well because finding a job is incredibly hard. So I instantly feel less than because my net worth, and my path in life is unclear for a 24 year old.  
I also have heard from women that some men are creepy. They have been on dates and the guy just does not know what to say or how to carry himself. I do have a good self-care routine and I have been told by women I make them feel safe. I know how to mirror people and I use a tease type of humor to keep the conversation going. I also have been told I remind certain girls of traits in their father. Like not in a weird way but despite my size and stature, I still have pride in myself and I put the girls safety before mine. I also make them feel special and actually listen when they talk. Should I just have people rate me and figure out if i'm attractive, if its my car, or what is it that is making these women like me?  
TLDR: I am having success in dating and hooking up with people. But I am insecure the whole way through. I wonder what makes me attractive. I wonder what women first see when they pick me out from the crowd? Is it me?

"I’m a 19M in America who’s never been in a relationship or has kissed a girl. I’ve had instances where I’ve tried to get into a relationship with a girl and it has never panned out. The last instance of this was when I had asked my coworker to hangout, wasn’t necessarily in a way where we more then coworkers but then she had ignored me our next shift and we didn’t hang out. I still like her a little bit but now we don’t talk as much as we did prior. (Like from 100% to 10%)

" I’m 21 F and my boyfriend is 20M. We’ve known each other for a year now, but been dating for 9 ish months. We took it slow at first and had a very sweet wholesome beginning to our relationship. It was exactly what I needed at the time because I had just come out of a long term sort of on and off again relationship. Ideally I would have had more time to heal, but these things just happens sometimes I guess. Anyways, he’s back home for a month right now but I’m going to visit him and another friend in the area during that month. He’s only been gone a couple days and I’m already feeling weird. I don’t know if it has to do with him or my lifelong issues with depression but I’ve been noticing recently I don’t feel fully myself. It’s hitting me the past couple days. Ive never been super social but am definitely more social than he is and the period of my life right before we met I was becoming more of a social butterfly and liking that about myself. Since we’ve been together I’ve felt more introverted. This is really nice because my ex es possibly too outgoing for me and it’s a nice change of pace with my current boyfriend. I don’t feel like I have to catch up yanno. However his ex was very social from what I can tell and I’m worried that that’s what he wants because he met me during a phase where a fell more into that archetype. He’s never done or said anything to make me overthink this I just can’t help it. And I would like to lean a little back into who I was right before we started dating. Ive just felt more irritable and have been having a hard time being the bubbly empathic and charming person I felt I was at one point. Also certain crowds of people I used to fit in with when I was with my ex have stated to fade away, despite after that breakup I felt I still belonged in said crowds. Maybe my priorities are changing and I need to make adjustments. But I’m also worried I have a habit of dissolving myself into my partners. With my current boyfriend it is much better than my last. I feel I have more of my own interests now and he has some of his own, with a good amount of overlap which is perfect. I’ve made more of an effort to not consider him too much when making plans for my future, and make desisions for myself and not the relationship. I still have some issues with this though, and want him to be in my future plans. What I have with my current boyfriend is wonderful I love him very much and I don’t want these thoughts to effect our relationship. I also see myself being with this guy for awhile and that’s a scary thought we haven’t talked about at all which may be adding to my anxiety. This is also my second ever relationship which makes it harder so maybe it’s lack of experience? May last boyfriend was long term too. About three years.

I knew being more than coworkers with coworkers is risky but I was falling in love with him. However we never go out, it was just hookup even though he often told me we should go blah blah blah. 
Recently I was so frustrated by that and tried to ask him out couple of times but he found some excuses not to. 

Yesterday I confronted him and had a long conversation in person if he is interested in going out with me. His answer was no because first he isn’t interested in dating anybody right now, second he doesn’t want to date anyone at work and third we both have different hobby/lifestyle. 

I was really shocked to hear that. He often talks about me with his other coworkers and they think we are dating. During break, we went to gym together all time and we chose to sit next to each other at work. So it is obvious something going on between us. Also whenever I told him I don’t have any family or close friends in this town and might want to leave in future, he said “you have me”. When I was working to get a house, he asked me if he can move in. He told me if he is going to learn new language it would be my first language and so on. 
I really don’t know these are all lies and am heartbroken and shocked. 

During the conversation, he said he doesn’t want to hurt me and stops telling him I am fine. But he clearly hurt me and can’t say anything other than I am fine. How can I be not fine after this but i can’t say other than I am fine to him. I also told him that our coworkers notice and assume we are dating and one of them asked me if we are exclusive (I couldn’t give them answer that time tho).

Hi,
I met a guy on Omegle almost 2 months ago. We talked for 3 hours straight, essentially about everything. We both showed a lot of interest in one another and exchanged our socials to further get to know each other. We talked for about 2 weeks before finally meeting up, almost like a date of sort. The thing is, this man is beautiful, like so good-looking that people would come up and ask if he was a model. He literally got scouted by a model agency on our first date 💀. We only held hands and exchange greeting hugs on our first date. He even posted a picture of our dinner with a tag of my name on his Instagram story, I did the same but didn’t tag him (cuz yk you gotta keep pretty men for yourself 😭). We continued talking for 2 months, going on about 3 more dates. He live an hour away from me but he never fails to make that as an excuse to drive down and see me. We kissed on the 2nd date but haven’t done anything more than that since then, like we don’t even talk about it. Now…this man sound perfect, no? Handsome, oh did I mention rich?, and a gentleman.

Ok, one may say that this is because he isn’t active on socials but let me tell you, he would post stuff on his Instagram before responding to me. It’s kinda like he is active but just don’t want to respond. We don’t even flirt when we text like it’s very minor flirting and we never talk about anything deep like our feelings or our experiences.

I asked my friend about him and she said he's single but likely just spacing out/not thinking about anything. In my experience when a guy stares it means he's attractive.

"Hello everyone,

I will set up the context here. I am a south Asian and so is the guy in question. We both are looking to date or get to know someone to get married to. This is very common in our culture that we try to get to know people for a few months with the intention of getting married. I know a lot of people will disagree with this approach but it is what it is and seemed to have worked for a lot of people.

Alright so I used to work in this organization the past year or so and recently switched to a new place of work. The guy I am talking about, we used to work together in the same team but I had no feeling for him and we were just good coworkers. When I resigned, in the last few weeks of my notice, I noticed that we are getting closer and comfortable around each other and I felt like we could be something. 

After I left, we promised to stay in touch and in a few weeks of my last day at work I thought okay it’s worth a try so let’s see if the guy would want to hangout with me. We tried to make a plan with our mutual coworker friends, it didn’t work out so in the end we both went out for a chill night out at the beach did some activities and had dinner and it felt nice and comfortable. We hung out for a few hours and I didn’t get bored.

I texted him on and off, he would respond positively and would reply back in a few hours but never initiated anything on his own. After two weeks of our first hangout we went out again, just the two of us. Again it was nice, he asked me some real personal questions and it felt like he really wanted to get to know me etc

So after our second hangout I decided maybe it’s time to ask him if he would be interested to see if we can get to know each other on a deeper level and maybe see if we can be lifelong partners. I made a plan this time to see him on a weekend, he showed up. We did a few fun things had dinner. I also kind of asked him if he is single or likes someone, he said no. Towards the end of the hangout when we were about to say goodbye I told him I like hanging out with him and if he thinks we can give it a try. I received a really weird response, he started saying stuff like oh I have this issue going on where I just keep losing interest in people, it never works out, when I see someone catching feelings I just back off bla bla but yeah sure we can give it a try. I just didn’t know what to say because I was nervous already for asking so I just said let’s see and said bye. We both were going to travel on the next weekend.

Now I was confused, I didn’t know if it was a yes or a no but it’s not definitely a HELL YESS. I tried to meet him over the week but it didn’t work out he bailed and said we will meet after we are both back from our travels. Now I am not sure, he hasn’t texted me at all… someone who is interested would do that right? What if he does get back to me after I return back? How do I know that he is really interested and not just going with the flow? 
As for me, I don’t think I should initiate or ask him about anything at all because I feel like I have done enough…

"Okay, so for a bit of context, I'm 17, a trans guy, and I'm autistic. I'm really interested in a guy I know (cis guy, also 17) and he... seems to like me back? The thing is, because I'm autistic, I can't really tell what is flirting and what is just being nice. I have made a short list of things he's done that make me wonder if he actually is flirting with me, or if he's just being nice.  


* Once when I was mid-sentence he randomly just interrupted me, leaned over gently and picked a piece of lint off my sweater, then smiled at me before letting me continue. It was careful and there was a lot of intention in his movement.
* He seems to look at my hands a lot because he noticed two burn marks on my fingers that are practically faded, some old chipped nail polish, and the freckles on my knuckles - he pointed all of it out at different times, unprompted.
* He's always sitting next to me, leaning towards me, and copying my body language as well as just looking at me a lot.
* He texts me every day, all day, and has even begged me to play his favourite game with him so I caved in and downloaded it. We have stayed up until 3 am at times just texting each other.
* He says hi to me in person every chance he gets, even if it means he's interrupting his own conversation for it.
* I wear this beanie with cat ears that he has said looks cute on me multiple times.
* He said he'd buy my soul so that he could keep it like a plant and look at it because it's ""such a nice looking soul"". (Not sure what he's been smoking, but it was pretty funny, kinda sweet.)
* He constantly tells me how he loves to talk to me, and seems to actively be finding new things to talk about just to talk to me.
* He told me that he had memorized my voice so that he hears it whenever he reads my messages.
* He sends me pictures of his cats all the time after learning that I love cats, and goes out of his way to look for them to send pictures when he gets home from school.
* He talks to me between his sets at the gym, which I guess can be considered normal but I've never known anyone who texts people between sets when they're at the gym so it's kinda new to me.

I'd love advice and responses mainly from neurotypical cis men, but anyone is welcome to give advice of course. I'm just really lost!

"Hello everyone, I recently entered a Situationship.

 The boundaries are clear- she doesn’t feel ready for a serious commitment right now and I accept that but what is worrying me is now that she has began to to move on from her last relationship, her ex is persistently calling messaging her and talking to all of her friends about being led on in some way and how his feelings are hurt and overall making her sound like a bad person for meeting someone new (me) 

This new girl as much as I like her (and she likes me) has been talking to me about her ex and his problems since early on, and I feel like it is ruining the mood per say (example, he called her up while she was staying at my place recently- twice) 

And I can’t help, but feel like it is getting too much and I don’t want to be treated like an emotional sponge. Of course I care about her and all but but I wish this guy and this issue would just pack itself up and go away.  It’s none of this dudes business and he has gone back in his word multiple
Times about keeping away from contacting her. 

In the long term i would like to start something serious but I feel like it’s too soon to think about that as it’s only been a few weeks but with this ex issue still going I don’t think it’s a good idea to get ahead of myself.

"Hi, so I lesbian female (29) have been dating my ENM bisexual female girlfriend (39) who is married to a husband in an open marriage. 

My girlfriend and I have not seen each other for 2 weeks, and just yesterday we finally got to hangout and have quality time after also having a little one week break in our relationship due to me explaining to her that I don’t feel like a priority and she doesn’t fulfill ALL of my needs emotionally, romantically, and physically the way I’d like and I almost feel like a part time gf sometimes since her husband and children come before me and we do not live together..

So yesterday when we finally got to spend time together I was so happy and excited to see her and we both sure did miss each other. We went to a fun painting class and painted on a canvas following the instructor, a lot of guests painting along and the vibes were great. Then I noticed something that immediately hurt me and upset me. I honestly felt disappointed and felt it was a slap in my face and made me feel like I was not special anymore. 

She painted the intials of her &amp; her husbands names next to a heart. I felt some type of way because this is our quality time together and it made me think well she must be thinking of him when she’s hanging out with me and although it’s her husband and I’m just the gf not saying that she can’t do that, but it would have been nice if she wrote our initials too, or included me in it also because that would have meant a lot to me. 

It definitely stung my heart that I didn’t make the cut. We’ve been dating for five months and I know she cares for me and has some love for me. It made me think thoughts like damn I thought I meant more to her or I wish she’d write cute things like that for me too.

I didn’t tell her anything in the moment, and just shrugged it off, although it was bothering me deep down and almost affected my mood. We still had an amazing night and continued having fun. I decided to text her at 3 AM expressing my feelings on how I felt a bit hurt that she didn’t write our initials when it was our date night because I couldn’t sleep and it was bothering me, and she just opened my message and ignored it. She does have avoidant attachment issues, tends to avoid answering many of my past questions, or works her way around it by not acknowledging it and so we just continued talking the next day as if I never sent that message and acted normal. 

She literally just pretended as if that message didn’t exist because she said nothing about it and I didn’t bring it up again. We just chatted normally and went about our day. I’m not shocked because a lot of times she just reads my messages and ignores it when it comes to something that may stress her out or if it’s a serious conversation or maybe she likes to talk about it on the phone or in person, but she literally just said nothing to my text. 

She doesn’t always understand me and I think I’m more of the emotional &amp; romantic one and she’s more dry and cold than I am, although she’s a sweetheart at times. 
I feel that I give her more than she gives me. I made her my main priority. I am not dating other people, and I knew that she had a husband and children from day one. 

But I just feel out of respect she should have been considerate and sensitive to my feelings by not writing her and her husband’s initials in front of me and acting like it’s totally fine when we literally haven’t seen each other for two weeks and we are literally on a date night together, it would make sense to write our names.. and she knows that sometimes I feel a bit jealous that I don’t have her all to myself and have to share her with her husband and would prefer not to know too much details of their relationship, and to keep their relationship separate. 

Do you think I have a right to feel upset and hurt? I know it’s a small act, but it definitely affected me emotionally. It made me feel less special. Thank you for reading.

"I’m a 22 (F) and I’ve been on dating apps for a little over a year now. I’m getting really tired of it because a lot of the guys on there are not looking for a relationship (almost 95% are looking for hookups) and swiping through profiles is getting very exhausting.

I also work a professional job full time but I’m not trying to be dating anyone in the workplace (and there is barely any young people in the office where I work anyway). I feel like a lot of social spots that do have young guys around my age have to do with the arts, gaming, or anime. I’m not interested in either (well I am interested in the arts but it’s not a passion of mine it’s something I enjoy casually and infrequently and don’t want to force connections with guys that are really into it).

"A few years ago, I (F, 24 at the time) fell in love with a close friend of mine. We'd been friends for about 9 months before I realised that I was in love with him. 

It was the first and only time I've ever been in love. I'm pretty sure he felt similarly about me. I'm now 26, and we haven't spoken in about 18 months after having the 'what are we' talk. We didn't end up together due to many incompatibilities between us. I've only very recently gotten over him.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past few days, I've been reflecting on that period of being in love and how chilled I was about everything at the time. I knew I was in love with him, wanted him - but I rarely got jealous. I was perfectly okay with the idea of not ending up with him. I loved him, but knew I could do better for myself due to various reasons, so I wasn't  going crazy over him or anything.

(Let me get this clear, it wasn't a crush. I didn't just 'like' him. I've had crushes in the past. I was in love with this dude.)

The main query I remember thinking to myself at the time was, ""Why am I so chilled about this? Why am I so blasé?""

I know that love and obsession/ infatuation are very different things and shouldn't be confused with each other, but I expected the feelings to be more intense, for things to feel like the whole universe had changed like in the poems, books and movies (BTW, I'm a HUGE romantic lol). Instead, it was a pleasant, peaceful and calm feeling. I just felt happy to be his friend, loved speaking to him and being around him. I felt totally in control of my mind and emotions, when I'd always imagined that being in love would be something where you feel totally OUT of control.

"Crush likes me back but isn’t ready for a relationship. Should I move on or wait?

I have a crush on a friend. This is the first time I’ve liked a person in almost a decade. I’ve only had one boyfriend before and we dated for 8 years. We broke up 2 years ago and I haven’t been interested in anyone since. It’s very hard for me to develop crushes on people. 

This person I like is a good friend. We work for the same company, but different departments. I have liked him for a couple months, but never thought of investing on him because we work together and he has an ex in the company too - with whom the relationship ended quite badly and she’s still hung up on him.

I never thought I would have a chance, but around a month ago, he started showing a lot of interest on me. Going out of his way to spend 1-1 time with me. He bought flights back from his holidays earlier than he planned initially just so he could be there for my birthday. He was cancelling plans with other people just to hangout with me.

There were a lot of signs. So I decided to tell him I had a crush on him. 

I told him the day before he travelled on holidays, so that whatever he replied, we would have time apart to process things (since he’s a friend, I don’t wanna lose the friendship either).

When I told him, he freaked out. He started acting very anxious, couldn’t get a sentence out. I figured he was scared to reject me, but after some time he managed to say he likes spending time with me and he thinks I’m attractive and he has been thinking of me in a different way. 

We hooked up and he spent the night with me, but after he got really anxious again.

He asked me to not tell his ex what happened because he doesn’t want to hurt her again (he has no interest in her anymore but feels really guilty over their breakup). He told me he doesn’t think he’s ready for a relationship now, that he is too confused and messy for it. 

To me, it’s very clear he likes me back but has some unresolved issues. 

I really like him and I’m thorn between giving him more time to figure things out or trying to move on.

"2 years ago I got out of a relationship with a girl who I genuinely thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with. Every day I loved her more. She ended the relationship and it took me like a year before I started even trying to date again, and I definitely wasn't ready. This girl was so amazing and beautiful, she had so many qualities I loved deeply. Our relationship lasted almost a decade, we grew together through hard times. My family loved her, it was a difficult change in my life, and honestly it still is.

I've been online dating, really trying to get myself out there. Seems like for every 50 likes I get there is 1 girl I would be genuinely attracted to. And that 1 girl is probably the hardest girl to meet up with. I hate dating apps, seems like a terrible place for men to be. I feel like every guy has to lower their standards because of them? I don't get a lot of attention from women I would be actually interested in. I think maybe my ex girlfriend set my standards super high.

I've tried giving girls I'm not super attracted to a chance but I end up breaking their hearts and it feels terrible.

I feel like I'm above average, but I don't attract women I'm attracted to. I'm a white 6'0"" guy with decent pictures, in decent shape, decent looking, I have hobbies and some friends, I make over 200k a year. I know, it's super vain to even list my ""stats"" like that but it seems like that's what online dating is literally all about! Obviously it's not enough to set me apart.

It's hard for me to get out because I work from home, but I do well in social settings, I just don't have a lot of opportunities for them. I don't feel like going to meetups would be productive because it's creepy af to do that just to meet women.

Anyway, I feel insanely frustrated with modern dating. I feel like it's pretty rare to meet someone my age who has been in a relationship for as long as I have as well. Love takes time and effort, and I don't think a lot of people understand that on these dating apps. 

**tl;dr:** 

I realize this is a bit of a rant but I'm sure there are people who feel similarly to me. If your wife left you and now you're dating, or your super long term relationship ended, etc. Would love to hear your stories and how it worked out or didn't work out for you yet.

"Need some help as I can be a bit daft at times. 29mdating 28f

Backstory: Ive Known this wonderful woman for years through work, we finally gave it a go a few months ago and it was nothing short of amazing.

Communication is great, same interests, same thought process, cuddles, passionate sex and genuinely enjoyed spending time together.....a lot of time together.
I was fine with the time spent, and she seemed to be as well as she initiated it most of the time. Im very easy going and dont particularly have a preference either way but really enjoy my time with her.

We definitely missed each other on days away (made clear by early dating lovey dovey talk) and spoke often.

Ive felt her pull away abruptly, while I will say she has some life stuff happening and tends to withdraw. A phrase was said that really stuck out to me that I havent ran into before. She is scared to lose her independence.

First I thought, ok that makes sense. Shes independent, doesnt need a man she has her own car, apartment, decent job etc. as I thought more about it, it dawned on me, she might be more afraid to rely/trust someone else. She has really opened up to me about her self and I’ve always been a complete open book, we have no secrets

Unless I'm daft, I would have thought this girl was falling in love with me, and it would be mutual.

I told her Im in for the long haul and to take her time.

So...if she was having the feelings I think she was feeling, that could it be terrifying for someone that is independent (avoidant) or fearful to trust someone? Its like she was falling and put her guard up. 

Im trying to understand without adding any stress on her and to support her best way possible. 

My biggest fear is she pushing me away.

I’m a mid 20s male who’s been a repressed virgin all my life due to my upbringing and culture. I couldn’t even do anything in college due to my low self esteem but now I’ve been starting to work on myself more and want to be able to enjoy my youth the way I’ve always seen my peers do before it’s gone. My parents have been pushing for me to get married and I don’t want to end up marrying someone only to later realize I’m not sexually compatible with them or that I don’t enjoy being with them in bed etc. 

For now I just want something casual to get an idea of how sex works (preferably hook up with a Muslim woman since I feel she’ll understand my background better and won’t judge me so harshly for being virgin this long though I’m open to hooking up with non muslim girls as long as they aren’t judgemental). If a relationship comes out of that, great. If not then I’m okay with that too but right now i’m yearning to get some experience at sex because at this age I feel like a huge loser. It’s not just because of what others may think or say but I also think that about myself. Where can I start looking or what should I start doing to be able to get casual sex nowadays? I’ve seen some peers/friends of mine before talk about it like it’s easy game but for someone as inexperienced as me I don’t wanna creep women out due to my inexperience.

"Approaching the new year, I've been reflecting on significant changes I (25M) want to make. My past five-year relationship, which unexpectedly (to me) ended almost a year ago, has been a catalyst for deep reflection. Despite the love I had for her, the breakup opened my eyes to the fact that I allowed myself to be mistreated for a long time and I have some deep wounds. (This is not to put the blame solely on her. I participated in creating such a dynamic between us.)

This past year, I've immersed myself in healing – therapy, the gym, new hobbies, travel, and an expanded social life. Life has significantly improved, but dating remains a serious soul-crushing struggle. Despite progress around my self-esteem in social settings, dating induces anxiety, leading to self-sabotage.

Acknowledging my tendency to attach quickly and obsess over the smallest amount of attention I misread as interest (and the ensuing emotional self-battery), I've decided not to date at all in 2024.

"I’ve (21 M) never been in a relationship or anything. Never had interest in people like that nor did I feel like I wanted to get into anything until this year, where it feels like I’ve now had two pretty unlucky experiences in the space of about eight months that’s left me feeling really confused. 

So, like, as I have understood it, the sequence of events in forming a relationship is generally:

You meet a person and become acquainted -&gt; you develop a “crush” on them (meaning, to me anyway, that you see relationship potential/compatibility in them and become interested in this person) -&gt; you or they make a move -&gt; relationship develops from there

In reading various advice pieces on here and other places in an attempt to understand people more, I’ve come to understand the concept of a “crush” generally is not a good thing and relationships generally are not started on those. 

Which leaves me like…what? What are you supposed to do, then? 

Am I supposed to just…ask out random people and hope that I eventually become interested in them? Is *that* right? That just feels mega janky to me. It feels like a recipe to wasting time or ending up hurting someone’s feelings because there’s an air of ingenuity to the whole approach. Why would I go out with someone I don’t know or have any interest in beforehand? I feel like if I were to go out with someone, I should know them at least somewhat well before, right? At least, that’s what has always made sense to me.

Sorry if I seem dense, it’s just my attempts to understand this have me feeling like I’m trying to decipher an alien language or something. It feels like everyone else has taken a class or something I’ve missed. I just don’t really understand this at all. 

I went on my first date a few days ago with a girl I had gotten to know over the past couple months and really liked, and I thought it went really well at the time, but I guess not. And after that, I feel a bit disheartened and I just want to try and understand what I did wrong.

"So I've always wondered how to make sure a girl likes you romantically, but it seems like people just say to ""ask her out"". That may work out for dating, but what about in the future? If I have a girlfriend or a wife, how do I know she likes me romantically? Literally my biggest fear is that I'll get married and then one day my wife will tell me that she never loved me romantically and that I wasted years of my life being a fool. I saw something on Snapchat today where a woman came out to her husband as a lesbian and I fear something like that happening to me because it would mean she never loved me romantically and I would seem like a dumbass. I don't like feeling stupid.

  
It seems like lots of girls marry guys they aren't in love with.

  
I seem to be totally lacking in the ability to tell if a girl likes me. It's so bad that I accidentally asked out a *lesbian*. Literally someone who would have 0 interest in me. That's how bad it is for me.

  
I fear this lack of ability will hinder my future relationships where I'll think a date went well when it was miserable for her, or that I won't know whether my future wife actually likes me or if she's trying to convince herself she likes me.

During the early months of our ""friendship"", we could text each other constantly. He would be super lovey dovey with me which caught me by surprise, he would flirt with me, sometimes call me ""dear"". I could tell he was super into me, and I also reciprocated the same energy back.

We bought birthday gifts for each other, he let me use his streaming account.

We met a total of 5 times. Every time we meet is a good time and we have passionate sex.

In our last meet up, we touched base and discuss if we are dating or friends and we agreed to remain ""friends"".  I was enjoying the attention he give me and was taking things slow with him, so  I didnt feel the urge to tell him my true feelings, tho it was starting to brew.

While I was away from him, I did meet other men but the more I met, the more I think of him. no other guys make me feel the way he does.

Fast forward to 1 month ago, and I noticed that there is a change in his tone. He's no longer lovey dovey with me, he no longer flirts with me. he use to always text me and asked how my day went, and now that became like once a week. he used to send reels and memes to me, but now that has reduced. i know he's not my boyfriend, but a friend with benefits, so who am I to demand him to talk to me constantly?

I asked if I could spend new years with him and he said sure. When I see him next week, I plan to confess my true feelings for him, and asked if he' still into me, and whether he wants to be in a relationship with me.

Should I ask why his tone changed or why he stopped being engaging and talkative with me? My anxious attachment tendency makes me want to ask him, but another half of me thinks its only going to drive him further. I would like to hear your thoughts. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I will ask him why he got so cold to me, its honest communication. thanks","Should I bring up about his change in tone and texting behavior? (28M, 38M)",18ou0u6,1703293860.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ou0u6/should_i_bring_up_about_his_change_in_tone_and/,
"People of reddit help me out.

A couple of months ago, I matched with a girl on tinder whilst on a night out. We chatted for a while and exchanged socials but after a while of chatting, my phone died.

The following day I sent her a message explaining this and she said it was ok but the conversation didn't continue as freely as it had the night before, admittedly because i backed off. I told myself she wasn't interested because of this i stopped messaging her. Amongst all this I kinda felt it was a missed opportunity because it looks like we have a lot in common.

Anyway, the reason for this post is because we have just matched again and I feel I messed up the first opportunity and am determined to not mess this one up. Should I acknowledge that we have previously spoken? We both still follow each other so she will more than likely recognise me but I don't know how to plan my approach.

"hi, i have never posted on reddit before but my mind keeps running in circles and i am having a hard time having perspective on things. i recently ended things with a man i was dating for about 2.5 months.
we matched on hinge and had been on about 10 real dates, a few hangouts, we met a bunch of each others friends, we already had a few mutual friends in common. He was a few years older than me but we’re both in our late 20s/ early 30s. 

he was very intentional in the beginning, he planned most of the dates and we had at least 1 date a week. We had talked about how we both were looking for a long term relationship and that we were enjoying getting to know each other. I told him before things got physical that i previously experienced some sexual trauma when i was younger, and for that reason i chose to work on getting healthy in therapy and wait til i was ready for sex, and i told him ahead of time that i had never had sex before. He was very kind and we agreed to date exclusively, but he was hesitant to use bf/gf labels and wanted to “take things slowly” 🙃. but then after we slept together twice he started getting distant and not communicating. i tried to talk to him about keeping sex within a committed relationship and setting better boundaries for my emotions. and he said my sexual inexperience caught him off guard and that it was a lot of pressure for him. 

We discussed things and I suggested we go back to how it was before we slept together and we left things kinda amicably. It’s been a few weeks since our last contact, and I feel used and devastated and don’t understand how someone could be so caring and consistent and intentional, and then not be. 

I don’t really understand what this was. It felt like more than a situationship but i never got to call him my boyfriend, even though he was treating me like a girlfriend. It didn’t feel intense enough to be considered lovebombing either. I am sick of thinking about him and being sad. It just feels weird. Any perspective or advice is greatly appreciated.

"Hi,

I'm a 26 year old woman, who recently joined a networking organization. The networking organization has a co-working space, and I'm a remote employee, so I go there a lot. I also go to events they have in the evenings.

I partially joined to meet men, since I'm introverted and I thought I might meet like-minded potential suitors there. So since I've been there, I've had maybe 6-7 men exchange contact info with me (phone numbers or LinkedIn). However, I wasn't sure if it was just networking-related, or something more, in all cases.

Until I had a man compliment my beauty and invite me to a workshop, which I couldn't attend. The next two times I saw him, he hugged me, but never initiated a date. I'm kind of a shy and haven't been in a relationship, so hesitated both times. I was interested in him.

Another man slid into my LinkedIn DM's, after meeting him, and asked if I had plans for the weekend and sent pictures of his child. I wasn't interested in him, so I was kind of vague but complimented the photos with his child.

A third man walked up and hugged me during the holiday party, but I hesitated and then he left shortly after. I was interested, so I waved to him as I was leaving.

A fourth man, I was most interested in, because he was my age (all the others were 30+), handsome, and had an impressive background academically. He asked for my number at a networking event, but I never heard from him. So I slid into his LinkedIn DM's, a few weeks later, we chatted for a bit, and then I said ""It would be nice to continue this conversation in person."" He never responded, but then, when I saw him in person at the holiday party, he approached me. He was with his date and put his arm around me and asked how I was doing. I froze (*because once again unexpected touching*) and then, I introduced myself to his date. I brought my parents to the holiday party (*they don't get out much*), so I introduced them to him. Shortly after, he and his date left, but were staring at me from across the room on a couple of occasions. I haven't heard from him

"Excuse the buzzword but I feel like they are gaslighting me when they say stuff like “you’re really cute”. It’s like they’re faking being really interested in me for some reason. It feels like this hyper-rapid version of love-bombing where they shower you with attention/compliments only to completely withdraw it a few hours later 

This recent match even took initiative by being the one to send me her snap. For the first night she seemed interested - asking me questions. And then the next day it’s one word answers and answers that are clearly on auto-pilot. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong to make them flip the switch so suddenly - it’s like extreme emotional whiplash and it keeps happening. 

It makes me feel bad because now I can’t trust people when they compliment me or say I’m “really cute” because their actions never end up matching up with their words.  
I am unable to accept compliments anymore because so far 100% of the time the energy flips to disinterest almost instantly. This has happened with every match so far that has been forward in terms of sending me a compliment of my looks as an opener. 

It’s such weird behavior to me, I would never compliment someone like that if I didn’t mean it - its like an alien concept to me because it’s so far removed from how I treat people. If I’m not interested in someone I don’t put effort in to trick them into thinking I think they’re cute.",Girls keep initiating and calling me “really cute” only to turn around and respond on auto-pilot and be distant?,18otokb,1703292815.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18otokb/girls_keep_initiating_and_calling_me_really_cute/,

"I feel like Im losing my mind these past few months. I have moved to a different country cause of university and since then I have never felt worse.
Uni is in my third language which is already hard enough, but people there are not so friendly, professors neither.

All my friends go to unis in diff countries so I havent seen majority of them since august. They all have new friends and whole friend groups, while I can rarely say hi to anyone. I am so jealous that I feel like Im starting to resent them, I know its not their fault I have hard time meeting people.

Because I have no friends and no family in that country, you get lonely pretty quick. You start craving closest possible human connection you can. Im at that point in life where Im ready for a serious relationship, havent dated for a while, 1.5 years. I want intimacy, to experience things, sex etc. 

Problem is Im not really used to do it ig modern way, through instagram, tinder nor do I go to clubs. I dont know anyone, I tried so hard to meet people over these last few months.

Im contemplating on going back home cause of this, I know its stupid throwing away all the hard work and education, but the loneliness is killing me from the inside.

"DOES IT COME OFF AS MANIPULATIVE? Please be honest.

It's been sometime now and I want to be honest. I miss you. I think about you everyday, even when I don't want to. I've tried moving on with how we ended but it just doesn't sit right with me. We were once friends who cared for each other. And I would like to assume that our love for each other was genuine because it wouldn't have been so hard to walk away from each other. 

I feel as though I've lost a piece of myself. I don't know if you've felt the same way, but I think the years we spent together deserves a better ending than the ones we've been giving it.

I must admit when we first ended I was so angry, about a million different things. I was so anxious to lose someone I loved, that I made it worse 😐. I've said some things I can't take back, and behaved in a manner that is unrecognizable to me now. I guess the saying ""hurt people, hurt people"" is true. If there's another stronger word for hurt then that's what I felt with all the events that led to us ending. On top of that I was struggling with my own issues with my mental health 🫠
To add I cant seem to understand when we would talk, you would tell me, ""you're scared to be alone"". Hearing that while we were dating only deepened my insecurities and I'm sure it manifested in ways that were unproductive and hurtful towards you. So I can see how it only amplified the dysfunction on my part. 

The feelings I felt when we ended were deep and unbearable at times. I thought I was dying bro lol forreal. Knowing you weren't choosing me just turned my whole world upside down.... Even though I knew from the beginning that's the choice you wanted to make for yourself. I still had a piece of hope that you'd choose me, so I acted out of character with anger when I should've recognized my self worth and let you go. It caused so much more damage than I expected. And it's unfortunate that it took me a long time to see through how my own behavior poisoned the friendship. To top that off, it took awhile for me to distinguish what parts were my responsibility and what was not. I see why people go no contact because it does take time to grieve and see things for what they are. And it's true people do say things they don't mean when they're hurt, angry, and more. That's what I tell myself so I can continue to see you in a positive light. Isn't it almost like an immediate defense mechanism where your brain tries to protect itself?

Whether this matters to you or not. I'd like to apologize for my hurtful actions, down to the way I spoke to you, the ultimatum, my perfectionism which made you feel imperfect, and the micromanaging. I'd list all the things but I forgot some haha (darn memory) and this letter would be much longer than I intended if I did. I don't know how deep my actions made you feel, but I am sorry. It may be hard to understand but I didn't do anything to ""intentionally"" hurt you. I was trying my best, and my best came with some pain. I finally understood what you meant when you said this to me. 

Before I wrap this up, I should address my latest actions. It wasn't right for me to speak that way towards you or create tension when I messaged you and when we would talk. I wanted to tell you what hurt me and I wanted you to acknowledge it, acknowledge that we were both hurting from the end of it all. I wanted my feelings to matter to you, and that pushed you further away. I assume I wasn't approaching any of it in a healthy manner. I deeply regret it, and it doesn't reflect the person that I am or the person that I thought I was reflecting. &amp; I guess you don't really have to acknowledge any of this. It'd be okay for you to respond the same way you have.

I also want to address the last conversation we had. I guess I just assumed you were okay talking about the past in person, but I see that it might not have been the time to discuss painful memories. I don't think I was even ready to hear it. Being triggered by your truth/side of it all hurt because I thought I was giving my all to you. I thought I made enough sacrifices to show you that I'd walk with you through it all. It was like hearing all the efforts I made with and without you knowing was stomped on by your words. It felt like you were making me the sole problem for us ending. I'm not sure if that's what you meant to imply, but if it is your truth then I guess that's something I have to accept.

With that being said it was okay to speak up for yourself then and now. I can't make anyone do that for themselves. When you arrived at my apartment it seemed like you weren't okay with having that conversation. But you were there so I began talking. I was nervous and a bit flustered and defensive to speak about certain things so yeah, I turned out not to be ready either🙃

My love for you has never changed even when I thought the last disagreement and the things that were said would be the one that would make me hate you. Like damn bro, I kind of wish it did haha. But here I am wanting to right my wrongs and move forward. The care I have for you is somehow still present. Also I should've said this the last time we spoke but ""in no way am I trying to make you change your mind about what has happened. I've accepted our end a ""long"" time ago and I just want to be honest and vulnerable. It takes time to heal and I'm okay with that 😊."" I miss you dearly as a friend. I just don't know if you feel the same, or if we've grown so far apart that we wouldn't even like each other.

I do hope that we can end things in a healthier manner someday 🫠. You don't owe me anything and that's your right but I'd love to end peacefully. I still hold space for you as a friend. &amp; I don't know if it'd give you any peace of mind, but I hope so.

"We've been close friends for over a year and have dated for around 9 months. Being friends accelerated our relationship. I think even at the start, we knew we were pretty different people with different love languages, but we get along super well.

Five months ago we went long distance. I really wanted her to get a job where I live (she wanted to as well but couldn't due to the market). The salary is a lot higher and the weather is a lot better.

She blindsided me with a break up recently. She pointed out issues from two months ago and to me they seem very fixable.

One thing we've had conflicts on in the past is money. I am more frugal, and she wants someone to spend a lot of her so she feels taken care of (she is very generous though).

When she last visited me, I did some things like buy discount store presents (I thought it was fine and thoughtful because it was related to her interests like cats or Minecraft or inside jokes) and take her to free food at my office (tech company). I wasn't even thinking about the money at the time... the discount store just had cool unique presents and going to the office was because she wanted to meet my friends, and I wanted to show her my daily life.

After the trip, in the two months leading up to the break up, she hinted at stuff she wanted such as a bouquet and a fancy dinner, and I agreed but not enthusiastically. She also wanted a necklace, and I didn't get her one (I personally thought it was too early in the relationship). I think I didn't realize how important those things were to her because I thought the stuff I was currently doing like paying for meals and getting her small fun gifts was enough.

In the two months, I was also going through stressful times with work and hanging out with friends so I didn't Doordash her flowers or buy her gifts like I would normally.

I realized I should have checked in on her more. I heard from a mutual friend that my ex also complained about me pressuring her to get a job where I lived. I have not heard about this issue a single time. I would have stopped immediately if I knew.

Is this something normal I should expect from a relationship where I need to check in on the other person? I thought most break ups in mature relationships also require a discussion first.

"I’ll start! 

Wish men didn’t lie but they do, esp early on. I’m 36F, single, attractive, and live in LA. Want to minimize your chances of getting gaslit? Here’s a little list I’ve compiled from mostly mine and my friends’ love life experiences: 

1. I’m really busy/working/have other priorities- He wants to breadcrumb you. If he actually wants you, you won’t ever hear this or even think it. He will make time when he thinks you’re the one from the very start. 

2. I’m so picky/ ask my friends how picky I am - Um yeah he’s not, just trying to make you feel special and sleep with you faster than you otherwise would. 

3. I can’t believe I got you, can believe you said yes to me - RUN from this one! This guy has low self value and will 100% bring you down to his own level. This is code for toxic relationship. 

4. I don’t like fake and materialistic girls - code for he can’t afford one + can’t let a girl live in her freedom and self expression. Do what you want woman. 

5. I like natural girls - Ok maybe, but I’d double check all the women he follows, looks at, checks out, and masturbates to. Are they homely pilgrims? Then you don’t need to be one either, esp as you get older. 

6. I don’t like loud women - He doesn’t know how to use his voice too. He can’t admit he’s intimidated by them and prefers someone who will be submissive to him whether he’s worth submitting to or not. 

7. The last girl I dated was crazy/a bitch/etc - Again, run! We all hear this one and it’s always a mistake to believe it lol, don’t believe it! He made her crazy and can’t admit it, or picked a crazy girl to date cuz of his own poor self-concept, that he has now carried over to you. No healthy guy I’ve been with has ever said this about his ex even if they did maybe act crazy. 

8. I’m practically divorced, my marriage is pretty much over. - Uff being a divorced woman myself, I hate to suggest this, but ask for proof if you don’t want your life and time wasted. Do you want your heart used? No? Then see some evidence of a divorce or papers or something etc. 

9. I’m not good with women/Im bad at dating/making a move/don’t want to scare girls away - NEVER help a man be a man, it’s his one job. This one is riddled with so much loser energy. If he’s older than like 21, he needs a mommy. Are you mommy or are you girlfriend? You deserve to be pursued, let this guy learn on his own. 

10. Girls look at me everywhere I go - Lol, boy sit down. This means he’s looking at girls everywhere he goes in a wandering eye type way and needs his ego inflated always. Might seem confident at first but you’ll get exhausted over time. 

11. I love feminists and women’s equality- NO he doesn’t! Normal guys don’t feel a need to say shit like this. 

12. You’re too much - “I’m not enough.” Boy, bye. 


*Feel free to add to this list. It’s not meant to man-hate, men are great! But lots are full of shit too.

Wasn't sure where to post this but really needed to get it off my chest.

My partner of around six months doesn't want me around her and her family over Christmas (Christmas Eve, Christmas day, and boxing day).

She seems to keep making excuses as to why, with the last being that she doesn't want to be upset on Christmas day if we have an argument.

We did have a bad argument recently. It felt like we nearly broke up.

This is harder for me as I have no contact with my immediate family, and haven't done for about the last five years, so always find this time of year hard. This has been stated to her.

Since she like Italian, I’m planning for a lunch at a nice Italian restaurant. After that we have few hours to spend together for an entire afternoon. I planned for the places already. 

My main question is what kind of conversations should I have? For the context she’s from Brazil and I’m from India. I want to maintain a pleasant conversations with balance . Doesn’t want to come off as too boring or too needy. Eventually I want to be myself and have a nice time with her. 

The key is I want to “know” and learn about her. I don’t want it to be a Q&amp;A. Want to go with the flow and see if we can be a good match.

"So, I've been working with this guy for roughly the last 2 years. We hung out a lot before and I kinda felt like we had a thing. I was in an open relationship so we had sex, but I wasn't sure if casual sex was for me so we didn't do it again. After that some drama went down at work and we didn't really talk for a few months. 
Now at a work happy hour he was flirting with me a lot but he always does that when he's drunk. We felt eachother up in my car, but we both ended up crashing at a friend's house, and nothing happened. 
Today we grabbed lunch together on our lunch break and he was asking me about if I was seeing anyone, what I thought about dating, like so many questions regarding that. At one point I felt like he wanted to ask me If I would ever date a coworker, but Idk if I'm just reading into that. He also made a point though of saying how he wasn't really looking to date and that girls are always into him, but he doesn't want it. He was also being really flirty though like when we were heading out to my car he asked if I cared if he ate an apple in the car and I was like yeah w.e. and then he put his hands behind his bag and was like ""you're not gonna arrest me?"" He literally smirked at me and then laughed. LIKE.... IM PRETTY SURE ITS FLIRTING. 
I gave him a drive home after cause his car's in the shop and I was going that way and he took a picture with me for Snapchat which he never does. There are like never people in his Snapchat stories let alone his coworkers. Then when we stopped he hesitated getting out of the car and idk it just felt like there was such a sexual tension in that car. He does have a bit of a history of being hot and then cold though and definitely not the best communicator. I'm just at a loss for what this means. I think he's very hot and Id be down to see where something goes now, but I don't want to be wrong and make things weird.

"I (24M) met this girl at work (23F) three months ago. I felt like I connected with her immediately with our shared sense of humor, interest in art, self discovery, and heavily on an emotional level. 

She followed me on Instagram added me to a meme chat on there where we talk and send stuff often to this day. So I got a sense that our interest in each other was mutual.  

I have asked her (to hangout not go on a date) twice with me. We talked hung out at a bar for a few hours one night, and grabbed açaí bowls and took them to the beach and hung out together for a while. Both these hangouts informed me that things weren’t going to work out the way I wanted them to. Because 1.) She would talk mostly about herself and would become distracted or immediately disinterested when I would talk about myself or my interests. And 2.) She revealed to me that she’s poly and not looking for a committed relationship. 

Still, my feelings for her persisted. So after work one day I asked her if she wanted to hangout more outside work. 
Her: “Yea! We can totally do that, I just need to sort out of my schedule.” 
Me: “Cool! But just so you know my intentions are our interest.” 
Her: (Looking around genuinely confused and stumped) “Wait you mean like interested interested?” 
Me: (smiling trying to hold back laughter) “Yea that kind of interest”
Her: Oh! (Like she just solved a puzzle) Yea I’m more of a friends person..” 

I played it totally cool and let her know that I respected her decision, appreciated her honesty, and apologized if I made things uncomfortable between us. She was really cool about it too and told me it was all good. As we’re both getting into our own cars transitioning the convo to small talk she then says something that still has me caught off guard: “… but yea! We can totally hangout outside work sometime!” And the next day when we worked together she took time away from her 30min break just to tell me a story while I was working, and then texted me a funny video she made after work and bonded over our own childhood memories over text. 

This has me still clinging on (and I say this in a negative way) to hope. Hope that things can still work out between us, and if she’s poly maybe she might want to include me as one of her partners and I can successfully persuade her into a monogamous relationship with me in the process. This hope has made me feel weak and hurt when I’m reminded that I’m still alone. 

She took 2 weeks off from work. This time away from her helped me move on from her, and I even stopped checking this meme chat that me, her, and one of our co workers are in. But today, I worked with her and it completely broke me. Because once again I saw someone who was absolutely beautiful, enjoyed talking to, but knew I couldn’t have right in front of me the entire day. 

It is honestly so emotionally heartbreaking for me that I feel like I can almost collapse out of defeat. I don’t know why the universe is still making me feel this way about her, and that it continually throws her on my path.

"So I went on a first date with a guy last week and I felt it went really well. He seemed nice interesting and asked me lots of questions about myself. V generous - it was an expensive meal and he insisted on paying. And he was hilarious as well we were laughing for most of it and the conversation flowed v easily. I think towards the end he was putting more work in the date because although I was having a good time I wasn’t 100 percent sure I was attracted to him which I know sounds silly. I felt like he liked me but I could have been wrong. 

Anyway the night ended we said our goodbyes and I sent him a message the next day thanking him for the meal. He wb something short and after 1 or two messages back and forth I said I had a good night and then he asked did I wanna go for a drink again. I said yes but he never replied. I messaged him a few days later just asking how his weekend was and again he was short but eventually asked did I wanna go out next week(12 days after the first date) I know it’s nearly Christmas and he is heading home for it it’s just I feel if he was really interested he’d try and meet sooner.

"I’ll make a long story extremely short.

Me and my partner have been together for over a year. Exclusive from the beginning, no conversations about changing the dynamic.

Recently, we’ve spent a month apart because I’ve had health issues. He told me he’s not going anywhere.

Well, I heard through the grapevine that he’s active on hinge.

I don’t want to burn my sources when I bring this up to him. We live in different cities, and won’t be seeing each other until at least next week. 

My question is, would it be in bad taste to text him about this and question him? Or should I wait until we see each other in person? 

The issue with that is that the waiting is KILLING me. I hate pretending everything is fine and chitchatting while this is in the back of my mind.",Longterm partner on hinge,18osf4z,1703289044.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18osf4z/longterm_partner_on_hinge/,
"I’m dating a guy, but we’re not boyfriend girlfriend, we’re in the going on dates stage, but we also sleep over at each others places. We’ve been talking about getting into a relationship in the future. We met through a co-ed soccer club we are both a part of. 

The issue is, he can be super insensitive. He doesn’t even realize he’s doing it but it makes me feel really put down and it’s building up. If I bring up a comment he made he’s apologetic and doesn’t make excuses for himself. But I feel like I’ve got these mixed signals. Over break, he’s been sending me ONE text a day. I know from a mutual friend of ours that he’s just a slow texter in general but I can’t help but feel forgotten about. After winter break (we’re both in college) I want to sit down with him and have a big talk about what I need to feel cared for and the comments he makes. I just sometimes don’t know if the things he does is because is due to little emotional intelligence (he’s admitted this about himself I swear I’m not trying to be mean) or if he really doesn’t think I matter. 

Example- at the beginning of our relationship he said if things didn’t work out we could be friends with benefits (I’m a virgin so I found this really insensitive). I just don’t think that’s something you say to someone you’re interested in. 

Another example- another guy, X, emotionally hurt me, and the guy I’m dating said he would feel differently towards X if it happened to him but it’s different because it happened to me. 

I like him a lot but he’s really hurt me. I really don’t think he even knows he’s hurt me, and he does say a lot of sweet things like texting me to wish me luck before my big presentation in one of my classes. And he was the one to reach out to start the texting over break. I just feel confused with how he says sweet things and then also insensitive things and sometimes I can’t tell if he’s this dense, and just a slow texter, or if he just actually doesn’t care. He pays for my food when we go on dates if that’s important and also all his friends are male (perhaps why he is dense?) if that’s relevant too",Dating a guy,18oseos,1703289008.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18oseos/dating_a_guy/,

"Help! I suck at dating and need advice!  I (32F) matched with a guy (34M) on one of the apps back in August. 
Now for context, I'm pretty shocking at dating, my job was so hectic and draining that finding the time and energy to go out was really tough. I've also never truly had feelings for the guys I've dated, they've been lovely, but I never felt that spark and those butterflies. So my profile is very, ""let's catch up in person, im horrible at this app"".
Back to the story, we matched in August, he said he doesn't like the app either let's have dinner, I was like fantastic, and when the date rolled around, neither of us planned anything or messaged the other. 
Fast forward 1.5 months later, I get a message from him saying ""hey we never caught up"". By this point, I quit my job and was taking a break, and didn't really have an excuse, it had been 8 months since my last date and I was well out of practice. So I organised it. I guess I wasnt expecting  much based off past experiences, but the date, which was just drinks, went really well, I really liked him, and it seems like it was reciprocated. He wanted to organise the next asap, but he was leaving for a work trip for 3 weeks. I was a bit sad, my experience usually is once they're gone away for a bit, that's it I won't hear from them again. I tried to message when he was away, but the replies were very short and few and far in between, so I stopped (also knew it was a work trip so it would be undoubtedly busy). I was really shocked when I got a message from him as a soon as he came back. I planned the second date which as a few days later. Dinner and drinks. We end up going back to his place. We both had work the next day, so it wasn't a long night and I went back home.
Next day I get a message from him where he tells me his friends have created him a hinge profile. I start to take this as a sign he's no longer interested. But a few days later he wants to catch up again, even if it's for a coffee becuase he has to go overseas again on a improtmu trip. 
We lock in the date of our next catch up at coffee, he goes away, i have this odd feeling that it wont go ahead, so when he's back I message him asking a few days before the date, if it's still happening... he then askes for a raincheck.
So something I forgot to mention above is that he's in the middle of a divorce atm, which he told me on our first date. He asked for the raincheck becuase it blew up while he was away and isn't in the right head space- which is totally understandable and I tell him whenever he's ready.
It's been 3 weeks since then, messages aren't very communicative ( to be fair it wasn't great to begin with, but now it's worse). It's just very once sided.
I have a feeling he's not interested anymore but he hasn't told me, he hasn't told me anything. And it's not like I've been ghosted becuase he replies. Should I just message him and ask of he's still keen and if he wants to hang out???",What do I do?,18osd2k,1703288879.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18osd2k/what_do_i_do/,

"Hey :) 

So here is my (20M) problem : I get approached by girls really often but I'm the most oblivious guy ever. It's making me insanely sad as I feel that even I if I know I'm attractive at the end of the day I'm still alone...

Here are the 2 exemples that triggered me the most lately : (a friend of mine is really attractive and gets hit on between 2 to 4 times a day, it's insane. She's been a friend for a really long time but we don't see each other often). Anyway : I met her mom 2/3 months ago and when her mom complimented me, my friend said ""See ? i told you he was perfect"". Fast foward 2 months we grabbed a Coffee together and she said something along the lines of ""every attractive person that I know is leaving atm"" (I am leaving to belgium for 4 months in a week). And also at one point, when she seemed to not be listenning anymore I called her by her name and she responded ""Sorry I was lost in your voice"". When I met her friends the first thing they said when I said my name was : OOOOH THAT'S YOU !

That girl is so attractive I could never come to the conclusion that she liked me, and I don't want to loose this friendship because I also really like her as a friend. Idk, I just don't know the line between flirting and her being friendly.

What really made me wanna change was when the other day I was working out at the gym with a friend of mine, I got approached by a really attractive girl who wanted me to spot her, we started talking after her set, exchange names but not a lot more as I quickly came back to my sets with my friend. Only to realise that I could have talked more with her and possibly get her number 1 hour later...

I got angry at myself because those types of thing happen really often, I talk to someone attractive but I don't realise I could go further at this moment and I end up missing something 

I need help, I feel alone, I feel so alone. I don't know what to do... I can flirt and pick up signals soooo well when it's with a girl I'm not interested in, but as soon as she is attractive I become the dumbest mf ever.",i'm oblivious af...,18os59v,1703288225.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18os59v/im_oblivious_af/,
"Hi there, sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this, i just don’t know where to post but need to rant. and ask a few questions

i (16m) have had a crush for about 2 years and thought i might have finally had a bit of luck when about a month a go a mutual friend brought up that she called me her boyfriend i took it a bit seriously as we had only talked briefly like once before this. not long after that, we both went to sport practices about once a week and got on pretty well. she would ask me very odd things that you wouldn’t just ask someone you hardly know out of nowhere which also got my hopes up. it stayed like that for about. 2-3 weeks where before a practice, she invited me to the tim hortons (i live in canada), where she asked me many questions like “what’s your current relationship status?” and a BUNCH of other questions about relationships and even gave me her snap. she then said she was asking for a friend who i KNOW doesn’t like me so my hopes skyrocketed. but today, i was planning on telling her but i got my friend to ask her if she liked me because of the situation that happened at tim hortons. they said that she thought i liked her which was correct, but then said she was in a talking phase with someone else. this CRUSHED me. here is the actual questions : 1. how do i get over this? i still kind of have feelings for them but i know it’s not going anywhere. 2. is there anyway to stop this feeling of just hollo and emptiness. i just feel as if all the emotion has been sucked out of me. i don’t feel like playing games, i don’t feel like watching videos or listening to music. and especially i don’t feel hungry or want to eat. i feel sick to my stomach and i just want it all to end. 3. could i have been lead on on purpose? could they have been an asshole this entire time?",My crush lead me on for months,18os4km,1703288169.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18os4km/my_crush_lead_me_on_for_months/,
"Im schizophrenic and had an episode for the first time in front of guy I’m casually “dating”. This is the same guy I posted about the other day, this has just been weighing on my mind and he texted me today following up on this situation. 

I’ve been really compliant with medications and haven’t had any symptoms in quite a while. Because things have been going well, I  started casually dating/FWB with someone and its been great so far. He is very kind and thoughtful. He doesn’t know I have schizophrenia. I didn’t feel like we were at the point in our “relationship” where I had to tell him yet.

Last weekend when I was at his house I started to hear some voices and things felt “off” again. I’ve been under a ton of stress at work lately, so I think this is probably why. I still had insight as to what was happening but I was pretty upset to start getting positive symptoms again after not having them for so long. I felt like I was losing grip. I don’t think he noticed anything other than me being quieter than usual. I waited until he went to sleep and then went and had a mini breakdown in the bathroom. I ended up falling asleep in there and he found me the next morning. He asked what happened and I told him I just didn’t feel well and wanted to make sure he got good sleep. He seemed like he didn’t really believe me and asked if he did anything wrong. I assured him no, but I think he thinks it was something he did. I left that morning to go back home. 

My question is: should I tell him what’s going on? I still have everything pretty under control and talked to my doctor. He added another medication and things have been fine since. Like I said I think it was stress induced. 

The guy I’m seeing is older and seems to be very emotionally mature, I just don’t know if I am ready to tell him yet as it is really private to me - I’ve never told anyone. I’m afraid he will think of me differently or not want to date anymore, which I guess would be good to know now as there’s nothing I can do about it.

How do I go about having this conversation? What do I say? Should I tell him even if we aren’t in a committed relationship? I care about him a lot and would really like to keep seeing him.

"I (22f) met this guy (21m) on a dating app and went on two dates. He’s very well mannered, and I do like him a lot but we literally have nothing in common. We both have an accent so like 70% of the time one of us has to repeat what we’re saying, and our interests and humour don’t really align as well as we’re from very different cultural backgrounds growing up. So I was pretty surprised that there was a second date happening, and on that date we hooked up. Since I’ll be leaving the city soon (plus I assumed he was only looking for a rebound hookup as he mentioned on the first date he just broke up with his ex that month), naturally I thought it’d be a one time thing and we wouldn’t contact each other again.

But when we were cuddling he started to tell me all kinds of stuff, his family and his travel stories and stuff, and also asked me about the guys I’ve been with and this somehow gave me the illusion that he at least cares a bit, it might not actually be just a one time thing. Told him I was a bit sad cuz this will probably be the last time we’ll ever see each other again, he said no I wanna see you again and we’ll just be a couple hours of train apart we’ll be able to sort it out. Asked him if we do see each other again what does he want with us, he replied ‘I really like you, we’ll see how it goes. ‘

After that we went back to each other’s home countries a bit for the holidays, he texts me everyday with a ‘hey’ or ‘how’ve you been’ to check up on me. He replies pretty slow tho. Thing is, does he actually like me, or is he just being polite? (Trying to not ghost me after sex) Cuz for some reason I feel really insecure, for one his previous gfs were all hot European girlies and I won’t be able to compare, second as mentioned we literally don’t have anything in common so we don’t really connect on that level so it’s pretty hard to believe he’d actually be interested in me. 

I think I’m pretty much an anxious avoidant style and I don’t wanna get hurt again by investing my feelings on the wrong person. He’s a great guy and probably one with the most green flags I’ve ever seen.

We get along very well and have a lot of common friends who are also my age. So as a joke we sometimes call him our dad. 

When at parties we spend quite some time around each other and I can sometimes see him secretly looking at me during our shared class.

A few days ago I went to his apartment haha just to take a look. It was just the two of us and I ended up staying for a few hours eventually. It was very fun, good conversation, we cooked together and not a single awkward moment.

The moment that sticks to me tho is when we were discussing relationships and we were both laughing about how we would like to have a boy/girlfriend. Not long after the discussion about age gaps came, because we were talking about a friend of us (18F) that got creeped out by 22 year old hitting on her. He said that he understood our friend and that it was a bit strange for a 18 and 22 year old to have a relationship. 

He said he would be embarrassed to tell his friends that he was dating an 18 year old. Because it would be like he is not capable of finding a girlfriend his age and how he sees 18 year olds still as high schoolers.

I get his point, but it's like all my chanches are suddenly gone. 

I do have some hope tho! After all this happened we met up with some friends to go ice skating. We went straight from his apartment together to meet our friends. And on the way there (and back🙃) we were giggling about how suspicious this was and comploting how we were gonna subtly leave together again. Haha that was fun and it low-key felt like he wanted to kiss me then. But absolutely nothing happend and I just went home.

I don't know how to feel about all of this?!

Is there still hope to get out this friendzone? Or you don't think I'm even in the friendzone? Do I just let this crush go? :/

I thought she was afraid at how deep we were bonding so i gave her space and within a week she called me telling me she missed me. She said she wanted more real dates and to really get to know me. I was over the moon happy, i planned a date to a beautiful winery and we over dressed and went and had a blast. On the date she said she wanted to plan the next date and made me promise the next date was of her making. Weeks went by and we had horse time but no date. I started feeling like she was hiding things from me and I asked her if we were exclusive, her response was “do you really think i have time to date more than one man?” I then brought up that i wanted to go on dates but she had made me promise the next one was for her to make. She said she had forgotten. 

Well things felt increasingly weird in July so i opened a bumble and there she was. I brought it up and she told me she had been on other dates recently but i was the only man she was having sex with and she had kissed some of them but “found it lacking.” 

I told her I am a one woman man and if she wanted to truly get to know me then she should be focusing on only me. She got mad and told me she was not ready to be my girlfriend and being exclusive was being my girlfriend. I told her i needed exclusive and to please let me know by our date on Thursday if she wanted me in her life or not. 

On Thursday she told me she wasn’t ready to be exclusive with anyone and would not be seeing me anymore. Friday i decided to head north and while heading north i saw on bumble she had gone to Avon MN for the weekend. On Saturday she closed her account and it stayed closed until October. I saw it was back up and within a day she text me and was just talking. She wanted to meet but not talk about what had happened. To be honest i love this woman so i agreed, we had a great time and i was happy she remembered it was my birthday. I was still hurt and didn’t trust her. I informed her i had sold chip and she was very upset but forgave me. I was going to give him to her for her birthday in August but with her gone i needed to find him someone who would love him as my colt was ready for saddle training and would need all my time. 

We continued to talk and had sex in November but it wasn’t the same and i got the feeling someone had been there recently before me…

She asked me to start dating again and i asked if she wanted to go to a candlelight symphony on 12/22 and she did but had her kids. Well i got tickets for one on 12/21 and was going to surprise her. 

We kept talking but she started getting distant again but i tried just being me and she decided she wanted a horse. We spent Saturday 12/16 looking at a mare and having deep conversations and the plan was spending the day and night together and then driving out to see a gelding sunday. We got back to her place Saturday night and it got hot and heavy, next thing i know we are naked in her bed but when i went to have sex she said we couldn’t because she wasn’t feeling well and i needed to go home and she would pick me up at 7:00am. This made no sense to me but i didn’t fight it, i left at about 9:00pm. 

She picked me up and we had a great day, the gelding was a bust but we were all over each other again. While we were driving she got a text that popped up on her car from Adam-Bumble saying how great last night was and thanked her for this morning because it was a nice surprise to wake up to… i asked her to explain and she said “you really think i had someone over after you left?” I think that told me what i needed to know. We had plans Wednesday and yesterday (Thursday) so whatever. Well Sunday evening she cancelled the Thursday plans cause “her friend” had got tickets to the candle light orchestra… i told her to cancel her date and keep ours. She blew up about how i am trying to force her to be with me and doesn’t feel safe with me. She went with him. Today she wants to make plans for next Tuesday to look at horses. She claims she loves me and is afraid…

I just needed to say it all… i know she probably will never choose me. I dont know how to get the strength to cut her from my life. I love her, i hate that i love her. I dont know what to do. I keep thinking she might snap out of it and fight for us. I dont understand me and i dont know what to do.

"I recently went through a break-up with someone I was involved with very intensely for a short period of time. 

I was having so much difficulty in processing the end of this connection because I couldn’t help but obsess about “what could have been” .. until heard this quote in a podcast — the universe breaks things before they break you.

It opened me up to the perspective that a connection may have appeared to have potential, but I am thankful that the misconceptions I had about the relationship was revealed before I was given a chance to invest even more energy into it, only to feel deeper pain or betrayal if that connection were to continue on and end later down the line.

I’ve also heard that there is no such thing as “right person, wrong time.” In reality, it’s more healing to believe in “right person, right time” no matter the outcome because the universe had put that person into my life to give me what I needed in terms of a lesson to be learned. Someone will always walk into your life at the right time because they were brought into it to serve a higher purpose for your own self-reflection and personal growth.

What’s crazy is that by reflecting on all of my past connections in 2023, each connection had taught me something that I failed to understand during the connection before.

I appreciate every connection that I experienced this year because each person helped me to reveal a deeper understanding about myself. 

I wholeheartedly believe that the universe will bring people into your life to teach you a lesson, and when the “lesson” runs its course, the universe will conclude it for you so you have time to reflect and bring it forward with you when you experience the next person that walks into your life. Sometimes you just have to let things run it’s course.

For 2024, I want to focus on appreciating the unconditional love that I already receive from friends, family, and toward myself.

My only hope through this post is that it reaches anyone who is having a difficult time processing the end of something and thinking about “what could have been.”",The universe breaks things before they break you.,18or18d,1703285085.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18or18d/the_universe_breaks_things_before_they_break_you/,

Long story short. My colleague has been away from work since last Friday. I fancy him quite a lot. They’ve been away. Which is quite unlike them. Last Friday they had a rather large meeting involving hr. They already told me what it was about but I didn’t pry too much as I know it’s not something I can ask about.

Anyway, the last messages on the chat were from me. Just saying “god tomorrows going to be hectic. Spoke to Sandra she had a good old moan about the changes coming in.” No reply to that.

"I broke up with him end of July this year and it was such a relief. We started dating Jan 2020. We had many downs the past couple of months, I've been asking for some changes for over a year and nothing happened, paired with little to no sex, he was struggling with himself or life a lot(!!) but wouldn't talk to me or anyone else about it at all. Naturally it would drag me down and I felt so lonely, unsafe and as if I was the only one trying to work on this relationship. So I started to withdraw myself emotional and get over him while we were still together - the reason, so I thought, why I wouldn't miss him the first couple of months and be so quick into dating again. 

I started seeing someone new in October which only lasted a month and hard for me when it was over because I got rejected.

For maybe 2 weeks now I started to increasingly miss my ex boyfriend and I don't know why. Is it bc of the other guy, do I really miss him or just someone to not be alone, did I forget all the bad things and now miss the good ones? How do I find out if it's really about him?

I really did love him. For me our relationship started badly bc he didn't want it to begin with, which I might have not entirely gotten over. I saw myself marrying him but anytime I tried to talk about the future he'd just block. He wasn't convinced about marriage itself but said he'd marry me if I wanted but there was never any daydreaming about our future or anything like that.

"I've been ""dating"" this guy on &amp; off for a couple of years.

We never really got a chance to date properly because when we first met, we met during the pandemic.

I gave him a chance last year but ended things because he wasn't trying hard enough.

He never calls me, barely sends me voice notes, and our communication isn't really that great. Our communication is great in person, but I rarely see him. Last year I might've only seen him a few times.

Anyways, I've been struggling to trust this guy because I struggle to get close to him. I feel like he's hiding something from me.

He cancels dates quite often, especially whenever he asks me to come over to his house. Mind you, we've been talking for a long time I've NEVER gone over to his house. I've cancelled a few dates but that's only because I've been on my period, not feeling well, had schedule discrepancies, or had a family event come up. 

For example, this one time he asked me to come over and on the day I was supposed to come over, he told me that his bathroom ceiling started to leak &amp; he said that he was going to get a hotel room and stay there for the weekend so that the repairmen could come and fix his place.

There was another time we were supposed to hang out &amp; he cancelled last minute because he ended up having to go to a writing event.

Or for example, last weekend he cancelled our date because he said his brother ended up going to the hospital &amp; that he was out of town.

One of the reasons I feel \*\*so suspicious\*\* about this is because he ended up telling me that \*\*his sister\*\* lives with him &amp; he's been \*so scared\* to tell me about it.. but I don't know why he'd be so scared to tell me that his sister lives with him. Mind you, he told me about this 6-months into dating last year before I ended things with him.

This one time he asked me on a date and ended up being 40-60 minutes late because him and his sister had a fight before he left the house.

Last year on valentines day, I thought he was going to make plans with me but instead he had a ""work gala"" to go to.

For his birthday, I tried to make plans with him but he declined because he said that his work colleagues were throwing him a party, so we couldn't hang out.

I don't know. I've always felt like he's been hiding something.

He's told me that he's been cheated on before, so I've wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would never cheat on someone.. I just don't know.

"Hey! 

A couple months ago, I (29F) met a man traveling, we were in the same hostel. 

A bit after that I commented on his story in IG and we started texting a bit, quickly figuring out that we liked each other and would have both been interested on going on a date when we originally met. 

We loosely planned on meeting again this fall while his travels would bring him through my country and hang out and see whether something was there with us for real. 

Due to unforeseen circumstances, his he could not further travel and currently, we cannot really meet until a private situation of his changes for the better. 

While he was still traveling I kinda let the conversation slow down a bit, because I did not want to get hung up on a textationship without having actually gone on at least one real date and met up in person and discussed how/wether we could proceed in the future. 

With his personal situation changing, I went back to writing him almost daily, just to check in, provide support and distraction. 

The convos we have are good, sometimes a bit short from his side, but he always answers very quickly.  He also gives me advice on how my issues, and bumps up my self-esteem. 

It's just, that he NEVER ever writes first. 

NEVER. Not a single time. ever. 

Ive addressed it before and he didn't give a statement as to why, but pointed out how much he likes that I show a lot of initiativ, also in the context that nowadays its something thats usually expected to come from men.

It still kinda bothers me. Yet, I don't think it's the right time create any kind of issue because the situation he is in is REALLY tough. 

I told him, rather jokingly, that once this is over and he has mentally recovered, I will expect the shit out of him, and he said he was SO ready for it. 

But then... I did explicitly ask him to proactively tell me certain kinds of updates, he agreed and he just DOESNT UNTIL I TEXT FIRST AND ASK. 

So, what should I make of this. 

is he completely disinterested and just enjoys the attention?

Is it a minor character flaw I should overlook?

Happy for ANY input!

thank you all and merry christmas to those who celebrate it :)

"About a year ago my girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up (for context she was also a year younger than I was). Her and I grew up together and she did become a part of my family. Our breakup was slow over months but complicated-mostly without hard feelings. I look back with a sour taste now, though, for a few reasons that I have expressed to my family. Her closeness with my sister and my cousin, one a little younger than me and one the same age made our breakup super tumultuous and ended up hurting a lot of feelings. She ended up confiding in the two of them off the breakup, one that she took harder than I did initially. Being that her and I tried to stay friends (stupid) after meant there were regularly misunderstandings between us - we always worked them out but my sister and cousin only ever heard that I was being a dick to her. Our breakup plus the gossip between them that followed led to my sister and cousin shunning me for months, my sister eventually stopped but my cousin still does to this day as they are still close.

We had sex several weeks ago and the condom broke but we put another one on and kept going…didn’t think anything of it now we’re here.

I responded and told him he could’ve been more emotionally supportive and that I felt like he was being nonchalant about the situation then I blocked him on iMessage and instagram.

"Let me preface this post by saying that in no way am I trying to start any arguments, just sharing my own experiences. 

For starters I’m an early thirties mixed race guy, half black and half white. I’m genuinely attracted to all kinds of people but my experience of that being reciprocated has been extremely demoralizing to say the least. I guess it will heavily depend on location, but I’m in the pacific northwest part of the United States and it’s mostly White and Asian folks around here. No problem for me, as I’m attracted to everyone. I’m fit, in shape, dress well and a pretty well- rounded guy always down for whatever. I have zero issues making conversation with women and asking folks out. 

No matter if it’s my co-workers, friends (both men and women), family or even my people on here who have reviewed my dating profiles, they all constantly say I’m handsome and one of the nicest people they know and should be slaying it on the apps and in person. Despite the positive feedback, it just seems like no one wants to date a black guy, my interest from women is near-zero.

I totally understand there are still stereotypes involved but still, you’re telling me there aren’t women out there that like me back? For comparison my white friends have no trouble landing dates here, hell even one of my close friends have hundreds of matches and can pretty much be with a new girl every week if he wanted. Then I showed him my dating apps and it was a barren wasteland. He said, “you need to change something up.” This baffled me because I can’t change my race 😂 Even my black friend (a woman) started dating a white guy and they’ve been together for a year now. 

Aside from dating apps, I’ve tried clubs and bars and dance classes, the cold approach etc. women just show zero interest no matter how much I smile, make eye contact and make them laugh. This is the complete opposite of what everyone says I should be experiencing attention wise. Even recently as last week a woman gave me a her number I met at a shopping mall. When I went to contact her the next day, she never responded and she’s the one who gave it to me, didn’t even ask. 🤦🏽‍♂️

When I do get dates it’s always the stereotypical she only exclusively dates black guys or fetishizing that bbc nonsense. (Yes I’ve had it happen multiple times). 

I get dating is hard for everyone right now, but for colored folks it seems extra hard. Like I get it, everyone has preferences and that’s okay, but I feel like I’ve already been pre-selected out by most women I’d most likely be compatible with and it sucks.

Edit: I just read that study done by the Match group listing people of color, especially black women and Asian men the least desirable on apps.

I wasn’t really into him because I always felt insecure with him and I didn’t really fall in love with him and I also moved away for university, so we didn't work together, but knew we were always on the back burner when we saw other people. The last time we met for 3 years ago and recently after I broke up with my ex (another guy) in  October, he texted me. (I’m also home for the holidays) so he texted me (guess he found out i was single) and we've been hanging out ever since. He also gave me a Christmas present. Please help with decoding what this is and his thought process about me.",Is he into me??,18ooogk,1703278454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18ooogk/is_he_into_me/,
"First of all, please be gentle in your wordings. A part of me doesn't want to post the question here because there are so many freaking mean people here, it's honestly terrifying. Please take into account that I'm new to this

&amp;#x200B;

Okay..... I hope this won't be long.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27M have been meeting up with a 30M. Quick backstory, as you have guessed I'm gay. I have spent the majority of my life studying, saving money, and sleeping around with guys because I come from a country in the middle east and I knew having a relationship is near impossible.

I finally managed at the age of 24 to leave to another country in the EU to purse my master's degree. And have graduated this year in July and got an offer from a company in another EU country.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in my time in the first country, I have only slept around and kept FBs without dating or hanging out since I was still worried about my future, if I'd have to go back home or not (shit happened Covid, War, etc.... and I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a job since the visa was near impossible these days).... now I'm here and my original plan was to spend sometime to get better at my new job and settle in the new country (it is my final destination) but I still wanted some fun. I arrived in November, and my job would start in December so I had a month to kill

&amp;#x200B;

I matched with this guy who was ""Looking for Long Term but open for short"" on Tinder..... and we met during a very cold night where we walked all over the city together, talking and chatting..... (I had assumed at some point he'd take me to his place) but he didn't. At the end he walked me to the Tram station, took my phone number, hugged me goodbye

And on the same night, texted me ""tell me when you get back home"" and when I replied, he said ""I wanted to kiss you but I was too shy"" 

He suggested another date, a gym date. We went together to a gym nearby his place (which was also nearby me new work, and my studio which I'd move into in Dec. I was staying in an airbnb for Nov). After the gym date, we stopped by a turkish fast food shop and went to his place............. well..... stuff happened. And he said he wanted to get to know me.... Again, he walked me back to the bus station and texted me ""tell me when you get back home""

He suggested the third date quickly, but it was in the middle of the week. I had learned from him that his birthday was early November. So I brought a box with three slices of cake for him as a gift. We went to the restaurant, I gave him the cake. After eating, we went outside, and he tried to eat the cake with me but we had no forks, so he just fed me one of the strawberries on top of the cake. And walked me back to the bus station. 

Later that night, he also texted me, and said he ate two of the slices and the third is tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, I found a Lebanese shop near my airbnb, and suggested to him. We met there but later he had to go and see a skiing spot with his friend, so talked some more.... and invited him into my airbnb for a quick hangout. He then left with a kiss and a hug. During the time he was in my airbnb, I learned that he couldn't meet me during the weekend because he was going to a party. and the weekend after, he was going to Germany until Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Later... the weekend passed (I had texted him some question about a bank he was using)... he didn't reply for days..... days... I thought he was ghosting me and sent him a text along the lines ""Really?? Ghosting me??? If you found someone else, you could have at least said something!"".... he then replied back later that he was sick (I could hear it in his voice recording). We didn't meet before his flight to Germany.... He never texted me while he was in Germany

&amp;#x200B;

And from there, all of his texts were too slow... He's busy, he'd say.... I would make voice notes for him that could reach +15 minutes... he'd take time but would eventually reply with something.......... That what kept me believing he was interested.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the mistake of telling him I was interested in him and that he was the first guy I actually got interested in.....................

In Dec..... I only saw him twice........  30 minutes before his bodypump session at the gym, where we didn't even talk a lot, everyone was just saying hi to him...... I had brought him a gift for christmas ( a small bike model) and lied telling him it was basically free because of my company's amazon gift cards.

Then few days ago I texted him, but he didn't reply.... later that night I texted him if he wanted to come for a quickie but he has to bottom not me... Suddenly he replied quickly... And dropped by............. I would lie if I said I liked all of it. 

it felt like a hookup........... it honestly felt like a hookup.......... and I had hundreds (not lying) there was nothing romantic about it. He was just focused on my body... we barely talked... we barely touched....... and the cuddling was't long.... we talked a little bit afterwards, he said he's not sure if he's interested in me for LTR or wants to be casual.... I didn't react... but that felt like a throne in my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

something my old fbs would say constantly to me... that I had a great body to fuck, but my personality... I don't have any.

&amp;#x200B;

And I think.... he lost interest in me and now sees me just for sex. He knows that I like him. And he flew back for christmas two days ago, and will be back 8th of January... he hadn't texted me once after the last time we met... 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestlty don't know what to ask for or what to do............ it hurts so much. Everything since his sickness day up to to day has been nothing but agony to me.... my logical side says I expect something from a guy I barely met............... but my emtoinal side is screaming that someone finally sees me more than my body.... but now only sees me for my body.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand.... if I'm attractive... people want to fuck me

If I'm not, people would ignore me

&amp;#x200B;

Then.... what about me as a person? I spent all of my life trying to run away, and now that I'm free.... the only two things I have are my body and brain.... It's not fair.... I don't need someone in my life.... I want someone in my life.... I want to share stuff with someone, I want to hangout,,,, i don't want to just have sex.... why does everyone want me for sex..... even him..... am I that blank of a person... I don't deserve this........

&amp;#x200B;

Should I give it time? Should I be patient? For someone who doesn't text me? For someone who hangs with his friends, who parties, who does everything but texting me? And would only reachout when he realizes that I stopped texting for a while.... just to get back on the hook or am I over thinking this

&amp;#x200B;

I keep remembering that he did listen to my long records, that he does eventually replies.... but the last two times I met him, a part of me wanted to slam his head in a wall, and a part of me wanted to cry in his arms.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I gave up everything in my life, just to realize even living as a gay man, there's no one for me. Someone please tell me what to do!

"I just want to vent and maybe to receive an advice, I'm a 29 year old guy that only have had 1 girldfriend in my life, so I don't really know how to date but this year I tried

Like 8 months ago I meet this Japanese girl in a webpage for dating/finding a partner, we talked a couple weeks and then I invited her to a concert, before the concert we walked and talked for a couple hours and it was kind of good, not the best date but good enough, next weekend we went to a library and after that we went to eat something, I think the second date was much better, the conversation was more fluid, we got to meet important things about each other... to this point I want to say I payed for everything, the ticket for the concert, the food, etc, I don't have any problem about that, just wanted to say that because I think it feels more like a date if the man is paying  
  
On this time she was showing a lot of interest, she usually texted me before I did, and she was asking me for help in almost every little problem she had, I thougth that was a good signal because she trusted me, but after the second date she started to answer my messages every 3-4 days, I was already kind of attached to her so, even if I thought things were over, I decided to ask her directly if she was still interest in dating with me or no, she answered that she thought we were hanging out as a friends, for me that didn't make sence, I told her I was not interested in a friendship and I was looking for a relationship, after that we stop talking  
  
Like 6 months later she send me a message saying she created her instagram and asking for following me, after that we started sending funny/animals reels, but usually we never talked, we just send the reels and that was it  
  
I don't remember how, but one day we talked a little bit and we agreed to go see a show (this time she didn't let me pay, so I was sure it was not a date), we saw the show, walked like an hour and said good bye  
  
Tbh I thought we would never see each other again, but a couple weeks later she invited me to go ice skate. Before skating we walked in a park and talked, I could noticed she was talking way more this time and she was way more cheerful, when we sit she got from her bag some food and told me she brought the food for me, I thought it was super weird (tbh I felt like I was in one of those animes where she takes food to the guy to show that she cares), after that we just went to skate  
  
The next week we talked a little bit more, then on Thursday, while I was in the gym, she sent me a message ""do you have plans for the weekend?"", I saw the message in my smartwatch but I decided to answer once I finished my workout, half hour later when I was about to answer I noticed she deleted the message, but I thought maybe she felt embarased of asking directly or something like that, so I didn't say anything about the message but insted I invited her, we went to ice skate again, and after that she invited me to go with her to the library, again I felt she was very talkative and cheerful compared when the times we met before, I walked with her to her place because she had to pick some stuffs, and when we were at the skytrain a couple times she turned to be just in front of me, closer than usual (not the proximity to kiss, but way closer than normal) and she looked me in the eyes intently  
  
After that we talked a little bit less than previous weeks, and I invited her to the cinema, this time she took some time (3-4 days) to answer, and when she answer she told me she was meeting her partner this christmas break, that obviously kind of shocked me because she never mentioned she had a partner before

  
  
I don't want to give the details, but this year I had dates with 3 different women (obviously not at the same time), 2 of them ghosted me in some point (the last thing one of them told me was ""I had a great time, hope to see you soon again"" after huging me) and the third one is the one I just writted about  
  
I feel super sad right now, like, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, it's my fault to thought she was showing romantic interest? or I'm just unlucky about the ones I have dated? should I keep trying or should I give some time to forgot everything around dating?

"I (F27) reactivated my Tinder profile the other day and started chatting with a guy (M27). I didn't think anything of him - the conversation we had was a bit dull and I noticed he talked a lot, but asked me barely anything. At one point I told him I was annoyed by him for not asking me anything and how I'm initiating a new topic all of the time. He reacted pretty positively to that and started reciprocating it and later even offered to meet me.  
He has been living in another country for almost a year but comes back home during the Christmas holidays; so he's back home now, but still, he is 3 hours away from me. Nevertheless, he came, and boy... It was amazing. We had such a great night - first a dinner, walked around the city, had a drink, and went to my place where we hooked up (just kissed, nothing else) after a couple of hours of talking. He seemed very into me and I enjoyed our time together very much!  
Now, 2 days later, we talk, but I don't feel like something more will happen between us. He is one of the nicest guys I have ever met and I so badly want to meet him again before he goes away.   
My friend says he needs to offer to come again, but I am not sure if I should give him a push and ask him if he wants to come... What should I do?  
Another thing is that I am a bit afraid I'll get a major crush on him if we see each other again and then he'll leave so I'll be a bit sad. The situation sucks. He even mentioned before he went home that it sucks that we live so far away from each other. But then again, if he wanted to meet me, he'd offer to meet me, right?   
And just FYI, he lives with his parents so I'm not sure if it would be convenient for me to travel to him + I don't want to offer that to seem desperate.

So like two weeks ago she wrote me to switch our classes and I was cool with it, and after that I wrote her if she is interested in this music teacher's concert that was coming up at that week. She said she might come, but later she said she can't make it, and I thought it is normal I mean she doesn't really know me and maybe she has to study for an exam or something. So after she didn't come to the concert I tried to talk to her and get to know her over text, but I knew it wasn't really going to work, because I am not much of a texter and she isn't one either I think... Maybe just because she doesn't really talk with people she only sees once a week, but she was dry texting really I mean the worst like she would just send me a laughing emoji and things, so I thought she doesn't want to text and I stopped.

I told her this, and that I would have to move out of state for a while, or get my own place, and the rent here is ~1300 for a single bedroom. I suggested to my SO if we could be roommates.

"Hello, I desperately need some advice on what to do specifically from couples. So I’ve been single for a year and a half and in that time I’ve been in one situationship that ended messy because she had issues but that’s not important. 

I have been trying to muster up the courage to put myself back out there and start dating again. I really dislike dating apps as I’ve meet some truly terrible and abusive people from them. I have been spending a lot of time on campus at UCSD trying to potentially talk to people but haven’t had the courage to yet. 

For a little bit of context on why, I work full time at a customer service job, it’s usually pretty rough because we’re used as emotional punching bags by customers but this holiday season has been rougher then normal. Because of this I feel like I’ve seen the worse side of humanity and see that if people are willing to scream, threaten and try to attack a random stranger trying to help them then there’s no saying what others would do. That’s why I’m usually really scared of meeting new people. 

Yesterday evening I found a gorgeous girl at the gym to talk to, when I went to approach I realized she was taking dozens of gym selfies (which I was in the background) and got a bit of an ick for but let go. And over the course of an hour I watched her take up multiple machines without using them and basically spend that time taking “sexy gym photos”. After that it really turned me off for approaching her and I just ignored it at that point. 

That’s mainly what I’m getting at, I don’t know if I like the unknown of approaching a stranger and seeing how they can be shitty on the inside.

"When I want to jump back into the dating world, I cant help but think my life is boring. I mean my job is weird. I resell on ebay. But most would find this cool I feel like. It doesnt make me feel exciting anymore its just a job...although I can talk about all the cool stuff I find. The gym is just a routine chore anymore and not really exciting. My hobbies of going for a walk/hike/fishing outdoors adventures is just normal to me now. So normal they just dont feel super exciting anymore. I do love to take a girlfriend or friends places though and have a good time. Other than that I like movies, music, games , tv like most people. I enjoy coffee and wine and enjoy tasting different ones. I enjoy cooking. But other then that I feel boring.  
However, on dating profiles and other times this seems like a perfectly normal life. People always say video games gym and outdoors hobby is enough! Idk is it?  
The thing is when im single, I only have my one good friend and myself. But when im dating someone, they usually are my best friend and my everything...so I was going out with them every other week...doing fun exciting things such as museums and aquariums. Now that they are gone. Im just left with what I said above.  
So I really struggle to see if I need more of a life, more than one friend, cooler hobbies, more reading to know important things and hot topics OR im simply just not exciting about what I have which comes off the wrong way. I cant appeal to a girl if most of the fun things I was doing was with my ex too.  
So overall I feel as my job isnt really a proud career although im making money. My social life seems crappy bc I have one friend. But when I have a gf, it was okay. My ex didnt have any friends for that matter..so we were each others best friend.

"Hey everyone, I apologize for the long backstory, but I'll try to keep things brief. As the title implies, I'm (28M) crushing on my (29F) roommate. We've known each other for the better part of two decades and have mutual friends from high school and college, but never really spent a lot of time together. Two years ago, I started spending more time with her because she was going through a rough patch, and it was then that I started developing feelings for her. After a few months I told her how I felt, and while she didn't exactly reject me, she also didn't say she felt the same towards me. All she said was, ""I have a lot of issues, and I'd want to work through those before I date someone and bring them into that mess."" I respected that, and then we continued hanging out over the next few weeks. During that time, she became more distant. I caught her in a few lies and she started keeping me in the dark about what she was up to, so I took that as she wasn't interested. I respectfully distanced myself to get over my crush on her and to better myself. After a few months, I was in a much better place in life and I felt that I was over her. I started seeing someone else around this time, but ultimately it didn't work out. We didn't see each other over the next year and half, but kept in touch here and there, mostly keeping things short.

Fast forward to earlier this year, she was looking for a place to live and asked one of my roommates if she could move in to our house. My roommates and I talked about it for a few weeks, and despite my hesitation, we agreed. Initially things were a little tense, and I'll admit that was on my part, but once she started asking for my help studying for nursing school, we started getting along again.

Surprisingly, living with her has been great. Normally I was the only one cleaning and organizing, so it's been a huge relief to have someone help me around the house. We catch up, talk about life, and it's gotten to a point where she gets upset when I clean or run errands without her. Whenever she has to run errands, she always asks me to come along with her. I invited her to my family's house for Thanksgiving, and she said she'd love to spend time with them again. When I talk about eventually buying my own house, she jokes about living with me and shows me things we could buy for the house. She's even mentioned that she feels much more at peace living with us compared to her previous living situation.

Lately I've been stressed with work and she's taken notice, offering to help out anyway she can including cooking me food, giving me back massages, and lending an ear to hear what's on my mind. When she's stressed about school or something is on her mind, she either comes into my room or we take a night drive and we talk into the early hours of the morning. Before this, she never really opened up about past trauma or her dating history. Now that she's finally opening up more, I've been starting to feel closer to her. I can tell she's matured since the last time I had feelings for her.

The issue is I'm not sure where to go from here. We haven't talked about what happened a few years ago, and frankly, I don't know if she remembers. She could be faking it, but she has admitted a lot of her memories from the past few years have become a blur because of recent trauma and it shows. I'm also worried I'm reading too much into her actions. She is naturally a nurturing and caring person, and she could be doing all of this with me because that's how she is, but she doesn't do these things with our other roommates. I don't want to make things awkward since we live together and I'm scared of potentially ruining a great friendship. She's genuinely everything I could ask for in a woman, so I'm also scared of not taking a chance and she ends up being ""the one that got away"". Where do I go from here?

I need advice about going to two different colleges than my boyfriend. 

I am about to go into university, and so is he, but the issue is we are going to two different colleges. Although we would still be in the same state, I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle the distance. I know we are young and we still have our whole lives ahead of us after high school, and although all couples say this, I really do hope we will last, if we can just get through college and everything to do with it. Im always told that we won’t stay together and we won’t last, but I really want otherwise. I love him to the ends of the earth and can’t imagine life without him, which is cliche I know, and he loves me and feels the same way.

The issue is I am a massive overthinker. I have insane anxiety and I constantly worry about us and our relationship. Living in the same city, I worry about him being happier with other people, or me not being good enough, or him thinking I’m a burden, as you do. He is great in dealing with it and reassures me that everything is fine and he is happy with me, but sometimes it’s just not enough. All of this paired with various adults telling me that we can’t does not help my concerns. I don’t know if I’ll be able to survive through college constantly worrying about him somewhere else, or constantly worrying about how he’s doing and what I can do better, which would not be good for my mental health. I also worry that he won’t be able to handle it or will think I’m a burden or a chore that he has to reassure constantly. 

The real kicker is that while I don’t know if we can stay together, he is completely convinced that we can. He has known forever that we will stay together, and hasn’t changed his mind. I’m slowly starting to see more of a chance, but every time I’m knocked down but some adult who says no you won’t or something along the lines of that. He has strong feelings about this, but I can’t promise because I don’t know the future and what we will do. 

For those who have gone into university in a relationship, I could really use some thoughts, comments, advice, and especially hope for the future to soothe my worry and overthinking. Also people who have gone through long distance. I just need some advice and to see this from another perspective. I know I’m a kid, but I really do love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but I don’t know if I can.",Advice about dating from high school into college,18on8c5,1703274369.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18on8c5/advice_about_dating_from_high_school_into_college/,
"Hi guys,

What do you normally talk about over dinner with your partner or friends in general? Especially, if you are not going to the same sports club or other things. Everything between us is great but last night, I almost ran out of words or topics to talk about. I search online but I personally find asking questions like Who is your superhero very superficial and out of context (it makes you feel silly; tried it before).

With my ex, we never ran out of convo because during dining we were literally laughing at dumb things, from waitress to other people in the place (I know it's not a good thing but we had something going on). So, any advice? I am generally not very good at making friends and one of my friends once labeled me as ""you are very intelligent but not socially smart; that's why you are very successful but you can't make a lot of connections"" (that is, however, questionable as I know more people than him :) so it could be that he is jealous) ",What do you talk about with your partner over dinner?,18on30k,1703273949.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18on30k/what_do_you_talk_about_with_your_partner_over/,

"I 24 f met someone 27m online, we have been “dating” since august but I have never been so confused about where I stand with a potential partner as much as I am right now. 
Most of our dates have been at his place, just wine and he makes dinner. 
Despite our intimate dates, he really doesn’t initiate physical contact, for example on one date, he made dinner, then we watched the moon, he showed me some of the art he was working on at the time and only when my uber was arriving, after i initiated a kiss did he actually touch me back. The whole night!!

 it drives me insane because I understand shyness but we have actually slept together, again the first time I initiated it but it genuinely makes me feel like he is attracted to me. 

He walks ahead of me, prioritises his friends especially this one girl friend, doesn’t text me for days but will like my stories or send me memes. sorry but wtf??  He had a couple trips planned and seemed really keen to see me before he left but cancelled our plans 3 consecutive times after suggesting them first, when he came back, he made no plans but I saw he was regularly posting on his insta with friends including that one girl friend. I figured he was ghosting me, so i reached out saying we should end things, he immediately confessed he likes me more than he anticipated and felt overwhelmed… bullshit right? 

he suggested we have dinner to talk but this was odd because it was dinner at a public restaurant…. we never do this. I figured this was deliberate because obviously you wont open up in a restaurant full of people right especially since dinner is normally at his place with him and his art and monstera plant.
 
Even after dinner, he made no move to touch or even kiss me… needless to say I was still painfully confused 
I asked if we were going back to his after and he made some lame excuse about his place being messy, he invited me over that same weekend and guess what he fell asleep within 20 mins of me being there😞

I eventually decided to call it quits, i feel so insecure with this connection, he seemed so distraught, called me right away saying he was sorry but he was conveniently flying out the next day, he asked if we can meet up in the new year but honestly I have zero hopes. it’s either im being a b*tch or this man is playing me. this avoidant misunderstood artist stitch is old.

My current approach is to just not try and stress about it since it’s completely out of my hands. I do feel that I’ll be able to continue being friends.

"I (22F) am unsure if the man that I am in love with (24M) is a liar.

Four months ago, I met this guy at a friend's party and there was instant chemistry. I have never felt anything that immediate with anyone and it really shocked me. For the purposes of the story, we will call him Daniel. Daniel and I seem to have almost everything in common (which may be a negative thing in and of itself, but regardless); it's almost as if it was too good to be true. We have had an almost identical upbringing; the same core values and principles; similar goals and aspirations for the future, etc. However, there has always been a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that something was wrong, albeit I needed to see the evidence in front of my eyes before I started branding Daniel a walking red flag, or anything similar.

About a month after us meeting, I learned that he was friends with his ex (we'll call her Laura), which initially didn't bother me. The relationship broke down due to cultural differences, not any fault or blame on either party. He wanted to marry her after three years of them being together but when he went to ask his parents for their blessing, they declined, citing the fact that she isn't from the same culture as the main reason for their declination. Daniel is very family oriented and has always dreamed of having a wife that blends well with his family, thus he came to the conclusion that their relationship needed to end. They were both heartbroken, but he claims he has now moved on.

Nevertheless, Laura is starting to get on my nerves now. Her and Daniel went for coffee three weeks ago and he left his phone on the table when he went to the toilet. Since she knew his password, she snooped through his phone and read through as much of our conversations as she could, screenshotting things as she went, including a lingerie photo that I sent to him (which is super fucking weird, to be honest). She confronted him about it, calling him a liar, even though he was clear with her about him and I dating from the beginning. Around a week or two later, her questions started to become incessant and bothersome; it was really quite the fucking hassle and I wasn't here for it. However, she kept those questions for Daniel and never included me, so since the mess seemed to be contained, I was fine with them doing what they needed to do. In my mind, it was none of my business.

A week ago, Daniel was travelling to a video shoot (he's a producer) with Laura, who had offered to drive him due to his car having a couple of issues. He called me before he got into her car, saying that she was going to ask me a question and he 'just wanted me to say no'. She ended up asking me:

* whether he has ever sent me a dick pic;
* whether he has ever sent me a video of said dick; and
* what the nature of mine and Daniel's relationship is.

Not going to lie, I was fucking fuming. At this point, I didn't even know Laura's name, neither did I know or care what she looked like. I thought: how dare this stranger start asking me all these intrusive Qs about things that really have nothing to do with her? It was giving messy, and I don't do messy. I told Daniel this after the fact. Although I answered them on the spot, I said that we needed to talk because I really wasn't happy. I spoke; he listened; he assured me that he understood where I was coming from, apologised for even allowing the situation to arise in the first place, and gave his reason for asking ME to lie for HIM as the fact that 'she is so much drama and I know she would make a big deal out of nothing. I didn't want to start volunteering information that she doesn't need to know'.

At the time, I accepted the reason and didn't think too much into it. However, when I told my sister, she mentioned that Laura probably thought Daniel was telling her the whole truth and nothing but, especially since he commissioned *me* to be his ""proof"". She warned me of the fact that he really could be a liar, and I could be just as much of a fool as Laura if I'm not careful. He has always hampered on about being super fucking honest and being an open book, so I can definitely see where she is coming from and now I am slightly concerned.

What do you think?

**TL;DR** – I've been dating this guy I absolutely adore for 4 months who claims he's nothing but honest, yet he lied to his ex (now just his friend, apparently) about the nature of our relationship, and he asked me to lie too. He said the reason was because she attracts drama and attention, and she didn't need to know the answers to her questions.

He and his wife have lived apart for years. They share 4 kids, a business, and other investments together. Part of what actually attracted me to him was the respectful way he spoke about her, the way he's an amazing dad, and coparents wonderfully. He told me they never filed because of the business and the kids. They want to leave it to them and divorce would cause them to lose too much money. Guess I should note that she has been with another man for 3 years now. 

However, they share everything still. Down to little things like streaming accounts, and big things like bank accounts. I feel as if I can never truly be his life partner because well, he already has one. 

I expressed my concerns. He said that she was not, and will never be his life partner. He claims to understand what I'm saying and says that those things can be changed in time.. that it's a learning curve for him and I that we can get through together. When he first told me of being married I did ask him what happens in a few years if we were together and I ultimately wanted that.. He said that he'd make it happen if we got to that point.

Been seeing this guy (22M) and i'm (20F) after meeting on a dating app. He lives far away so we've only met three times, two times at his and once at mine and we've stayed over the whole weekend every time (so three days in a row), we're planning on meeting again soon and he seems to really like me. We text every day but he's a hardcore introvert and his job is very socially tiring so we don't really call a lot. We haven't done anything else but cuddle but he's giving me so many signs that he really wants to be with me.

"Hi!

I joined a new job very recently. First day on the job I end up meeting a new hire as well and we grabbed lunch together. We really hit it off and I thought he was super cute. We seemed to have a lot in common. For our jobs, we sometimes travel a lot, so after that 2 months went by and we didn't see each other again (I was traveling outside the office weekly). I saw him at our holiday party, but even though we made I contact he never approached me. 

I'm back in our city and was swiping through bumble when I saw his profile! I haven't dated anyone in a long time and have found it really difficult to find someone, especially with all the work travel. So I took a desperate act...I wanted to see if he liked me so I paid for the premium 1 week version and saw that he did match on me! 

As some of you know, in bumble the girl has to message first if you match, otherwise the guy can't send you a message. I haven't matched him yet because I'm unsure if I should. We both just started the job, dont know each other much, and it might get tricky in the office. At the same time, we both have a job with heavy potential travel so if I dont take a chance now, we might barely even see each other for things to develop naturally on their own (or they could, who knows). 

There's something about talking through an app and letting go of those initial build up moments of the romance, and wondering whether the person likes you, flirting little by little- that I feel will be taken away if we just match through an app. 

Should I let things unravel IRL? Should I match but not message to give him the hint Im interested or would that be confusing? Or should I match and message him?

"hi! i'm a 20m in college. i just started going on dates a year ago and ofc many people know it's been a roller coaster of good and bad. 

this year in college is by far the busiest I've ever been and don't see anything happening long term(though I'm not opposed if the right thing comes around of course). 

i had sex for the first time after meeting someone from tinder last month and it was genuinely a good experience. they were kind, patient, and communicated which made everything go smoothly. i've been staying on top of getting tested and staying informed by my doctor(who told me to basically not have sex...).

my mental roadblock comes with doing this well...more here's some things that come up 

1) it's a lot easier to tell your roomates you need the room for the night and have the place to yourself. right now i only have wednesday when my parents are away from work. not everyone is free wednesday. my roadblock here is segwaying coffee, food, walk in the park etc. into something well more without having a college apartment. i guess if there's a will there's a way.

2)figuring out what the other person is looking for. many people on hinge where I match people have ""figuring out dating goals"" or nothing. it's sorta a two way street with asking because someone could be open for something casual but they don't want to say that right away without getting to know them do even if I ask I could get the wrong answer. also it's a bit hard to shoe horn it into a convo right?

"I started dating him a year ago right after me and my ex broke up. We hit it off pretty well, but I was not over my ex at the time. Being a stupid teenager, I cheated on my current relationship with my ex for over a week. My ex then tells my friend what I have been doing. And so, issues arise. My friend breaks up with me. During some weeks, we (me and my friend) keep talking till a point where we have intimacy for the first time. After two days, I confess that I love him and I will change. He accepts me and we start dating again. However, I created a grave mistake again. Explicit photos were shown to other men, by my account. Out of guilt, I blurted out what I did to him. He begins to gain more and more trust issues as the year goes by because of my consistent lying. Currently, we are not together but trying to work it out. However, I keep trying to stop lying but it sometimes slips through.

I do not want to justify my bad habit, but I want to explain my habit. I do it out of fear of reaction. Due to my mom’s demeanor, I have lied to her countless times because I am in fear of how she will judge me and react to it. Fear rules me in ways that I do not know how to react or do things. 

I really do love him, and I feel guilty every time I commit a mistake. I want to be better for him and give him beyond the bare minimum.

"So there's this crush I've been having, he's an important business partner. I confessed to him via private chat on WhatsApp because the conversation via (business) telephone prior to it sounded like it was the right time to do so. We had a very close relationship work-wise and we got along a bit too well personally. 

I told him about my feelings: ""Hey, you know if I wasn't so afraid, I had told you that I would like to get to know you better, privately, so we can get to know each other behind the business-partner-facade, but only if you feel the same way. But as I'm too chicken, I cannot say it out loud so I just think to myself...""

He had always responded quickly and never left me on read - but he did this time. I have my ""read"" notifications turned off on WhatsApp, but I was so sure he read it this time. 

He then acted so out of his skin and ignored me even work-wise, didn't call, didn't email; yet he did email my supervisor with me only being SOMETIMES in Cc and certain things HE would have asked from ME were sent by his colleague. Yet we had contact in some way nearly daily. 

I sent the message last Thursday evening and then deleted it at noon/ in the afternoon on Friday because I thought ""fuck it, long absent and soon forgotten"".

Also I was somewhat waiting for a response to my ""happy holidays"" texts: 
A business card,
two Christmas cards I sent him personally but he said he never received them (I sent one and then another one because I thought it got lost in the mail but he also didn't react),
a personal business mail directed to him, his colleague and his boss and
a ""mailing"" to all of our main clients, including him and his company. (I had reasons for having that many holiday greetings.) 

He didn't even respond ONCE all this time. But when our boss sent him greetings, he replied with a WHOLE FKN NOVEL, to the boss and my supervisor only (I was shown afterwards.) 

I wouldn't make such a fuss normally but he's the type of person who always replies instantly to an email or a text, with sometimes only having to ""wait"" an hour at max. Also I was used to him always being there for me as I was for him.

I also receive my work mails on my cellphone so I saw his mail today with him sending me some stuff he needs with an ""Oh and merry Christmas!"" at the end of the mail. His mail came way after working hours. 

Call me salty but either he read it and ghosted me or there's this HUGE COINCIDENCE that he hasn't read it and just behaved out of character because..... weather. 

He had sent an email or two in between regarding work stuff but didn't call or anything.

"**TL;DR** 

I finally got to take out the girl that I’ve liked forever, but I’m not exactly sure what it was or what all this is. Should I just talk to her or continue going with the flow?

**Context**

I’ve known her for two years at work. She was with a boyfriend for some of that time, but he was a huge asshole and that ended as of 4 months ago. A little after that time we got close and started seeing each other outside of work many times, but only a few times one on one. Mostly with other coworkers. Some of these times it would end up so it was just us two in the end, or we’d have to take one another home by the end. Point is, even with others around we’d always end up gravitating. 
Sometimes it would just be her and her friends. 

We would text for hours from night into the early morning, sometimes for a few days at a time.

**Story**

A few nights ago, she initiates by texting me a new song from her favorite band. The last time we’d hung outside of work was 3 weeks ago to see a movie/thrifting with her female friend, just us 3. We talk and she mentions an upcoming Christmas party that I will also be attending. She suggests picking me up, which I found cute as it seemed like she was making an excuse to do so. I actually think I may be slightly out of the way. 

Anyway we talk for hours, but around 2am I bring the conversation to travel. I mention this historic city that’s beautifully decorated with Christmas lights. She says she’s been wanting to go. I ask her if she wants to go with me, and she ecstatically says yes! BUT, there’s no mention of the word date or hang out or as friends or anything like that. Before I can even ask when, she asks me when I’M free. Mind you, this city is 2 hours away from us. We figure out we can’t really do it later than tomorrow (as in today, it’s 2am). So we decide to go later that day.

I get her at 4:30pm. We go off and have a GREAT time the entire time. We see and do lots of stuff under all the lights. I can’t miss a beat making her laugh. At one point I offer her my hoodie due to the cold. She’s reluctant at first saying I’ll be cold, but I just take it off and she accepts. 

On the way back we start to near our exit, it’s like 2:30am. She mentions the butterfly effect, and how if she hadn’t texted me non of this would’ve happened. She begins to ask me what the next “adventure” is. 

We arrive to her house at 3am, but she lingers in my car for an entire hour. She has to get up for work at 5:30! We talk about loads of things, but here is where it gets interesting. She kept pausing when the topic of conversation would die out, instead opting to kind of stare at me. I could feel her staring, and I don’t really do well with eye contact if it’s not conversational, so I’d look back at her and engage for a second then kind of smoothly start talking again. Back to our “date”, there was a similar point where this exact same thing happened. We were at the historic fort, and sat down by the water and talked forever. There, she did the same thing, but I did the same thing I’m doing in the car. Nevertheless, we say our goodbyes and we tell each other that we had a great time. SHE tells ME that we should definitely do it again. By 4am, she leaves my car **WITH MY HOODIE ON**.

The next morning she posts a photo from our night out on her story. I won’t give any details, but it’s obvious that it’s just her and I in the photo. She texts me a TikTok of a couple who did the exact same thing in the same city saying “looks familiar”. We text and we setup two different times to meet each other again. 

**TL;DR** 

I finally got to take out the girl that I’ve liked forever, but I’m not exactly sure what it was or what all this is. Should I just talk to her or continue going with the flow?

We’ve been talking intermittently since then, it’s been 4 days since all that happened. All of my friends are telling me not to worry because of all of the “positives” so far, but it’s really bothering me that I do not know for certain what she wants from me.

"Aloooo I'm a 24M (sounds like my t-shirts size XD) 
So I've spent the last three months going on the same bus route to school every morning (1 hour long).

About a month ago there was this girl who started sitting with me in the bus pretty much every day for a week (I'm pretty sure she likes me) (I don't know her much but I like her too). She basically just sat there and went to sleep because the bus is at like 7AM so I didn't bother her much. Then she would wake up and I would talk to her for a bit and crack some jokes for her to make her laugh.

Then she stopped coming to sit with me and I kid you not I've spent the last 3 weeks wondering what I might have done to upset her.

I thought she got uncomfortable with me because sometimes our legs brushed against eachother due to the bus moving and that's why she stopped coming for classes for several days and then never sat with me again.(I think she is a bit shy)

I was feeling pretty bad thinking I had alienated her so I wanted to apologise to her and offer sitting at the  back of the bus because I thought she didn't wanted to see me, I also had the feeling she stopped coming to class just to avoid me.

Thing is when I was about to ask her for a moment to talk about it all she was sleeping. Then I thought ""I'll write her a note and attached it to her schoolbag to make sure she saw it when she waked up.

She never replied so that clearly meant she was pissed off at me. And that's how I spent several weeks in the back of the bus.

To anyone who may have been picking my text apart at my assumptions I'll say you are totally right.

Today I sat in front. She went aboard the bus. Saw me. Sat beside me and I could feel my insides brewing.

And then she just fell asleep.

Turns out she wasn't pissed at me, she never got to see my note, she didn't sit with me for the weeks before because she gets dizzy in the back of the bus so she stayed in front. 

I basically fabricated a whole paranoia that I left unchecked for almost a month without even checking on the girl.

Also it seems so that my skills at attaching notes leave much to be desired.

Why do I write this? Well, I just want to tell my future self (well, and you redditors) in case I read this in the future.

Move forward, only forward, either to success or to screwing things up but go forward. 

When you mess everything up own your mistakes and be fast to apologise for them. Not everyone will forgive you for them but at least learn from them.

"**Context:**

So I'm 27M, have been friends with 33F when I was still employed in that same company. I no longer work there, but she still does. 

My initial impression of her was that she's cool, a go-getter and above all, she's chill and kind. A couple of month goes by, and I soon started to realize that I fall for her - she lights up the room and our conversation whenever she's in it. Oh and boy she's way out of my league, she's owned her own house, she bought a car, travelled multiple places while I'm just renting a single room, owns a motorbike, and never travels.

She's out of my league in my view. Simply because she's older than me and has lots of experience and has accomplished much.. She gives plenty of advises and helps me out, I guess that's why I fell for her. I never confessed or said that I like her, because I don't wanna freak her out while we were working in the same company. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Dilemma/Crux of this post:**

Now we're at the 3 year mark of having this ""tradition"" of hanging out weekly, mind you not just us, but our other friends/colleagues from that same company. ***About 2 weeks ago, she found out that I had a crush on her throughout the 3 years***. She then pulled me aside from the rest of the group while we're hanging out and personally told me that:

* She appreciates my chill attitude - that I didn't second guessed her decision when we were working in a team that was heavily-male dominated. 
* She also added that likes me for being kind with her throughout all these years, for being there with her when she was down. 

Right after that, she then gave me a bag of candies that I like. She told me that she's in no rush to wanna take this to the next step, but before doing that, she wants to know if I'm still having feeling for her and making sure we're both in the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my dilemma:** I still like her. I know very well that she's way out of my league. But as stated in the title, is that legit?? I mean, when I check online and read about stories on ***why*** couples fall in love, the women would say something along the lines of:

* ""she's attracted to him/his sexiness"",
* ""she falls for his cute looks"", or 
* ""she likes him for his accomplishments/strong financial standings"", etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Never in my entire life have I ever known that a lady falls for a guy because of the intangible things that she said**. I mean, she appreciates my chill attitudes, me being with her while she was stressed with work - those are what friends are for, no? Anybody can do that imo.

I don't know man... Being kind, being helpful, I don't know if these are enough. I just afraid that if the next sexy or cute guy with better financial accomplishments come along, then she might dump me for him, or any other next better guy. 

**Thoughts/Concern?** I don't wanna rush this either, hence I'm looking for feedbacks with different lenses.

"Tldr : met girl kicked off both mutually interested but she off on vacation. Do I msg her good morning every day. I've been waiting for her to msg for 2 days.


Hi,
Little new to dating protocol so thought I'd reach out for advice

 I met this awesome girl at my uni at a private event in a club and with hit it off. I know she's into me and her texts were usually long and show me warmth. We also went on a first coffee date last week, which she proposed, where we mutually agreed that we were both having fun and would love to see each other again. After which we walked back home, hand in hand, and for the first time in 3 months I wished my house was further. I kissed her goodnight and she wanted me to text her when I reached home. I think the next day I texted her good morning beautiful and part of me feels might have given her too much approval instead of letting her chase more, but in a string of texts she wrote something to the effect that she was lucky she had her out of state friends (I mentioned friendships are important) and she said I was lucky to have her now. ( Does she already think I'm the one whos in the weaker position?)

Two days laters she went for a vacation which will last a week. Initially I wished her a good morning and during the evening we'd talk through text but the past 2 days I didn't want to initiate as that would show that I'm more emotionally invested than her which I feel would seem needy and push her away. 

Am I right in waiting for her to text me first for 2 days? I know she's with friends and don't want to keep invading her space. Or will she expect me to always message first which makes me seem the clingy one.

I'm not misogynistic but know that we all have primal instincts and ppl keep telling me I should let her come to me instead of being first to initiate each time. 

I really hate texting as it's no substitute for meeting in person and reading body cues which I'm really good at.

He even asked me for sex, but I shot that down. I told him we aren’t even boyfriend and girlfriend yet, and he said nothing. What I mean to say is that we’re doing all these things together and I know it’s early on but I feel like by this point he should have asked me out. He even said he loves me yesterday but I didn’t say it back (However he admits love/like are the same word in his mother tongue so he doesn’t completely understand the heaviness). He says he can see us together long term. He says he’ll convince me to be his gf when we joke around but he hasn’t even asked me yet.

"To preface, my first relationship was at the end of highschool, after graduating we separated and that was that. It's now been 5 years... so i basically have 0 experience, and I haven't dated since. Been busy with work and study etc. Now I am at a point that I am happy with myself and have wanted to start dating. Despite being completely dense...

I'm currently in Japan on a long holiday (3 months), and am am leaving this coming January. I've been on dates with 3 very different type of girls, and am feeling conflicted on who to dedicate my feelings and time to. One girl was also a traveller, and we had 2 dates, with the last one ending very well. We have been speaking every day since she left, and there still seems to be feeling between the two of us.

Another girl is Japanese, and she is very typical reserved Japanese. We've gone on 3 dates now, and have held hands for only a few moments. I have a date booked with her for all day tomorrow.

Lastly is another Japanese girl, I've gone out with once, and had a great night with. She is not as reserved, but still likes to take it slowly. We plan to meet again on the 30th.

My predicament comes from not wanting to bait any of these girls. Because I have limited time here in Japan and they all know it, I feel rushed in hashing out our feelings before I leave. But each of their circumstances are quite different. First girl has already returned to her country, but has showed interest in visiting my country next year. The second girl initially had no interest in travelling, but after our last date suggested maybe visiting my country for a working holiday. Then the last girl is already book to come to my country next year for a working holiday.

I'm nervous because tomorrow there is a high likelihood the girl may confess to me. Ideally I can convey that I would like to have more time to think about it, and discuss with her if she will be okay with us not meeting for a long time. I know I have some feelings for each of them... but due to all their plans for the future being quite different it makes it difficult who to commit to, and I'm struggling with differentiating between feelingd of infatuation or something more serious.

Anyways... sorry for the emotional rambling. Im definitely quite nervous about tomorrow, and would really appreciate and all advice/criticism.

"For context: I have never dated nor had relationships with anybody my whole life but since entering university, I wanted to know what it's like to be in a relationship so I have been on dating apps. and recently, I have started talking to a guy. However, I think he has a different expectation/ view on a casual relationship? He asked me what my view of a casual relationship is like (my answer was hanging out for lunch or going to lectures together). and though he said he would take it slow, he would direct the conversation to a more sexual relationship (FWB) which is something I'm not familiar with so I don't really know how to feel about it. In response, I would try to redirect the conversation to a more 'safer' topic but he would bring back the conversation to sex like asking me about my 'drive' or whether I have sexted before (and we literally known each other for like 2 days).

"There is a couple of reasons, from mild autism, through parents completely neglecting my social development, to severe ""failure-to-launch"" syndrome. I do have a little sexual experience, but no romantic relationship ever and at this point, the dating thing is like a foreign language to me. I long for intimacy and a relationship, but currently have no ability to form one.

And any changes in this area feel like fighting an uphill battle with an outnumbered and underequipped force. Even the smallest improvement costs an disproportional amount of effort and my resources are not unlimited.

Do you think I could benefit from hiring a **female** dating coach? I do have a general idea on what are my weaknesses and what abilities I lack. I mostly look for honest-ish feedback from someone who talks to a lot of people. What is their impression of me, what works for other clients, perhaps some obvious changes (since it's always darkest under the lamppost). Also a different perspective, because I don't interact much with extroverted, outgoing people and most of those dating coaches seem like this. I wonder what is their outlook on more reserved people like me.

Has any of you worked with a coach like this? Has it helped? How long have you been working?

I would like to point out that there is no ulterior motive here (like wanting to date the dating coach, lol), and I would prefer a perspective as much as possible different from my own, so no male coaches and PUAs.",Dating has never been a part of my life (M33).

I've been seeing a guy for three months. Things were going well—and still are to some extent, in the sense that we have lots of fun when together—but then I asked to be exclusive and he said he wasn't ready. This has stressed me out. I like him, so I'm going to keep seeing him. Last night, however, I decided to go out on a date. It went really well, and it really makes me question why I keep seeing this other guy. I guess going on this date reminded me that there are a lot of other good people out there, including many who will probably want to be exclusive by that time. Refreshing!

Edit: To be clear, I didn’t go out with this guy to make the other guy jealous. He denied my request to be exclusive, so he’ll never know about this, even if we do eventually see each other exclusively.

Since then, we'd been messaging almost every day and been on two more dates. He seemed really sweet and really into me (and I really liked him).

It's been three times where he's asked me on dates and cancelled last minute. The first time he said he had a stomach upset, the second time he said his phone/bank cards had been stolen so he couldn't get in touch.

It seemed believable because he went out of his way to get in touch with me via social media instead.

Then last weekend after messaging him to confirm our date, he cancelled on me 4 hours before because he'd had to travel to another town to sort out some ""personal stuff"". At that point I got very suspicious but thought he might be telling the truth, except he hasn't messaged me at all since the weekend to offer a proper explanation, apologise or try and reschedule.

I felt a very odd sense of belonging with him that I did with nobody else. It felt very easy to talk to him, even on just the very day I met him. As time went on, I noticed he was making moves which seemed very obvious to me that he was interested in something more. We both were dealing with heartbreaks individually so we didn't want a rebound situation to happen, so we were very concerned with how to begin dating. We made sure to communicate as much as possible about worries and be as open as possible. I was very excited to start dating him. I'm also going through a very rough time at uni with assignments, deadlines, and commitments and my mental health isn't at its best either. So, I did express I wanted space and not to meet up too often. However, he said he missed me a lot so we decided to meet up briefly before our first date. We ended up having our first kiss. And for context, I've never felt anything while kissing anybody (I might be ace, idk) and I thought it would be different with him as I've never kissed anyone I was romantically involved with until with him but I felt nothing again. And turns out it was his first kiss as well. He wasn't very good and that's completely okay but idk what happened that night, I just didn't feel any emotions for him after the kiss. He also was acting a bit differently that night, was quieter than usual and he said that's cause he felt comfortable around me and could just be comfortably silent but I guess that also scared me a bit. I cried to him the same night cause I was a bit freaked out and thought I am most definitely ace. We went on with our first date despite this, it was nice. We got physical after (not sex, but second base) and I was okay with it, I felt indifferent and sometimes good but wasn't overjoyed being physical or anything. We decided to take a break for a while, until exams are over for both of us to figure out what to do. The break was my idea, cause I don't know if I like him at present.

Reddit community I am so confused. I am new in the modern dating pool. I dated a lot in my 20,s but after divorced I focus on my work and my self now I am 38.

I met this man that seem to be very stable single dad and I am a single mom so we had great convo and went on different scenarios for a date restaurant dinner, movies, tacos I tough we were cool. 

In one of our dates we drank a lot and I stayed at his place we kissed, cuddled and touch but we didn’t have sex. Next day he is all nice and lovey calling me and texting and I was happy about that. Next date we go to the movies we kissed goodbye and left to each other houses. We planned a date at his house for next time.

For work I drive a lot so I had to drive one hour an a half to get to his house, we had dinner, great convo and then we had sex. 

So we are cuddling and I ask him what does he think about us and he said I like you, I said I like you too but my question is more towards to know if we are exclusive or if you are seeing other people. And he said that he has friends that wants his attention but he gives that attention to me, he said that we are friends that we like each other and we should get to know each other more and I said ok I agree with that and then I said that I won’t like to be friends with benefits but I understand the part of getting to know more each other. 

We were cuddling and he started asking what time did I have to wake up? And he said he had to wake up early so for me that was a sign that he wanted me to leave so I directly ask do you want me to go home, I would prefer you tell me now cause I don’t want to drive home at 3:00 AM. And he said I don’t want to be a jerk but I am use to sleep alone…

So I grab my stuff and I told him that’s the first time someone ask me to leave (I was crying at this point cause I felt very humiliated) and I didn’t fell right about it cause he knows I live an hour away. And he said he didn’t want to hurt me blablabla and I told him that I just think he was not in to me cause if he really liked me he would not let me leave and he say maybe you are right so I step out and he was behind me and told me to text him when I get home, I just smh and left.  

I just think that why was not a problem the first time I spent the night with him, I am not sure if this is normal now days, if he freaked out because of our conversation or if I over reacted but I was so upset that I deleted him from all my social media and phone number.

When it came time for her to go back to school for her final semester, she broke things off as she essentially did not feel “she could be a good/fair girlfriend while living several hours away and prioritizing school, college friends, and family.” I’ve gone back and forth since then on believing that reasoning, but regardless I’ve left her alone so not to bother her, while also not hurting any potential chance I have in the future. None the less, she’s back home now, and I’m finally going to call her tonight to congratulate her on graduating, hopefully talk about how her semester went, then I intend to ask her out on a date next weekend.

I’ve been too embarrassed to open up about this girl to any of my close friends, so I’m just looking for any motivation or advice anybody on here may have.

"I’m a 31-year old male. After 20+ years of being alone, I decided to give online dating a chance and download Tinder for the first time. I immediately regret making that decision and feel a lot shittier than I did before. This has to be the absolute worst purchase I’ve made in my entire life. 

This app is so annoying to use because everything’s LOCKED behind a fucking pay wall. Most of the time it feels like I’m playing a bad gacha game. There’s even micro transactions which allow you to buy fake currency so you could try to get that ONE person to “like” you back. I’ve been swiping left and right all day everyday for the past week and I NEVER get a single match. I just keep getting ghosted over and over again. I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to Platinum. I ended up buying some boosts/super likes but I honestly don’t see any difference than before. This whole experience has been chaotic and I completely lost sense of reality at this point. No decent girl would ever try to sell themselves online unless they have some kind of EGO/motive. It’s Only Fans but without any of the perks. I just have one question at the end of the day and that is….why?

From what I’ve read online, Tinder is just an app for people to hook-up but not necessarily to pursue a long-term relationship. Other apps are probably better in that regard but the majority of them implement that same system of going back and forth. It just takes WAY too much time and effort to find someone who “matches” you. It doesn’t gaurentee anything in return besides pissing me off. The bar is so extremely high and people in general have such unrealistic standards when it comes to finding a significant other. As an average man myself, I find it very difficult to stand out of a crowd all because I’m not part of the top 5%. Unless you happen to be tall, handsome and have a very successful career then you’re just shit out of luck. There’s way too much gatekeeping when it comes to matching because there’s ZERO communication. HALF of them are just BOTS so how the fuck do you expect me to take this seriously when I can’t have an actual conversation? You’re at the mercy of some corrupt algorithm that bases everything on face value and that mindset will only dig a deeper hole into depression.

If there’s anything I learned from this experience it’s that I have to stay AWAY from dating apps. This is just another scam praying on people’s desperation with no desire to improve your life whatsoever. I feel like I’m just wasting a lot of the time and money I could’ve used to make myself a better person. For my entire life, society has always taught me to pursue a relationship because it’ll make me “happy”. But at this point, I’m not sure if I even want it anymore. 

WHY the hell would anyone want to suffer through all of this BS? As soon as this subscription expires next month, I’m deleting this app for good and never coming back to it. But feel free to change my mind.","Dating Apps are useless, change my mind",18oeg9j,1703250214.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18oeg9j/dating_apps_are_useless_change_my_mind/,
"We met on Tinder and I (27M) asked her (26F) to go on a date after a week of chatting. I told her after one of our first dates that I just got out of a relationship of 4 years. She told me she was okay with this but that she wanted to take things slow to make sure I wanted to be in a relationship for the right reasons. Fair enough. I told her I respected this and that I thought that is a healthy approach. 

Since then we've been dating for almost 3 months and nothing has happened. Last week I asked her how she sees things progressing between us and she mentioned she still has a hard time with the fact I was together with someone else not too long ago. She told me that after we spend the evening at her place in the couch, she imagines me and my ex sitting in the couch together. That made me kind of frustrated because I feel like she should be able to trust me by now. That if she can't trust me this is never going to work out. I could tell she was kind of shocked by me mentioning being frustrated. At the end of our date we kissed, because I could tell she was open to it. 2 days later I went to her house and she started to kiss me when we were sitting in her couch. Passionate kisses. I was over the moon and thought things were going great. 

Yesterday we had another date and besides a quick hello and goodbye kiss nothing happened. She also seemed more distant and not really enthusiastic to see me. I mentioned this to her afterwards and she told me she feels pushed and that things are moving to fast for her. I feel guilty for pushing her because that wasn't my intention. I was just frustrated that things are moving so slow. We definitely don't seem to be on the same page about how fast thing should move forward and I fear I might've pushed her too much... 

Today she mentioned maybe I should start dating other people as well and that I might find someone who's ""speed"" matches mine so I don't keep feeling frustrated. That kind of hurt my feelings, because I'm pretty invested in her at this point.

I (26M) am starting to plan a 4th date with this girl (25F) and so far we haven’t defined the relationship at all but both seem to really enjoy each other and we talk a lot but this only started about a month ago.

"Hey Redditers, I’m setting up a second date with a guy tomorrow and I need HELP.  Feel free to laugh at my panic, I’m sure I will get to a point where I can in the future.  I am f 18, he is m 20. 

 For the first date, he came to a college town that I live near and we went bowling and then went to playing arcade games. We pretty much split the cost 50/50, but I was down to pay completely as he had a bit of a drive. We didn’t get too much time to talk on the date, but I thought the competitive nature really helped (at least for me) break the ice and feel more comfortable with him. When we were leaving we both said we had a good time, and went our separate ways. I could tell he was nervous, and much like me, more of an introvert that wasn’t into rushing into things. That night, I texted to confirm he made it home okay, and then let the conversation dwindle for the night. We had a series of Good morning/ How was your day/ Goodnight texts, without much weight to our text convos for a bit. I started sending him virtual games and we would start talking more through those, so I considered it a win. Eventually I asked a weird question, and he turned it into an opportunity to ask me out on Date #2. I said I’d love to. We are still working on a plan that we are both excited and comfortable with that is close to him and still in a public location that’s open despite the holiday weekend  (I told him I would come to him this time).

Anyways, here’s where the questions actually start. Aside from a high school relationship that didn’t get overly intimate and a few first dates that didn’t pan out, I don’t have much experience with dating. There were a few moments on Date #1 where I probably could have made more of a move,  but all in all there were no substantial moves made on either side.  Given we’re both still going to be a little anxious, how can I make a move while also not overstepping if he isn’t ready for it? If it gets to that point, do I initiate a kiss? How would you initiate a kiss?

What are your go to convo starters? I have some weird questions and more personal questions, but don’t want to pry and often let my curiosity to learn as much about someone get in the way. Also, How do you keep yourself aware of how much/what you are talking about? While I am getting better at it, I still struggle with frequently changing topics when I am talk and I often become tangential. 

Over the conversations and interactions that we have had, I am hopeful that this will go well. I think we have similar values and personalities, and we especially understand and admire each other’s love for our work/the pride we take in our work.  Overall, from the extent of which I have met and have gotten to know him, I like him and don’t want to mess this up. I know it’s not the end of the world if I do, but it would still suck.

"So, I’ve been seeing this guy for a couple months now. A month ago he lost his job and I can tell that it’s been a huge cause of stress for him (understandably so); however, that hasn’t stopped me from wanting to see him and I’ve made that known to him. I’ve had to cover some of the bigger expenses on our dates, which I don’t mind at all. When it comes to the smaller expenses, he’ll take care of them, which I greatly appreciate him still trying to show effort. Anyway, at the end of our date last night he sincerely apologized (in which he hadn’t before) for his situation. I was completely understanding to all that he said and reassured him that I enjoy his company and that dates don’t have to be expensive. I don’t know if he was trying to lay me down gently or if he was trying to say that he needs some space by apologizing. If that’s what he was trying to do, I wish he would’ve been more clear about that. I don’t know if he was wanting me to read between the lines, but if that’s what he was trying to do, I wish he would’ve been more straightforward about it. Or, perhaps, he was just simply apologizing. Should I have suggested giving him space to figure things out? Or, is that something he should bring up? At the end of our date, he walked me to my car and kissed me. When I got home, he texted (something unrelated to our conversation) me. I guess if he really wanted to end things or take a break through that apology, he wouldn’t have initiated any physical contact/continued communication after our date.

"Not everyone is a snake but it’s impossible to know who is and who is not until they bear their fangs and strike.  At the very least people can change in unpleasant ways.

I’ve had the seemingly nicest and  most wholesome people turn out to be two faced pieces of shit, and my experiences pale in comparison to some of my friends and relatives. 

Just on my street, more people are divorced than not, and almost all of them have a huge amount of bad blood either when the other cheated or stole from them or mistreated their kids or something grave along those lines, of course that’s just one side of the story.

But the bottom line is you never truly know anyone and you can never truly trust anyone, not even yourself I would argue.

"I (F28) fit into the beauty standards in my part of the world and get a lot of male attention. But all men ever want from me is to have s*x once and then never speak to me again.
Most of them are really good at hiding their intentions, I had men tell me they’re looking for a wife and that I’d make the perfect wife and I check all the boxes, only for them to ghost me a few days later. I also feel like them ghosting and subsequently replacing me with someone else is happening after shorter and shorter periods of time. Whereas I used to be able to keep a talking stage up for a few months, now it’s usually a  few days until they lose interest.
And in the beginning they’re always so enthusiastic about me. Yeah you could say maybe my personally is just so sh*t that it repulses everyone but I am not acting any different than when they first met me. They just always lose interest and move on to someone else, and sometimes they come back after a while only to ghost again as soon as someone new grabs their attention.

I don’t want to experience the pain of being abandoned by someone who made you feel so special again.

"Hi all,

Do you like looooong stories with a 2023 dating ""problems"" ? Haha well this one is for you :-D  :

I dated a guy earlier in the year who had just come out of a 7-year relationship. I should have seen it coming: after he'd been all fire about me, he suddenly left. He told me that he liked me but that things had gone too fast for him, that everything in his life was falling apart, he was only taking wrong decisions and that he wasn't emotionally stable enough to get into a relationship yet. I appreciated his honesty, even though it took him 2 months to tell me. 

After having this conversation, his behaviour on social networks (Instagram, but also Linkedin LOL - even though we don't have ANY work connections) changed: he started liking everything, and sometimes even at the second I posted it. It didn't matter what I posted: a story or picture of me or mountains lol: Likes, likes, likes. Then I went on holiday with a guy friend (who's really just a mate - and he knew it) ... and BAM I see on instagram (even if he actually almost never post):  he's seeing another girl, he starts posting only stuff about her to the point where me and my friends thought ""who does he want to prove he's happy?"". Anyway, I'm happy for him of course, our story was a long time ago after all ... His behaviour hasn't changed, still liked all my stuff, since he's been seeing her. He asked me to text him when I got back from my trip to let him know how it was, as he'd also like to visit this country. No problem, I wrote to him (2 months after the last time we were in contact), he replied very nicely and the first question he asked was ""how was it with your friend? - like he could have asked me about the food or something! Anyway, after answering, he stopped talking.

I ""confronted"" him 3 weeks ago and asked him why he gave me so much importance on social networks because it gave me the impression that he was still interested in me. My text was really nice. No reply from him. And then... SHAME. I ask myself how I could have been soooo stupid to think that he was interested in me because he liked all my stuff. He probably just wanted to be nice.   
Since then I've completely distanced myself from Instagram and haven't posted anything. This was definitely a lesson learned.

Then... 2 days ago... I received a notification on LinkedIn that he had viewed my profile. He knows very well that I'm going to see the notification....   
\-&gt; I'm aware that he's clearly not interested enough in me to contact me and surely he likes me. I'm also aware that I'm making a problem of it myself and that I could just block him. But I really liked this guy and I'm not the type of person to cut people out of my life... maybe I'm too nice (or stupid lol) , but I prefer to fix things. That's my personality.

**What I'd like to know is whether anyone else has ever been in a similar situation? Or did you act like this with someone? How did you react and how did it end?**

I'm stunned, caught completely off guard, not knowing how to answer, so I just do the first thing that comes to my mind: read aloud the Bible passage I was on to her. As if to say ""I have some words of the Lord to offer you in these trying times.""

Her stern face turned to a light smile and she kind of chuckled. We kind of hit it off from there, played a few games together over the course of our stay at the ward. 

However, when it came time for me to leave and I asked for her number, she said ""ehhhh, I don't know...."" and I immediately said ""yeah alright ok"" and went back to my reading. I could tell her she was letting me off and didn't even want to hear her say no, that would have hurt too much.

"Hey,
I (M28) met this girl (F28) on hinge a week ago and yesterday we had our first date. She lives about 2 hours away and we went to her closest city to visit a museum and a Cafe. The lasted for about 6 hours, mostly on the cafe where we talked about so many things and had a lot of fun. 

We find each other very attractive and we are on the same page with all important topics. I have to admit that she kinda flashed me and I cannot stop thinking about her. 

We agreed on a second date on next Wednesday after Christmas when we were still in the cafe, but made no plans yet. Now that things went so good and we like each other, I want to make good plans for the next. I have no doubt that we will have a good time, but I would like to get the chance for more intimacy and I don't mean sex. There is no chance to have the second date end at home, since she lives with her parents due to studies and I live 2 hours away.. 

I am scared to fck it up. I think it would be good to get closer and I would like to kiss her. But I won't have the chance to do so if there are no opportunities on the date. I don't want to end up in the friend zone

I thought of a fun activity like Minigolf or escape room and then something where we can get closer. But I am not sure what to do. The weather will be very bad so it has to be indoors as well.

"I’m currently going to therapy once a week, for about a month. So it’s something recent and new. It’s been hard to talk about everything because THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG IN ME! I have depression and anxiety since I was a child (divorced parent, lots of family fights). I’m taking meds for about a year and a half, but my psychiatrist didn’t do much more than just tell me to take meds. That’s why I’m doing therapy now.

I WANT TO CHANGE! Everything I’m doing is because I know I’m broken and need to get help :(

I started to workout, to eat correctly (I didn’t eat regularly) and healthier, to go to therapy, etc. BUT there’s this things I just can’t understand about me: I find someone cool for friends or date, and get really excited about it. I feel good, I genuinely like them. After sometime I just go indifferent, apathetic, numb. I’m not rude to people, I just don’t feel anything about them. I get distant for NO REASON and because of that is very hard for me to maintain relationships. I actually do this with absolutely everything in my life. Activities, hobbies, education, videogames, jobs, I tend to left everything in the middle and never finish anything I started.

My therapist told me is not so important to understand the WHY (at least for now) but to understand if it’s a problem and change it. So here I am, asking for any advice you have on that matter because I can only pay for therapy once a week and I thought a lot about it and couldn’t find out how to make it right :(

TL;DR: I like people but after a short time and feel apathetic

If you need an example: I started to talk to guy in the first week of the month. We talk by text, by video, and even played together online. We planed a date for this week. He came and it was really fun, we did lots of cool things. Time passed and slowly during the day, the numbness came in. Now I can’t even bear the thought of him.

"Let me get this started but I do warn
This does contain some really stupid shit (I was 13 at the time) so yk how teens are with decision making its really bad so there's gonna be some corny parts and really had decision making

Let's begin


As a child I lost my mother at the age of 7 and my father at the age of 10.

My mother died due to a massive seizure. And my father due to a gunshot wound caused by a argument with my grandpa and him.

It left a mark since they fought over who would take me where (my dad wanted us to go to Delaware and my grandpa wanted me to stay) but the gun accidently went off and boom. Dead instantly 

It wasn't more of the dead body that left the mark it was the fact that is was over me. 
For years I blamed myself and shouldered all of the burden on myself and as a 11 year old kid I was really mentally unstable sometimes 

But I used games to control my feelings and I made accouple of friends named A1-ask1,raze Tazmaina and pennywisenickjay. 

Eventually we played a squads game on forntite since it was popular at the time and met a girl named mingleck (can't give out irl name) 

We all played and we all instantly click as friends but me and mingleck connected  more than others.
She would support me through my problems including a bit of trauma from my father's death,Suicidal thoughts, bullying and a bunch of other shit.

But she was always there for me. Then the drama started.. 

Let me sum it up for you all 

A1-ask1 dated her for 3 months.. then raze.. and yeah it was real hectic but fun. 

Eventually we all kinda split up into our own lives and me and mingleck stayed together. We had similar personality interests and morals so we clicked as more of bestfriends after everything.
At least I considered her my best friend.

But 8 months in I caught feelings for her. I mean she was gorgeous,funny,kind and really smart and clever.

So by month 12 I asked her out and she accepted  and we started to date.  Though her parents didn't like me due to me cussing alot but I understood that.

So we did the honeymoon phase for 4 months and then eventually we parted ways since we both had alot to work on but agreed to reunite every holiday to spend time together. 

Now let's start my downfall as a person..

A month into our relationship a guy named kaiden barker (haahoo419 was his gamertag) the kid was a real asshole.. 

But ofc I was niave and trusted him and he manipulated me into making a ""deal"" with him.

The deal was 

If he won he would get mingleck 

If I won nothing would change.

Not a win at all ik.. but I went for it.

But mingleck told me she put her full trust and agreed to the terms but as soon as we began he spoke to me

And said I remember it clearly ""I'm gonna fuck your girlfriend"" and I kinda just snapped and lost focus and lost the deal. I mean I was pissed after I lost not to the fact that I lost but to the fact that he even said that just imagining it made my blood boil.

But ofc I'm not that dumb lol.. I alr set up a plan to get her back and I did. Simple and done 

Though I kept him as a friend since I really had no one other than my girlfriend at the time

But the relationship other than that fuck up was good. It really messed me up mentally since I thought that if I couldn't even keep someone like kaiden barker away than what would happen later. And u convinced myself I wasn't worthy of her love.

She always convinced me otherwise but I kept on insisting and it stuck in my head. 

She comforted me and told me I was always enough and that she would never leave me but. I just told myself otherwise. 

I mean she is way outta my league at the time gorgeous,funny,kind and really smart

I kinda had nothing going for me expect I was good at art and painting and also a bit of cleverness when it came to planning but thats all.


Buy anyway then the thoughts just overwhelmed me and I wouldn't self diagnose but I felt depressed ig? Idk how to explain it.

But yeah she always told me she was there for me and she was.

2 years later on July 6th 2022 

I really wanted to spend more time with her but I was so scared that. I don't know why I was scared but I couldn't express myself and tell her.

So I just sent 2 photos to my friend asked him to send it to her and say happy b day tomorrow to freak her out and yk grab her attention.

Ofc it did but yeah she was really pissed. And I don't blame her.. I broke her trust in me and that's on me.

But yeah we talked and eventually she broke up with me and yeah 

I tried multiple times to apologize to no avail even now I'm still trying my best a year and a half later.

Apologies won't work I'm sure. I know what iv done is disgusting and I hate myself for it but.

Iv realized my faults in the relationship as I look back at it.. I could've been such a better person but i was immature and a bit egotistical and I let my emotions get the better of me.

I'd give anything just to be able to apologize but I'm kinda no contact and I have no idea what to do.

I really want to at least explain myself. Thats all I'm not even asking for forgiveness I just want to try to talk with her.

About a month ago a matched with girl in a dating app. We started taking and immediately we found that we have a lot in common, the communication was excellent. It’s rare that I talk with a girl and immediately we click. 
The next day she asked to exchange social media to talk off the dating app. 
A few days later as the conversation is rolling smoothly, I start thinking about asking her out. It was mid week and I knew she would be out of town visiting some friends in the weekend in another city, she would be back in Monday. 
So I asked her if she would like to go out with me when she returns in a few days. She agreed! We said that we will arrange the details in the coming days. Come Monday, she returns back. But she is a bit silent, takes a while to respond. I asked her what is bothering her. She answered that 10 days ago when we started talking she had more free time. Now she is pressured from work and she Masters she is doing. As such she doesn’t have any excitement for meeting a new relationship. Well… that went well…
I told her is she needs a few days I can wait but she said that it’s not fair for me. After that communication has become thinnner and thinner. We haven’t talked for the last 2 weeks.

"I (26F) have recently started dating this guy (30M). It really hasn’t been long (only about a month). I understand it’s very early days. 

Just to give some background. I went through an amicable but traumatic breakup with someone I was in a relationship with for 3 years. It took me 2 years to be ready to date someone again. He was my first love and I did think we were going to get married. 

Fast forward since July of this year, I’ve been dating people from online dating apps. I don’t go out enough to meet anyone new and I’m not attracted to anyone I work with. Since July I’ve had 2 guys I was dating ghost me. As someone with an anxious attachment style this has made me hyperaware/hypervigilant to any changes in communication. Both of those guys claimed they liked me but would start taking longer and longer to reply till they just stopped. 

This current guy I’ve been dating also seemed genuine to begin with. I’m the first person he’s dated in 3 years since his last relationship. He also hasn’t had any casual relationships in 2 years. When we first started dating he was very keen and would make time to see me. We’d see eachother a couple times a week as we live not too far away from eachother. He was very responsive over text which I also liked. I last saw him 2 weeks ago. Last week he was busy with work during the week but we were meant to meet up on Sunday. He wasn’t feeling well on Sunday so cancelled and rescheduled for Monday. On Monday I hadn’t heard from him all day so I messaged him to confirm our plans. Again he cancelled as he wasn’t feeling well. He hadn’t made any attempts to reschedule so I messaged him on Wednesday. He said we could meet up either Thursday or Friday. Again I hadn’t heard from him all day Thursday and for a 3rd time he cancelled because he isn’t feeling well. 

Now I completely understand he’s entitled to not wanting to meet up if he’s feeling rubbish. But I can’t help but feel he’s slowly ghosting me. He’s communication is becoming patchy and I feel like I’m putting more effort into our conversations and future plans. I have explicitly asked if he’s still into dating me and he’s said yes. However I feel like he’s actions state otherwise. On top of this, he hasn’t actually said sorry for cancelling on me last minute 3 times now. 

Am I just being overly sensitive and should I just give this poor man some time to get over his illness. Or is this just someone who just isn’t in to me? 

PS: I watched the movie “He’s just not that into you” last night. I feel like if he really likes me, I wouldn’t be feeling so confused about his feelings towards me.

"I’ve been friends with this person for two years, and three months ago (September) we started texting more often (as in every day). But every time I would try to further establish contact by suggesting we talk on the phone instead of text, he would make up some excuse not to. I figured he just didn’t like me. In November I visited him and his family because I still liked him, and wanted to swing by to stay hello while I was in town. They let me stay with them for two days and were very kind, and his mom made it rather obvious that she knew I liked him. He seemed interested, but as I was leaving, his sister in law mentioned that he said “it is obvious she is into me” and then she urged me to ask him out because he would never make the first move due to some trauma with an ex girlfriend.

I told her it concerned me a bit that I had had to initiate all contact, drove to see him, and that his entire family was under the impression I liked him…..and yet He did not feel comfortable meeting me half way (in the sense of coming forward with his interest, or allowing more contact).  I told her I had originally planned to say something but needed a bit of time to think this through. There were a number of things that made me think twice. 

For instance, while over there, he told me he had been talking to a 22 year old girl on the phone for 2-4 hrs a night. FaceTiming. He is 36. The age gap concerned me, but I said nothing. What also bothered me was that he had recently been talking to her (in September, around the time I contacted him), and he allowed far more contact with her then he ever did with me. Additionally he had been getting ready to ask her out two months ago, but she got a boyfriend. Why tell me this if he is interested? It made me doubt his intentions.

I allowed a week to pass after the visit to gauge him more closely and figure out if he was taking me seriously. I was prepared to ask him out, but just wanted to make sure he was not playing with me. Then he abruptly started giving less replies to my texts. Granted he took a trip to the other side of the world, and time lags are an issue, but I noticed the change. I confronted him, told him how I felt, and he told me he had lost interest because I wasn’t showing enough interest. Granted I had been a bit tense around him at his house, but that is because I was nervous. Yet he says that made him doubt my feelings.

I told him his story about the 22 year old girl had thrown me off. He told me he had paid her attention because she was initiating, and I was not showing enough initiative. He told me the moment had passed and I should have confessed sooner. I told him no one was stopping him from coming forward with his own feelings, and it was unfair to expect someone else to do all the work when he was not putting in any effort himself, and that it was wrong of him to tell me about other girls as it had led me to believe he was not seriously considering me. He apologized. I told him I was still prepared to try seeing as we had gotten along so well before, but I understood if this was the end of it.  He suggested we meet in person when he comes back to the states in 2 months for a date.

He seems to want to text everyday because when a day goes by that I don’t write him he sends me a “how was your day” text. But I noticed I am usually the one initiating contact, and writing longer paragraphs. He does not try to continue the conversation. He still does not want phone calls. Why is he doing this?

"I matched with this guy on hinge. The first day, we had a really great conversation over text. The next day, and every day onward, he would reply so sparingly. Maybe just a few texts each day. Mostly small talk, what are you doing today, random quips about our jobs, hobbies/interest, etc. The first day we texted, he mentioned something about “when we meet in person” but hasn’t really been flirty at all and has made no moves towards trying to set something up. 

I will say, usually when he texts me, he will say he’s on his way to work/a friends house/other plans and then text me several hours later saying he left said plans, so I think he might just be someone who doesn’t text or check his phone while doing other things. Also, Christmas is objectively one of the busiest times of the year.

My situation and a coworker

So I had a crush on a HR(Female) who interviewed me. We are working at the same place but different departments. We texted and got to know each other a little bit. I then asked her out,  she didn’t directly rejected me but instead change topics. 

After some days, I saw her and gave her some snacks. And she texted me to thanks me about the snacks. And I stopped texting with her, she then sent me her pet cat at night. And we continued to chat. After a few days, a guy who drove to the company and picked her up. So I thought cool, maybe she had a boyfriend. So I moved on and stopped talking with her. 

Then she in the next few days texted me to give me some snacks again. And she hinted me: “ everyone is just coworkers, if you really like someone, stay in a professional  relationship possible.“

"I (27F) have never really dated, so this is all new to me. For reference, I am a bartender/waitress at a local place in my hometown, homeowner, and dog-mom to three dogs. Starting November 1st there was a new employee (24M) that started at work and we have great workplace chemistry. It wasn't until about 3 weeks in that people really started noticing that we compliment the other well. After getting some insight from another co-worker I gave my number to said new employee because I did and do have a crush on him; this action goes against one of my personal morals/rules for myself to never date in the workplace with any potential partner.

He (let's reference him as JD for this post) ended up texting me and later that week we went to a bar, in which he met me after work despite having to work a 2nd job at 7 A.M. We ended having a bit to drink and set up some ground rules/expectations, as well as getting kicked out because we stayed past closing time. A few days later JD came over to my house, which I had asked days prior and did not remind him, and we just talked at my kitchen table for hours. He told me some deep things about him and why he came to the area. My 3 dogs actually liked JD within about 2 minutes of him entering my house and all wanted to play with him.

At work people have noticed that I am happier and more livelier than usual. We keep work top priority while we are busy. However, we did have a moment at work where JD ended up grabbing me from behind and making sure I didn't hurt myself climbing a shelf - he denies this happened with a coy smile whenever I have asked about it. We ended up going back the bar a week later, where I waited for him to get done with work this time, and we had a few moments. When I sit I cross my legs and JD started gently caressing my exposed shin; later he ended up playing and running his fingers through my hair, as well as smelling my hair and stating ""you hair smells nice."" Within 2 weeks of talking he remembers my coffee order and I his, as well as we respectively know the others stress food, go-to food order, and alcoholic drink choices.

Fast forward, we had a talk that I provoked by simply stating ""you make me happy, and people are noticing it at work."" JD immediately hid in his hoodie and reassured me that this conversation needed to happen eventually. He would creep out of his hoodie like a turtle, but I could tell he was uncomfortable with the topic. A lot of his part of the conversation didn't make sense because it was contradictory, IMHO, at times. JD informed me that he is used to being a loner and has lived in self isolation for a long time, while believing his past relationships were deeper than they actually were. JD said that it is hard for him to get into a ""rhythm when there are certain things that are not present,"" as well as thinking that me treating him like a king is crude (someone at work told him I would treat him well) but he can see it in my ""actions, heart, and being."" I explained that I am in a place in my life that I know what I want at the moment and that I believed that JD was worth waiting for because he ended his part of the conversation with how he needs to work on himself and that it wouldn't be fair to give a half-a\*\*ed attempt due to him working 2 jobs. We both agreed we didn't want anyone to get hurt, while hoping to remain friends at the least.

It has been a week since the conversation and he has been following me like a lost puppy. If he needs help at work he will normally come find me and ask, while we have deep and full eye contact conversations when he is done at work and gets a drink. My co-worker that I have worked with for over 5 years has noticed that JD only has deeper conversations with me with eye contact and that when we talk it is a low in volume, despite JD sometimes not controlling his volume well because he gets nervous and fidgety around me. Our manager has noticed him hanging around my work area more than normal as well. A different co-worker figured out we were interested in each other by how I become more air-headed and happier with JD at work and that JD doesn't stress out and is always close by. JD and I have hung out once since the conversation and he was happy and smiling the whole time. Every time we time have hung out JD has told me snippets of his past and he did not have good upbringing and all of his previous girlfriends either used or cheated on him. I think some of the things he tells me is to test the waters and try to see if it will push me away, but I know everyone has a story and in the end it comes down to how we make ourselves from our experiences.

If I am talking to someone they will have my sole attention due to my belief in loyalty; on the flip side, some of our mutual friends have stated JD is very similar in his morals and beliefs to me, as well as him having trust issues so it will take JD longer to work up the courage to make a more noticeable move. We have not done anything besides talking and just enjoying the others presence (nothing dirty). I don't know what to make of this situation because a lot of people that I am close to are pretty much stating we are ""unofficially official"" because of how we act with each other at work.

I am honestly just trying to be a good friend and influence - his rock at work so to speak - for the time being. I don't know what to do next or if I should do anything at all. However, trying to keep my head clear is hard when everyone that knows are people I work with, so I think an outside lens would be good.

Side note: we do not text a lot because we both informed the other early on we weren't big texters and some people believe it's not a good, but we can talk for hours in person

She was freaking out and sent me a message apologizing asking to make it up to me and reschedule, saying how she appreciated how understanding I've been. She has adhd and things have been tough for her lately.

I fucked up in my response - said ""Damm that really sucks. Ey at least ur car isn't robbed? They just uh kidnapped it to an unknown location and didn't leave a ransom note lmao. Sorry maybe not the time to make jokes while ur stressing. For the date, it's OK it's out of your control and bad luck with the timing of other stuff. I have compassion for what ur going through but it's a good time to mention that there is a limit I can handle bailing in general. From my end it does suck not really knowing if we're gunna meet up when we have plans, bummer to get excited for plans that don't happen, and it messes with my scheduling. That being said I am down to reschedule,  I do still really want to see you. Can you do friday? If not thursday works with me. ""  I wish I never said that shit about rescheduling. All my other messages were very compassionate and understanding. I know with adhd rejection sensitivity it must have been horrible. I messaged her on Thursday asking about her car and if she was still down to meet. No reply.

I apologized on Monday, earnestly. Saying ""Hey, I'm deeply sorry for the message I sent on tuesday. It was incredibly insensitive to say that shit about bailing, and I'm sorry for any pressure it put on you and mental strain.  Especially while you were having a hard time, and had such a shitty day with ur car being towed. You have been nothing but kind and I appreciate that you were making an effort to meet with ur schedule. You deserve support and compassion, and my message lacked that. 

I had a great time with you and I hope we can meet up again. Let me know (no pressure!)  ""

She ghosted me. We were talking for 2.5-3 months and had great vibes before that. I understand that I should have been supportive and soft in her time of panic and was harsh. 

To be clear she was absolutely telling the truth about everything and was very into me.

"my boyfriend is leaving the country tomorrow to continue his studies (we live in a 3rd world country and he has always dreamed about going abroad and leaving this country) 
and i’m laying here in my bed soaked in tears. i have finals in 4 days and i can’t seem to get anything done or do anything else. he wants me to join him after (continue my studies there too) and said he’ll take of everything 
but me being a realist, i don’t think that’s really possible, im 19 and my parents are completely against the idea of me living away from them (when i was searching for unis they wouldn’t even let me get away from the city) and i’m not financially stable enough (or at all actually im really broke and my uni is full time with attendance so there’s no way for me to have any income of my own that will be enough to pay what it takes to move to another country even if he says he’ll take care of everything even financially i know he can’t, he’s also just a student struggling himself..
He told me 3 months ago he’s going to leave and that he got accepted in a uni in europe but then his visa got refused and i was kinda relieved? i started to accept the idea a long time ago but i had more time with him then, first day i cried so bad and i was really mad he didn’t tell me earlier, but the reason he didn’t was that he wasn’t sure if he would get accepted at all and he didn’t wanna tell anyone before he was sure, 
now fast forward 3 months i get a text that he has to tell me something really really important and we have to meet, (we couldn’t hang out for a week due to me having finals, but i had days planned ahead of us because i while have a whole month break and we could do anything then) 
so then he tells me he’s leaving tomorrow night because his exams start really soon and his visa got accepted yesterday, so he has to leave asap. and it just hit me like a truck, i’ve always known in the back of my head there was a possibility he’s leaving but now i’m really shocked i can’t get it through my head. 
the thought of him not being here with me where i could touch and hug him and see him, im going insane. We had a last meeting and it was just me laughing and crying at the same time because i was feeling too much it was so heavy, the thought that our kisses were counted at that moment was making me go crazy we couldn’t stop kissing. i couldn’t leave his car. i miss him already 
i’m going insane and i’m probably gonna fail my finals and everything is going downhill 
But i’m also really proud of him, i know how much he wanted this. he has always dreamed about it, it’s the best for him and his career, he’s going to be an amazing doctor i’m sure, but i’m gonna miss him like crazy. Please how do you cope with this, i feel so depressed but i still need to study or else i’m failing

"This may count as a vent, but I need somewhere to have an existential crisis (other than talking to myself). I'm 19m, a sophomore in college studying computer science. Hobbies include reading, writing, listening to (rock) music, gaming, and exercising and I've wanted to pick up new hobbies for a while, but I've been busy with college. Yes, most of these are solitary hobbies, but I am not the kind to actively go out and do things. I like to be alone most of the time, but sometimes I enjoy the company of others. I'm introverted and socially awkward, and these are things that I know for a fact I will never truly change about myself. I'm extremely average when it comes to looks. I work out from home 6 days a week. I'm trying to work on myself now, especially with the new year coming up. I was talking to someone I met on a dating app for a while. It was going well until it wasn't, and now I've been friend-zoned. She told me that she had been developing feelings for me even though we had never met IRL. She promised me that as soon as she was settled into a new home. I messed up with her because of differing opinions. And to be honest, that felt like my best bet.  


I probably could have had a gf by now if I had played my cards right, but I didn't, which is why I'm here of course. I have self-confidence issues, but I've been working on that. Obviously, losing weight, eating healthier, dressing nicely, smelling nice helps with self-confidence. Again, I've been trying to lose weight and eat healthier (okay maybe not healthier, but at least less bad food). Next year I'll for sure try to get out a little more (hell I'm going on a week-long trip to Yellowstone for my spring break with some people from my uni). I simply don't like being around a lot of people. I prefer being around few, if any, people at any given time. I know I gotta change my mindset and I gotta be more positive, but I'm trying to be as realistic as possible because I genuinely feel like something is missing in my life. However, given my seeming unwillingness to change myself for the better (I know I'm not perfect but I'm trying to find myself), I genuinely feel like I'm gonna spend the rest of my life single and never really knowing what love (in that sense) feels like. I don't want to sound like a soapbox here, but seriously...how do people actually find a loving partner instead of a (pardon my French) 2d cardboard cut-out of a person? There. Vent over.

"Went on a single date with a girl and things went exceedingly well. She texted first and seemed genuinely interested and thanked me for the great time. Texting her is very spotty and not what I’m used to for someone who shows interest - she’s sending me selfies and pics of her biking and stuff and I’ve been trying to line up a follow up. She says she’s free on the 30th but is very busy with work and family stuff which is fair. She went on a big party weekend with her friends which she said she was gonna invite me to but it seemed early, so that felt like a good sign. Didn’t hear from her for 2 days after the weekend ..and followed up with a text and we started texting frequently again. But I’ve just felt like the energy is off for some reason and I can’t quite nail it down even though she’s conveyed a lot of interest. Just a lot of small talk and it seems very surface level. 

My co worker showed today he matched with her and I assume is messaging with her which has turned me off a lot. He’s older and overweight so it’s a bit of an ego hit.

I couldn’t quite read her, she had one of those genial expressions on her face — I had no idea whether she was inviting me in for conversation, or just naturally had that look to her. She was super attractive, I thought. 

After the dinner, we would all go out to this club — we were a pretty large group so we split several taxis and were on our way to the destination. I told my friend (the groom) that I thought she was pretty. He turned to me and gave me this frown of approval — I’m not sure if it somehow it made it down the grapevine later that night but the moment we arrived she was closer to me, almost hugging up on me and i’d always catch her stare in my peripheral. 

Fast forward 2 months later, out of nowhere she’s just added me on Instagram and Snapchat. We have another big gathering with the same group of people next week, and she’s messaged me privately saying she wants to get to know me that night.

"It’s just so easy to overlook in early dating when things are sweet and all. In the past few relationships, at the beginning, I always thought my partner tended to be secure attachment style which usually turned out to be the opposite - showing all sorts of  avoidant attachment styles’ characteristics(eg silent treatment, lack of empathy, emotional procrastination)

I understand that no one is 100% secure or 100% avoidant, but I grew to understand that I need to be with a partner who tends to be securely attached.  

So how do you spot your dates/partners who tend to have avoidant attachment style. In early dating, it’s so easy to see the side where people are so put together, all rounded, even lovely dovey.

Then, as we’re walking into the show, he starts making fun of me, criticizing my walking pace, and being passive when I asked him where he wanted to walk. After a while, I start feeling stressed because he’s acting passive aggressive and he takes a picture of my (upset) face and sends it to his friends, laughing. I ask him why he’s taking photos of my upset face and he says “it’s just a photo.” Finally, after another ten minutes of passive aggression I ask him, “what’s going on?” He denies anything at first, then he says he feels ‘disrespected,’ that I’m being ‘inconsiderate’ and that I ‘lack self awareness.’ 

Some of what he says doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, so I ask for clarity. He is clearly agitated and I can’t think of how to de-escalate the situation. I am aware that he has mood swings, but this felt on a whole new level to me.

At this point we agree to go home. We walk back to the car, get in, and then he says, “do you want to talk things out?” My response is, “I’m sorry, I don’t feel safe doing so right now.” And he starts screaming at me. “What? You don’t feel safe? You think I’m abusive? What? You think I’m going to hit you? You think I’m going to kill you or something?!” And he keeps ranting, telling me he had a miserable time, that I’m nothing. All while he’s driving 90 miles per hour on the highway, muttering under his breath that he should ‘toss him [me] out of the car,’ that he ‘should’ve left yo’ [my] ass back in the lights.’

He pulls over at a bus stop and calls a friend to have them sit on the phone listening. Then, when that friend hangs up, he calls another. And then another (I think his dad). Finally, he drops me off in the parking lot near my car, screaming at me to “get out of the fucking car!”

All this to say, I can’t shake this from my mind today. I can’t stop myself thinking about it. And I can’t help but feel like I somehow caused this or it’s my fault (even though I can’t see any reason it would be).

"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for almost 2 months now. Halfway through this year I joined a church, and met this guy called Luca (20M) who was really kind and friendly. He invited me almost every week to different events and social gatherings within the church and with church friends.

 I never really thought much of it until now.

 He invited me to a mutual church friends Christmas party tonight, and sent me a text message 15 minutes ago saying,“I think we should meet at mine before the party and have a talk about us and where this is heading.” 

I’m a bit confused, because I always just saw Luca as a friend, and I did just recently get into a relationship with my current boyfriend.

"I met this girl in university which I have been living together with for 8 years now (we are 27). We started off really good, it was fun and we were both intrested in each other, but she was more into me as I was in her, there were some things I was letting slide hoping that it would change in future as we get older and grow up. Some things changed, some not. After sometime - 1,2years , after honeymoon phase, we often argued about each other flaws to work on ourselves, to grow and learn from but of course it damages somewhat the feeling along the way I have about her. 

She is really supportive, helpful, caring, loving, really into kids and would be great mother but I have noticed that she lacks logical thinking which I hoped that would grow along with me, as we get older. That illogical thinking with her actions triggers me and makes me feel bad about her, that she is not the one I could trust with some tasks/things to do, as I would make sure thay it has been done correctly. Also it makes me feel bad because then my anger  comes out, which I always try to control and I sometimes make dumb comments about her decisions/illogical thinking which I after feel really bad about saying as I know she is trying her best, but it just doesn’t work for her. 
Sometimes when we argue I feel that I spend energy where it shouldn’t be spent as it gets repatetive and happens again. In the end our mood is down and I feel bad about that. 

We don’t have much to talk about, we have few seasonal hobbys we enjoy together, but also we sometimes get into arguing over that as well. We both are to blame there.

Lately I have noticed that I have been feeling wrong about myself - lost my motiviation, concentration, my spark about some things and myself, getting back into shape, feeling mild depression from time to time, questioning my self what am I doing with my life, wondering about my purpose, lost connections with friends and being more antisocial (but because it is more peaceful at home not because she is to blame), as I am feeling lazy and comfortable around her. As our time ticks I don’t want to spend my rest of life being unproductive working 9-5 getting somewhat good money and being boring, not having friends and not having fun with the other one that I chose to spend my life with. I have always dreamed about having more in life than just 9-5 and being a loser that have no friends, do some things that are just for killing time. She has too, but its the reality that does not transfer into action towards such life from both of us. ( I guess we are waiting both to each othet to make some magic move to have our future closer to our goal)

She supports me whatever I do and would sacrifice and do a lot for me, BUT thats the problem that she has no ideas on anything her self, she just rides along and it makes me ride along with myself and not taking control of our/my life. Kind of feel like I have to always think about what should we talk about, what should we do next in our life without getting inspiration from parner. ( I have understood that people around me gives me motivation and spark - when someone is around with the same energy).

I know that it would be easy to just start working on myself while keeping the relationship, I have tried multiple times, but it just dies down after short time.
 I am not sure if I love her anymore as I did 2 years back, I feel like I have been doing things for her because she deserves it - as she is so good person, as I should as her partner. Also my sex drive has died down as it was before, I don’t have the mood for it often, but I do because of her than myself. 
I have met new people, which I have more intrested in (at least thats what I believe) to talk about, joke with - more with my sense of humor and intrest. Hers sense of humor is often cringey to me which is also what I value - good sense of humor.

I feel guilty that I have lived with her for so long, I also proposed to her 6months ago as I was hearing about it from family, her and I kind of felt for some time that I should propose, but wasn’t 100% sure. Did it to also help me get the spark back, change the feeling, but now I think I regret it, (but it made me really question myself and start with tearing myself apart, so maybe it was for good). I feel bad after telling her this, explained that I don’t feel happy that often anymore and I know (and she has noticed) that I am not giving her the 100% love and attention as she is giving me, but I know I should, I just don’t feel that way anymore for some reason. I feel bad about the thought - to leave for a hope to find someone better as I have been lone with no real close friends anymore and thinking that maybe I just need to settle with what I have. As she would be my only close friend.

I feel like I have outgrown her and it would be the “kick” for my change to get my life together and stop feeling so bad about my life. Maybe it is the “near 30 years of age”, that have woken me up to reflect on my life as a last warning to be happy.
I am not sure if I wouldn’t regret to breakup, just because I was maybe bored or I was being selfish.

"So I’ve (27M) received some valid criticism recently that I am too passive about dating. I’ve been on dates and I’ve had women spend the night at my place, but I’ve been selfish with my time and energy to the point where I never try to turn these FWB situations into something more. 

I’m determined to change that going forward, as I realize I’ve let a couple of potentially great relationships slip away from me.

About two months ago I started seeing someone new. She (26F, I’ll call her Erin for the sake of this post) is gorgeous, intelligent, witty, has a great sense of humor, and we share a great love of coaching kids’ sports (we were both collegiate athletes, and we both coach different sports at the high school where she’s a teacher).

I’m considering turning what we have into a committed relationship (something I’m pretty sure she wants), but there is a possible problem:

After our third date she stayed the night at my house, and she must have told her friends about me because they went out of their way to track down my Instagram profile and send me warning messages in my DMs. 

Erin’s ex-boyfriend was an absolute mess of a human, he was a verbally abusive alcoholic, and just over two years ago he committed suicide. 

She was an absolute mess for months, and according to her friends her ex is still the main thing she talks about and she has “depression episodes” where she hides herself away for days at a time. 

The thing is, I haven’t seen any of this behavior yet. I do know she has his name tattooed on her (which honestly I’m sure will be something that annoys me eventually if we become serious), but when I’m physically with her I get her undivided attention. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar? Clearly this is going to bring some level of baggage with it, but I’m trying to look forward 3-5 years here. I know if I sit down and talk with her she will likely just tell me what I want to hear (“he’s in the past”, “you’re who I want”, etc.) and I want to know if people ever truly get over someone that died while they were together?

I like this woman a lot, we have great chemistry in multiple ways and I want to shoot for the best possible outcome, but I’m trying to be as rational as I can before I let myself get way too emotionally invested. 

The last thing I want to do is be forever competing with a ghost that I never even met.

"I have always based my value on goodness.  I have high morals and big standards for myself.

Basically, I got a flirty message 15 days ago with a guy who is in another country.  We actually really bonded and connected.

It was nice.  But he was quick to ask for a naked picture.  I’ll bite.  And I did.  We exchanged them with the promise of no screenshots
And no screenshots were taken (it tells you)

We had talked for 5 hours straight and it was amazing.

The next few days slowed down very quickly.  We had a conversation and he quickly went into sex and all that, and I voiced that I wasn’t comfortable sending nudes that time.  I wanted to be established (I had made a similar mistake before) and he gave me a speech on how I could trust him, I had opened up about my terrible toxic relationships; and he said he was nothing like them.

That being said when I stated boundaries I was left on seen.  1 hour turned into 5 hours, to 20 hours.  I eventually texted him if that was it to which he conveniently responded that something traumatic had happened to him

I was upset and voiced that he needs to be better at communicating.  He never did.

He would hit me up every 2 days, I was bummed, but everyone and their mom told me I was getting played and he already got what he wanted.

He would always say he was going through a lot, which I understood, but still barely heard from him.  I took it as an excuse, even after giving him different ways to communicate with me.

Our conversations would last up to 5 minutes if I was lucky and then he would leave me on delivered for hours at a time.  I was very lenient with his schedule.

A few days even he asked me for a nude randomly (hadn’t hear from him in a day or two) and I said no.  To which he pushed and pushed and pushed.  I told him that was a red flag and I was considering not talking to him, to which he fought that it was so simple to take a nude.

I got a random text from someone I liked before, asking if I wanted to hang out.  I hadn’t heard from the European guy in 18+ hours and I decided to explore other options.

Today he came back, his time 2 AM saying he was horny.  I was up front and told him out of respect that I went on a date.

I got completely cussed out.  I was surprised, and even told him he didn’t act like he liked me.  He said he turned down other people for me.

I feel guilty.  I need opinions.

Edit:
He was upset because I was up front and said I was a relationship person, and he responded “Yes I guess I am too.”
I was loyal to the connection, but when he started to neglect the connection and became inconsistent and dry I voiced that it was hurting my feelings, giving me mixed signals, and confusing me.  And that I think we shouldn’t chat at all if he isn’t going to be open.
He told me that wasn’t necessary.  Still his communication was not good.
I still was leaving the door open for him to be better, but he was giving me 20% and I decided to go on a date when given the chance.
This was the first time we had chatted since then and I opened up the conversation with it.  I genuinely always try to be a good person, and he went as far to say that I was treating him like my exes did me.. which was horrible to say, considering I’ve gotten used and cheated on in both my old relationship.

Hi Reddit, I need assistance! I (32F) met a guy (37M) on one of the apps and we’d been chatting for a couple of weeks. Great chats that turned quite flirty. He owns a company and is about to go on vacation but we managed to meet yesterday for a couple of hours, and it was essentially a cheeky rendezvous at my place and it was clear what we both wanted.

I started off giving him head, he returned the favour, then we started to have sex. He was quite big, so it hurt a little bit, and I said slow down. Then it became evident he was having trouble staying hard. We stopped, got dressed, had a chat and then he left.

Now it’s the next day and I’m disappointed, not just because it wasn’t how we thought it would play out, but because he was gorgeous and I would consider dating him seriously. But he appears to have now ghosted! I want to follow up, but I don’t know if it’s a good idea. I thought he was a total player but maybe I’m wrong.

"Hi guys,

I met this cute girl, like we texted a bit and in the end we ended up having a date (which turned out surprisingly well). That was now 9 days ago, we still text every day and we said we‘d meet again after xmas.

I really like her already and I think she likes me too, however not quite sure how much she likes me.

Now, I really can‘t stop thinking of her &amp; I‘m quite struggling if I should tell her how much I like her or if I shouldn‘t tell her yet and wait how the 2nd date goes.. and tell her maybe at the 3rd one (of which I hope it will take place ofc)

"Hello I’m a senior in high school who’s never dated anyone before but about a month ago I started talking to this girl who I share multiple classes with. We both have very chill personalities and a very similar sense of humor so it was never that awkward. I got her instagram and we talked on there a bit and we also started sitting together during lunch everyday and soon after I got her number. After exams one day we went to the boba place next to our school but that’s the only thing we’ve done outside of school (may have been a date but idk). 

My biggest thing is it feels like I’m always the one who starts conversations and suggests things to do (like sitting together at lunch or getting boba after school.) and I don’t know if that’s a good or a bad thing cause on one hand it seems like she enjoys the time we spend together but on the other hand there would be 0 communication if I stopped trying.  I also don’t want her to feel like I’m too attached if that makes sense because I text pretty often.

"I'm lost and unsure where to go from here. back story.
I 24f had started talking to 27m mid October after going to a Halloween party together. We have previously known of each other because of mutual friends but never talked much but an occasional ""hi"" if we saw each other around town. We live in a small town in Vermont so it's really hard to not see someone. At the Halloween party we were both pretty intoxicated and talkings lots more than usual and he even asked for my number. I was kind of surprised and my friends were too and afterwards said he was totally flirting with me. I had texted him that night after the party because o was curious to see where this could go. Fast forward to now in December we have talked super often over text and he even invited me to another party his friends were throwing for a sports game. I brought some of my friends along too because he said to and I was nervous. This party was last weekend and we talked at the party and he got to know my friends even exchanging social medias. After the party we talked a little just checking in everyone got home safe and thanks for the invite.
Since then nothing. radio silence. it's been almost a full week and idk if I sound crazy because of that but we were talking so much before and now nothing. I'm really sad because I really started to like him and I'm just not sure what to do.

Would it be stupid and a mistake to reach out. Should I wait for him to message first.
speaking of messaging first because I feel like someone may ask. it was fairly divided with who would start up conversations. but I started the last two and I don't want to see crazy or clingy or desperate, but fuck I am.

Anyway, so we both work in the same institution but in different departments. We came in the same year but did not join the same orientation batch. I added her on facebook and Instagram out of sheer foolishness, and she accepted. My small department knows I have a crush on her and would sometimes tease me about it. 

One time we had an event where we invited people from other depts to join. It was a game. She won the contests and my workmates would urge her to take a pic with me for 'documentation.' There was also a time when we were talking about my crush on her in the office, and we didn't notice she was already behind me. It was so embarrassing. Anyway, I noticed that she regularly views my stories on social media, and message me one time on how to utilize the gift card she won. Other than that, we have zero interaction.

I’ve been talking to a guy for a few weeks now. We’ve gone in a few dates. Expressed wanting to see each other again. Seems like things are going well. Well recently certain things are mind boggling to me. It looks like I got blocked on FB but he is still talking to me. He changed his status to in a relationship. When I asked him about it he stated he was not sure why I could not see him and that the change of relationship status was that he made a decision of where he thinks we stand. He wouldn’t talk to me about it in that moment and instead said he wanted to discuss over dinner. I let it go and assumed we would discuss it. We didn’t. Now I’m just feeling like if he made a decision what is it? I think it’s going well but what if he isn’t? I asked him if we can discuss it. He says we will but it seems like he is pushing it off and he hid the in a relationship status. Am I wrong for pushing for more details of this decision in where we stand.

"I am a 33f and my friend 38m. We initially began our relationship as FWB, in the beginning I started to feel more towards him, than I expected. I just exited a 4+ year relationship and he was still hurting regarding his ex. We both wanted someone to snuggle and sleep with. We discussed boundaries, etc. (\*side note, he is the best sexual partner I've ever experienced.) After the first month, I shut off my feelings to protect myself. However, this is when he began to want more from our FWB agreement. We ended our FWB after two months. We both discussed it and still remain friends.

After a few months of being just friends, we wanted to snuggle. We agreed, no sex, just as friends, etc. It was really great, nothing sexual and fell asleep holding each other. Morning came around and he kissed me. We continued to kiss each other with such tenderness and sincerity. We both mentioned how much we missed each other. 

Here is the problem: I am a bisexual latina. I consider myself a democratic socialist. He is a conservative. I am not sure exactly how far right. Some of the comments he has made, while we were hanging out with my friends, is what a far-right man would say. All my friends DISLIKE him and gave me a hard time about being in a FWB with him. 

I really enjoying spending time with him. He is a thoughtful and kind soul. I enjoy spending time with him and possibly want a relationship in the future, but I feel this is an issue we need to discuss prior to entering any commitment.

Fast forward a month, he’s been texting me nearly every day and has become a good friend to me, supporting me through random daily stressors and generally being very sweet. He’s said a few times now that I should come visit him and I always say yes, I would love that - but then the conversation always turns to talking about the things we’d do during my visit (non-sexual, to be clear haha) and the topic of when is never addressed.

My two concerns - (1) he hasn’t tried to nail down a specific date for me to visit and (2) we’ve never talked on the phone despite me casually suggesting we FaceTime a couple times. I’ve been in one other relationship that began as LDR and the man was very deliberate with nailing down plans and seeing each other over FaceTime, which made it clear to me that he was interested. 

Alternatively, this guy’s behavior has started to make me wonder if I’m just a way to pass the time and daydream about meeting or if he’s actually serious about pursuing something. I know the obvious answer is to ask him, and I am planning to if the two issues above don’t resolve naturally by the holidays. But I also really prefer the man to take the lead and have been burned by situations where I take the lead and the man simply goes along with it and isn’t truly invested.

The only valid reasons I can think of him avoiding the dates and calls is (1) not wanting to seem pushy given the busy holiday season and (2) he has a very strong accent. He’s a very sweet, mild-mannered guy… but I don’t want to make excuses or dismiss what could just be a fundamental incompatibility.

However, on dating profiles and other times this seems like a perfectly normal life. People always say video games gym and outdoors hobby is enough! Idk is it?

The thing is when im single, I only have my one good friend and myself. But when im dating someone, they usually are my best friend and my everything...so I was going out with them every other week...doing fun exciting things such as museums and aquariums. Now that they are gone. Im just left with what I said above.

So I really struggle to see if I need more of a life, more than one friend, cooler hobbies, more reading to know important things and hot topics OR im simply just not exciting about what I have which comes off the wrong way. I cant appeal to a girl if most of the fun things I was doing was with my ex too.

So overall I feel as my job isnt really a proud career although im making money. My social life seems crappy bc I have one friend. But when I have a gf, it was okay. My ex didnt have any friends for that matter..so we were each others best friend.

However, my mind being like this tells me I need some new things in my life.

"I went on a couple dates with this girl back in November and we had a great time. Light hookups and we were talking everyday for the whole
Month.  She had a couple of trips to take in December and I asked her twice on a 3rd date before the trip (1 was hers, 1 was my trip), but she said she was too busy.  So I broke it off after I asked her twice.  Her response was she said she didn’t want to lead me on and was really busy, but enjoyed all of our deep convos.  Haven’t talked all December since. 

I get it, she’s not interested and my best option is to just move on.  But we had such great convos and I really liked her. 

I was thinking of sending a Merry Christmas text to see if I can restart the process and maybe get the next date.  Has anyone ever had success doing this?  Or am I wasting my time?

Basically iv always been fast to text back to people, unless I'm busy in work or doing my own thing like reading, gaming etc, I'll always have a check on my phone to see if there's any messages, but recently iv been talking to this guy and iv been making sure to leave time from when he texts to how long I reply, anytime I do seem to reply fast he makes comments on how slow he is to type or seems put off by it almost, thoughts?","Whats your opinion on someone texting back fast in this day and age, pro or con?",18o14a0,1703202883.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18o14a0/whats_your_opinion_on_someone_texting_back_fast/,
"So there’s this guy I’ve been talking to for a little bit now and we’ve gone out to lunch twice now and he’s even invited me to watch him play hockey a few times. When we first started talking I initiated it and things were good. We would text all the time and a misunderstanding came between his friends and him that circulated around me and when I went to a different hockey game that he was there reffing for, after he talked to me to clear up the misunderstanding. He’s a really sweet guy and has never really dated anyone before. He plays hockey football and baseball and has really good grades. But after our last lunch “date” (he was the one who initiated calling them dates) he wouldn’t really text me back on time and so I just asked him if something’s up and for him to be honest and he told me, “nothings wrong but I just don’t really want a girlfriend right now and you’re a nice person and all but I just don’t want a relationship and I am sorry but it’s not gonna work out, I am sorry but I need to focus myself on me and God”
I texted him back and said “It’s okay and I understand. I assumed something was up, I just wanted to hear it from you and just so we’re clear, by no means I was looking for a relationship with you especially anytime soon, you’re a good person and I liked that even as a friend” and I just told him thank you for his honestly and he apologized and we agreed to keep the friendship we have. 
The thing is I just really like the guy a lot and I want to make it work out even if it takes some time, I just need some honest advice on how to make things work with him.

"Some background. So I was seeing this girl for roughly 5 months. We chatted everyday and I honestly thought we were perfect for each other. We have same life goals same values and I thought we really connected. Because of all these factors I decided to not date other people and try to see what this would become.

When we went on our first date a while ago and she did admit she didn't feel a spark between us. I know this is stupid but we decided to continue dating and she wanted to see if the spark might come later. Fast forward to now and I asked what how she saw us. She again says she didn't feel a spark and it's for the best if we go our separate ways.

I honestly cannot do anything but respect her choice. It's not like anything like this can be forced. But I want to know how everyone handles this part of dating.

I have been on so many dates and it feels like it took so long to finally find someone I felt this way with and then it gets yanked away.

"Me a (26F) has never been in a romantic relationship out of fear of being too vulnerable. It’s had to do mostly with some childhood stuff which I’ve mostly unpacked now but I’m scared I may have been focused on career, disappointing my parents, repeating generational mistakes to focus on a man. I’m just over all feeling lonelier as I get older and im just scared that I won’t ever experience that.  I rarely leave the house so I don’t even know how’d it happen for me since the dating apps were a dud. Idk Iatley I’ve been feeling like maybe my fear of being vulnerable has built up my walls too high and I get really weird knowing a man might like me. Any advice???

"Changed the names of us for privacy and will delete this later:

So, Emma is a girl i met through a videogame we both played and basically how it is, you play with more people, you know someone etc and we talkes and played alot. Fast forward, Emma is in a relationship, but she told me that right now where she's kinda sick, her boyfriend didn't take her serious and barely checked on her, only played videogames. So we had a conversation (multiple tbh) and told each other some stories about our life. She and i both talked about traumas and fears we had. Emma told me via Telegram (basically where we write together besides the Videogame lobby/speak) that she's staying in bed feeling horrible and wrote stuff like ""want to join"" ""get over here, hug me"" sended me a picture of her and told me usally, she doesn't show people how she looks like with out makeup. She also told me hearing my cute voice calms her down. 

I feel so strange reading her messages and was reading her text again and again, i kinda feel like i want to puke my heart out kinda, it's a strange feeling.",Had a strange conversation with friend and now i don't have a clear head.,18oxabj,1703304629.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18oxabj/had_a_strange_conversation_with_friend_and_now_i/,
