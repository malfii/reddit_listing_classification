"   A few months ago, my longest held friend cheated on their gf. Things were basically perfect with their gf, but they slept with some guy almost half a year ago and had to be pushed to tell the truth to their gf.

   They broke up, I was willing to stand by my friend's side, help them get pass this and become better, but my friend was still extremely adament about staying friends with the guy they cheated on their ex gf with, said he was so understanding and didn't judge them when they told him about the cheating (they lied about the relationship being open), that he help them see the good in men (they were a very vocal lesbian before this came out), that he's such a great person and that maybe they'd have a relationship later. 

   This just didn't feel like progress to me, it felt so sick to me, I couldn't stay friends with them if they saw nothing wrong with that. They said they felt terrible about what happened, yet put up pics of them basically cuddling the guy from around the time the cheating must have happened on their social media.

   Now they're basically dating and moved in with some other guy they got close like right after the cheating came to light, and is still close friends with the guy they cheated with. 

   I honestly feel so insane for how off the situation and her actions feel to me. When I tried to tell them my feelings, they were furious and called me controlling, when they've never been like this before when I'd try to tell them something was a bad idea. It definitely feels like, there's not that much guilt if they can stay friends with the guy they cheated with, right?

   How can I be friends with someone like that, someone who's close friends with someone they cheated with. Who can lie about so much so easily. And yet I keep feeling so much guilt for cutting them off. I worry a real friend would have stayed by their side, unconditionally. 

   There's no way to mend this, and I honestly don't want to, I just keep worrying ill be on the wrong side of things somehow, I'll be the judgmental fake friend who didn't believe in their growth as a person in the future. 

   But it just feels too sick to me, if they never told anyone about the cheating, they'd have probably integrated this guy into our friend group, maybe even dated him. And we'd be none the wiser. I just want to know I'm not like, unreasonable in all this, that this also would cause others to lose trust.

"I am so sad right now I have gone to freaking Reddit for comfort .

When I was young I used to idolize my parents relationship ~ because at the time it was kinda perfect no fights they loved each other.

But things have clearly changed, I am 19yrs old my parents have been arguing and yelling more recently. The house is like screaming contest god idk what the neighbors are thinking.

There is a lot of background info I can‚Äôt say but I just am TIRED I am the one who is meditating/counseling the both of them. Trying to get them to ‚Äòcommunicate ‚Äò it kinda worked, it not solved the situation. But atleast they are not yelling now üôèüèΩü§≤üèΩ.

Idk what to do really I understand both sides it a tough conflict. My mother was crying I was comforting her ( she is staying with me in my room btw)

"Very long story short, my best friend of ten years is an IV heroin addict. She came clean to me about it in 2021 after I suspected for a long time. Since that day nothing has felt the same and I feel like my life is also falling apart.

We were the type of best friends that did EVERYTHING together. We worked together, lived together, moved across the country together. She was the sister I never had. Now I feel like I don‚Äôt even know her. 

I did so much for her trying to help once I found out, I gave her my car so she could use it to work, I got her multiple jobs and even had her work for me for a while but she kept nodding off at work and using in the bathroom (taking 40+ minute breaks). It has been traumatic to say the least. All the lies, stealing and gaslighting has turned me into someone I don‚Äôt even recognise. She even went to jail and I had to tell her family, when she didn‚Äôt show up to work I thought she was dead. I‚Äôll never forget trying to track her down that night to discover she was alive in a jail cell.

The worst part is for the better part of two years I didn‚Äôt tell a single soul about it, out of loyalty to her. Until it got to the point where she wasn‚Äôt returning my texts or calls. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about this not even her?

We haven‚Äôt spoken in months and no one‚Äôs been able to get a hold of her, even her friend she used to use with. I literally want to strangle her and scream at her and fantasise about bashing her to try get some sense into her. Which is completely out of character for me, I‚Äôm not a violent person. Not to mention the trauma from my extremely vivid recurring dreams of her dying, and the feeling of her cold body. It‚Äôs fucked.

Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this I guess just need to get this off my chest. I feel so used, degraded and hopeless. I quit my job recently because my mental health is in the gutter. Grieving someone that is still alive is horrible I would not wish this on anyone.

‚Äú___ it‚Äôs not about the money nor wanting more, it‚Äôs about taking care of me. I want to be taken care of and I have no problem paying for my own shit. The issue arises when I ask something of you and then you sound hesitant, make unpleasant comments, noises that insinuate that it‚Äôs a bother for you, and overall make me feel guilty for simply wanting you to pay for a little treat that'll make me happy. I've spent hundreds of dollars on you and although it‚Äôs technically not my money, I'm the one that decided towards what the money went to, took the time to carefully pick out gifts for you, or took the time to hand-make the gifts. I, unforgivably, will always choose to give you something because I love you. I would literally set myself on fire if it meant that it would keep you warm, I would hold you in my arms for hours if you ever needed to cry, and although I‚Äôm not a violent person, I would fucking throw hands at whoever dared to hurt you.

You have no issue buying yourself an $800+ gaming computer, video games, and other accessories for gaming hobbies: however, when I ask you if you could pay for my $25/35 nails it‚Äôs such a hassle for you. It makes me feel like you don‚Äôt value me nor my happiness; that your games matter more than me considering you‚Äôve spent so much money on them to spoil yourself. I know that you‚Äôve bought me stuff (especially in the past) but you were only doing it to get my attention and to get me to be your girlfriend (your words, not mine). Recently you‚Äôve also been unwilling to buy me stuff and although at the end you do it; for the most part, there‚Äôs a tacit understanding that I will pay you some amount back (which I do). I rather you not buy me anything than you buy me something and make me feel guilty for asking for it. In addition, I‚Äôm not saying I dislike you buying stuff for yourself, by all means be my guest; the only thing I‚Äôm saying is that all I wanted was to feel special by having my partner pay for my nails; something that would make me feel pretty and that I could show off to my friends.

"I repeat! Pant size down! Whoooooo!!!

Over the last 3 years due to bad mental health I gained 25kg. 

I‚Äôve decided to make a big change in my life and choose myself instead of others and came to the conclusion the weight definitely is not helping my self esteem or happiness so it needs to go pronto. I‚Äôve literally been hiding myself for the last year because I felt so horrible I didn‚Äôt want anybody to see my face or body.

I still have all my pants from the last 3 years, so I put them down in order from biggest to smallest so I have some clear goal to get to.

"Today was probably the weirdest day I've had in a very, very, long time. The past week overall really has just been a whirlwind. 

Today my gf of 10 months broke up with me. Tomorrow is/was supposed to be our 11 month milestone. I am largely at fault. This was my 2nd LTR (25M), and I was dating a girl long distance. We had met prior to the distance, and 90% of our serious relationship was long distance. 

She broke up with me over text today. I was just with her yesterday. Everything seemed fine-she was here on layover on the way home and normally we have several days-but this time only a few hours. We had a great time, and then out of nowhere today she texted me and broke up with me. We talked things out over the phone, and agreed to be on good terms, but I am still processing all of this...

I struggle with anxiety and depression. I take Wellbutrin and lexapro together but I feel like my chronic emotional drain/personal depression and anxiety took a big toll on my relationship. My partner was a lot more emotionally open and transparent than I was-and I struggled with communicating my emotions at times. She felt as if she was giving more effort, and got tired of the goodbyes/uncertain-ness of when we would see eachother again. 

I do blame myself for a lot of this. The phone call after the text itself went as good as one can, and I'm grateful for that-but I feel so weird with myself. My last LTR I got cheated on-and this one instead of that-it's MY fault. She is an amazing girl, and we said we will always love eachother, but I have no idea how to progress from here and be alone. Her support and talking to her ALL the time is going to be the biggest adjustment. ):

"For me this year has been filled with an overwhelming amount of changes and struggles. 

To list a few major ones;
‚Ä¢ I moved across country with my partner for his job, far away from my family, friends, and the job I loved. 
‚Ä¢ I had a very traumatic birth that nearly killed both my child and I. I have an ugly scar that‚Äôs a constant reminder of the pain, fear, and missed first experiences because of my body failing me.
‚Ä¢ After I gave birth my MIL let her true colors show. I thought we were close but as soon as I was home from the hospital she became hostile towards me. She has belittled me, criticized me for the things I couldn‚Äôt control while also nitpicking everything else. She has said some very hurtful things while all in the same breath using the excuse that the pain that one of my partners ex‚Äôs caused her is a justifiable reason to treat me this way (yes, this is something she has said). My partner has been amazingly supportive of me and has been standing up for me, I‚Äôm so very grateful for him. 

Between those major examples, and other things in-beween that I‚Äôd have to write a book to explain how in depth this year has been unkind to me, I had held out on the hope that the upcoming holidays would help me feel better. This is the first year I‚Äôm having Christmas without my family or friends. This year there is no tree or stockings, no Christmas gathering, but the one thing we‚Äôre were able to do were gifts. Well‚Ä¶ Until my partner broke the news to me last night that I won‚Äôt be getting mine. 

He had made an appointment at a spa for me, paid upfront too. It was a special appointment that was meant to pamper me. He wanted me to have a day to myself where I can just relax and feel good. He had just received a call while at work that the Spa had cancelled my appointment because one of their VIP‚Äôs wanted an appointment‚Ä¶ So out of everyone else they could‚Äôve chosen, they chose what was supposed to be my appointment and gave it away. They never offered to find me another date or time where I could still get a spa day, just said that they would return the money he spent and left it at that. I feel beyond horrible about this, and the only reason he even told me about this was because it‚Äôs so close to Christmas and he doesn‚Äôt want me to be disappointed if he isn‚Äôt able to find something else by then.

This year I feel like I‚Äôm consistently getting kicked down by the universe, and it‚Äôs ending just as poorly as it begun. I feel childish, selfish and foolish even crying over not getting a stupid present on Christmas.

"For context: I am currently awaiting brain surgery. I had a TBI in the summer and I've been getting progressively worse instead of better so I had an MRI and they found a brain tumor the size of a walnut. Because of this, I am unable to drive, work, go back to college classes, etc. and being home is hell on earth. 
I have a sister (20) with BPD that regularly starts fights or has meltdowns that triggers my sound sensitivity, parents that hate each other and often argue, and a kleptomaniac brother (11) that goes out of his way to steal my things (food, etc.) and is a pathological liar and finds ways to try to convince my parents that I'm just misremembering, crazy, and after him. I am unable to have locks or a fridge to hide my food in, so unless I want my groceries to slowly rot in my drawer I need to eat it all right then or have it stolen. My mother will defend him no matter what so he is unaware that his actions are wrong and he likely will never receive help. He has his own meals, but will often end up eating 5+ meals a day if he can steal mine/leftovers from my parents.
After months of skipping meals due to this, I broke down today. He stole cookies (10 cookies within 24 hours, mind you) I baked for my friends with almost all the money I had left as a gift as I cannot afford presents this year after 6 months of no job. I broke down. I lost it more than I think I ever have in my entire life. I screamed and cried and told them I hated them for creating this monster of a child and refusing to parent him. I cannot buy my own food without a car, cannot afford delivery thanks to no job, and the food I am given is often stolen from me so I am forced to skip a lot of meals. I'm already terrified of surgery and live every day in constant pain, lack of sleep, and the darkest thoughts I've ever had. I'm unable to leave my house and I want to get the hell out of here. 
I do feel bad for calling my little brother a monster, but I can't take it anymore. I can't even apologize to him because he takes apologies as he was right in stealing and convincing everyone I'm making it up. Every day is already hard and I'm starting to lose it from lack of food and human interaction that isn't aggressive. I live every day in pain and in bed, wishing I could sleep or get up or do SOMETHING aside from lay awake all day and night in pain.

"How do I find my self-worth again? I feel dirty and unlovable. 

Sorry for the bad english.

A little background about me: I'm a 26yo asian who was once an achiever, respected by peers and looked up to, but got depressed due to years of parental abuse and pressure. Attempted suicide at 20, became a bit of hikikomori for 4 years because my attempt became news online at the time and that didn't help much with my recovery and only made me want to kill myself more. I did odd jobs online that could earn me enough to buy what I want every month given I have no responsibilities other than myself. At age 25 (june 2022), I decided to get my college degree. In the same year, I met a guy online (let's name him John) with whom I had a strong connection with. We fell in love and decided to meet a year later (June 2023) but I found out he catfished me by lying about his age (he's 46 instead of 35) and had two kids from different ex-spouses and is still technically married to the first ex. Still, I was dumb enough to forgive all that because I was deeply in love and maybe because I have massive daddy issues that's why I can genuinely get attracted to older men. Fast forward to September and I didn't get a single job or earn anything for the month. Luckily I still live with my mother who supported me since the beginning. I already had this trip booked to a show with John months before but I realized I had no money to spend for the travel, food, and lodging. Having no friends and relatives to ask help from since I pretty much cut off everybody years back when I attempted suicide, I did the most stupid decision of doing sex work. I slept with 5 guys in total (some were repeats, one is a sugar daddy but he's only a year older than me) just to reach my target amount. My problem now is I apparently transacted with my sugar daddy's friend and he told him about me, showed my picture and all. Now this sugar daddy thought I was only sleeping with him and got suddenly all suspicious and sound a bit threatening. I practice safe sex, got all of them tested beforehand, and never did any of them raw. Sugar daddy is a kind guy but he works and lives near me so it would be possible we know some common people and this possibility just makes me anxious. What if he says something about me? Also, one of my clients apparently went to the same school and the same freakin major as I am in now. He could know my name if he wants to. I'm also anxious that he'd mention this to people he knows and living in such a small island, I'm afraid my reputation is already ruined. Out of all the clients I had, he's the only guy who possibly knows my real name.

Now back to John, we eventually fought and parted ways after that show. It just sinked in to me that I did all these things just to be with a guy who's temporary. I feel stupid and I'm disgusted with myself. Every night since November, I've been crying to sleep. I can't seem to make peace with what happened and also the added fear of the eventual consequences of what I have done. I'm in my 3rd year now, hopefully gonna graduate in a year. I hope I get over this and start a new life in a different city. I hope someone someday will be able to accept all of me and genuinely love me for who I am.

"this is so entirely inconsequential, and not nearly as intense as most of the stories on this sub are but I need to get this out of my head. so, for a little bit of context we live a sort of duplex situation. it's a singular building but we have separate entrances and we share a front yard and driveway. 

the other night my partner and I were watching a comedy movie together and we were admittedly being quite loud with our reactions. we didn't realise how late it had gotten as it is the holidays and our sleep schedules are all messed up. all of a sudden we heard yelling so I turned the movie down a little to hear it better and it was our neighbour yelling at us to keep it down. 

I totally understand why they asked us to keep it down but what I don't understand is the delivery. we've never had issues before and we had a pretty amicable relationship. like, we say hello when we see each other out in the front yard, remind each other to take the bins out to the road on rubbish day, and they even play with my son when he's outside.

I feel like im never alone.

My Husband F, (22) and I (M23) have been together for 3 years. I love f more than anything but they're sensitive. It's been a learning curve. They have autism and want thing a particularl way. But they always want to be near me. I work at a fast food joint as a manager and they stay my whole shift, either in the car or in the place. If they want something, they want it now. God forbid I have an attitude because I'm busy. And if I come off a little too sharp because I'm stressed and overworked? They shut down or get petty. 

They asked for food while I was getting rushed. I asked the back to make it fresh. They didn't and I couldnt watch them because the food takes *five minutes* to cook and I was dealing with a rush. And of course, it's my fucking fault. I'm the sole breadwinner and (I also am the one who mostly cooks and cleans) I'm always hitting OT with my 16 an hour. I get stressed and overworked. I want to sit alone. I don't want alone away from them, I just want to be alone. 

I'm tired.

We have a one bedroom apartment. I'm never alone. My usual alone time is when they're sleeping and I can't get up from the bed. The only time im actually alone is when we fight and they drive off. And if I try to be alone, they're blowing up my phone. I try to hang out with our friends last week and F has been tired and was sleeping.

I woke them up and asked if they wanted to come with. They said no. Asked if they wanted me to stay, they said yeah. Asked AGIAN. they nodded. Then they got mad I left them, was blowing me off and constantly checking my location. Then two days go by and I go to bring up that I want some alone time, they tell me that they feel like I don't want to hang out with them. I feel like I'm always losing. I'm losing time with sleeping and working and I fucking have an hour to myself besides sitting on the toilet and even then if im in there for too long they tell me to get out. I genuinely don't want this to build up until I blow up. I don't want to hurt their feelings. I just need some fucking time by myself and for them to not take it personally.

And yes, I had a conversation about it months ago and they got sad, with misty eyes and all and said, ""You need to get away from me?"" and I know that's how they will see it. They always get alone time when I'm at work when they're in the car. I'm never alone off the clock, relaxing. I'm not saying it will cure my stress to be alone but it's just something I would like.

26(M) and currently going through some sort of grieving period through a rejection from someone I‚Äôve had feelings for. 

Long post incoming

This episode has just got me thinking about my life, particularly in the area of love. Just to provide some context, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, but not for a lack of effort in trying. I‚Äôve recently noticed that I lean towards more of being a sentimental person, as I have tried going into the hookup scene and quickly realised that it was NOT for me. Like, I can‚Äôt do intimate things with people that I don‚Äôt know personally or have emotional feelings for, no matter how attractive they might be physically. However, I have my doubts about only pursuing long-term relationships, as it‚Äôs hard for me to gauge if that‚Äôs something I really want without being given the opportunity to be in one. All in all, while I‚Äôm still unsure about which path would be the one that‚Äôs best suited with my values and personality, it seems to be the latter at this stage although again, it‚Äôs hard to know without being in a relationship to realise it. 

Long story short, there had been a girl I was pursuing for sometime and was rejected by her due to the fact that there was another guy involved and she had feelings for him instead. 

Tbh, it wasn‚Äôt the worst rejection I had and I know I will get over this eventually in time. However, I‚Äôm just starting to feel frustrated because of the amount of times I‚Äôve been rejected for wanting something genuine and a basic thing that every other person around me somehow has: love and belonging. Everytime I pursue someone, it always end in heartbreak not just from the rejection but also because there‚Äôs always another guy involved. And that has slowly crushed my self-esteem and self-worth. I try to keep myself presentable (staying healthy, having hobbies, etc) and while I know I‚Äôm not perfect and have my own flaws to sort out, I know that I‚Äôm not the worst out there. However, seeing other guys who clearly have intentions get what they want for being a dickhead, and I‚Äôm not even being given the opportunity for being genuine, is slowly killing me inside. I even had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of mine once pursued someone I had feelings for previously without me knowing and they ended up together, which felt like a double backstab due to the fact that they were also BOTH aware that I had feelings for the girl. And now, with my most recent interest telling me that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwalking green flag‚Äù and had done everything right, yet still deciding to opt for someone, is slowly making me feel pessimistic about my own self and future, and I can‚Äôt help but ask ‚Äúwhat am I doing wrong?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to change myself to being a f*ckboy like most other guys I know and I probably won‚Äôt ever be because of my values and upbringing. But I‚Äôm just getting real sick and tired of always being looked at only as the nice guy that is only fitting for being a friend or the one that isn‚Äôt even being considered after giving it my all, and seeing myself being usurped by some other guy who might not even had given all of his effort. It doesn‚Äôt help knowing that I‚Äôve seen guys who clearly don‚Äôt fully care about whoever they‚Äôre pursuing get what they want as well. And I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take this before I become numb to this or lose hope, which in turn, could potentially make me miss out on someone that may actually reciprocate. 

I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm still just emotional from my most recent rejection and I‚Äôm not thinking straight, but I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here and just needed somewhere to vent. I want to keep to my values of being genuine because that‚Äôs who I am as a person but seeing the results I‚Äôve gotten from it, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even worth it at this stage. Or if it‚Äôd be best for me to just become numb and not give a care about any of these things moving forward. Yes, I am aware of the fact that the best way to overcome this is to focus on myself and not anyone else, which is what I have always been doing in between the times I get feelings for someone. And due to my approach of pursuing someone for something genuine, I don‚Äôt usually fall for someone for years, which is what makes the rejection even harder because I‚Äôve waited that long just for me to go back to square one. People have always told me that I‚Äôm still young and I‚Äôll find the ‚Äúone‚Äù but really, seeing my history and experience, I‚Äôm really starting to doubt that and while I‚Äôm also doing my best to not adopt this mindset, I‚Äôm really starting to lose hope in pursuing anyone else in this generation

i just moved into his house and we have been dating for 5 months. we were introducing our cats to eachother tonight and there was a moment when my cat was cornering his and he asked me to grab my cat so they dont fight. my cat is extremely skiddish and 14 years old. so i tried my best to gently pick him up without scaring him or forcing him ya know(he was under a small table). he slipped out of my hands and got closer to my bfs cat, they hissed at eachother and my bf just looked at me like he fucking hates me. he looked at me like im an annoying coworker and he just kept saying this is not good, theyre about to fight! i felt horrible about the situation already and my bf has to make me feel worse bc my cat slipped out of my hands. 

this is a running pattern ive started seeing. i feel ill equipped to handle this world and i have very little confidence in myself. i make mistakes frequently and i dont know why life is so hard for me. but every time i make a mistake, my bfs reaction to it makes me feel 100x worse. just the look that he gives me when i dont do something right negates all of the times he tells me loves me. i feel like i mess something up at least once a day and if hes there to see it, i feel like its the end of our relationship. 

i wish i could do things right. i wish my bf looking annoyed at me for fucking up constantly wasnt such a big deal to me. i dont think hes in love with me anymore bc he has seen how incompetent i am in general. i owe him a lot and i feel like a genuinely evil person for not being good enough for him. i dont believe he really loves me and i feel worse for that bc he does so much for me and that attitude is detrimental to a relationship. i feel bad for moving in with him bc i dont want him to feel obligated to stay with me bc i cant hold my own. i want to be better and not such a crybaby. im done therapy for years and i try so hard and i still feel like a broken, stupid little girl.

"I (m25) have been having the most difficult year of my entire life. My step dad passed away, my cat might be dead, my mother took the side of my sex offender (my older ""brother""), I left that house completely with no intentions of ever going back, I constantly feel like I'm a problem living with my partner and their family, and I also have a job where I feel I'm messing up in every single turn.

It's gonna be a bit to unpack so I'm gonna go by order of events with little bit of description starting with my cat Silco. We found him in the hood of my mom's car and it seems he stayed in there for about 12 hours.My mom was gonna take him to the shelter but I saw him, and he hissed at me once but never again. I kept him that day and I loved him. But after a few months since I wasn't around much because of work and other stuff that wouldn't let me stay home often, I had to leave him in the care of my family. They didn't treat him well, after I would come back from doing whatever I was doing, I would see his room was a mess, his water bowl was completely disgusting, old food dried up on a plate, and it seems like he was stuck in the room most of the day. I had a talk with my mom about it and told her that I've come to the decision to give him to someone else. She brushed everything I said off and said ""she'll take care of him instead"". I wasn't ready to fight her on this cause it would just lead to me getting ignore, so I let her take him. (Of course I was doing stuff for him when she wasn't around). Eventually after a few months, she got tired of taking care of him and opened the door and was gonna let him walk out. I was there and I immediately brought him back in the house and started looking on Craigslist for someone to take him. I found a lady that was willing and I bought him down to her job as she requested. As I left, she called me a while later saying to come get the cat again because he was acting up. I wasn't able to go back and get him because I was already in the middle of something important and I was running behind. Apparently he scratched and bit her boss. Which lead to animal control being involved and she told me over the phone that she was gonna opt to euthanize him. He wasn't even a year old, but she wanted to put him down and there wasn't a single thing I could do because since she was now the owner, it was her choice. (Missed a detail, they wanted to know if he had Rabbids or not and they would either find out instantly by killing him or keeping him contained for 10 days which she wasn't willing to do). So I talked to my mother about the situation and she got upset telling me to get her cat. I told her u could and she demanded I give her the lady's number. So after a few minutes, my mom calls me back and says that she said she's ""advocating for him to live"" which is the complete opposite of what she told me. I couldn't deal with knowing exactly what happened to him so I blocked the lady and just hoping she didn't kill him. I feel like it's my fault he might be gone though.

Next we have my step father. He passed away Litterally out of nowhere from a heart problem. I couldn't bring myself to go to the hospital and see him or say goodbye. For a short while I felt nothing, just completely empty because that was the second that has happened this year. When I went to his wake everything hit me that I would never see him again and everything just felt wrong. To make matters worse, my older ""brother"" moved in while we we're grieving. For 3 months while he was there, I kept having the worse uncomfortable feelings I've ever had, and I would try my best to avoid him. I didn't eat much, I had a hard time sleeping, every second I knew he was there I'd lock myself in my room. I didn't realize it because I've always felt extremely uncomfortable around him, but he has given me PTSD (from what my therapist said). After 3 months I couldn't take anymore, so i basically wrote him a note saying to stay away from me for now on and I had the most difficult time trying to give it to him to where I had to go to the hospital for a panick attack. My mom took me there and everything came out that I couldn't deal with all this shit anymore. I couldn't keep pretending anymore that were a family when he Litterally molested me as a 3 year old child. She knew about this since she caught him in the act, and she never did anything to keep us separated. He was allowed back in multiple times in my life and I was force to pretend everything was fucking peachy. She pretended as if she was on my side for a little while. She gave him to note and of course he got upset and was gonna move out. My mom called him back and wanted me to ""at least hear him out"" and we had a family meeting. He apologize multiple times, and my mom asked me if I could forgive him. I shook my head no and then he left out.

Fast forwarding to a few days later I get a text from my mom saying ""your brother is homeless now because of you."" And something on the lines of ""you need to forgive him."" I got so upset at the fact she was blaming all this one me that I was avoiding her for a few days. I ended up confronting her by text and she ended up replying with ""you know I'm not gonna answer, cause I'm pissed off rn."" And that set me off so bad, I ended up going to the hospital due to self harming. After I came back from the hospital, I saw the door to my room completely removed and the child molesting brother was there too. I couldn't stand being there any more. So I took my car and left and went to my partners house. I didn't think I'd be welcomed to stay there 24/7 so my plan originally was to stay a tiny bit of days there and the rest, I'd sleep in my car.

Luckily, my partners father caught wind of my plan and stopped me and told me he'd let me live there for now on. It felt like things was getting better on the outside, but mentally I'm still wrapping my head around every single thing. Almost every single day Ive been here, I've been having a panic attack. Every day I fear that I will get kicked out, and that me and my partner will break up. And of course, I'm working for a job that is constantly changing the rules and if we mess up on anything, we are able to get fired on the spot and having immense anxiety about that as well.

"okay, vague title I know and Im sorry. 
But this story is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. insane. So buckle up. 
When I was about 4-6 years old (I have a lot of trauma from that time so the years are all jumbled) my stepdad worked construction for this guy we‚Äôll call him Dick. He wasn‚Äôt the only one of course. Every 16-25 year old man that did drugs and didn‚Äôt mind hard work worked for Dick, later on even my big brother would work for him until he and my other siblings on my dads side were taken away by cps. He didn‚Äôt care if you were high, he always had more work to do, and he seemed genuinely kind. A lot of the kids that worked there were on drugs and would often need a place to stay. This was the situation with us. We stayed in a trailer in the yard with all the others. Only one person got to stay in the house and that was Trevor. I remember the first time I visited, Dick showed me around, gave me a snack, and let me sit on his lap while he showed me the ‚ÄúMagic Piano‚Äù. I remember being scared but the Piano was all I could think about. I remember a tree growing from under the deck by the workshop where he would tell me about the mountain lion he caught and where my brother and i would play and watch my stepdad work. I would later find out it was Cedar. 
Now something to note is that Dick is a veteran. Hes also gay. He refused to admit it but everyone knew. They thought he was harmless, just closeted and ashamed. He would say things to the young men like ‚Äúits getting a little hot today, you should take your shirt off‚Äù and they would do it or they would say no and that would be it. As the years went by the behavior became more strange. When my brother was 17 (I was 11) he told us that Dick, while in just underwear and a chair, offered him and Trevor $100 to just whip him a little bit. He said no, Trevor complied. 
When I was 13, a few years after my parents got sober, Dick died. My stepdad was heart broken, and went to his house to help Trevor get the affairs in order. While looking through his things, they found something horrible. Pictures. Loads of pictures all of little boys in compromising positions, hidden away. My step dad freaked. Everyone that felt they deserved it came and took what they wanted of the tainted inheritance. We had garage full of old Vietnam gear, his truck, and that magic piano i begged for but could never lay a finger on once i found out. My stepdad took the truck on a relapse bender, crashed and went to rehab. But thats not where our story ends.
See, my mom was scrolling through facebook and found a post on a truecrime forum about a cold case from our town in 1997. A 20 year old kid. Under was a comment from a women with dicks same last name. She claimed it was Dick that did it and she was raised by him and other serial killers. The problem is, this chick is crazy. So no one will listen. But my mom decided to read more about it. She saw that he had disappeared from the same road Dick lived on, after reportedly fighting with a man over a construction job. Sound familiar. They found his body mangled in the river. Never found the killer. My mom showed the photo of the boy to my stepdad who quickly replied ‚ÄúThats Cedar Boy‚Äù Apparently, in Dick‚Äôs house was the exact same picture of the boy. When SD asked him about it years ago he told him that Cedar Boy (all he called him) was a old friend, a very close friend. He said that the boy passed away in a car accident on the property. Afterwards, he missed him so much, he planted a tree right where he died just for him. 
Dick is dead now. But he never got what he deserved. Who knows how many young men and boys hes victimized. My parents say Trevor isnt the same as he used to be. Hes wrong now. Imagine how much it hurt to be his favorite. Imagine how many favorites he had before Trevor. How many dared to say no like Cedar Boy did. I cant call him that. His name is Steven. He died before I was ever born but I feel as if Ive seen him before. It doesnt make sense. And my brain is all scrambled thinking about it. But it all just seems so clear now.

"Hello. Idrk how to start of this post but this is something that I just need to talk about (and need advice on.)

My (21F) dad (58M) had a life-long best friend, we‚Äôll call him M, who I grew up around and considered an uncle. Unfortunately I grew up in a very dysfunctional family (both my parents were addicts at one point but my dad quit cold-turkey once he got a stable job) and he was a huge supplier of coke for them and for my mom (53F) especially. Because of this, M was allowed access to me. However, my parents made sure I was never alone with him. 

When I was 8, there had been a day scheduled where M was going to take me to a restaurant I really liked and my mom was going to come with us. The day came and my mom had been drinking the night prior (as she always did) and was so hungover that she just decided to let me go with him alone. I won‚Äôt go into details about the event, but I will just say that I‚Äôm glad I was a late bloomer.

After that my brain repressed the memory. I became fearful and paranoid of M but I had no idea why until last year. He tried to get me alone with him a few more times but eventually stopped when I turned 13 when I told my dad he made me feel uncomfortable. From then on, M was not allowed in the house while I was home.

Flash forward to now. I‚Äôm in therapy for it as well as other reasons and my therapist suggested I file a police report. This is where I need advice.

If I were to file a police report, the likely outcome would be that they say they can‚Äôt do anything and file it away just in case someone else comes forward. However, there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll recommend opening a case, and I have no idea what I‚Äôd do if that happens. Before anyone asks, yes my dad knows. I told him as well as a few other family members who were friends with M. My mom doesn‚Äôt know because she will 100% blame herself and she‚Äôs already been through enough pain this year.

TLDR; I was assaulted when I was 8 by my dad‚Äôs ex-best friend and now 13 years later I‚Äôm wondering if I should make a police report on him.",I was r-worded at 8,18neu4z,1703134664.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18neu4z/i_was_rworded_at_8/,

Bella,

I hate the way you hurt me, it‚Äôs like you never loved me to begin with. I know that you hate me and you never thought of me as a long term friend, you never asked me to hang out but you hang out with other people. You always got mad when I asked to call you, the reason why I asked to call you was because I was sad and needed my friend.

You always got mad when I would snap you too much, even though you knew I was lonely and I wanted to talk with someone. You promised me that you would never leave, because all I do is try, try, and try but it‚Äôs never good enough. All I wanted was to have one person who loved me unconditionally, all I wanted was that person who told me that I‚Äôm important.

All I did was screw up and make you angry, but I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm really trying not to be a screw up. You blamed me because you transferred out of your college because of me, because all of a sudden I was supposed to be going there your suddenly not going anymore. 

That hurt me Bella that hurt me, all I wanted was to be good enough. But I will never be good enough for someone like you, I know you think of me as a mistake and a burden.  Because you wouldn‚Äôt have left if I wasn‚Äôt a burden, I know you hate me most right now. I know you don‚Äôt wanna forgive me for what I did, but I never intended for you to transfer. BECAUSE I RUINED YOUR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE, I DID!!!! And now I have to live with that, I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT!!!

I just feel horrible bella because I ruined your life, I ruined your life Blondie I did. I know you wish that you never met me but you did, I know that you hate me. Nobody said it was easy dealing with what I‚Äôm going through, all I wanted was my ‚Äúsafe person‚Äù to be there for me. I know you were mad that I got into Arizona, I know you were wishing I never got in.

I know you wish something would happen to me, but I don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen because I have plans. And I am happy even though I‚Äôm dealing with family issues, you were the only person who would regularly tell me that I am loved, wanted, cared about, and a good person.

"And I find it so uncomfortable and horrible. I met this man on a hookup app all the way back in December and we hit it off so well. Our senses of humour, the conversation, our sexual tastes, everything was amazing and in perfect combination.

The next few meets, we really opened up to each other. I told him about the horrible situation with my sister and that I had to move out because she was emotionally abusing me and live with my dad, and he was there for me for all of it. He gave me such good advice, and was my shoulder to cry on.

It wasn't just him helping me, I helped him too. I'd be there to listen for him, and to give him advice. He told me about his own problems with his family, and how he's always so anxious and relies on alchohol to even do basic socialisation because of his extreme social anxiety. He said I was the first person in years that he didn't need to drink for, and that I was the ""ice"" to his ""fire"", that I calmed him and was a ""beautiful soul"".

I got him to start going to therapy, and to go to his psychiatrist to get a higher dose of anti anxiety medication. As the months went on, we met each other at least once every single week. We had amazing roadtrips down to the beach, singing our heads off. We were definitely romantic with each other, we would cook together, have cute little dates, he enjoyed providing for me, cooking for me and giving me massages even when I told him he didn't need to. He told me that providing for a person as amazing as me is a privledge. I would've been in a relationship with him easily if it wasn't for the fact I was moving to university in September.

I just knew I could never do long distance. And I made sure to communicate that to him early on in our friends-with-benefitship. We had an honest sit down, and I told him that we have started being really romantic and basically in a psuedo relationship at this point, and that I wanted to continue being friends after this thing ends because we have such a strong connection. We set up boundaries for when I left to uni, that we would not talk as much for about 6 months and we would stop things like him calling me pet names, so that we would move on and be real friends without any risk of romantic rekindling and jealousy. And he was down for all of it. He was really happy with what I set out, because he wanted to be my friend forever as he put it.

We agreed that we would be happy to even meet each other's partners later down the line and would support each other in everything.

However, in the last few weeks, he got so strange. We stopped having sex in the last few weeks because we agreed on a slow transition to becoming friends to make it easier on us instead of going from sex/dates to nothing at all.

He treated me so oddly. He'd talk about me in praises like he often did, but it got more extreme. He would say how I was a gift to the planet earth, that I was bound to make the world a better place. I was born to bring peace and happiness, etc, etc.

The worst time is when we were watching a film together in his living room, and I could just see him looking at me instead of watching the TV. I turned around and laughed asking him what he was staring at, and he said ""Just my special little god""

It was so horrible to hear, I don't really know why. I made a fake laugh and went back to watching the film. The entire way through it I was thinking back on our whole relationship, how he would praise me and put me on a pedestal above everyone Nd everything else. I felt so guilty. He had been obsessed with me this entire time.

The worst part is that I think part of me knew this for a while. But because I liked the positive attention, I let it slide. I let him stay in that horrible, unhealthy mindset.

So, as soon as the film finished, I had to make things right. While we ordered our takeaway, I kept the conversation light but then turned more serious. I tried to approach it as softly as I could.

I told him that I was concerned about what he said earlier, and he didn't even stutter when he said ""Well, I do view you as a god. You're like my diety, you saved me."" I tried telling him that it was unhealthy to put me on such a pedestal, that I was human like anyone else with mistakes and flaws. He just combated me by saying stuff like 

""you're not like anyone else, you're kind, intelligent, a beautiful soul. Not like anyone else. Not like anyone else.""

He then just unleashed and started embracing me saying how much he would miss me when I left, and that me leaving was like his savior abandoning him.

I was really really upset, so I just tried to calm him down by getting him to do breathing exercises and I gave him a glass of water. After both of us calming down, I told him that I was really upset and would be going home early. Before I left, I told him very gently that our 6 month plan of cutting stuff off should probably start now, and he slowly agreed and apologised for everything.

Now, we're in December. 3 months since we stopped talking to each other regularly.

But, whenever we do talk on the phone or on text, I can tell he's still obsessed with me. I've urged him to continue his therapy and join social groups to have a wholesome and friendly network instead of the one he currently has, but he still urges that the only thing (not person, might I add,) he needs is me.

I know the right answer to do. And that is to cut him off. But, if I'm really the only person that makes him happy, isn't that cruel, especially when he's somebody who I care about?

"I'm going to be a bit vague purposely here. I really broke my wife's trust. Things were strained already, but today she encountered me about something I had been hiding from her that she found out about. It was the hardest conversation I've ever had.

"My parents divorced when I was about 13. He had worked for G.E. in the mid-90s, which was the only time he had ever had a stable job and was moderately successful. At least enough to move us from government housing into a trailer park. He was laid off and never recovered.

Back in 2016 he was essentially homeless, something I didn't know because he didn't really talk about himself much and was generally difficult to get in contact with. He was living in a school bus on a friend's property and was hospitalized. A number of issues, mostly a result of hard living as he had become accustomed. I tried to get him back to normal and moved him in with me and my wife.

Unbeknownst to me at the time, but he had gotten fully lost into QAnon. Additionally, there were qualities about him that I had forgotten from living with him as a child, specifically a short temper, that became very problematic. Best example of this is his own poor relationship with his brothers and father, which led to him tearfully pleading with me to never speak to my uncle again (he was the youngest of 3 boys). Earlier that day I later learned he had argued with him on the phone and threatened to kill him out of some paranoia that my uncle would ""steal his family"". The sadder part was the idea he had not already lost his family himself over 15 years prior.

My wife and I were expecting our first child (1st of 2 girls) and we managed to get him into government housing so we could start our family. His health continued to deteriorate, and while I knew he drank I didn't realize the full extent of it, or I didn't want to know. Probably the latter.

His embrace of QAnon also had gotten worse and his beliefs had become more and more openly racist and regressive. He would always try and ""intellectualize"" them, but all he was doing was posting videos of people of color fighting white people and captioning it with things like ""one of the reasons I feel as I do"". That kind of thing.

In 2021 he was hospitalized due to congestive heart failure, and my little brother (who was more open to try and engage with him about his beliefs) was shouted out of the hospital following some very nasty things my father had said to him. 

I went to see him after and could see he was already defensive without even saying anything, and without much provocation, he had launched into a similar attack on me, saying nasty things about me and my wife. I said only ""good luck with all this"" and left, various nurses and staff looking my direction as my dad's voice carried on after me down the hall. 

I went no contact after that, for probably a year. Another hospitalization and I ended up showing up for him, and pretty much was the only person left on the planet that would do so. I'd like to think I have some super-human empathy but really I just find it so unbearably sad that, now being the father of 2 girls, that someone could have the same gift as me and so thoroughly fuck it up like he has. 

He's a man that dropped out of high school in 9th grade and has lived in relative squalor through most of his adulthood. With two sons that both went on to graduate college and create lives of their own and accomplish things he was never able to. I can't imagine how proud I would be if my daughters did those things, and I only can muster pity and sadness for someone that can't get out of his own way like him.

He's also someone that mostly just talks about themselves, or directs the conversation back to himself when he's able. Everything becomes about him. I was laid off this summer and a few times I talked to him and he didn't even remember I wasn't working, just would keep asking my how work was going.

Twice in last few months he has been admitted into the ICU for alcohol withdrawal. One day he wasn't able to eat and keep anything down, so was forced to go without alcohol because of it. Less than 12 hours without it and he was at the point of seizing. He was in the ICU for 3 days, and they wanted to move him to a regular room after that. Instead he left and I picked him up, and by his mood you would think he was just released from prison. Even said the nurses must have really liked him because they were all teary-eyed when left. I didn't have the nerve to tell him they were probably upset that they spent 3 days trying to keep this guy alive for him to just walk out with an apparent death wish.

He came by for Thanksgiving, asked for some money for gas. I gave him $10 and he left. He came back shortly after but had a Modelo tall boy. My wife nearly ran him out of the house, she couldn't believe the audacity after I had just taken a week of my PTO to help him out while he was in the ICU.

Sure enough, maybe a week later he calls to tell me he's in the ICU. Same as the month before. I'm pretty defeated at this point. I just tell him 'okay' and to call when he needs a ride home. I tell him ""you know you have to stop drinking, dad"" and I could hear him get defensive, like a rattlesnake coiling up its tail on the other end. Before he can launch into his apologetics, I cut him off and say ""I'm not arguing with you about this, you just have to stop drinking."" 

When I do pick him up, I tell it straight, ""You either need to make some changes or get your affairs in order, you probably aren't going to make it out of the hospital next time"". And it seems that in the interim between my call and picking him up, a doctor has talked some sense into him. And he is looking into getting into a program to detox. I tell him I'll help him look for AA groups, but this is something he has to want to do, I can't do it for him.

I saw him yesterday, took my girls by to see him, and invited him over for Christmas. His demeanor is very different than I ever remember, and he seems to have come to terms with the fact that he's past the point of no return. He just seemed smaller than I've ever seen him before, like instead of seeing my Dad with graying hair and wrinkles, I saw an old man the same way a stranger might pass him in an aisle at Wal-Mart or something. 

My daughters want for nothing, we fortunate to be able to give them the things they need and some things they just want, and my mother really spoils them as well. But of all the many stuffed animals and toys they get, my dad got my oldest daughter a cheap little stuffed bunny rabbit from a dollar store a few years back. For whatever reason, my daughter really cherished it in a way she didn't cherish her other things. And it destroys me and saddens me that my own dad, who has only ever had next to nothing and always complained about it, and victimized and radicalized himself over it, can't see this great wealth of love and family that's right there waiting for him. Something men in his condition with his history never get, or would die to just get a taste of. He has an open invitation to come by and spend time with them and pretty much never takes me up on that.

I don't expect anyone to read all this, but am grateful for anyone that does.

"I'm honestly just so mad right now and needed to vent. I was out of state and paid my ""friend"" $200 to pet sit my dog while i was away. 

When i returned home, I noticed my dog is covered in piss and so are his blankets in his crate. I can't even guarantee he got his medicine while i was away (should've counted them, you live and learn). My roommate then informed me that my pet sitter and friend stole my gun from its locked area in my room, threatened everybody with it, then threatened himself. Apparently this went on for hours, meanwhile im across the country visiting family. 

Now he does not know that I know this. He's still expecting me to pay him $200 for watching my pup but all i can think about is how he stole from me. The other thing i keep thinking about is how scared my damn dog had to have been. The third thing i keep thinking about is how he even knew where it was, where the key was, how many times he had to have gone through my room in the past, and everything like that. I'm teetering between just paying him the money and cutting all contact and paying him nothing and cutting all contact.

"For context, my dad re-married a few years ago to a woman with two children, one 27 and the other 29. I‚Äôm the youngest (23) in the blended family, so I still have a room at my family home, even though I did move out after graduating college. 

My dad always emphasized that my room would be my room, I always would have a place there, since the others have been fully out of school and working for 5+ years now. 

However, when I went home for thanksgiving break, my stepmother removed every single thing in my room and boxed it up in the closet. She fully redecorated the room, removed my clothes from the drawers, and all my wall art. She explained she wanted to convert it to a guest room and her daughter (27) loved it when she visited in the summer. It sort of felt as if she changed my room so her daughter could stay there whenever she pleases even though she lives in another state.  

Fast forward to this week, my dad called me and asked when I would be coming home for Christmas. I told him the 22nd to the 26th, as long as my PTO went through. I had this odd feeling in my gut and asked that I would still have my room even though it was turned into a guest room. My dad assured me and said my room is my room when I‚Äôm there (keep this line in mind for later) 

Then yesterday I receive a text from my step mom asking me when I was planning to stay until because her daughter wants to stay in my room Christmas night. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond so I sat on it and in those 2-3 hours, she triple texted me asking if her daughter can have the room, that she doesn‚Äôt want her daughter to have to drive back and forth to her aunts house (30 minute drive), her boyfriend is also coming, and that she doesn‚Äôt see her often. I felt there was no way to say no and the way she was texting felt like she wasn‚Äôt really asking so I said I would leave Christmas Day. Her text tone shifted, she thanked me, said I was welcome to stay for dinner, and suddenly mentions there‚Äôs an air mattress if I do want to stay.

It just feels kinda bad. Like she pushed me out for her daughter, didn‚Äôt mentioned the air mattress until I agreed cause she knew i would ask why her daughter couldn‚Äôt sleep on that (when she has in future years) and that I will have to drive 1 hour and 30 minutes to go back to my apartment on Christmas Day. Even the dinner comment felt insincere. It seems like she tried to find a loophole to the ‚Äúit‚Äôs your room when you‚Äôre here‚Äù by asking me to leave. And she didn‚Äôt even ask me to stay when she brought up the air mattress. She said if I was too tired she could blow it up. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm getting upset over something small, I understand that‚Äôs her biological daughter and we aren‚Äôt super close, but I wish she didn‚Äôt put her daughter first at the expense of my feelings.

"I used to be a major emetophobe (that is, fear of throwing up) i still am, to some extent if i feel super ultra nauseous i freak out, but when i say major, i mean would refuse to eat anything but toast and vitamins, to make sure i wont have enough in my stomach to even be sick.

Well, i saw once while scrolling through instagram reels some joke saying something along the lines of ‚Äúpeople with phobias meeting people with phillias‚Äù and it got me thinking: why not try? 

So for a good 3 months, everytime i felt nauseous (not super nauseous, but enough to send me at that time into panic mode), i would ‚Äútenderize my steak‚Äù. It was tiresome, kinda weird and extremely embarrassing to wait until i was alone to cure my nausea, but i found out that when you are aroused, you don‚Äôt really think about much besides being aroused.

After those 3ish months, it started to become a cure to me. If i had a stomachache, me-time. If i felt dizzy, me-time. If i was worried i ate something that gave me food poisoning, me-time.

Right now i would consider myself okayish. im no longer insanely OCD and anxious, not nearing towards an eating disorder, not even lacking in food -i eat a lot now- or calories. But still, if i feel nauseous for any reason, i get super aroused. It‚Äôs actually become a problem, as i might get a bit car sick on a family trip and suddenly i have the urge to honk the donkey. 

I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I definitely do not want to go back to my scared and freaky life of staying up at night, petrified wondering if i was about to be sick. But now i have a new freaky life. I am still grossed out by the sight or idea of being sick, like every normal being, but being nauseous is a new thing.

senior in high school here.

being surrounded by smart people my entire life has lead me to the conclusion that I'll never amount to their level of intellect. studying hard? doesn't matter, because I'll always recieve a 70. spend hours writing, wrangling my brain over a topic in english? doesn't matter, because I am suddenly inarticulate and possess the same skillset as a 3rd grader. I used to just be okay with the fact that I'll always be a below average student, but now it's genuinely killing me. tomorrow, I'll recieve my math test and accept the fact that I failed for the 20th time. then, I'll write my essay for english, and spend hours thinking of a solid thesis. It's like something is wrong with me. I look at my peers who can understand concepts with a snap of a finger, then I come back inside to my own conscious being and realize that I learned absolutely nothing. the only thing I offer to this world is emotional intelligence, and that by itself cannot be enough. something is wrong with me, and I don't know what to do. the last thing I want to be seen as is lazy and incompetent, yet, that's what I'm quickly becoming. as I'm writing this, I am on the verge of throwing up thinking about that math test I absolutely failed. this is who I am and I just need to accept that.",i hate navigating school as un-intelligent individual,18ned1s,1703133039.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ned1s/i_hate_navigating_school_as_unintelligent/,
"I am the dungeon master for one of my best friends, her husband, and their three friends. I've become good friends with all of them.

They sit there and tell me they're having fun. They show up faithfully every week. They engage with the stories I make up. For those in the D&amp;D scene, this is all wins, from a DM's perspective.

But like, a few weeks ago, one of our (Non-neurotypical) players rage quit because he rolled a 1 on the dice during a non-important social encounter. Now my best friend is telling me that it's not my fault, that the player is the one with issues outside of my game, and maybe we could try a few things to avoid him rolling badly.. or maybe ask him not to roll any dice at all outside of fights. I don't like that idea, but I'm going to go with it because it's not important enough to keep upsetting the player; who's due to return to the game this week.

Now, today, I've heard from my friend's husband who hates what I've done with his backstory. He built an intricate backstory but doesn't seem to want to engage with any of it? Basically he told me he just threw it together and didn't expect much to come of it. I, personally, was having fun exploring it and now I just feel devastated. I thought he would enjoy it and have fun but I was wrong.

If I ask myself if this is fun for me? I thought it was.. and now this is just kicking up my self critical nature into overdrive.

I feel like a bad DM. I feel like a bad friend. I feel like I should quit. Or stop this campaign and start a new one. I know, when I am not in the middle of feeling so sorry for myself, they want to keep playing this campaign and these characters but I don't know what they want from me!

"Just needed to come here in hopes of venting a little.

Back in 2020, we assumed a house. Basically, we took over the loan held by another person without any money switching hands minus paying back what money the previous owner was overdue for, which was about $8K. The situation was that the woman who owned this house had moved to Texas with no intentions of ever returning. She's a close friend's grandmother and heard about our struggles to get a home and wanted to be done with this house. It was a great kindness. Thing is, her step son lives here and was the reason she was behind on the mortgage as he had decided to stop paying her. He couldn't assume the loan because he didn't have the money or the credit to do so. So he left and we immediately took it over.

He left this place in horrible shape. But it wasn't just him who had. According to the neighbors, the previous owner before the grandmother and step son had also neglected the property. The entire 4 acres had various different trash piles left behind that had been there for years. General household trash, construction materials, tvs, broken appliances. You name it, we probably had it in our yard when we assumed the house. Additionally, he left hundreds of cans of beer behind, a ton of meat in the deep freeze that was no longer had power, fridge with mold and food, and his dogs had used the carpet freely as their bathroom throughout the house.

But it was now ours.

Over these last few years, we've reduced the junk on the property by half, replaced every window on the house with brand new windows (to which we owe about $40k for), and have replaced most of the floors and even subfloors. We've fixed the drywall. We've been deep in the project for the last 3 years. And it isn't cheap. There's 5 of us that live here.

During that time, my step dad had a massive PICA stroke that could've very well killed him. MRIs show that he lost a giant chunk of his brain. Because of this, he's now disabled which took a year to finally get. He was also going through a divorce with his previous wife who was awful in every sense of the word during this time. I was his caretaker for that year until he finally relearned to walk and could start to take care of himself.

My mom also had surgery to remove her uterus in an emergency because she was bleeding profusely every two weeks. They ended up taking all but one ovary. They wanted to take that too. It was bad. And...even with charity and insurance, she's still paying this off.

We also at once point had a roommate who contributed to the mess outside because ""well it's already a trash pit, why not"" as well as took our careful organization of that junk and put it all in one spot in the grass where the blackberries took full advantage. He also left a lot of shit there too.

I just had a tonsillectomy on 12/11. And it's taking months according to the news for paid leave to pay out...

So things have been tight.

Back in October, without notice, our insurance for the house sent someone to assess the property. Today we were told by our insurance agent that our insurance has decided to drop us October 2024 because of two things. 1. The roof has moss on it (it actually doesn't. There's a tree that keeps dropping shit on the roof.) And 2. The ""debris"" in the yard (which we inherited and have been working on.)

Without house insurance, we'll be foreclosed on.

I feel so low. I've been crying today. I've been staring at my Christmas tree. See, my family has lost their home before. My mom was a realtor and my dad got cancer. We lost our house when the market crashed during the Bush era. I've been homeless before. I've also had to couch surf a lot too. We finally pulled out of below poverty and now...this. Back then, we received the news that Mom was going to lose her job in the new year. We were told on Thanksgiving 2004. Now, 5 days til Christmas, we're told this.

Our agent is looking into other insurances that might take us. Our other option is to invite them back out after we fix the problems present. But we were warned that they could still decide to drop us anyways. Either way, it needs done before October or else. Because no one will want to insure it otherwise.

I just feel angry. Because they didn't even talk to us about it. The loan holder for the home had sent an assessor before and was fine with things because they could see we were improving the situation. Our insurance just...didn't even ask us anything. I feel like we're being punished for the actions of others. And honestly, I'm feeling very depressed over the whole thing.

It's doable. It'll just cost a lot. But we don't have a choice at this point. We can't do it slowly as we get the funds.

It‚Äôs a bunch of absolutely ridiculous asks. Menial tasks that he is totally capable of doing himself. Like constantly asking me to load him a bowl. Dude.. just do it yourself like I am. Constantly asking for a glass of water, if he wants leftovers or something to eat, he asks me to get up and make it or heat it up. He always forgets his towel right outside the bathroom door, so naturally asks me to bring it to him, despite the fact that he can literally take one step out of the shower and reach it. He never gives up either, if I try to ignore it he‚Äôll just keep asking and calling my name until he gets mad. Before he goes to work he asks me to put his speaker and phone charger in his bag‚Ä¶ why can‚Äôt he just bring those with him when he gets dressed and goes out to his backpack? He asks me to bring his shoes from the front door to the chair where he puts them on. Again.. why can‚Äôt he grab his own shoes? It takes 2 seconds. The door is like 15 steps away from the chair. Ridiculous ask. He‚Äôs even made comments like ‚Äúcan you start untying them too?‚Äù I was like wtf no? Are you 3?

"(I apologize for the long post)

Hello everyone I am lost on what to do anymore. My mom is a 48 yr old women and is with a 28 yr old man. My mom was in a toxic marriage with my dad for over 20 yrs and she met this 28 yr old man (who I will call Joe) through a friend and all of a sudden had the courage to leave my dad and left with Joe right away. She moved in with him and at first hid his age and where they lived. From the beginning of their relationship our whole family had a horrible feeling and very toxic vibes from him. He never came around and  my mom would ignore and do anything for Joe he told her to jump she would ask how high. I was 17 yrs old when this all started I am now 24 and about a few months my mom showed me she has a black eye gave me a fake explanation to what happened but deep down I knew something was wrong. She also found out he was cheating on her through text messages called my sister for help but ended up staying but kept claiming she wasn‚Äôt with him anymore but we all knew that was a lie. Then a month later she showed me her hand and said she smashed her hand  because of her trunk but the type of car she has its impossible for that to happen so I knew she was lying. On Thanksgiving my family saw bruises all over chest and asked her what is going on she kept denying he‚Äôs hitting her and she got them from work. Just this past weekend me and my mom were supposed to go Christmas shopping but she never came to pick me up or called so I called her and she confessed that she called my uncle that morning for help because he‚Äôs been beating I found she got the black eye because he hit her with his gun and threatened to kill her and has been hitting her whenever he‚Äôd get angry at her and it has been going on for months  she admitted to me that he was leaving and she was begging him to stay because she thought things would get better and Joe ended up calling the cops on my mom so she would let him go. After my uncle came to her rescue she went with my uncle to file a police report and they arrested him the same day with a felony charge (assault with deadly weapon) unfortunately he made bond and was released a few hours later. The police gave her a emergency restraining order against him but deep down I have this feeling she‚Äôs still in contact with him she‚Äôs lying about where she is and his family still in contact with my mom by the way his mom was living with them the whole time watching my mom get beat by her son (his mom dealt with the same with his dad) now my mom  keeps saying he left the country back home to Guatemala but how would she know? I lost my trust in her and proud of her for coming forward and telling the truth but I believe she only did it because the day she called my uncle for help he packed his things and left her. Even though he was calling/texting  my mom a hour later like nothing was wrong. my mom is currently staying with my sister but keeps saying she wants to go home but I know my mom she doesn‚Äôt know how to be alone she‚Äôs afraid to be alone. She‚Äôs acting like nothing is wrong whenever I talk to her things don‚Äôt add up still I don‚Äôt want her to go back to him I don‚Äôt want to lose my mom over that man.

hello reddit! it‚Äôs my first time typing on here so im sorry for any mistakes made. 

im 19f and my boyfriend is 21m. we started talking online last year and it has been more than a year since we have been talking. when our relationship started out, he was really affectionate and used to send me really sweet messages. he would reply fast and always seemed interested in talking to me. things changed this year and he seemed busier than ever. his replies are much slower, sometimes even taking more than 8hours to text me back without updating what he‚Äôs up to. i check up on him daily but i realized he doesn‚Äôt do the same very much. it almost feels like im putting in so much effort but not getting the same back. he doesn‚Äôt seem that excited to talk to me anymore and it hurts me so much. it doesn‚Äôt seem like he miss me as much as i miss him when he‚Äôs away.

my love language is words of affirmation and quality time. he knows i overthink and yet doesn‚Äôt bother to ease my anxiety and overthinking. i have told him countless times of what triggers my anxiety, for instance going offline for long hours without updating me a single message. despite me telling him, he still does it and when he is free hours later, he just tells me ‚Äúsorry i was busy at work‚Äù 

he also falls asleep without wishing me goodnight or does not bother to update about anything. im aware i probably have relationship anxiety and he knows so the least he could have done is put in effort to not make me overthink.

it makes me wonder why wouldn‚Äôt he make time for me üòî even when i got really busy, i would make sure to at least update him and tell him i couldn‚Äôt reply him for awhile. i would spend time with him in my free time but why wouldn‚Äôt he do the same for me :( it makes me feel unappreciated and undervalued, like im not his priority anymore. he makes me feel unimportant and unworthy. when he gets really busy, i tell him i understand but i still feel really sad when we don‚Äôt get to spend that much time together anymore. when he‚Äôs away and distant i overthink that he‚Äôs interested in another girl and I start to break down. he‚Äôs not the best at reassuring me but he tries but sometimes it just don‚Äôt work. it feels like he doesn‚Äôt pursue me that much anymore :(

 tbh I don‚Äôt know if he is the one for me anymore‚Ä¶please help me what can i do üò≠

"Hi, I (17F) am a high school student, and I'm about to enter my second semester of my last year. I have a group of friends of quite a few people and I'm quite close to all of them. The issue is, they're all going to post secondary school, have their future careers figured out, and I have nothing. I don't even know if I want to go to post secondary.

Everyone keeps talking about their acceptance letters and how they're excited to graduate, but I'm dreading it.

I have 3 that I genuinely care about that are going into the city but my issue is, they'll all have the opportunity to make new friends. I won't. They're all going to move on with their lives and explore with new people, and I'm going to be left behind, having no clue what to do with my life and no friends. Those people are my only and closest friends. I'm not a social person so it's not like I can just go out and find new ones. I know we're going to drift, but I'm not going to have a single person to fall back on. I'm terrified of being alone, it's a genuine fear of mine.

"(Reposted since it got taken down cause apparently the b word is a slur?)

For context my sister is 18 months older than me and in college. She visits every few weeks and currently she is staying for a month for her Christmas break.

So today my sister arrived at 3ish pm and asked me to help bring her stuff in. I was like sure and helped her, no problem. She took out some gifts that she had gotten for me and had me put them under our tree. Then fast forward to a few hours later, sister, mom, and I go to a cat adoption center because mom wants another cat (we have two) and sister is planning on having one in her dorm. I go too cause obviously I'm on board with getting another cat; I love my two cats but they're not super affectionate plus have favorites that aren't me so the possibility of getting an affectionate cat really excited me. So we go and meet two young cats, Latte and Archer. I quickly take a liking to Archer, a gray kitty, who's super mellow and cuddly, which is exactly the kind of cat I'd been wanting. I get super set on choosing him and bringing him home soon, but sister also likes him too. At first I thought this was a good thing, but I made a comment that I wanted Archer and she immediately and rudely shut me down, saying that ""this isn't about you"" Weird, but I thought she was joking or being playful or something. Well apparently not because throughout our visit, whenever I said something about wanting Archer, she would always immediately and rudely shut me down, again saying something about how this isn't about me. She even insisted on holding him and when I asked for a turn to hold him she repeatedly said no before eventually letting me. By the end of our visit I had gone nonverbal (autistic) and wouldn't speak or even respond to texts. On the ride home I was thinking that there's no chance I'd get Archer because sister would get her way and that really upset me because not only had I been really looking forward to getting an affectionate cat who'd happily spend time with me, but I really took a liking to Archer in particular. And what makes me feel even worse is that mom didn't even do anything. She only said something when I told sister to stop being a b-tch. Like? Why didn't she say something when sister was being a jerk to me for no reason? Especially when she was super nice to me just a few hours prior. I just wanted to get an affectionate cat that'll sit and cuddle with me because my other cats never do and I don't want to force them.

So basically I feel real crappy even hours later and haven't spoken since. I feel like I'm overreacting but honestly things like this aren't an uncommon occurrence and it makes me feel like sister is the favorite child, which is a suspicion that I've had since I was young.

Why do I have to suffer the consequences of her actions? Why am I left the pick up the pieces of my broken life after what she did? I truly wish she‚Äôd crash into a tree just how I‚Äôve wanted to do since that night. I hope she never sleeps at night, I hope she feels eternal guilt and sorrow for what she did to me.

I made it so fucking clear that I was in pain, I said stop multiple times. She heard me EACH time.

The worst part? She‚Äôs well liked in my town and has told everyone that I‚Äôm the villain. She baited me into arguments then recorded me without my knowledge, then later used these recordings as leverage to keep me from speaking about my rape. I‚Äôm trapped. I can‚Äôt press charges because I‚Äôd only be shooting myself in the foot.

She was terrified I was going to press charges. When I confronted her about what did (kindly I might add) she denied it, tore into me, said that it was actually me who was the bad guy, and implied I‚Äôm misremembering because of my OCD. I know I‚Äôm not misremembering. I remember every detail, every moment, everytime I tried to fight back and was pushed down.

I have been in a wonderful relationship for over a year now with a beautiful and kind woman. Yet I still suffer with the effects of that night. I get flashbacks, intrusive memories, and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD.

"TLDR: The credit card company paid for my husband‚Äôs $38k funeral because I wasn‚Äôt a shared card user on the account and we were diligent to put beneficiaries on everything. 

To not fully call them out, let‚Äôs just say my husband had a credit card with ‚ÄúFun Card‚Äù prior to his passing. I also had a card with them on the same account. 

My late husband passed away from cancer in his early 30s. While he was on hospice, we had planned a lot about his service of what he wanted, and pre-booked, ordered and paid for a majority of things in advance. Given he wanted it to be a big party celebration, this included the following:

- Reception hall fitting 350 people (all inclusive with decorations, BBQ buffet dinner and full open bar for 300 people)
- 40 dozen special cupcakes/desserts
- Koozies, wristbands, and stickers with his ‚Äúcatch phrase‚Äù on it for family/friends attending the service
- Transportation for family from service to reception
- Cremation/urn and all that entails
- Miscellaneous items his hospice team informed us about

Morbid, I know, but he wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed or stressed. With all the above, it equated to just shy of $38,000. We put this all on the ‚ÄúFun‚Äù credit card with the understanding the balance could be paid off with the life insurance money. 

After my husband passed, I went through the process of obtaining the death certificate. The morgue we went with provided a service of notifying all the companies he had an account with for me, and we had already prepared and provided them with all the necessary documentation, such as 401k, banks, mortgage, etc.

Now approximately 16 days after my husband passed, and just 5 days before his service, I go to the grocery store and use my ‚ÄúFun‚Äù card. 

Declined.

Last I knew our limit was over $80k on the card and I knew we had only had the charges for his service on there. Also, given that was the only credit card we used, I was in a panic. I went straight to one of their branches to find out what was going on. 

This is what I learned and what transpired at the branch:

1) I was told (rudely) they could only speak to my husband because he was the primary account holder.

2) When the account was created by my late husband, he had incorrectly established me as a card user but not a shared owner of the account. (Basically inputted like a child and didn‚Äôt get rights to any of the points, but didn‚Äôt have to share liability of the debt either)

3) Without consent of the primary account holder, I could not be set as a shared owner and gain access again. (Despite me desperately pleading)

4) Once they received the death certificate from the morgue, the account was automatically closed and set to go to probate to assign the debt to the beneficiary (me) since there was not a shared account owner.

So, this is what I learned as a younger widow in probate court. Each state sets a certain number of inheritance money to surviving spouses (+ any children under 18 under the care of spouse) that cannot be touched by debt collections. In my state, that number was $55k for me.

Now second fun thing I learned - if you are listed on accounts (such as 401k, life insurance policies, stocks, checking, savings, etc) as the beneficiary, those are transferred directly to you and do not need to go through probate court - you can go directly to the company/bank and do the transfer yourself.

Thankfully my late husband was fairly good about having me labeled on everything except a few small accounts. All in all, the assets where I was not listed as a beneficiary ended up totaling just around $16k.

Now, ‚ÄúFun Card‚Äù had submitted their debt to probate court. However, since the value of the inheritance did not go above the $55k minimum of the state, the judge did not awarded any amount to them. (Yes, I fully disclosed all the other accounts that went directly to me)

After speaking to an individual representing ‚ÄúFun Card‚Äù in court, my situation of bringing this loophole to light has implemented a string of new policies on account setups, and training for on-site branches for this scenario.",Credit card loophole paid for my late husband‚Äôs funeral,18ndee6,1703129916.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ndee6/credit_card_loophole_paid_for_my_late_husbands/,

"I grew up with a comfortable life. My parents gave my siblings and me pretty much everything we needed and more. I am beyond grateful for everything they have given me. However, I couldn‚Äôt stand my dad‚Äôs narcissistic behaviour anymore.

My father is a politician. In my country, if you are a politician, you are a ‚Äúcelebrity.‚Äù Growing up, we always had to look good, look presentable, have good table manners, etc. (especially in public). Otherwise, my Dad would get mad at us when we got home.

Growing up, my eldest sibling and I have been aware that my Dad is cheating on my Mum. Him being in the public eye and not being discreet about it, I would have people go up to me and tell me that they saw my Dad with another girl on a date. I would relay it to my Mum, making sure first that the story is real. My Dad being a MEGA cheater, I have six half-siblings (that we know of so far) with different women. My Mum has never been accepting towards my half-siblings - which is understandable in my opinion. She‚Äôs been tolerating my Dad‚Äôs cheating habits for the sake of us, her kids.

As I‚Äôve matured, I‚Äôve come to realise that my father is a narcissist. When he finds out that I told my Mum something about him cheating on her, he would ignore me for a while. Instead of apologising, he wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for months. And of course, his favourite, he would cut off my allowance. He loves holding money over our heads.

My Mum is my Dad‚Äôs sole business partner with all our family businesses, but he would not allow her to be involved in anything business-related. She is pretty much just a business partner on paper, that‚Äôs it.

My Mum has always wanted to open a business of her own so she doesn‚Äôt have to rely so much on my Dad. Being that my narcissistic father is our sole provider, he would not give her funds to open up her own business because (I think) he thinks he would not have any control over her anymore when she starts making her own money.

A few years back, my Dad sent me overseas to finish my degree (which I‚Äôm very grateful for). After graduating, I‚Äôve stayed overseas as I have made a lot of friends and just enjoyed the freedom of being able to do whatever I want and not having my Dad breathing down my neck all the time. Lately, however, I‚Äôve come to realise the reason why my Dad sent me overseas - so that he could cheat on my Mum, and no one would tell her anything because I‚Äôm the main person who snitches on him.

It was the elections recently in my home country. My Dad never invited my half-siblings to join his campaigns, as this would tarnish his ‚Äúperfect‚Äù public image, even when the public already knows he‚Äôs a massive cheater. 

When we (his ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù family) would join his campaigns every single day during the campaign period, he would never introduce us to the public - since the public already knows who we are (I think?). However, on the last day of the campaign period, one of my half-siblings who has a dream of becoming a public servant as well was introduced to the public by my father. He did not ask permission from my Mum that he was going to do it. So when my Mum found out, she got really sad and because she felt she got so disrespected and betrayed by my father AGAIN. And me being overseas, she would call me every single day just to cry. It breaks my heart to see my Mum in pain. My Mum is now talking to a lawyer and planning on getting a divorce which I am 1000% in support of. I told her that all of us are now adults so she shouldn‚Äôt worry about us anymore and just start living her life again for her.

I am done with my father. I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore.

I have a decent job, a stable income. I‚Äôve been paying all my bills on my own. However, I still get an allowance here and there from my Dad. But after what he‚Äôs done recently and seeing my Mum in so much pain, I want to completely cut him out of my life. I know this would mean he would completely cut me off financially, but I‚Äôve just had enough. I‚Äôd still be okay financially, but I have an even more comfortable life with the allowance I get from him. But I just couldn‚Äôt tolerate him and his narcissistic behavior anymore.

"Let me just say, im sorry for the ranting in advance i just need to get this off my chest, its hurting me. Ive never been so low in my life, ever. Sure i know people and have some family here and there but the way i see it, i have a few true friends and even then we are nothing like the bestfriends everyone else is and im not so close with my family like others are. I feel like i barely talk with my family and friends so they dont know me too well &amp; vice versa. I havent had a girlfriend ever, ive had some girls like me but i didnt really feel a connection with them. Ive always been so ashamed of my families wealth even though we arent too bad off. We have come along way but i just dont have enough friends and go out enough to know where i fit in exactly in the social class. I like to think im very humble but we get by, this makes me genuinely think im incapable of finding love. and oh yeah, the fact that i am very ugly and overall a pretty boring personüòÇim trying to laugh it off but its not really working. Anyway i also feel like all the girls that i am interested in are into completely different guys that i cant even fathom being like. I want to be myself, but if i cant ever find love cause of it, i think i will die alone. Im so introverted and jealous of others, like genuinely i hate myself for that. Speaking of hating myself, the biggest reason i hate myself has to be my ugliness. if i were even a little bit more attractive i think people would actually like and respect me. Im currently ‚Äútalking‚Äù to this girl that my friend sort of put me on with but it kind of feels fake. Shes a pretty girl and i feel like has options with other much better looking and more sane dudes, so i feel like shes just enjoying some attention before we inevitably stop texting and it becomes nothing but a memory for her, but for me, its gonna become another solidified memory in my mind that will constantly remind me that im not regular, im not good looking, and that people treat me as a joke. I think i must be bipolar or something. Man, sometimes i can fight this feeling off like nothing but sometimes it genuinely physically hurts me, like right now. I wish i was normal. I wish i fit in.

"My GF (let's call her Allie as a fake name) found me online when she and I (M) were 13 and we started just talking, chatting, yadda yadda, and I actually started feeling for her.  
  
But my attraction towards her eventually manifested itself in one of the worst ways possible.  
  
At the time of this event, I was 14 and Allie was either 13 or 14. I don't quite remember. But regardless, I started asking for pics n stuff (as a 14yo in the early stages of puberty *would* do). I pressured her across multiple weeks during that year, maybe even over a month.  
  
  
  
Eventually, we grew a bit distant, and that went for about a year.  
  
After that, when I was 15, I looked back at what I had said to her. I looked back through the messages...  
  
  
  
...and I didn't like what I was reading.  
  
  
  
I didn't like... what I wrote.  
  
After that, I knew what I had to do, and coincidentally, Allie had just initiated a new conversation with me, and we started talking on an online drawing whiteboard site. After the small talk was out of the way, I finally said what I knew I needed to say.  
  
I apologized. For what I said, for who I was, and for how I knew I most likely made her feel.  
  
And she forgave me. I still do not fully understand why, but I am grateful that she did.  
  
I am almost 18 now and am much more cautious and respectful on the topic of sex and nudity. I always make sure that Allie is okay with talking about that stuff now.  
  


Okay. Now... the questions.  
  
Was I in the wrong?  
  
Yes. Anyone with more than two braincells could see that. (I also know now that asking for and/or receiving nudes from a minor is highly illegal: a piece of info I did not know at the time.)  
  
Did I learn anything from this?  
  
Yes. I learned that I was a bad person in the past, and that my moral compass wasn't quite pointing north. Additionally, I learned just how easy it is to be horrible under the guise of anonymity and how easy it is to be a horrible person without realizing it. I also learned... for the first time ever... about long-term consequences. I knew what they were, but this was the first time I truly grasped the weight of my actions. The punishment was no longer a slap on the behind from my parents. The punishment was no longer being sent to my room. It was no longer getting lectured/yelled at.  
  
My punishment was a bond with someone I wanted to grow closer with being weakened by my own doings. My punishment was knowing that that person got abused and manipulated BY ME. My punishment was me being ""the villain"". My punishment was guilt. True guilt.  
  
Is the matter resolved?  
  
Most likely. I have apologized to Allie, and she has forgiven me. (Not sure about the legal standpoint yet.)",I was manipulative to my GF.,18ncsrx,1703128012.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ncsrx/i_was_manipulative_to_my_gf/,
I don‚Äôt know where to begin. I got pregnant when i was nineteen and had my son in june of this year via emergency c section and we both almost died. I love my son and i would be devastated if anything ever happened to him but i absolutely hate being a mother. I feel no real connection with him and struggle to want to take care of him. I live with my mom and grandma and they go above and beyond helping me with him and i‚Äôm eternally grateful for that. When i‚Äôm alone with him and he has screaming fits i just see red. I get so scared i could hurt him i just have to sit him down and take a breath. I struggled with addiction before i got pregnant and was diagnosed bipolar. His father is not involved at all.

"I've been looking back on my life lately and I've realized as more time goes on the more dull and lifeless I become towards some people, my parents and family in particular. Around friends I can be more myself and can still be a lively person but even then I feel like I've been isolating myself more and more. My parents don't really know me anymore and I think they know that too aswell. I'm not sure how I've become so closed off. I have a really difficult time recognizing and validating emotions within myself so I'm really never sure when I'm going through a depressive cycle unless I start to see signs like this, at-least I think this is some sort of depressive cycle. I've been smoking a-lot of weed the past year or so, it comforts me and keeps me from the loneliness. I know its not good to cope with drugs but it has helped me do a-lot of thinking and self reflection. I've always had this feeling deep down for many years now but in more recent time it has had more weight on my mind; the feeling that something bad had happened to me when I was younger. No matter how hard I try I can't remember anything traumatic happening, but I sometimes catch glimpses with ""coded"" memories almost that bring out this awful feeling in my stomach. Memories that I can't necessarily see in full detail, they are more abstract and jumbled due to how much time has passed since I had experienced it. They're mixture of random details, sounds, smells, etc... but they sometimes have this dark undertone to them that is so sickening. I want so badly to remember what this was but I don't know how. I feel like maybe I have some repressed memories that I need to heal so that I can grow as a person, but I'm not sure how to do this if I can't remember them. I've always been a little different from everyone else, I've always had a-lot of anxiety issues even as a little kid as-well as insecurity issues too. I also know that if I did experience or see something traumatic I would have not told an adult, I have always kept a-lot to myself as telling my parents things could cause an explosion and bring me shame. I internalize and deal with problems on my own because I feel as if sharing with someone I should be able to trust always ends up making things worse for me or puts a burden on them, so if no one else knows my problems or things that are bothering me I can dissociate from them easier. I just needed to write to get that off my chest, I would appreciate it if I get feedback because I'd like to hear if anyone else has these feelings or knows what they are.

"tw for mild abuse (non physical)

my mom and i have always been pretty close and she‚Äôs always been my rock. before my stepdad, it was just me and her, and then my sister too.

however my stepdad came into my life when i was maybe 13-14 and i tried to get along with him, and we did for the most part. however when i got older i started to realize he wasn‚Äôt great and was probably abusive. he has never physically hurt me but has been very emotionally and verbally abusive for years. he has continuously hurt me and my mom and my sister and has done some‚Ä¶interesting things, including but not limited to cheating on my mom, screaming at me over minor inconveniences, being a raging alcoholic, and constantly making fun of every single thing i do, who i date, things i like, etc. there is more obviously but i don‚Äôt want to get into details, but i have always been a huge target for him to make fun of to everyone he meets and he uses me as a way to get cheap laughs out of people when it obviously makes me uncomfortable, and when i ask him to stop he just laughs more and tells me to get over it. 

i finally couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. after i moved out of their house i realized how much happier and more free i felt. physical issues i had alleviated because i wasn‚Äôt anxious or walking on eggshells in my own home. and i never really went home even though i loved my mom and sister to death and still do. 

i confronted my mom about it and obviously it did not go well. she vehemently denies any of that actually happened and told me to stop holding grudges, then turned it on me being an awful child and never being grateful. she told my stepdad about it of course and now he‚Äôs just completely giving me the cold shoulder (which idc about i‚Äôm over him) and my mom expects us to just make up like nothing even happened. we still fight over it though and i have been advocating for family therapy.  things have been pretty strained ever since and now i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll ever have the same relationship with my mom ever again. my boyfriend has been really supportive and so has my other family, so i‚Äôm very lucky and priveliged to have that, but i would be lying if i said  i didn‚Äôt miss my mom and my sister. and no christmas with them either which is awful.",i think my mom is choosing my stepdad over me,18nckh8,1703127282.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nckh8/i_think_my_mom_is_choosing_my_stepdad_over_me/,

it‚Äôs been a few days and everything has j been irritating me. he was two hours late for our trip that i planned when i told him to not be late bc he usually is late. the reason why he was late was bc he was self conscious abt his hair and took him two hours to do it. he kept making more excuses and i told him j not to be late next time bc it‚Äôs been happening a lot. what i feel guilty for is that he tries to be physical and affectionate to me but i can‚Äôt stand it. like i feel like i can‚Äôt breathe. he also has been complaining a bunch on our trip abt his hair and asking me questions abt if i‚Äôm mad at him. i‚Äôm not mad but i‚Äôm overwhelmed by everything. everything thing j seems to irritate me. we also have been seeing each other everyday and i need a day to myself but he disagrees because we are in long distance. idk why all these feelings came up after the night with the edible. i feel like i could never bring myself or think abt breaking up with him but i‚Äôm so overwhelmed and stressed.",i got high and now i feel like my relationship isn‚Äôt working,18nchzu,1703127057.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nchzu/i_got_high_and_now_i_feel_like_my_relationship/,

"This is a long post, sorry. 
I‚Äôm a student, and I came home last weekend for Christmas from uni via a simple 2 hour coach journey. I had packed everything I needed for 3 weeks to a month of going home, aka all of my uni work, favourite clothes, my xbox, and the Christmas presents. The suitcase with all of these was taken. 

When I got off the bus the driver had only one case out and it wasn‚Äôt mine. At first I didn‚Äôt think much and just looked into the underneath of the bus where the rest were until it slowly dawned on me it‚Äôs nowhere to be found. I could barely hear the driver‚Äôs instructions on what to do next because it felt like I was thrown under water. After getting details for the next steps I was crying in the middle of the bus station. It was midday for Christ‚Äôs sake. There wasn‚Äôt even that many people around. 

I immediately called the coach service to let them know what happened and they told me to fill out a form of the event, and that‚Äôs been done. But I have very little hope that it will get retrieved, because if it wasn‚Äôt left on the coach, and I am 100% sure it was not, then there‚Äôs only 2 options of what happened, one more likely than the other. 

The unlikely option is that someone mistook my case for theirs and took it, however I don‚Äôt think that happened because my case had a unique charm on the handle that you really couldn‚Äôt miss, and none of the other leftover bags looked anything like mine. One was the same colour but a much lighter shade, not able to be mixed up.

The likely option is someone who didn‚Äôt bring a case simply came up in either the previous stop or my stop and took it, which wouldn‚Äôt be suspected by anyone else. Or someone in the vicinity came and took it, not as likely because the driver would‚Äôve been there the whole time. Doesn‚Äôt even matter about how, but the fact is if it‚Äôs stolen there‚Äôs just no way i‚Äôll get it back. Yeah they could see the CCTV and find them but it‚Äôs been enough time for them to have sold, burned or thrown out my stuff literally anywhere. The total worth of the contents was about ¬£600, but that‚Äôs not enough for the police to get involved apparently.

And you can say it‚Äôs just stuff, sure, but it‚Äôs not to me. Sure, I can live without my favourite clothes, and I can buy a new xbox eventually. This is my second year in uni, but the first in which I‚Äôve had enough money to finally get my mum the presents she deserves, and I put a lot of work into them. It really breaks my heart to know there will be nothing under the tree because we don‚Äôt have the money for Christmas this year. But it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just stuff.

But my fucking uni work‚Ä¶ please. I do a really really intense course, I spend many days and nights working on a lot of different things at once and all my lecture notes, my sketches, my ideas were there. If that person has any sense of conscience, if they even happen to see this post by some miracle. Please give me the notebook and papers back. That‚Äôs all I want. I can‚Äôt fail uni because you needed money. You can‚Äôt sell those, but I can have a future with them. 

I‚Äôve had a really shit uni year as it is, being ill for two months from the beginning of the course and missing so much. I‚Äôve spent my waking hours catching up or working at my part time job, and now it‚Äôs all gone. I have a few weeks until my hand in date, and I‚Äôll obviously get an extension, but I won‚Äôt have those ideas again, I simply can‚Äôt remember everything I wrote down. Even if I get financial compensation, it doesn‚Äôt bring back this.

I understand that I was fortunate enough to get away unscathed myself. It could have been a more dangerous situation, with a knife at my throat or worse. But it doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. Some things in there were really personal. Some things I got on my recent travels that were one of a kind, gifts I spent time and my last money picking out, and clothes I adore that I wear every day, some of which you can‚Äôt just buy anymore. 

I feel this weight on me every day when I remember what happened, and I can‚Äôt shake it. I find myself at shops looking for gift wrap, only to realise I have nothing to wrap. My mother has been so supportive of the whole ordeal, reassuring me that she‚Äôs glad i‚Äôm just there with her, but it just makes me miserable that the things I wanted so badly for her to open up on christmas day and see her reaction to are just‚Ä¶ gone. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I have no more motivation for starting my uni work a third time, so I spend most of my days in bed.

"So I‚Äôve said this in a comment to a post but I haven‚Äôt shared the story. I was 14 she was 16. We got hella drunk. She didn‚Äôt necessarily force me to drink more but told me it would be fun to hang out if we were super drunk. She barely took any shots. She took me to the bedroom after I told her I don‚Äôt wanna do anything sexual. She said don‚Äôt worry and still took everything off my body and proceeded to do it. I hated it. Most people I try to tell this too either brush it off and ignore it, don‚Äôt care about it, or just tell me it wasn‚Äôt rape bc I obviously wanted it. I didn‚Äôt want it. It sucks. But it‚Äôs whatever I guess I‚Äôm almost 20 now. I tried to tell my ex about it and she told me I can‚Äôt be raped so I must be lying. She told me I was drunk and most likely wanted it anyway.

"TLDR; Struggled with depression my whole life, dated an ex for 6 years that destroyed my mental health and my social life.  
  
I (F21) have lived in Vegas my whole life. I'm so tired of being here, here in this city and here on this Earth. I have always struggled with depression. Since I was a kid, I've always struggled with thoughts of su\*cide. I've contemplated su\*cide many times before. I've been admitted to hospitals four times before. Two occasions on which were associated with my ex (he'll be called Miles), whom I dated for 6 years. I met him in middle school, dated in high school, and I finally ended things with him in July this year.   
  
The relationship was draining. At first I didn't reciprocate any feelings for him until he confessed to me he had feelings just when I got out of a relationship that was tormenting. I decided to go out with him, and the first 2 years with him ruined my religious values. Which is fine. But the rest of our years together, being in the relationship turned me into a disheartening, lying, pessimistic person, and I was a person who didn't value or appreciate the beauty of life. Despite of all that, I would always put in effort to spend time with Miles. I loved him the way he was, and always comforted him for anything he needed. I've driven to his house countless times to make sure he wasn't going to hurt himself, or if he was going through an episode, I made sure he was given all my support.  
  
On October 2021, I went on two relationship breaks (not breakups) with him to figure out what I wanted from the relationship. Keep in mind, we did not set any boundaries or rules to follow. I wanted to take those breaks to figure out with what I needed to do. I felt guilty for liking other people and I didn't understand why I felt crushes on others. I went on to talk to another ex, which I hadn't known he had feelings for me after years of not really talking to him. I would tell my 2 friends (who were friends with him as well), about my excitement to hangout with that ex. I had feelings for this ex but it gained worse when my two friends encouraged me to strive for it. The two friends told me if there were no boundaries or ground rules, it was basically free-reign and I was allowed to ""have my fun"" to figure out what I wanted. So I listened. I didn't talk to Miles as much as I should have. I would fantasize these plans I would have to do with my ex (sneaking up to his house window with a ladder) but I would have never followed through, and it wasn't realistic. Anyway, those 2 friends ONLY encouraged me to ""have my fun"" as an excuse to want to have a three-way with me. I was too scared to do anything. My friends convinced me to strip down and have their way with me but I didn't do anything. I declined and then I ended my break with Miles. After a week goes by, one of those friends went out and told Miles about the things I said about my other ex, after our break was over. I didn't think telling Miles was going to help anything so I didn't tell him anything. Anyway, I lose all of my friends over it. Miles went out to tell his whole family, friends, and even anyone that he knew, that I cheated on him. We broke up on March of 2021. Fast forward, we decided to get back together last year on November of 2022. I went for 6 months dating this co worker to get over Miles. I left Miles for that co worker because I had felt guilt and felt like Miles needed someone else. I was constantly reminded by him that I ""cheated"" and needed to prove him that I loved him. The 6 month relationship didn't really work out, mostly because the co worker wasn't someone I felt like was going to be long term, and reason two was because Miles and I got together to hangout, realizing we still had feelings for each other, and he convinced me to breakup with the guy I was with. He sat in my car with me, and told me to text my co worker that I ""lost feelings.""  
  
At that point, if ANYONE was to give me love, support or attention, I would instantly gain romantic feelings for that person. This include my best friend, Mile‚Äôs roommates, his friends, co workers, literally anyone. I was someone who was so desperate to have attention from anyone, because I didn't receive the same effort I was putting in the relationship back. I only ever craved love and romantic gestures from Miles. He was so romantic and lovely in the beginning, but as we continued on, it died down drastically. I was someone who would constantly put in effort. Whether it was gifting, going out to eat with him, etc. If I was to ever go to Miles for comfort from a breakdown or ask for help, he would always gossip to our friends and tell them what I was struggling with. It only made me feel worse, and I never understood why he would tell anyone about the details of my breakdown. I realized how much Miles changed me from all those years. For the better, and for the worst. For the last year of our relationship, I would always go over to his apartment. I would never be at my own house. He said he didn't feel comfortable being in my house, and would always convince me to drive to his house. It was 30 minutes away from where I lived. But each time I would go over, I would be isolated in his room. If I wanted to do something, it would be turned down, or excused for him to relax and play video games with his friends because he was stressed most of the time. If I wanted to go home and do my own things, he would guilt trip me, always telling me that he liked my presence. I barely talked or saw my family. In a way, he made me rebel against my family a lot of times. I didn't go out with my family at all. During the holidays, he would convince me to go over to see his family and spend time with him. Everything was always about him, and I felt like I was the side character.  
  
As of now, my friends who are also friends with him, haven't spoken to me as much as they used to. They told me they would remain friends with me if me and Miles broke up. I haven't heard from my best friend, who is friends with Miles, for 2 months. My only IRL friends I have remaining is my good high school friend, and Mile's brother's girlfriend. I know he told my high school friend some things about me, and said how long he‚Äôs been wanting to breakup with me. He apparently also told people about how he broke up with me/the breakup being mutual, when I was the one who initiated breaking up in the first place. I'm not sure what else he told people but it did enough for all my friends to stop talking to me. I'm learning on self care, self love and doing things I enjoy to make myself happy. But today, it really hit me, incredibly bad. I feel like if I reach out or cry to anyone, I'm so scared they'd abandon me. Four days ago, Miles messaged me saying how he didn't like dating me, how frustrated he was on missing me, and how he doesn't want to be attached to me. Prior to him blocking me on every form in social media, he sent me petty messages on how he wants me to stay out of his life. I was okay with it, simply because I moved on and I wanted to focus on myself. But, I noticed after he told me that, he stalked my accounts on Tiktok, he opened up an Insta account featuring his cat, and used that account to message me after a shooting happened at our university.  
  
The only thing I'm looking forward to is potentially moving to Colorado, and move in with my current partner. Particularly south from Denver. So far, I've been to Colorado at least 5 times now. Me and my boyfriend take turns to travel out of the state. I'm going back in January. He's saving up to get a place, as he went through a complex situation where he had to move back to his parents. But until then, I still need to graduate college. It's the one thing that is motivating me to keep going. I still have one year and a half. I feel like my life will get better.

"When I was an intern at a medical facility, in 2019, it was just a normal day. I got in nice and early at 8:45am. I was dressed sexily, and had just taken a dump at home. I felt ready to tackle the day. An hour or two went by, &amp; I noticed a funky smell. I shared an office with two staff. I thought ‚Äúdamn, one of them smells terrible. It‚Äôs like ass smell.‚Äù The smell persisted though, and wouldn‚Äôt leave me. It was at that moment I asked, ‚Äúcould it be me?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way‚Äù, I told myself. I hadn‚Äôt had an ass smell incident in over a decade. I went to the bathroom, and did what I now call ‚Äúa check‚Äù. I took some toilet paper, and wiped. What I saw completely horrified me. My eyes opened as wide as possible üí© üëÄ. I just stared, hand trembling in disbelief. There was shit all over the toilet paper. My internal voice screamed ‚ÄúNOOOO!!!‚Äù At this point, I was sweating out of anxiety. I cleaned myself up as best I could, with feelings of shame, disbelief, and shock. To this day, I ask: ‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I forgot to wipe my ass.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid I fart?‚Äù It haunts me. I wipe 5 extra times even after TP comes back clean.

"First off, I just want to say I have no issue with people identifying how they want to. I have dated nonbinary people and I have had to refer to those people by they/them. Having done it so long. I use it without thinking in daily conversation. For example this current girl I'm talking to. (Call her H)  I blundered when ordering us food. I was like ""they will have the same thing"" and H was like ""why TF did you call me they"". Also after my last breakup I would use the same terminology when talking to my therapist and it has him confused to which I understand why. It's just hard for me to not refer to people as their biological gender. I'm not trying to be rude. I tried to give it a chance and now I'm like super used to it. It doesn't help that nonbinary people will get mad at you for identifying them wrong. Anyways I'm trying to break that habit and just wanted to vent a little.

"So before I write this I just wanna say there‚Äôs gonna be some triggering information, including suicide and selfharm. But I will also say, it does ‚Äòend‚Äô on a positive note. So yea, there‚Äôs your warning and I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs triggering. But I need this out. 


This year as a whole has been incredibly hard for me. Probably the hardest year I‚Äôve had as an adult mentally and emotionally. Multiple times this year I have found myself past the passive suicidal point, while also battling that with self harm to cope with staying alive. I guess this whole downfall started august 2022. To say the least cause I don‚Äôt want this to be ridiculously long, I threw away 3.5 years being completely clean from selfharm. And I‚Äôve just fallen down a really dark rabbit hole since that point. It started with a sh relapse every 3 months, sometimes between. But over time, with environmental chaos, plus work, and struggling with friendships, it became a lot more consistent. And I‚Äôve always had this stupid mindset with sh that I can‚Äôt stop till it‚Äôs deep enough. Which has landed me in the hospital more then once.

 March of 2023 I started planning out killing myself on my 21st birthday. (June 2023) This is where my 3 month rule comes to play. Every time I‚Äôm seriously suicidal and planning to killmyself I make sure the date is ALWAYS set at least 3 months in advance. This is for a few reasons, but the main one being it usually gives me enough time to get better. And at the bare minimum, to not be at rock fucking bottom. It‚Äôs worked, every time. I mean here I am. Anyways, I made it past my birthday and I accomplished a huge goal I‚Äôve been fighting for over 5 years. I expected it to help this weight but it definitely didn‚Äôt. I started to become seriously suicidal again, I made a plan to wait till after Christmas. But I was at a point I didn‚Äôt think I could wait till then, I was hyper focused on my plan for at least 4 hours a day. 

So i selfharmed really bad hoping it would help me wait till after Christmas. And it did take the urgency of the suicide away, so I hyper focused on my selfharm. To use it to keep me alive. I stupidly fell down the rabbit hole of sh twitter. It ruined everything. My selfharm has reached a point where I can‚Äôt return to the way I used to. I don‚Äôt want to go super deep into detail, but I just. The fact I can‚Äôt stop unless I reach all fat each time is not good. I can‚Äôt accept anything less now that I‚Äôve reached that point, I can‚Äôt go back. So the past 2 months my self harm has been the most severe is has my whole self harm journey. And it‚Äôs super bad timing cause I don‚Äôt have insurance here..I‚Äôve had insurance up untill June this year. 

I haven‚Äôt wanted to get better or help myself for myself for a long time. But about 1.5 weeks ago I started thinking about attempting recovery for myself at the start of 2024. I thought about it more and called myself out. I only wanna wait till the start of 2024 so I can enable myself to get worse and keep cutting till then. So 3 days ago i decided to take my recovery seriously and get better for myself. 

I even got a brand new 50 pack of razors I‚Äôve never used before and stopped myself from testing the sharpness. I‚Äôm so sick with selfharm I forgot that testing sharpness is still selfharm. 

Well, today I deleted twitter. I also left every single sh related subreddit here as well. And tomorrow I‚Äôm going into the forest and I‚Äôm going to do a little ritual and bury every single razor and tool I have. Im so scared and proud. I‚Äôve told 2 friends about the forest ritual, knowing they will keep me accountable if last second I try to change my mind. So yea, this has been a really really hard year for me. But, I‚Äôve decided to chose recovery and fight to get better for myself. Im not going to give up or give in this time, imma go past 3.5 years clean. 2024 is gonna be my year. 

Thank you for reading if you did, I‚Äôm sorry for the length. Ik it‚Äôs a book lmao. This helped me release and also fully accept my decision. I‚Äôll update tomorrow after my ritual to keep myself accountable. ü´°‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",Why I have a 3 month rule for my death date.,18nbu3a,1703124985.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nbu3a/why_i_have_a_3_month_rule_for_my_death_date/,
"In February 2022 me and my (ex)partner of 4 years lost our first and only baby girl. She was very poorly and we never got to take her home. It was and still is a heartbreaking thing to go through. 2 short blurry months later, I found out he was planning on meeting another girl. He said he wasn‚Äôt happy with me anymore and thought it best I move out. With the already broken state I was in, I didn‚Äôt give much resistance and moved back in with my parents who were a huge support system and nurtured me until I was able to somewhat function again. I had lost my baby, my partner, my home, my future, our rainbow kitten and life as I knew within a short couple months. I was a shell of a person for a very long time and couldn‚Äôt fathom how life could ever return to even bearable, let alone happy. For the next few months he played some mind games, one minute saying he wanted to fix things and the next sleeping with other girls. I tried to understand that he of course was grieving as well, and was maybe coping by avoiding and running away. So we tried to work it out. But after a while, it was so clear to me that the broken trust and complete sense of abandonment in my most vulnerable moment was all too much for me to forgive and forget, and we mutually agreed to part ways. 
It‚Äôs almost been 2 years since then. We occasionally send each other a text on special dates of our daughters and have both expressed a deep platonic love for each. Possibly because of what we went through together, and the grief we share? I‚Äôm not sure. Anyway, He‚Äôs now moved on and seems happy. I don‚Äôt really have an interest in dating yet and am more focusing on rebuilding myself and my life after it was completely flipped upside down within a matter 2 months. I still grieve deeply for our baby and motherhood as a whole, but I‚Äôm learning to embrace moments of peace and happiness alongside my grief. But I, without fail, still think of him every single day. I still find myself having to fight the urge to message him. If someone was sharing this with me, my first thought would be that they‚Äôre lonely and missing the relationship rather than the person. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm surrounded by friends and family and have never actually been as socially active as I currently am! I‚Äôve since taken up new hobbies and have been trying really hard to focus on self love and care. I
Now I know I wouldn‚Äôt act on these thoughts because at the end of the day, we separated for a reason. I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust him ever again, or lean on him during hard times in fear he‚Äôll run away like he did before. It just wouldn‚Äôt be the same. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he pops up in my thoughts everyday. And to be honest it‚Äôs draining. upsetting even. It‚Äôs also kind of.. embarrassing? To have been treated like that, yet still have these feelings for him after all this is just silly. So I haven‚Äôt told anyone. I‚Äôm hoping that getting this off my chest on here might help or at least help me to make sense of these feelings? Maybe that deep platonic love isn‚Äôt so platonic on my side? Or maybe I‚Äôm confusing the connection we have of our daughter with love for him? Most of my memories with my baby girl include him, so could i possibly be thinking of her and the memories trigger thoughts of him? Could I even be unconsciously prolonging ‚Äúgetting over‚Äù him to stop myself from moving on with someone else. I guess that would mean the end of this chapter.

Today at work I had the worse situation happen to me. I was working drive thru to bring a customer their order. I give the women her order and after a few seconds she made a comment about another drink she had. This women ordered a small sweet tea with her meal.

I just.. don't know how to get over this. I love him so much. I just want to run back into his arms and say I forgive him but some little part of me is so mad at him. Mad that I kept on compromising my boundaries (ex: talking to his grandmother even though i dont like her to try and resolve the tension and going to holidays that i dont celebrate whatsoever[im autistic,  i hate family gathering holidays and i get overwhelmed easily with new people]) for someone who thinks asking to be spoken to kindly Is asking for a major change in personality.

"Making this note so I wouldn't forget. Not cause I'm angry but as a reference. 

We had talked about out issue and the way he's made me, for a while, sexually and now I feel cheated. 

Let me explain
I don't feel like having sex a lot lately but I've been forcing myself to and sometimes I actually do want to do it but most times I do it cause I know he needs it and its not unpleasant anyway and I also want him to be satisfied. 
The lack of care, love and connection during intimacy has lasted for months now ( a year or more) nd honestly? The psychological effects its had on me is a lot.
I question and doubt alot of things, I feel alone or empty and hollow sometimes. For a period he wasn't fulfilling me sexually and honestly? It felt like he didn't care so now I've gone from very sexual to dry a f and feeling ugly and unwanted...my self confidence where he is...is extremely low. 
I'm beginning to feel self conscious and doubt myself. Also, him shooting down my attempts of hyping myself (be it jesting or otherwise) is so painful....very very painful. 

Honestly if I pen down everything? It'll be too long and I'd like to write this down cause I feel I'd forget (because I don't want to think about this til I can confidently say it is what it is).

So today 5th Jan 2023
    B4 the shawarma came, he wanted to be intimate and I wasn't in the mood at that time but later I felt a little horny and due to the fact that I saw how stressed he was and the fact he told me sex helps him de-stress, i worked myself up to being horny but his behavior b4 the act was off and I could tell he wasnt interested. 
    Looking back...I should have walked away and maybe held him or tried to be there for him rather than initiating the act when we both weren't all the way there but I didn't. 
    I reassured him it was fine but his behavior b4 the act threw me off and made me question everything and his attitude during made me go in and out of the mood .
    I ignored it but he wasn't fully hard and all that and I was overthinking but still threw myself into the act...which I now regret. He came but I could tell he wasnt happy and wasnt all the way there. Sex probably wasn't even on his mind and I can tell it wasn't what he needed then and it made me feel worse.
    It has thrown me off sexually and I am not interested in doing it anymore. Also doesn't help that I partly feel cheated? Cause I have been encouraging myself to move on from it and for it to be this way breaks my heart. He was going through a lot of stress from different places and he didn't want to speak to me after and it made me feel worse.
    Also added to with the fact that he had said something that seemed like he was throwing me under the bus and we talked about it but when we couldn't come to a compromise and I went into the room, he kept watching football match...til half time. Only then did he come 2 talk and play with me. Also later at night, after he had come out several times to ask me what's up and I said nothing (cause I have no evidence to back what I'm feeling and don't want my feelings treated as irrelevant or an attempt to have issues) I came to the room and he turned his back on me. I'm not angry honestly, it just added to it I guess?
    I don't want to have sex for the foreseeable future. I'm just sinking into my shell of shame, sadness, anger, self hate and emotionally taunt.
    I don't know what to do except wait and see if he's closed off due to the sex or if its cause I now want it that he has decided to pull away. I'm just so sad and for me who hates typing to pen all this down? Yeah...","Dec 2023, it got worse.",18nbcq6,1703123485.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nbcq6/dec_2023_it_got_worse/,

I wish I was exaggerating.

The first thing I heard when I moved to Co was that the driving here will make you want to rip your hair out from someone who was driving 30 miles over the speed limit and had just ran a red light. I was anxious, but its not just one example but close to 6 million examples minus anyone who isn't from there.

There are endless examples in my short time in this state that I can give. No turn signals, 50% of people just drive with their high-beams on even in lit up towns or cities, tailgating in the right lane on a multiple lane highways that is otherwise completely empty/ entire tailgating lines in the right lane all driving 20 miles over the speed limit obviously rushing towards a furious metal death right behind a semi that would end the lives of dozens of morons If the truck were to suddenly stop.

Its not even aggressive driving either.

There are plenty of morons who are obviously way to high and are driving way under the speed limit.  Literally will sit with 60 miles until the next car is arriving refusing the turn right. Using the passing lane as their own chill zone.

She‚Äôs had cancer for a while, recently we got her surgery on the accessible tumors but even afterwards her lymph nodes were constantly flared up for the last 3-4 months.

"As a 32 year old who has so far only failed as an artist, I've ended up in a mire of self-loathing, doubt, and existential dread. I have to work a job I don't like to maintain an existence I see no value in. The thing that's making this doubly hard is envy.

A couple of weeks ago, I went to a live show with a friend. It's music I love, performed by a local band with pretty strong support. It was undoubtedly a great night for most of the people there.

But I came up against something familiar -- a crushing sense of unrelenting envy. There I was, standing in a crowd, looking up at a stage where people are living their best lives. These aren't wildly famous people, just people who have turned enough heads to tour their music. 

A group of five artists working on stuff together, playing these wild live shows -- that sense of inclusion, acceptance, and celebration really, really weigh on me as somebody who feels excluded and ignored. I don't despise them or wish they didn't have these things; it isn't a hateful envy, more of an envious grief. 

I don't really know what to do. I used to think that hard work would pay off and I would eventually find 'my tribe', but that has simply never happened. I'm 32, so opportunities for anything ""new/emerging"" are dwindling. And being 32 also means people just don't give a shit, because you're supposed to have found your place in the world by this point.

I know her ex has serious mental health issues. I do too, so to a point I empathize &amp; I spent years trying to be supportive and kind and patient. I made so many excuses for her behavior so many times when other people had problems with her. But she has repeatedly stomped on mine and everyone else's patience too much for too long. Nothing ever changed. In fact, it only seemed to get worse because she has no sense of identity outside of constantly having problems. She has admitted multiple times to going to doctors, ERs and even inpatient psych because she wanted attention and wanted people to fawn on her. She made the last several holidays about her by having breakdowns. She made a huge life-changing event my sister endured all about her. She lost her job and lied to my sister about it for months. She constantly manipulated my sister into catering to her hand over foot. She would get pissy if conversations didn't revolve around her. She made my sister leave her own birthday party early because she didn't feel like being there anymore. This BARLEY scratches the surface of the bullshit she pulled.

I feel like me &amp; our brother are going to get our sister back. We feel like maybe now we can have one fucking peaceful holiday without her ex's dramatics. My sister will actually have the space to live her best life now without someone dragging her down. Her life can be about her for once, for the first time in years. She'll be able to breathe and focus on herself. 

I do feel terrible that my sister is hurting. Its not easy ending a 7-year relationship even when it's technically a good thing. I haven't (and won't) say anything to her except that I love her and I'm here for her. She doesn't need to hear anyone say ""FINALLY"" despite that basically everyone is thinking it. She deserves gentleness and support and space for healing.

I hope her ex has a good life and figures out how to be a happy, functional person but I'm relieved to never have to be involved in her bullshit anymore. Maybe the wedge her ex drove between us can heal faster now. Maybe we can spend time with our sister without her ex finding some way to interfere and put everyone's attention on her.

"I am a hetero cis 20-year-old dude.  
  
Pretty sociable guy overall, with a decent amount of female friends, but when it concerns dating, I'm scared of commitment, or rather even conceiving why someone else, who has much better options would go for a guy who is not a genius or super talented at anything; have some hobbies (cooking, rowing, reading, movie buff, playing the guitar and keyboard). And if it was about specific and personal checkboxes, I'm sure there are other guys out there who are taller and better looking, matching those very same criteria. Why put one's reputation on the line? Settle for less?  
  
I'm short (5'6""), average-looking (although I see myself as fucking ugly and avoid mirrors as much as possible, unless I gotta comb/brush or try clothes on; I've grown more accepting of my looks as of late), baby-faced, and have pitch-black eyes (actually dark brown) but you get my drift. Somewhat clumsy at times and overly sensitive.  
  
I am somewhat jokey and witty among friends, do not feel that of a bummer \[believe me\], somehow I had two female friends (admittedly cute and smart girls) fall for me; I really really liked one of them. Known her for 10 months and began to flirt around the eighth month when I had to partner with her for a Statistics class project, actually went on casual dates and flirted after we bonded, but I still am grateful for and cherish said experience.  
  
Then at a common friend's birthday party, we were chatting in his backyard and she, a bit drunk but still VERY conscious, went on about ""formalizing things"", my confidence and easiness broke apart in a second, and thoughts of being cheated on, being left soon and her disregarding more worthy pretenders flooded my mind. I responded that ""I wasn't emotionally mature enough and couldn't give enough love back in the long run without loving myself"". That might come across as self-centered but I did it out of consideration for her, I wouldn't have been able to handle that anxiety and function as a stable partner. 7 months have passed by since and now she's seeing someone else, she still was open for around 6 months for me to get over this shit but I just distanced myself suffering, and still went on with my self-deprecating shit. I'm in a much better place mentally now but feel awful, a guy like me cannot get that lucky as often.

"Bit of info, I'm 20 F. I got the call two weeks ago from my younger brother (17M) that our dad had suddenly died. He died in his sleep at 58 with no apparent cause as he was perfectly fine, awake, and alert the day prior on the surface. My brother found the body, and my mom was out of state on business while I was out of state because of college. Because of distance, I had to buy an immediate bus ticket home to get to my brother so he wasn't alone as a minor.

Obviously, we are all in shock that he could just suddenly pass like that. The thing that truly was traumatizing was the fact that one day he was perfectly fine (on the surface), and the next night he was just gone. And that my brother had to find it.

But why I think people are going to think I'm insane or something is because I don't miss him. I don't. 

Did I wish death upon him? Absolutely not.

But what I wanted, what me, my brother, and my mom wanted, was freedom. And this is, in its own way, freedom.

My dad was massively homophobic. Which is a major issue when your wife is pansexual and both of your children are queer.

Examples of things he has said to my face:
""Yea, why would anyone want red nipple covers, just like why would anyone want red hair"" - context, my hair is half black, half bright red

""I didn't raise you to be f**gots and lesbians""

""So if your brother found a nice girl, he'd break up with his boyfriend?""

""I don't think you have that AJDH (ADHD) or whatever it is.""

And things he hasn't said to my face, but my mom has discussed with him:
""If OP has a girlfriend, she can come over, but she's not allowed to stay under my roof""


My dad was also very uninvolved with our lives and couldn't be bothered to learn about anything we were interested in unless it was video games or Marvel movies. My brother's gender expression and expression in general was severely limited just by living in the same house as him. I basically had to take care of everything if it's just me, him, and my brother at home. All the tasks that should be his, I have to do. He didn't start caring about being involved until after he realized we actively started avoiding more and developing a hatred of him.

I don't miss him. I don't miss him at all. He has made our lives miserable for no good reason. He was a sad, lonely man with no bright future except for a great retirement plan money wise.

I think everyone I know is expecting me to cry about it. I think I'm supposed to be sad or grieving or something. But even the therapist that came with the police when the body was discovered was dumbfounded by how calm my brother was. How uncaring we were about his death.

I feel like I'm supposed to care more. I feel like I'm supposed to be sad because while he was lowkey verbally abusive, there was otherwise nothing bad about him. His only crime is being involved, dense, and selfish. It feels like the only thing he really did wrong was insult me and my brother.

We've literally been joking about his death for the last two weeks because, in a way, that's how we cope. I have said waaay too much out of pocket shit about how dead he is. And it's funny every time. But I can't feel sad about it. It's like how everyone was memeing the submarine collapse because their deaths were just funny because they were idiots. RIP the son though. 

But yea, I don't miss him.

"** DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE, I DO NOT HAVE A SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO MINORS**

Idk how to put trigger warnings so if you decide to read, be prepared.

This is not a main account for privacy. I found out the other day that a girl I had been talking to for over a year had lied about her age, being SA‚Äôd and being pregnant as a result of SA. She had lied about this not only to me but other adults and minors. All of our interactions had been online as we lived on other sides of the world.

I had met her about a year ago online via a friend of mine, I‚Äôm uncertain at this point how much my friend knew as I don‚Äôt want to bring this topic up to them. We had talked a little bit, but there wasn‚Äôt any particular attraction and I don‚Äôt remember what we spoke about. I don‚Äôt remember much before January, since I didn‚Äôt consider us very close. In the month of January she told me that she was pregnant, which I then asked her how old she was. She told me she was 18 which made me confused as that‚Äôs very young to be having a child. Later she would tell me that it happened because of SA. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it, and we would occasionally talk.

I had left a toxic relationship in late March early April and at this I would see her more frequently. Then in May I would add her on discord and whenever she was around since me and others believed she was 18, the conversations would sometimes have adult themes. Over the next couple of months we would start to get really close and I started to have some feelings for her and at one point she said that it was mutual. She never sent me an explicit pictures, but we would both say sexual things to one another and there was nothing she said or did that made me believe that she was underage. She would talk about university and other things that were more adult like how her grandmother found her sex toy.

Then towards September she disappeared for a while, which I assumed was because she was having a child. When she returned she said that she tried to end her life after ‚Äòhaving her child‚Äô. I was concerned for her because I genuinely had feelings for her. She even sent pictures of her with a baby, which at this point I‚Äôm assuming is her mother‚Äôs. Things were complicated between us and we would have conversations back and forth about having a relationship because of distance. At this point I still didn‚Äôt know the real reason is because she was a minor and I would get into trouble if we had a relationship.

Mid October I started backpacking through Europe, I had been planning this before I had considered her a close friend. I did want to meet her at some point during my trip, but again she left the online space. I tried contacting her multiple times but nothing happened so I continued with my trip as normal, a little heartbroken and just trying to sort of forget about her because she kept on continuing to disappear. Less than two weeks ago she contacted me and at this point I‚Äôd gotten over her and responded coldly. A day later she told me a mutual friend would tell me the reason that she is blocking me and I believe others she was previously in contact with forever.

Come the 15th, I ask my friend what she had to tell me. My friend told me that she wasn‚Äôt 18 and actually 16, and she had lied about a lot of things. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all, I never thought that that would be the reason. It‚Äôs been fucking with me ever since, and especially with the whole dream being a pedophile drama. If I had of been in a different mindset I might have contemplating ending thing, or worse. Right now I just have no idea what to even think about it.

"This is my first time post on redditüôà Il try keep this as short as possible but give a little back story aswell. I(28f) have been with my fianc√©(m29) for 8 years we have 4 kids together(3 are his) and im starting to resent him. I feel i have absolutely none to vent to so here i am. 

My mental health has been really bad my full life. Both my parents committed suicide, ive lost both my grandparents. Not in contact with my brother or sister. I have no one i can call a friend. I only have my kids, my partner and his family who have took me in as one of their own. The first 5 years of our relationship was abit rocky with drug use and MH issues and in that time he used to watch porn which i absolutely hated and he knows this very much. But you know ‚Äúits a man thing‚Äù ‚Äúits normal‚Äù.  It split us up for abit in the past because i felt so disrespected because he knows how it makes me feel. But since we have got back together 3 years ago hes still being doing it but hiding it behind my back. I always find it, he just doesnt know i know. We have a very good sex life, we sext each other, send nudes, play games, try new things so its not like he has a ‚Äúreason too‚Äù im beginning to think he has an issue or just doesnt give a fuck about me. For the past few months its not just been porn. Hes obsessed with big boobs and i dont have that. He looks up certain types of girls goes down rabbit holes of certain girls pages. In the past when ive asked about him watching porn ect and i have said i have sent you loads of stuff so why do it and he says he gets bored. It makes me feel so shity about myself and always stuck with me. I have blocked all adult stuff so he cant go on anything but its been facebook lately and on the history its just videos of women in skimpy stuff, wardrobe malfunction, up skirt, you name it and even breastfeeding videos because you can see a boob which absolutely sickens me! I feel like i cant say anything because it will probably break us up for good! So im literally staying and acting normal for the sake of my children because we have no one else! Right now hes doing this every time i go to sleep or i go out the house hes off to the toilet to have a wank. Now i get anxiety when i leave the house or close my eyes because i know what he will do. I literally dont know what to do anymore i hate myself because im nothing like these people, for letting myself get treated like this. I love this guy to bits i want to marry him hes my soulmate but at this stage it feels like just dam right disrespect and i cant stand to look at him or anything. I feel like a pressure cooker ready to explode if we get into an argument. Someone give me help, advice anything to try save me from myself. Ive never told anyone this in 3 years so please be kind.

"My dad was many things. Stubborn as a mule, ex-firefighter who often put other needs over his. He also used to drink, sometimes just a bit, sometimes extensively. In march he ended up having what seemed to be alcohol epilepsy.

Life went to normal for a bit aside from brief healthscare. He hit his head during the fall from epilepsy and it seemed to affect his eyesight so he had to change jobs (it was car parts delivery &amp; big fuck you to his boss for way they treated him on his way out) 

it was relatively peaceful until june, where he lost consciousness and had to be taken to hospital. As it turned out, test results showed that small tumors were present all over his brain.

Our local hospital didn't have means to treat him properly, nor did they seem very willing to try so when he got slightly better we got him home, and then after a bit got him in one of better hospitals in the capital. 

Early test results they made were seemingly positive and they said he's lucky that he'll get chance to take immunotherapy and how many wish they had one like he does.

It did not help.

His state was getting progressively worse despite therapy and taking all sorts of medicine to keep the body going. By time of early-mid November he was no longer capable of doing stuff on his own. 

Bit after that they came to conclusion immunotherapy didnt have the desired results and switched to chemotherapy, but by then it was probably too late.

He spent his last 12 days in hospital. We hoped that we'll get to at least celebrate his birthday and then christmas, even if doctors told us it will very likely be his last ones.

We didn't get even that

Last friday my mom, siblings and aunt drove to capitol to get him home for a bit, spend time as family. Car had only room for 5 people, and I didnt have foresight to know what was to come. When they arrived, Doctor told them that sending him home is not possible anymore as he was in no condition to be moved. 

They knew it was over when they came to his room, but no one was ready to say goodbye. So he started the talk. Despite cancer ruining his lungs he did his best to tell my mom and siblings how much he loves them, kiss mom all over her face, hug them as tight as he could and to tell them to do same to me for him. 

Then he told them to get out, that theyre exhausting him. He probably felt that was it and didnt want them to watch it. Even in his last moments he didn't want them to suffer having to watch him draw his last breath.

He died around 10 minutes after they left

I wasnt there with him or for him in his last moments. I didnt get to hug him, say I love him, say goodbye. I learned trough a call. I dont think its something i'll get over from. When he needed his family, I wasn't there...

Mom showed me documents telling just how wide the cancer spread. It was in his bones (ribs, sternum, hip etc.)  lungs, kidneys and he developed tuberculosis. Perhaps there was more but neither she nor I was willing to read further

His funeral was today, and, as some cruel joke, it was also his 53rd birthday. It was first proper family funeral I was on. Many, many people came to say their goodbyes. From family, to friends, to ex-coworkers. Even the dickhead boss showed up.

I didnt break down until firefighters all lined up to salute him. I think it just finally hit me he wont get up to salute them back, he wont get up to hear me cry, apologize to him for not being there with him and to say how much I love him. I lost my dad

One of his long wishes was that before he'd be buried that he wishes his helmet back from his days as firefighter was nailed to the coffin, and his friends made sure it was fulfilled. 

I got to told him I love him this time. Wished him happy birthday.

"I had a few toxic relationships as a teenage and I ended up having a quite big depression and making a lot of things I regret. But after some time I wen therapy when I was 19 and after a year or so everything got much better. I started doing more sport, stopped eating meat, and tried to focus more on myself, how I am, the things I like and thw things I hadn't bothered to try.
Now I'm finishing my career, happy with myself, confident, and getting small achievements periodically. At 21 no more suicidal thoughs, self harm and crying till I sleep, I'm so proud if myself guys. I'll be engineer soon, learning my 4th language, orange belt in kickboxing and feeling how all the effort I've putting in myself, all the struggles I had for so long are crisalizing in what I looked for.

"Hi. Some nude photos/videos have been leaked on the internet. I did not consent to this, but I found out by being harassed by many social media follow requests. Then one day a user DMd me my own explicit photo. I reported this. But I kept getting more DMs until one person straight up told me they found my photos on the dark web along with my social media handles. Which by now they are on the regular internet. I think my Snapchat got hacked about 2 years ago because I remember this weird thing had happened to my account. So I'm assuming that's how it happened.
Because the only person I sent these to was my boyfriend which he did not do this to me. And I clearly had these photos saved in my Snapchat as well. I downloaded my Snapchat data and noticed a phone had logged onto my account in 2020.
(My password and 2 step verification has been changed since then so this can't happen again).
So my question is, should I tell my therapist this? I want to because it makes me feel depressed and horrible about myself. It makes me extremely stressed about my life and my career.

"I've only had two situationships (one black, one non-black hispanic) and hundreds of dating app interactions. The way those experiences reminded me of my status in the country's dating market was enough for me to peacefully bow out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not bitter because I know men can't control what makes them wanna put a ring on it and not string a woman along for sex, even if it does stem from aggressive outside influence.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not bitter because it turned out to be a major stress reliever that felt like an anvil being lifted from my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have to worry about scrolling through apps and seeing gross stereotypical sexual fantasies from all groups of non-black men and offers to be their black sidepiece if they're married. And black men having self-hating things on their profiles.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't miss not living up to racial sexual stereotypes like having a big butt and having it thrown in my face (the hispanic guy I dated specifically joked about me not having that all the time). And lots of guys on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble etc. constantly asking if I have a fat ass since all my pics were chest up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't miss needing a long straight weave to be attractive to a lot of black guys in my area and being invisible to them without one.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on, but this post would get too long.The point is that I feel much better about myself and happier all around when not dealing with men.

&amp;#x200B;

I care way more about keeping this feeling and peace than chasing the very slim chance of getting into a serious relationship or marriage that may be ok at best because the guy settled for me.

I want to know what‚Äôs wrong with me always. Learning that I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum was such a freeing, helpful discovery. But I didn‚Äôt expect or want this to be even on my radar.

"We‚Äôve been friends for two years, went through the ups and downs, all that. It was mostly fine until I moved away for college.

I moved around 2000 miles away from her. We obviously still kept in contact but with the friends I made at college, along with school and my own string of problems going on, it made it hard to keep in touch with everyone from home. I felt terrible for this, tried my best to talk to her regularly but I didn‚Äôt even talk to my family regularly either. 

She then made it a habit to call me an asshole every time I would talk to her after, saying I was giving her panic attacks, making her cry, that it was my fault she was upset, that her other friends were mad at me for doing this to her. I‚Äôd apologize over and over again, try to explain that it‚Äôs been hard keeping in contact with anyone being 2000 miles away + a two hour time difference. When I‚Äôd call her, we‚Äôd talk for hours and things would be fine but even the. the conversations would be littered with her saying that it was all my fault she wasn‚Äôt doing well. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôd never stop contacting longer than a couple days. 

Then, as I‚Äôve been struggling to find a new job and afford to eat, she started to send me money. I never asked her to, and told her repeatedly that she cannot send me money, she needs to stop, etc. I don‚Äôt like taking handouts, never have and never will. Regardless, she kept doing it anyway saying I couldn‚Äôt stop her so eventually I just gave up. They were never exorbitant amounts, around $20 every two weeks or so but regardless, I do not like taking money or anything from anyone as I do not want to owe anyone anything. Even if someone says I don‚Äôt owe them, something always comes around where they will change their minds and say I do. As expected, she did just that.

Very quickly, she used the money as a way to make me talk to her, saying I owe her since she pays me, or that she‚Äôs paying me to talk to her. I made it clear that I did not want her to send me money in the first place and she did not need to do this. She didn‚Äôt listen. 

When I came back home to visit for the holidays, everything seemed worse in person. She blamed me for everything that went wrong, ridiculed anything that went right, and guilted me into doing things I didn‚Äôt want to do by saying she could ‚Äúbring up traumas to make you feel bad and do anything‚Äù (that‚Äôs not paraphrased, she actually said that because I didn‚Äôt want to ice skate and she did). If I or my other friend did not go along with what she wanted, she‚Äôd get quiet, pouty, or angry and shut down. My other friend caught on to this quick and we both agreed that she was not fun to be around lately. She seem surprised when I put my foot down about ice skating and told her that she could not make me do anything, and quickly went into quiet mode. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. She‚Äôs been like this since a huge fight we had several months ago that we have since talked through and made up from. She used to be so nice to hang out with and I genuinely cherished her company but now‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just exhausted.

"Right before Christmas too! Go me!

It started because I had her Christmas present under my bed (unboxed - it's an item of furniture in a box too big to wrap, so I took the parts and instructions out and put them under my bed, and was going to build it overnight Christmas eve and surprise her with it that way). I asked her not to go under my bed. It's a storage bed, with bits of luggage, bedding etc stored under there, so it wouldn't be unreasonable of her to *want* to access under there, so I thought I would give her a heads up. 

Did she listen? No. 

Not only did she go under there, but she decided she absolutely MUST put some coats of hers under the bed, and the parts of her present were taking up space, so she just....took them out, dumped them at the foot of my bed. And unfortunately, in moving this flat pack nightmare, some parts have gone missing.

I was so angry when I saw. And it opened up a can of worms.

Because this isn't the first time something like this has happened. 

And the more I was thinking about it, the more upset I was getting, and the more things it was bringing up from some fucking DARK place inside of me. 

She never has respected my privacy or boundaries. She doesn't like it when other people do the same to me, but doesn't seem to grasp she is also guilty of it. She will frequently move things around in my drawers or wardrobe in the name of being ""tidy"". This has always been a thing. 

I am very precious about, and protective of, my space. Mostly because I don't have much of it. Sore point number two - I have never been allowed my own space for things. The wardrobes in my room as a child and teen? They were full of toiletries, or my mum and step dad's clothes. I had barely anywhere to put my things, least of all somewhere easily accessible and that I could be organised with. The space under my bed? Also for storing their things. I understand that I am often untidy, but it is usually because I have *nowhere to put my things*. I don't buy new things very often either - in fact, most of the clothes and knick-knacks I own are things given to me by my family as presents over the years - so if the issue is that I have *too much*, it is one of their own creation. 

I've always been made to feel like my things are in the way, and that I just have to slot around my family. I've been patient with it since moving back home, because none of us planned for me to have to move back in (there was nowhere available to rent and I'm currently in the process of buying a house) so of course there's not much room for me after they got used to me being gone for so long. 

But it's not a new thing. I've come home many times in the past to find she's been ""re-organising my drawers"". This is not helpful. I often end up losing things because they are no longer where I put them, and there are very personal items (yes, of THAT variety) I keep hidden in there that I very much don't want her to see, let alone be handling and moving around. 

The space thing extends to not being allowed to feel any kind of negative emotion, too, without being smothered and told to cheer up, like my depression or grief is an inconvenience. I lost my partner two years ago while I was staying with my folks for a summer placement, and the second I so much as started tearing up, my mum would be on me, telling me not to be sad, she hates to see me like this, it's time to move on, and so forth. I held onto that grief for so long, because I felt I couldn't express it. 

Things began to spiral then. Being made to feel like I'm not allowed my own space brought back more memories of always being told I was ""expensive"" and ""cost money"" as a kid. We didn't have much money. I was acutely aware of that - not only because my mum made sure to tell me that I 'didnt realise how much things cost!' but because there were several things I never got to do that my friends did (school trips, clubs etc) because we just couldn't afford it. I would have loved to have hobbies, join a club, learn an instrument, but I was scared to ask for anything because I was always being told I was costing too much. I often didn't get lunch because I felt guilty asking for both that and bus fare.  If I was sick? ""You're costing me time and money off work!"" If I took a slightly longer than normal shower one day? ""You're the reason our bills are so high!"" 

I had (still have, to be honest) an eating disorder because I was always scolded for not finishing what was on my plate and wasting it (even if it was too much for me to eat - I was not a fussy eater, there's just only so much I can fit inside me). So now I force myself to eat everything I'm served, and cannot stand to waste any food, ever. If it's on my plate, I will get it down, somehow. This has made me physically sick in the past and it's something I'm constantly trying to work on and get over. 

I have always tried to pay my way. I have always tried to be grateful, and show that gratitude in gifts and affection in return. When I ended up having to move back home, I started paying the bills. Not just my share, not only some of them - ALL the bills. Mortgage included (while also paying for my own on top). They needed a dental? Paid for, no questions. Car issues? Sorted. They have been helping me do up the place I bought which I am EXTREMELY thankful for and have been very verbal with this gratitude, and always told them that I don't expect any help and don't want them to exhaust themselves, but what they have done has been a great help.

My mum denies it all, of course. She never said those things to me. Just the same as she never said homophobic shit to me as a kid that made me terrified to come out to her in the end. Whether she meant the comments or not, they still stuck with me. Comments do.  

But I bring up some of this stuff when mum keeps pressing about things, why I'm so upset etc, ""what's she done wrong - she deserves to know!?"".  I tell her what's wrong, how she makes and has made me feel, and that I don't want to feel guilty for existing any more. 
Her response is a torrent of comments along the lines of ""I bend over backwards for you!"" and it culminated with her *starting* to say ""if you're not happy here, you can leave"", but I cut her off before she could finish, and simply said 'fine'.

And did that. 

Got in the car, left. 

My house has no bathroom. No hot water. It's all bare concrete and floorboards. But, it has a hob now, and a kettle, and cold running water from the kitchen tap. So I'm going to just move in now. I'll make do. I made do at uni, I can do it again. If it means I don't have my stuff rifled through, and don't have to feel guilty for merely existing and taking up basic resources in order to continue existing, then so be it. 

I love her. I love her so much. But I am so tired of being made to feel like my existence is a burden on people. I never asked to be born. Most days I wish I hadn't been. No matter what I do, it isn't good enough. So I'm just going to exist here, in my space. My OWN space. It's a fucking shit hole and I'm cold as hell, but it's mine, and no one can take that away from me or make me feel like I'm not allowed to be here.",Finally blew up on my mum about privacy,18n8jma,1703115166.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n8jma/finally_blew_up_on_my_mum_about_privacy/,

"Background: My company has projects which are joint ventures (where we partner with another company on a specific project) and I am a part of one of them. Due to the nature of the industry and some details I cannot get into, the joint venture project that I am working on (let's called that JV 1) cannot work with or share information with another joint venture (let's call that JV 2) despite both JV 1 and JV 2 having employees of the same parent company working on them.

The mistake: A colleague that I have known for a while at my parent company was working in another department unrelated to JV1 or JV2. He reached out to me for some information relating to the project (JV 1). I checked the org chart to make sure that he was not working on JV 2 and sent the information to him, thinking that it was for peer review purposes as we do a lot of that at our company (where we consult with other employees of the company to review details of a specific project). He has also been involved before in other peer reviews so I did not see any harm in sending it to him. He scheduled a meeting with me after I emailed him and in that meeting, he told me that he was moving to JV2 and his position is not official until Jan 2024. He did not disclose this to me when he asked me for the information. I immediately realized that I fucked up and disclosed to my superiors that this happened. 

I ended up replying to the email where I sent him the data stating that it should not be circulated and that he needs to delete it from his computer. He sent me an email back saying that it has been deleted and that JV2 will not use the data that I sent. He also mentioned that he did not ask for the data, when in reality, he did verbally and I have no record of that to prove it.

"Back in September I (M30) met, ""Katie"" (F20) through work.

We went out on a date in October after exchanging numbers and had a wonderful time. Between then and last Thursday (12/16) we flirted constantly, and finally hooked up last Thursday (just making out and feeling each other up).

While we were hooking up she told me she ""wants something more down the road"" because her ""life is chaotic"".

She called me last night telling me about how she can't string me along, and now it's very doubtful there will be anything beyond friendship in the future since she's getting back with her ex who she's broken it off with at least 8 times, and has hit her. I told her I couldn't just forget what we had done and move on. For me it isn't that simple.

This was the first time I'd ever been physically intimate with anyone. I feel like I was led on, and used for someone else's emotional and physical gratification. Not only do I feel that, but I also am deeply insulted by the idea that I just forget what I think was a wonderful first time experience. A memory that is now shattered because I can't see Katie in the way that I used to. She told me ""I want to give us a chance but I can't."" and that ""You make me feel things that he doesn't. I feel heard, cared for, you're sweet to me, etc.""

What hurts the most though, is that throughout last night's phone call she repeatedly begged me to not feel bad, and ""please don't be upset."" As if I should just ignore my own feelings.

Not only do I feel used, lied to, and manipulated I am absolutely livid.

If this situation wasn't bad enough. I work with her.

I told a few of my friends about this, all of them think I should at least be there as a friend who can support her since it's very clear the only ""man"" who has ever been there for her is her highly abusive ex.

I'm really not sure what to do, but I do know that I'll feel guilty if I abandon someone who up until now has been nothing but kind to me, and has never gotten mad or upset at me.

However, I recently came to a conclusion that I should stop having sex for the rest of my life and just stick to masturbation. And it changed my life for the better.

"TL;DR My boyfriend wants to give up on our relationship because he feels like his needs aren‚Äôt being met and mine are more important. but I want to keep fighting for it. I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll ever find someone like him. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. Past 2 years we were in an LDR. He just told me how he feels like his needs aren‚Äôt being met and that he‚Äôs lost himself in this relationship. He said he felt like he‚Äôs just been compromising so much of himself the past year and trying to find a way to make it work. He feels like he‚Äôs given up so much but it never seems to be enough. Even when i tried to be hopeful and offer concrete next steps on how to address our problems, he said that the overall feeling is still just sadness and constant pain.  

This is first relationship and he says he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even justified feeling like this and maybe he and I need to mature more. He says maybe we can find our way back together in the future. He‚Äôs never been the one to initiate talks of possible break ups. It happened maybe once only before. So i know its very serious this time 

 I want to make it work cause I agree with alot of what he said. I really haven‚Äôt been my best self and I‚Äôve been selfish alot this year because of some personal stuff. But i wanted next year to be different. I even went to therapy for my own issues. He‚Äôs the love of my life and I don‚Äôt think I can ever be with someone like him. All my past relationships feel nothing like this. But I feel like even when I tell him these things, he‚Äôs already given up. 

We‚Äôre on a cool off now and we‚Äôll take on the 27th. But it already feels like its dead.

"So this is kinda like a trauma dumb of my life to anybody that will listen.

All my life I have always been considered ugly and unattractive. I have always been overweight and jelouse of other girls. 

I was the type of girl that the boys would laugh at in school and the type of girl that the girls were glad they never turned out to be.

When I was young I went online to find validation from strangers on the Internet and I sure found it. I was groomed into a relationship with another person for 6 years. I'm now out of that relationship and I feel so lost.

I feel like she was the only person that could ever love me, I developed an dependance on her and even now she's gone. Nobody has ever shown me love and been interested in me like she has before, she used to tell me me I was a godess and that I was a 10/10 and that I could get anybody I wanted but she was very far from truth. She moved in with her roomate and started telling me that she was attracted to him and have been flirting back and forth before I broke it off. She told me today that's a girl asked her out on a date I have nobody.

I developed bulimia nervosa and I still havnt lost any weight and I hate myself for it. I met a guy at work that I liked and I actually thought I might have a chance with him but I was wrong he wanted his ex and she's really pretty, like godess pretty.

I know it doesn't apply to all of them, but, that was my rule.Fast forward early this year he (2 years younger) asked me out and I thought, okay what the heck. It's just beers. The date was decent and relaxing. So we kept going on dates. He seemed like such a gentleman and a romantic. He would drive around town (I like the spontaneity), go to random hipster cafes and bars, watch the sunset etc. Well, months later you might be able to guess, that all wears off. I see the red flags everywhere. He refuses to communicate for once. When i try to have a conversation, he immediately goes ""Im not having this conversation"". I found out recently that he also lied to me about his past - he said he had cheated once, 5 years ago, but I found there were actually multiple instances. He also just doesn't put in any effort. He sleeps over my place a lot. He doesnt offer to chip in. He expects food from me without paying for any of it, but when we go out for dinner, he immediately wants me to pay for my half like 15 seconds after he pays for the bill. When he's sick I took care of him - he very rarely says thank you. I ask him please will you at least clean up after yourself, I do the cooking and washing, you can throw away your own used snotty napkins. Instead he criticised how my apartment wasn't that tidy anyway to begin with, so why am I so ""triggered"" (I'm a depressed person, but I go to work, and I come home and I have to make dinner for myself AND him, and after all that I barely have any energy left and my bad for thinking SURELY he understands that).So, I guess Im just really, reaally exhausted right now.

"This is the brief story of an agoraphobic friend who got lost inside her own head: why must the best people suffer? The people who deserve the most love and kindness in this world seem to be the ones who end up with the short side of the stick every time. Life is unfair to say the least. Let‚Äôs get into it:  
I woke up with a few plans to get things done today: catch up on laundry, clean the floors, go over to the parents for a coffee, do  groceries, and maybe get some writing done. I woke up at 9:30am, made my coffee, sat down at the kitchen table at 9:45 and haven't got up once yet, it's now 1pm. I scrolled, I jotted notes down about things I read online, I read a couple pages of a book, but I mostly just sat here in a daze, gazing out the window like a lost puppy. My mind can't focus on anything because it keeps bringing me back to Kate.    
  
 Kate is my girl that I hadn't seen in a while (close to two years) who gave me a surprise visit a couple days ago. I used to see her a lot more, even when she was diagnosed with agoraphobia, I was the only friend she allowed into her apartment. I brought her a coffee and a bagel almost every morning because I knew she was the kind of person who needed a routine, as well as a feeling of safety, knowing someone is always there for her. If not she would unravel it seemed.    
  
 I brought her groceries, books, clothes, the little things, anything she needed. I even made more late night liqour store runs than I can count. Her need for numbing herself seemed to increase as the years went on.    
  
 When she asked me one morning not to come I was a little worried but I let it slide, she needed alone time that day, everything was good. The next day she said the same thing and even after me insisting I stop by, she didn't allow it. She seemed angry, so I left it alone. The whole week she told me not to come, until I made my own decision to pick up a few basic supplies and go drop them off. She had to be getting low on food, and toilet paper I didn't care what she said, I was going to see her.    
  
 When I got there I heard moaning, and whining it sounded like, coming from the other side of her door. Then muffled whispers. I knocked a few times before I used my key to let myself in. Kate was on the floor in a fetal position, rocking back and forth whining and whispering to herself, her fingernails making their way from her cheeks to her neck, tearing her skin apart, drawing a unexpected amount of blood for just fingernails.    
  
 I thought maybe she had hurt herself real bad so I ran over to her. She belted out something incoherent when she lifted her head to look at me, while she continued to scratch at her face. I bent down to help her up and she scratched at me too, and almost hissed it seemed like. Then she put her hands over her ears and kept screaming ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" repeatedly, at the top of her lungs. I told her the neighbors were going to call the cops soon. I guess she really didnt want to deal with other people so she eventually calmed down after about five minutes straight of this.    
  
 When she seems to be in a rational mindset again she looks at me so calmly and says ""Why are you still here? I don't want you here, I don't need anybody. I want to sit here and rot in my pity until this suffering ends. I need you to go and promise me you wont come back."" As her friend that has been by her side since the fifth grade, I was shocked and saddened. I thought things would get better as we got older and she realized there was a whole world out there with no reason for us to be defined by our past. For her, everything seemed to get worse with time.    
  
 I wasnt just going to walk out of that apartment and never look back. I stayed and tried to reason with her, tried to see where this sudden darkness was coming from. She told me to just let her go, there is no hope for her now and there never will be. She talked of her tortured mind, the whispers, the demons and the walking nightmares. She lived in a bubble of her past. She could not let go.    
  
 Eventually she started screaming again and clawing at her face. She threw a remote, a fork and glass my way, missing every time. I tried to calm her down but when she put a knife to her wrist threatening to kill herself if I didnt leave right then, I panicked and proceeded to leave. I asked her to promise me she wouldnt hurt herself if I did leave and I used the guilt card because I know it would make a difference when it came to Kate. Letting people down was something too hard for her to bare. So I told her I would never forgive her if she harmed herself.    
  
 I called her later that day, she seemed to be back to her normal self except the melancholy in her voice was deeper it seemed. She apologized but told me she wanted to do this on her own from now on, she had to prove to herself she is a worthy being capable of living her life without a babysitter. She needed to feel like she had some sort of purpose. At first I got a little mad at her and told her that I didn't care what she wanted because I know what she needs. She spends most of her time alone already, living with her nightmares. I couldn't imagine her being okay with being alone all the time.   
  
 Eventually she convinced me that she really was okay and she knows she needs this to be the next step in her journey. She was done with living in the past. Kate was ready to get back out there and was actually making the first step? If me stepping back helps get that done in anyway, I was all for it. I told her I'd still be calling to check up though and possibly drop off some goods and leave them outside her door. She told me not to but I did anyway.   
  
 At first I called her every day but as time went on the calls got shorter, and she answered them less. Any time I did talk to her though she seemed as if she was getting better each phone call. Almost as if she just didnt want me in her life anymore and was doing great without me. She told me she was making slow steps in leaving the house at least once a day. I took her word for her it although hard to believe.    
  
 I've stopped by her apartment with coffee, bagels, croissants, muffins, and even her favorite candies and she never let me in. Sometimes I'd get to see her eye poking through the peek hole, but she never opened the door for me. She hardly even spoke to me through the door. After a year of pleading and begging for her to let me see her, I really did step back. I gave her space. I still called but eventually she stopped answering, and soon after the number had been disconnected altogether. This was after about a year and six months of not seeing her. I got worried not knowing her situation so I went to her apartment looking for her, for the landlord to tell me she moved out five months ago now. He didn't know where she was going and couldnt tell me even if he did. Confidentiality. I tried to pay him off incase he really did know, to no avail.    
  
 I went home and spent the day trying to find her online as well as call anyone close to her to see if they had seen her. No one has seen her nor heard from her. She didn't have many people in her life, her mom died at a young age and dad left so she was put into the system. The only ""parents"" she does know were abusive emotionally, psychically and sexually. I knew she would never call them for any help so I didnt even bother. I called up her foster brother Abel and he said he hasn't heard from her in years. They had a blow up a few years back and never reconciled.    
  
 I decided I should call the police. They told me that she was a grown woman and was aloud to do whatever it was she wanted. They checked her records and seen that she was still using her credit cards, but failed to tell me where because ""confidentiality."" I guess I could be an axe murderer looking for one specific girl to kill? It pissed me off either way. Kate pissed me off more, how could she be so selfish? Until I seen her again, she knew all I would do is worry.    
  
 What the hell was she doing? She needed me, I was all she had. Like I said the only ""family"" she had was her emotionally abusive foster mother who used to degrade her everyday, embedding the words useless, ugly, disappointment, loser and more into her young mind.  Her bedtime stories were of demons and serpents taking over her mind and life because she was good for nothing, a waste of space. Stories of how she would end up a hooker or dead in a cold alleyway with the stray dogs feasting on her. At least she would be good for something, her mother would tell her: feeding the starving dogs. Stories about how no one would ever love her or miss her. Then she had her foster father who was the friendliest guy in the world but liked to make his little girl ""feel good"" he would say. But it had to be their little secret. Fucking disgusting. She never told me this until a few years ago.    
  
 She had Abel, they were close growing up but it seemed he started to feel estranged from Kate the more neurotic and angry she got as the years went on. They seemed to drift apart and then had a falling out that neither of them cared to fix.    
  
 Kate and I had our group of friends growing up but she was always indifferent to us. She was a loner and most of the time would try to stick to herself. I forced her to go out and participate in activities. I never realized until now when I look back, how much sadness Kate carried around with her. She was the kindest person I have ever met, with a heart of gold. The kind of kid who would squish herself up against the door in a 3 seater car seat, so that the other people sitting with her would be comfortable. The kind of girl who would step over an ant or release a spider instead of killing it. Any room she was in she was always trying to make sure everyone was comfortable and content. She cared so much for every living thing, to never get any good in return but she tried so hard to keep her spirits up for years. But looking back I see now, she was fighting a losing battle with herself.    
  
 After high school Kate eventually met a guy who showed all the signs of prince charming. He treated her like gold at first until the hitting started. And the emotional abuse. He was slowly grooming her and programming her mind to believe that what he was doing wasnt wrong and that she deserved it. This went on for years, and she never told anyone. She was a good actress.    
  
 She bent over backwards for this guy as he slept around on her, didnt call some nights leaving her hanging and worried she had did something to upset him and that she would lose him. He made her abort a baby convincing her she was unfit to be a mother, and that the kid would come out a devil child. He held a power over her. She felt like needed his approval in order to be looked at as a worthy woman. When he eventually left, telling her that all she was a rag doll with no spine or guts, trash and unlovable to any respected man, she retreated from the world.    
  
 That's when she stayed in her apartment most days only leaving to go to her publishing job where she sat in an office by herself until her shift ended and she headed back home. After a few months of this, she realized how much safer the world was inside these four walls. ""No one can hurt me now don't you see? And I cant hurt anyone but myself in here."" I remember her telling me all those years ago. I thought it was just a phase. A year and a half later she was diagnosed with agoraphobia. It wasnt a phase.   
  
 At twenty-three, after three years of hiding out she developed lupus, a disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs (autoimmune disease). She started drinking heavily. And medicating herself. She was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety which only seemed to numb her fully. I was slowly losing my Kate. She got better one year, worse the next, good for a month, bad for five. I was used to it. Until all this happened and she cut me out of her life completely and went and did God knows what.    
  
 After trying for a couple weeks trying to figure out her whereabouts, I slowly started to come to terms with it. People come and people go, its life. If I wasnt beneficial to her journey anymore and she needed to cut me out, I get it. That was her decision and it was selfish of me to try to force myself on her. I let her go, and there was silence between us for close to two years. I only hoped she was doing good and hopefully living her best life.    
  
 Two days ago when she showed up unexpectedly, she proved the opposite. Her eyes were sunken in, her skin purple and thin. Her hair was matted in three different places, her clothes old looking and battered, and she smelt like she's been sleeping in a dumpster. I'm not sure what the look on my face portrayed to her but as quick as she came, she was trying to turn around and leave again mumbling about how shes a fuck up for coming, she should have never disturbed my life again, shes a loser, a waste of space. She started hitting herself in the head until I grabbed her and held her close.    
  
 My Kate, I missed her so much. I failed to help her and shes gotten herself into this mess, what kind of friend am I? I should have never let her do it on her own. When I was hugging her the waterworks started pouring out of me. I failed her. I wiped off my tears and brought her inside.    
  
 The look in her eyes broke my heart. She wasn't Kate anymore. She didn't have one sign of light left in her. It's as if she went to go live the life she was told she was destined to live.    
  
 People who live soft can be undone by beasts. People who live along the beasts have the advantage. Kate could never move in unsion with these monsters who called themselves human. She could never wrap her mind around how people could be so monstrous, over the years it broke her. Now more than ever it seemed. I seen no hope in her eyes.    
  
 I sat her down at the kitchen table and asked her where she had been. She wasnt ready to talk yet but I could tell she had so much to say. I didnt push her, instead I asked her if she wanted something to eat or if she wanted to take a hot bath and relax. She agreed to the bath, I offered her a glass of red which she gladly accepted and she soaked in the bath for close to an hour.    
  
 When she got out she looked a little livelier. A little bit more color in her face. I poured her another glass of merlot, knowing I didn't even have to ask. I poured myself one as well, preparing myself for the turn of events I was about to hear. I turned the voice recorder on my phone on just in case something happened. She didnt look or seem like Kate anymore and it worried me a little, I'm not gonna lie.   
  
 She shared nothing of where she has been, instead she said ""I'm done Kay, this is it. I wanted to say goodbye."" I tried to interrupt her and ask her what she meant, but she kept going before I could.    
  
 ""In a dream my instinct for survival told me to keep going, to find a place to hide. I've learned along my journey not to trust the shadows and the ghosts but it is becoming harder. And there is no where to hide. All of it is becoming increasingly harder. Everything. I'm exhausted. I sold my soul to sickness and painkillers long ago. I have become a hostile, irrational then rational, agreeable then insulting, passive aggressive, cruel, sadistic, deeply disturbed type of person. I don't know where I am or who I am anymore. Despair, agony and pain runs through every vein. I try to move on but the weight of the world gets stronger everyday. Each road marked by false signs, happiness for me, Kay, is a distant relative. I see other people able to fight off the dark and really live their lives but me,  I'm stuck and I envy the ones who aren't. Envy and resentment are terribly corrosive passions and I am destroying myself with this and everything else that kills me. I am an enemy of human happiness, a curse upon the human race and for once and for all, I'm done. I just wanted to let you know that if it wasn't for you, I'd be done long ago.""    
  
 I actually let her get all that out before speaking up. I seen that her hands were both sitting on the table in front of her, therefore I didnt expect her to do anything irrational like pull out a damn knife or gun or anything crazy. Then I said ""Okay Kate let's be rational here. Let's be smart. What are you going to do? Stop this nonsense talk, you are going to stay here with me for a bit and we will figure it out together."" Although my plan was to get her into a suicidal prevention place or a mental ward I guess you'd call it, I wasnt going to tell her that right at this moment.    
  
 ""No, I knew you would try to convince me but this is it Kay! This is it!! Stop!"" She started smashing her fists over her head harder than I've ever seen her do. She was causing damage probably internally she wasnt hitting so hard. She pulled out a razor blade attached to some sort of plastic, (looking like a shiv you would see in prison) and held it up to her neck. She was crying hysterically. ""I'm done Kay I'm sorry I dont want to do this here though, so just let me go."" She knew I wasnt going to let her go anywhere. Either she was taking her life right there in front of me or she wasnt doing it at all. I was scared to approach her.   
  
 She was shaking like a leaf and looked like she was out of her mind completely. She dropped the blade unexpectedly after about three minutes of threatening to hurt herself or me if I didnt let her leave. I ran up to the blade, put it on the counter far away from her and held her close as she leaked tears and boogers all over my sweater. I called the cops with my right hand over her shoulder and hung up right away, knowing they would come but also not wanting Kate to know I called.    
  
 Kate was at a loss for words, a little angry it seemed but submissive when they got there. She didn't say much after that. She was restrained for safety measures and put in the back of the cop car. I asked if I could follow behind they said it was fine they took her to the hospital where we all went in together and she was admitted into the mental health facility in the section D of the hospital. Just until they could figure out if she is in need of real, paid help and they would send her somewhere better.    
  
 I went out and bought her coffee and a bagel from her favorite bakery, I stopped for some goodies at the store: all her favorite snacks and treats. I grabbed some of her favorite books from my place and I also picked up a few sudoku and crossword books to distract her mind a little. Kate was heavily medicated when I got there to drop off the stuff. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and headed out.    
  
 This all happened two days ago now. I am going to try my best to visit her every day and the days I cant, I will call her. My main goal in life right now is get my girl Kate back on her feet.    
  
 Why is it that depression takes over the best people? The ones with the biggest hearts who would go to the end of the earth to make even a stranger happy. Why couldn't life even out a little bit, give us a little bit more fair times and less unfair ones? The saying goes ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" but no, how about ""what doesn't kill you makes you emotionally traumatized and damaged for years to come unless you have a strong enough mind power to overcome the bullshit.""    
  
 Life is just unfair sometimes and its unfortunate to say the least.. I just want Kate, for once in her life to find some form of her own twisted happiness is this chaotic, sometimes confusing like world.","Story of a friend who suffers from crippling anxiety, depression &amp; agoraphobia who got lost inside her own head",18n7bfa,1703111857.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n7bfa/story_of_a_friend_who_suffers_from_crippling/,

I genuinely want to be done with drinking cuz it always gets me sick and I get I chose to go out and that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm feeling sick. it‚Äôs just hard to say no sometimes especially when I don‚Äôt see my cousin often, once every couple years. 

the thing i‚Äôm really dreading is the combo of my family on xmas / xmas eve and a dinner/sleepover i‚Äôm supposed to have with my friends from middle school. i‚Äôm trying to appreciate these things I guess too cuz I will more likely miss them next year in my airline job. that‚Äôs basically the only reason why I said yes to the middle school friend thing (we are all early 20s now).

I know I sound like a mess, i‚Äôm just trying to sort out my thoughts here.

"Living in Germany and having traveled to many countries, I made the decision to temporarily move to Poland with the assumption that it would be relatively similar to other EU nations. However, my expectations were shattered  because of the numerous culture shocks and unexpected challenges which made me feel incredibly depressed.

Before diving into my rant, I want to make clear that the issues which annoy me are from my personal perspective and also about the general atmosphere/ the way the country is run and not a reflection on all Polish people. I have made some amaazing polish friends and it's an enormous country,  so it won't be the same everywhere.

Firstly, the customer service. Unlike in Germany, where it's customary to engage in kind interactions with a subtle smile, in Poland, the atmosphere is completely neutral, and devoid of any display of emotion.
I have gotten used to this neutral demeanor, but it's not uncommon either to encounter extreme rudeness, just because the person youre talking to is having a bad day and doesn't want to be approached by anyone even if it's their job.

Polish social dynamics show a preference for close circles of friends and family, with a noticable avoidance of interacting with strangers, going as far as not caring if someone were to collapse on the street. And the lack of patience for foreigners attempting to speak Polish slowly also doesn't make you feel very welcomed.

There's also this pretty unsettling vibe when you're outside with aggressive drunk people causing a scene. I mean, seeing a drunk peeing in public at a busstop during the day? That's something I've never seen before. And the driving scene here, non-stop honking just for sticking to speed limits‚Äîit adds to this feeling that people here are a bit more on edge.

A prevailing ""I don't care"" attitude and ignoring regulations seems to be manifesting in different ways. City full of snow in winter, no street cleanup for days. I almost broke my foot on the icy, lumpy sidewalks. Landlords commonly ignore tenant issues and my workplace neglects concerns like a mouse infestation in our cafeteria. 

Another noticable aspect is the perpetual victim mentality that is displayed, either in personal life(complaining) or when it comes to politics. Some harbor eternal grudges against neighboring countries which they use as an excuse to be prejudiced and hateful and some still talk about demanding reparations from historical wars, despite ongoing financial support from Germany/ The EU in the amount of billions of Euros.

Additionally, Poland's strong Christian values manifest in a concerning level of homophobia. While I respect individual choices based on religious beliefs and I understand more traditional mindsets, the extent of hostility towards the LGBT community surpasses anything I've seen before.

"I've been with my SO for 5 years. His parents are divorced and he's looooooow contact with his mother because of unending mental abuse. He's an only child, so aside from his 1 cousin, his Dad and stepmom are his only family. Obviously those relationships are very important to him.   

When I met his dad for the first time I got that yucky pit-of-your-stomach stranger danger feeling. Like, instantly. He didn't do anything to warrant this feeling. He was friendly, polite, welcoming... but my guts were telling me to stay away.   

Unfortunately over these 5 years, the feeling hasn't gone away. His family hugs hello and goodbye like a lot of friends/family do and I hate hugging him. I feel gross, dirty and extremely uncomfortable. When he talks to me, I try my best to politely leave the conversation. The worst is if he compliments me. He said I looked ""radiant"" once when we were all at a holiday party and I felt disgusted and ashamed.  

The man has never done an inappropriate thing to me at any point and I cannot shake this way of feeling. 

It would devastate my SO if I said anything, especially since there's no merit - it's just a feeling. Nobody knows how I feel and fortunately I'm able to hide my feelings so nobody has picked up on it.

"The guy I have been with has had a girlfriend from one year and throughout his whole relationship he has been texting me to meet up and suggested an affair. 

I met him before he met this girl. We hooked up once and then cut contact on good terms because I wanted a fwb with the actual friendship and he only wanted to hookup with me. 
We ran into each other one day 1 month later and kept contact again eventually hooking up. At that point I think he had already dated the girl. The second time we met I noticed him getting distant so I asked if he is dating sb, yes, but they are not  official. So I agreed to meet again. 

One week later they were official, instagram posts, getting to know each others friends etc..i dont have instagram but I knew he was active there so I checked his profile time to time. Naturally I pulled away and just wished him good luck.

Thing is , even after becoming official he kept texting me. And I obvs replied too
That went on for around half a year, he asking to meet and me refusing and not really pushing it, tho I did get curious why he wanted to cheat. He was so eprsistent and obsessed which I cant comprehend. Sex was great and we did what he admitted he didnt do with his gf but I still found him too fond of me, considering we never dated. I decided to meet and later accept to have sex with him again. I obviously am sorry for the girl, she has no idea this has happened. I just felt much worse refusing than I did cheating...as I just wanted to take that much time I could have with him and enjoy it, if that makes sense. 

I am a hard working girl and have a stable family and all so I am not doing this from a neagtive mindset, and am totally aware of what I did/do. 
I think I just like this guy so much physically tho and maybe even have some feelings for him,  I cannot explain why because I cant stand his attitude and that he is so dishonest.
He has never really given me anything more than sex or conversation and we didn't spend time doing other activites which I needed at this point in my life. 
I live abroad away from all my relatives and want to give and recieve some love. 
I can't stop checking his insta and updates and it always disappoints me to see how superficially he posts about their trips and hieks etc. I guess I am the only person who knows this

I feel sad that I can't get to enjoy time with him as I want to tho I know he doesn't appreciate me. 
We have talked about it and he is in a very messy place mentally and in every way so I don't take anything personally and try not to get offended. After all people are who they are and I am not gonna fight it. 

I must admit tho I find myself wondering how someone can be so sneaky and stay in a relationship started with cheating and think about cheating the whole time and cheat and still stay. I know I just need to be alone and not damage other people, and I literally am so alone haha. I jist cant get myself to meet new people.

He is gonna move to another city for work and I know I will move on but I am finding this knowledge a bit heavy and I feel bad to be part of something he might remember with regret, as I really poured my heart as innocently as possible.

"I(22m) have no emotional/mental support system. I have noone I can confide things about except myself. Noone I can call anytime and say I'm not doing ok, and they'd reply. Maybe it's because I'm a guy.

I've gone through 3 years of this since my break up with my ex. I haven't been able to open up to people. And it's not entirely my fault. Most of the friendships (interpersonal relationships) ive had with people have resulted in them getting to know my issues, ghosting/ignoring/blocking or sometimes even gaslighting me.


As a result I've come to be insanely insecure of whom I reveal my true self and feelings to. It gets hard sometimes and I just feel like shit.

Smoking and drinking help ease that pain and the feeling. It stops me from feeling or thinking about it. I like getting high to make me forget. I am drunk even as I write this. So I apologize if it comes through as deceitious.

"I'll start by stating that this isn't exactly my story but that of a friend. I'm unsure about how to handle this information. 

My friend has been dating her boyfriend for a bit over a year, and recently, they hit a major roadblock. Though she didn't reveal the cause, it was clear to everyone that they were in a rough patch, mostly on his end. She tried talking to him, but he consistently ignored her efforts. He removed her from his social media and avoided being around her. I felt it wasn't my place to interfere, so I didn't bring it up with her since she didn't seem inclined to discuss it either.

After a while rumors started to spread at our school that she cheated on her boyfriend with the guy who filmed her and sent it to her boyfriend, and that's why they're not on speaking terms anymore. The guy who supposedly raped her was an EX boyfriend. She confirmed that this was true, and everyone was really shocked, since we all knew she really loved him (or so we thought). After she confirmed the rumors we were more hesitant to talk to her since that behavior was not something we wanted to associate ourselves with, and that's when she claimed that it wasn't consensual and she was raped because she was high.

According to her, she invited her EX to her house at midnight while she was home alone to talk and get closure from their past relationship, and she ""didn't intend to do anything with him"".  
This situation has become incredibly controversial and intricate. Here's what I know:

1. She messaged this guy behind her boyfriends back, and invited him to her house while she was home alone at midnight.
2. She often refers to feeling loopy or slightly giggly as being ""high."" She usually claims this after taking a singular hit from a vape, possibly seeking attention. While it's plausible she was genuinely affected, it's more likely she was just slightly loopy based on what I've seen from her. 
3. Her story completely changes only after we started to push her away from our friend group for her actions.
4. There's a video allegedly showing her being assaulted that was sent to her boyfriend. Logically, it raises questions about why someone committing such a crime would record it and then send such incriminating evidence. I just find a hard time believing this happened.
5. She absolutely REFUSES to go to the police about the situation, despite the fact that she has supposed video proof this happened.
6. Her boyfriend who has seen the video, is still not interested in continuing a relationship with her because he is still claiming she cheated on him. If that video really was of her being violated, would he really maintain his belief she's a cheater?
7. She has a history of repeatedly cheating in relationships. 

This is why I'm finding it hard to trust her. While it's important to believe the victim, considering what I know about her, I, and others in my group, are struggling to believe her story.

"So my (22F) friend (21F) has been thrown around homes constantly all her life. Recently, her sister kicked her out, and then her aunt kicked her out too, all this year. She had until the 27th to leave her aunts, she had no where else to stay, and she ended up saying that some guy she‚Äôs ‚Äúknown for many months‚Äù offered her a place with him in North Carolina. We‚Äôre from the Midwest, so that‚Äôs really far. 

Of course, this worried me, and her family was worried too, but I trusted that she knew this guy and that all was fine. I just wanted her to have a place to stay and not be on the streets somewhere. That is however, until she mentioned that she met this guy (Allegedly, 20M) a little over a week ago, on OMEGLE of all places, and that they were ‚Äúdeeply in love‚Äù. Now, she is bipolar and this has happened before with her and guys so of course I‚Äôm calling bullshit on her. It never ends well. Yet, she already had her plane ticket and all her shit packed. She‚Äôs stubborn and I‚Äôm sure she would have found a way to go anyway, even if I had told her family the truth. 

I had told her to sleep on it until the very last possible moment, but she already left today. She‚Äôs there now. 

I‚Äôve also talked with her brother (20M) who said that he had actually offered to get an apartment with her. He had the money for it, even showed me his bank account with it all, yet apparently she didn‚Äôt believe him. Either that, or I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs just so obsessed and ‚Äúin love‚Äù with this stranger that she denied her own flesh and blood. 

This brother was her other best friend, other than me. Both of us are baffled as to what she‚Äôs thinking and we‚Äôre terrified that she‚Äôs going to be kidnapped, murdered, or god forbid something worse. Her whole family was questioning her about it, but they believe the lie that she‚Äôs known this guy for a while now. Nope, barely been 2 weeks.

I feel guilty about not saying the truth to the rest of her family. Her brother knows, but even he said he‚Äôs not sure there could be anything done to stop her from going anyway. And preferably, we don‚Äôt want to look like the villains to her. She was already arguing with me about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúunsupportive‚Äù because I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs in love with this guy, and same with him.

"Hi, this is stressing me out and I need to know for sure if what I did was grooming or not.

For context, this happened years ago, this was during a time where I was always high out of my mind and had no filter or good judgement, I was nearing my mid 20s when the situation occurred, I was in pg13 gaming communities so it wasn't unusual for me to befriend teenagers and interact with minors; these interactions have always been age appropriate, I never discussed sexual topics with any of these minors nor ever intended to. I want to add that a majority of my close friends were adults of my age.

I was added to a server by a mutual friend who happened to be an older teenager, they were friends with other friends of mine who are adults too, they mentioned someone who drew my character being in that server and as a result I wanted to get to know them since I'm also an artist myself and honestly really loved their artworks, they then inform me the individual is 12 but since I was always around kids and teens due to the communities I was around I didn't see that as an issue, and due to being high out of my mind almost 24/7 at the time I failed to see the problem they were raising to me.

I joined the server, started talking with the people there and the 12 yo posted artworks and talking about w/e stuff a 12 yo talks about, I found their demeanor adorable the same way a child can be adorable, but I was too high to realise that repeatedly saying this compliment to a 12 yo would be extremely weird and raising red flags. I realised afterwards this is something best kept to myself.

There was never any intents of being sexual or trying to manipulate them in any form, none of the conversations were sexual or even close to, I never privately messaged them and when they left the server exclaiming to be uncomfortable it's only then I realised why; although they had not removed me from their friend list either (although when I mass nuked my friend list they were removed then) I did think of apologizing to them but I didn't want to put them in a position where they'd be isolated with me, and plus how do you explain to a 12 yo as an adult that you were constantly on drugs and didn't realise you were doing something offputting? 
Their reaction to leave was appropriate, I dont believe the risk of being preyed on is worth it; they didn't know my intents and shouldn't have risked it.

I won't argue that this isn't weird and concerning, because it is, if I saw an adult do these things I too would be concerned and investigate, but my stance has always been unless there's solid evidence of anything sexual going on then it's innocent until proven guilty, I would still talk to the adult about their behaviour. 
I admit that being high on drugs around minors was extremely wrong and inappropriate and it is something that has never happened again since.

But was I grooming this kid and didn't even realise it? Am I a predator? I'm scared I might be, I'm scared they may say something and people thinking I had sinister intents, I wouldn't fault the minor for speaking up; they need to keep themselves safe, but I feel like if there was no sexual intents and no intent to manipulate then I'm in the clear but, i don't know, this is heavy on my mind and I don't know what to think.",I'm worried I may have groomed someone without realizing it,18n53qx,1703106073.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n53qx/im_worried_i_may_have_groomed_someone_without/,

So I had a date who within the first 10 minutes, started messaging a friend when we were stood in a queue to buy coffee. I done all the heavy lifting in terms of conversation, and he rarely asked me anything. Whenever I did speak, he would be looking around. I also wasn‚Äôt attracted to him, he wasn‚Äôt engaging or funny etc. 


It‚Äôs made me think back to a guy I went on dates with last year, who was so good looking, funny, complimentary, used to do nice things and it‚Äôs made me wonder whether I‚Äôve messed things up. However, I need to think back to the fact that I asked him to stop something in bed (which he ignored) and I witnessed him getting in a bad mood for a long time about a relatively small inconvenience and wouldn‚Äôt really look at me when I tried talking to him etc. He also said things like he‚Äôd hit me if I done something (which I assumed was a joke) and called other people names etc. I also saw that he had a lot of friend suggestions that were scantily clad women which was questionable. However, I just remind myself that if he liked me enough then it wouldn‚Äôt have ended and also remind myself of the things I‚Äôve just mentioned too.

"I was referring to that story about these five children that were burned alive in a house, and I started thinking about 'Natural Selection.' They ranged between 4-13 y.o. Now a 4 year old cannot do anything obviously, but an 11 and 13 year old can easily break the bedroom window and jump onto the garage roof and jump down from that as well. Even if they suffer a fractured rib, a broken arm or a broken leg, hey you know what? At least they would still be alive and not die in the most fucked way possible.

I started crafting theories as to what happened here.

1: They were all asleep at the same time while the dad was out shopping but they burned to death in their sleep as the smoke asphyxiated them so they were unconscious.

2: They couldn't see which way anything was, fire smoke burns the fuck out of your eyes so you can't see anything, then they might've met their fates unfortunately.

3: They were too sheltered to even conceive a plan to break the bedroom window and jump out.

I don't know about you, but I'd much rather deal with a neck and back injury than to burn. But that's just me I guess. Guess they chose the fire route.

Police said ""they had no chance of surviving"" how? Unless their bedrooms had no windows in it, then that would make sense. But they had fucking windows. The fire started from downstairs, and granted it blocked their only exit from the house, but they couldn't come up with a new exit strategy?

I'm telling you man, these new fucking generations. No comprehension skills, no survival skills and you can just tell they were tiktok, ipad/iphone children.

"Hi, I (f, 22) keep wondering if anyone can relate to this experience.
TW: mental&amp; physical (+sexual) abuse, suicide thoughts (briefly)

I had a childhood friendship that was both mentally and physically abusive and it basically stole my entire childhood.

She and I went to the same kindergarten together and I don't have many memories from that time. After that I went to a different preschool than her so we were separated for some time but we eventually landed on the same school in the same class in first grade.

I don't exactly remember how our constellation became so toxic. I was always very emotionally sensitive (i get somatic responses to other peoples emotional outbursts) and my parents were getting divorced at the time. I had no idea how to cope with either of those things back then so I guess that left me vulnerable. I remember her guilt tripping me and telling me that I was so arrogant for not giving her all my attention and making friends other than her during preschool, which is weird at such a young age but thats how it was. She was quite emotionally intense, easily irritated and aggressive, extremely bossy, manipulative etc. In a very creepy way, she also behaved a lot like adult abusers (will get into that later). I think the combination of my sensitivity and her intensity tangled me and I quickly reached a point where I could not refuse her anymore because I was simply terrified.

She would constantly talk me down, purposefully embarrass me in front of others (and then said it was important to be able to laugh about one self, take a joke), bully me for being short sighted, acted like I was extremely dumb or inattentive when I didnt pay attention to or simply didnt hear something she said. She treated me like a servant, took anything from me that she wanted to have and called me lazy or greedy when I tried to refuse (regardless of whether it had an emotional value to me as well). There is not a single body part of mine she didn't call ugly in some way and compared it to her own, which she viewed as perfect because she was more mature than others her age. She bullied me when I wore my brothers old clothes but also when I wore ""feminine"" things and always told me I wasnt woman enough. (Up to a point where I felt that I didnt deserve to wear a ponytail because thats for girls and therefore i didnt have the right) She went crazy when I talked to others more than necessary and got mad when I played with other kids when she was sick. I was always so incredibly jealous of the others who simply talked whenever and to whoever they wanted to and played what they wanted to during breaks. 

Physically, she would often painfully tightly squeeze my arm when I said or did something she disliked when others were looking so that she didnt look bad. She dug her fingernails into my skin until there we red, sometimes bloody prints in my skin. She would kick me underneath the table. She forced me into eating things I hated simply because she liked them. She slapped my face at several occasions. She would always make up games where I had either a mother role or I was an antagonist that she had to fight. She used thoseplay fights as an excuse to hurt me. She would push me around, against walls and choke me, kick me, scratch me, bite me or pull my hair up to a point where I was still losing full strands of hair hours later. 

She also demanded a lot of physical touch. There was a rumor about me being lesbian because I wore my brothers clothes (I'm bi so it was half true but bruh the stereotype). She took advantage of that for attention and started kissing and touching me in front of others against my will (from like age 7 on) and acted like I was hopelessly in love with her. She also forced me into showering/ bathing her and getting in with her and called me stuck up and immature or a bad friend when I hesitated. I can't kiss women until now because I get flashbacks and women's lips feel like I'm kissing her every time. I smell her and see her in my mind when I do it and I get disgust goosebumps when my legs touch theirs. It's horrible because I know I like women but I cant be with women without her picture dominating my mind.

Generally she demanded a mother role, I had to clean up her plates, read her bedtime stories, tie her shoes and whatever came to her mind. 

It got to a point where she could give me a glance and it put me straight into a panic attack where I couldnt breathe and could barely even stand. That happened weekly up to daily. I was in a constant state of fear. Her looks felt like dying and it felt like she had all the power in the world. I was heavily depressed back then, loved nothing more than the safety of sleep and utter silence, but I kept up an energetic image and it was easy for me to perform well in school so people stayed unsuspicious. I never understood back then how easily my parents could have gotten me out of that situation. So I kept it to myself, covered up for her behavior and apparently I was so good at it that nobody ever noticed. We seemed like perfect childhood friends to the outside.

Sometimes I acted sick on days where I knew that I couldnt take it. I prayed for her to die, sometimes I wanted to die. At some points, kids pointed out her behavior but teachers never listened and she usually acted nice in front of others anyway. 

We went on like this until we got separated in seventh grade (age 13) (our school had a german and an english branch, i went to english, she went to german). We still had contact afterwards but it was a lot less and I could finally live more freely. I never dared to stir up the conflict, because I felt like I had lied to everyone and I could not break out of it anymore. When I moved to a different city (age 18) I eventually broke off contact with her. I even confronted her about it and she said she never perceived it like that and half ass apologized. She began talking about herself and how hurtful it was to find out that it was never real (we love a selfish queen). She also shared some stuff about her dad that kind of showed where her behavior came from. After that we never talked again.

I still notice every day how that shit influences me and how fucked up my concept of relationships and friendships is. Im glad I live in a different city because I would rip her apart if I ever saw her again. Working on it in therapy now. I am fine and know how to process it now so no worries. Maybe anyone relates and wants to talk. I'm open to answering any questions as well. It is quite a niche experience I guess.

"29M I‚Äôm a bit scared to write this. But who cares. Lately life has not been the easiest to deal with. I‚Äôve always had to fight since I was a kid. I had a pretty rough upbringing basically with an abusive mother and an absent father. Now that I‚Äôm a young adult and understanding the world I find myself getting angry at where I‚Äôm at in life. I have no relationship with either my mom or my dad. I‚Äôve been on my own since I was a teenager. It haunts me to think of how far I could have come with supportive parents or even one person I could depend on. I‚Äôm relatively academically successful, I‚Äôm in the early stages of my career so there is little to no reward currently. I try so hard but life always pulls me back. 
I been out my moms home since I was a teen she didn‚Äôt even want to help with college to fill out as fasfa form. Not to mention every single one of her boyfriends abused me. I even had to work two jobs while in high school to support myself. I would walk while she rode my sibling in the car. I was over all the chores in the house. Safe to say I got out of there soon as I could. Once I got stable which was about 3-4 years later, I was slowly pressured to have a relationship with my mother again  but I always felt nasty after dealing with her. I wasn‚Äôt the golden child but I made sure I stayed in school and worked; her golden child literally became one of the worst people I know. Each time we tired to communicate any man she was with at the time would target me and attempt to bully me. Which was crazy. I would simply fade away and not be seen by her for the next year or so. As for my dad, he never really liked me due to the beef he had with my mom. Nothing I did or said made him happy. He literally brings up stuff that happened before I was born; I don‚Äôt even know the half of anything that happened then. Growing up I always felt like god was punishing me. I didn‚Äôt understand why I was given such a terrible burden. 

Fast forward, I graduated near the beginning of the pandemic. This was my second degree. (I have 3 for now.) I was feeling like my world was about to finally open up and the entire world shit down for the next couple of years. My plan that I masterfully planned out to the t failed. There was literally nothing I could do. Growing up in the hell hole I grew up in taught me quickly to be solutions based, but none of my solutions worked. I found some work at a few immediate hire places but quickly found out why they were that way. Thank god I had savings to help during that time. But boy, it felt like a robbery of a life I planned happened right in front of my eyes and I couldn‚Äôt do anything.  

Currently, I working a job that‚Äôs not in my field of education, I don‚Äôt feel motivated, I had a few health scares during the pandemic, and I‚Äôm not as stable as I would like to be. I hope I don‚Äôt sound entitled. I‚Äôm really trying but it feels like I‚Äôm in a sick movie. When the carpet, get ripped under my feet each time I try to come up. I go through this alone. I don‚Äôt want to tired any friends out with my woe it‚Äôs me story. I want to be known as someone who someone can be proud of. I do not feel accomplished in the slightest bit even with my 3 degrees and the life I‚Äôm building for myself. This economy sure isn‚Äôt helping. Im not walking in my purpose. And I‚Äôm constantly on edge on things going wrong in my life. I always trying to prevent any slip up because I‚Äôm all I have. 

Wow that last sentence brought out some emotion. It feels like I‚Äôm always wearing a smiling mask while my soul cries. When I do come to terms with it things, it feels like I‚Äôm giving up on my dreams and surrendering to this hell hole reality. I guess it‚Äôs complicated. I know you have to take responsibility for your life and I constantly am being responsible.  However, when you don‚Äôt have any family foundation and you do everything by yourself it‚Äôs hard. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm watching a horror movie in slow motion. I am in therapy but it doesn‚Äôt change the reality of the situation. I just pray next year is a great year. I want to enjoy my 30s so badly.

"Recently, my ex-girlfriend contacted me for the first time in a long time (5+ years). My relationship with this person was toxic and consisted of ongoing cheating and dishonesty on both sides. We were young and I have long since forgiven, forgotten, and moved on. I have overcome multiple mental illnesses that consumed me during that time of my life and have been stable for many years. So when this person contacted me, I responded and engaged in some convo purely out of curiousity. This began to spiral a bit when I realized I was starting to regularly fantasize and daydream about this person and romanticizing the ‚Äúhighs and lows‚Äù that I once felt. I began falling into a limerant state, something that hasn‚Äôt happened to me in many years. I could acknowledge to myself that it wasn‚Äôt healthy, but at the time was enjoying the little dopamine hits it was giving me and assumed it would eventually go away. I agreed to a platonic catch up with this person hoping it would knock me out of it and maybe even give me the ‚Äúick‚Äù. Unfortunately, it did the opposite and I‚Äôm now in a full blown tailspin. It feels like I‚Äôm back to square one. It brought back all the emotions and tendencies that were once extremely detrimental to my mental well-being. I am obsessed with seeking validation from this person. And for what? I do not want to be with this person. I‚Äôm hoping I can bounce back quickly and have tried to put systems in place to avoid thinking about her, but it feels like an addiction.

"for context, i m(15) have a small 3 year old yorkie, that doesn‚Äôt sound look a reason to hate him, but to be honest i genuinely do not feel safe around him

he grew up in a home where there were many other dogs so typically as he got older he learned to hide his food and protect his areas. so when my family got him from my moms friend he still is like that, attacking us occasionally, but me on a more so regular.

i get that hes a small yorkie so he shouldn‚Äôt really seem like a threat, but he‚Äôs just so overwhelming. when he‚Äôs getting ready and showing signs i feel so unsafe and uncomfortable but i cant do anything about it because my family does nothing to stop him from attacking me. when he does attack me he runs at me snarling then grabs onto my leg and pulls back. he‚Äôs left a gash in my leg once and ripped my pants, the whole process of him getting ready to me getting away is just way too much and too intense but nobody does anything what‚Äôs worse is that sometimes they make me clean up after his piss and shit when i dont even want him as my pet anymore. 

idk if i‚Äôm just sensitive or if this isn‚Äôt acceptable (my family seems fine with it) but i hate this dog for the life of me and i cannot wait for the day he dies or at least if my family would teach him to stop attacking me (they‚Äôre literally doing the opposite by luring him away from me with treats)

"Both 20. We broke up pretty mutually on the basis of religion though he pushed it more. I was still looking for ways of continuing the relationship but at the same time i understood what he meant. We are about a 2 hour distance away from each other when he's in university and we rarely visited each other when he was at university, probably 4 months in between. When he isn't we are only about 15 minutes away from each other. Towards the end he wasn't calling me on the phone as much too, saying he was busy and what not. When we decided to be friends i blocked him as i couldn't really do it anymore and it seemed like he didn't care. He didn't reach out when i did and i unblocked him after that anyways AND reached out first.

I went no contact for 6 months (by not replying to the message i ignored for 6 months) and broke it. I was still a bit annoyed as it seemed he still didn't care to call, to communicate + he said if i wanted to call should call, that he doesn't have anything to say. I also told him i don't like him, which was a lie and he said he still has feelings for me but he's suppressing the emotions as he 'knows we can't be together! 

He also didn't say happy birthday to me because i ignored him for 6 months.
Truthfully, i didn't expect it to hit 6 months, i just wanted him to message me again (like double text) he could've messaged in those 24/48 hours - to show he cared. But he didn't, he didn't send another message in 6 months and probably would have never.

This time, i ignored for 24 hours and he did send another message, I was happy to see that as it made me think like oh? so he really did change that aspect?

He wanted to be friends and meet up.
I know, i went a thousand steps backwards because i'm thinking about him again. I finalised it by saying i guess we can't communicate if he hasn't changed (in calling + stuff). He replied saying ‚Äòok‚Äô and that was it. 

I want to be honest, call him and have a long chat but he never shows utmost effort in communicating on the phone - it's always only me. So wouldn't it be stupid to do so? AGAIN.
Plus we would only at least maintain decent conversation or at most be friends... I'd love that but what do you guys think?

him: we can just be friends, is that calm with you? 

me: uh, we shall see. I don‚Äôt understand it though, after months you don‚Äôt think ‚Äòoh let‚Äôs have a chat‚Äô, you‚Äôre just apathetic really.

me: i didn‚Äôt say it was your fault. What i mean is that i personally have always said calls are better for communication but it‚Äôs whatever then, texting it is. 

him: i don‚Äôt have anything to say that i haven‚Äôt already. Also if you want to call you can just do it. You don‚Äôt have to force me or try make me do it.

"I (23f) currently still live with my parents as I am still in college and my job doesn‚Äôt pay a whole lot. My dad (53m) has always been a mess. An alcoholic, raging and violent anger issues (which he blames on being in the military, but he was like that long before being in the military), verbally and physically abusive to everyone, and just emotionally distant. I‚Äôve learned to fear him and be careful what I say, but I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm sometimes like him with getting angry or wanting the last word, or just being stubborn.

I tense up and can‚Äôt breathe when he hugs me or passes behind me, even in the past two years I‚Äôve had to lock myself in a bathroom while he bangs on the door insulting me and demanding I come out because he pretended he was going to hit me and I panicked and ran as a response. I‚Äôm scared of being near him when he drinks, and he drinks heavily. My older sibling had once told me how he choked out our mom while drunk, how our grandma begged our mom not to marry him.

Me and my sibling dealt with much of the same from our father, except for how creepy he could get with me. He‚Äôs always made comments about me, about my body, my looks, behaviors. He‚Äôs once pointed out how ‚Äúperky‚Äù my chest was when I was wearing a hoodie, making comments on the shape and saying weird comments, with my mom right there and also joining in. When he‚Äôs wasted, which is almost constantly, he‚Äôll obsess over me and cling to me, or hug me or my legs and rub them, and get upset when I move away. He‚Äôs publicly, at my job which is at a bar, made gestures of ‚ÄúT-bagging‚Äù me or talking about me being with girls or guys, which my coworkers would all find hilarious despite having their own various parental abuses. And what I may hate most is how much he‚Äôll compare me to my mom, which makes me just feel disgusted.

I hate dealing with him. I hate being around him, and I wish I could just be away from this house already. My mom has witnessed all of these things and sees no issue with it, since she was used to her dad going as far as casually watching porn with her in the room when she was a teen.

I‚Äôm just tired of this place and wish it could be over already. Men make me uncomfortable and nervous, I can barely be friends with any of them, especially when one of my friends will say how any friendship with a guy and girl is based on the guy being friends with the girl because he‚Äôs wanting to do things with her.

"I run a sports specific afterschool program. We are basically an alternative to after school daycare for working parents. I have a nine year old student who is a good athlete but a complete nightmare to deal with day in and day out. He was actually expelled from school at eight years old for his constant issues which are basically always fighting with other kids, causing trouble, riling up the group etc. He has a brother six years older than him who was also expelled from school so clearly there is a family pattern.

 I happen to really like this kid I always go above and beyond to try to help him become less of a problem.  My punishment for being disruptive during class is to have kids sit on the bench off the mat, this kid basically owns stock in that bench.

As an example of some of his behaviors: last week he gets in the pick up Van and then and opens his water bottle and proceeds to squirt it all over an autistic kid who hates getting wet. We get to the Dojo and he has to sit on the bench and he then dumps his water bottle all over the floor.

I am constantly updating the parents about his daily issues and they generally respond ‚Äúwow that doesn't sound like him‚Äù or  ‚Äúhe must've gotten upset at school‚Äù  just no accountability whatsoever.

 Tomorrow night we are having a year end ‚Äúlock in‚Äù sleepover party, this kid was very excited about coming and I was already dreading it.

He had an incident in class with another instructor where the instructor grabbed him and said ‚Äúwhoa stop stop‚Äù because he was doing a move wrong and risking injuring his training partner. He violently jerked his arm back and said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me!‚Äù And wound up hitting my instructor in the face as he was jerking his arm away and that resulted in him needing to sit on the bench.  After class he comes up to me eyes watering, lip quivering and apologizes which is a big deal for him. I have him apologize to the other instructor as well and tell him I'm proud of him for taking accountability and that he can now come to the sleepover party.

Other instructor (who also really likes this kid btw) calls me on the way home and basically says listen you have to start holding these kids accountable I don‚Äôt care if he apologized, I don‚Äôt want him at the sleepover. He‚Äôll learn more from this than from getting his way. I‚Äôm the owner so ultimately it‚Äôs up to me and I decide to back my instructor. 

I feel like a huge asshole now because I‚Äôve already told a 9 year old he can come to this party and wasn‚Äôt anticipating the feedback from my other instructor and generally I don‚Äôt make mistakes like this.

Even then, even the thought makes me question whether I am smart enough for that field. I doubt I could succeed in it. I don't think I'll even be accepted into a college.

Growing up in poverty has shaped my perspective, instilling a fear of money and not being able to lift my family out of our financial struggles. My family all around me comments on how I'll be the successful one, how I'll take us out of it, and how I'll be the first to finish college. It's as if everyone around me sees a future I'm unable to envision. I feel scared. What if I'm not? What if I can't? And if I fail this?

 I'm scared to fail my family. I am frightened of the future. I am so freaking terrified of it. I want to cry and scream at the thought of being someone because right now I still feel 14 years old.  I am 18 years old. I failed the 1st grade. I feel stupid.  Everyone around me is so smart, so amazing, and already has a plan. My plan has so many holes and I just don't know. How will I even pay for college? My brother couldn't go to college because of the costs. I cannot see myself passing the age of 20.

Feel so sick right now. It was our last day of school and my students brought me gifts and we were eating some sweets in class throughout the morning. And I brought these small cookies for the students but they didn‚Äôt all get taken so I had some on my way home. Then I got home and snacked even though I ate a sandwich at work. I did my workout and came back and ate dinner with the intention of stopping eating there because I already overdid it. And then I carried on eating some and my brother came home and made biscuits at my relatives house. And I literally just ate 4. What is wrong with me. I act without even thinking about it. I actually hate myself. I tried to throw it up just now and nothing even came up so I guess I have to sit here and feel guilty about all my mistakes but also about trying to throw up again.

"Despise isn‚Äôt enough a strong enough word to describe the way I feel about my mother for this and many other reasons and I need to get it off my chest. 

In 2016 I attempted to take my own life after battling depression, anxiety and an eating disorder following several traumatic events and growing up with an absent father who abandoned us and an emotionally abusive and unavailable mother. It was serious and if my boyfriend at the time hadn‚Äôt come home from work early that day I would not be here. I had a blood transfusion that saved my life and still have a huge scar on my neck. 

After all of that I was in the hospital for two weeks and not one family member called or came to visit. I called my mom and asked her to please come visit me because I felt so alone and needed her. She came but she sat at the other end of the room, didn‚Äôt look me in the eyes and stared out the window while I cried. 
When I came home after being sexually assaulted and had bruises all over my arms and legs she told me I shouldn‚Äôt have been out drinking. 

Two years later my sister took her life and my Mom flew out of state to be next to her while she was in a coma and then passed away. Since then she posts long paragraphs on Facebook about how heartbroken she is and how much she misses her baby, started a scholarship in her memory, and regularly shares memories with her. She‚Äôs so f***ing fake it pains me. 

My sister wasn‚Äôt any closer with her than I was. My mom has always been distant with both of us and my sister actually reached out to her one week before she took the pills to try and talk with her about what was going on in her life and want to know what my Mom did? She blocked her. She didn‚Äôt want to talk to her. My sister wanted a divorce from her husband and this was just too much for her. 

She‚Äôs evil, but she acts like she‚Äôs the victim on social media and it makes me sick. I recently went no contact with her after three decades of tolerating her emotional abuse and while I do feel like I‚Äôve been set free, I am still grieving the loss of the mother I never had and wish I had.",My Mom brushed me off when I attempted to unalive myself but after my sister succeeded she has made her entire identity about losing children this way and I despise her for it,18n2u24,1703100163.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n2u24/my_mom_brushed_me_off_when_i_attempted_to_unalive/,
"Ranting because I don‚Äôt really have anyone else to tell. 

I (23F) only have one brother (24M) and we both went through a lot of trauma together growing up, but he also was a huge part of my childhood trauma as well. 

From ages 4-16 he beat me every single day. I‚Äôm talking hitting me as hard as he could, and I always had bruises on me. Almost lost my life to him on multiple occasions by asphyxiation. But once I hit 17, I don‚Äôt remember what changed but he stopped and he‚Äôs never touched me since, and we seemed to be finally getting along. We had a lot of deep talked about everything else that happened in our childhood, but he always pretended that the abuse didn‚Äôt happen or if I brought up a specific event, he would come up with a reason how I deserved it. 

Anyway, he recently had two twin girls with his fianc√©, and believe me they are extremely adorable. But, since his fianc√© was pregnant/gave birth he started to berate me with crazy threats if I didn‚Äôt do something/ if I did something he didn‚Äôt agree with. (Which mostly was talking to certain family members he didn‚Äôt like, hanging out with certain people, arguing with him about anything etc).
I essentially just agreed to whatever he said but never actually followed through (both of us have our own homes away from family so how would he know)

But the breaking point was his car and his fiances car broke down pretty much back to back and (I heard this from other family members, specifically the ones he told me to stay away from) that he was going around asking them for a vehicle to transport him, his fianc√©, and the twins. Our mom agreed to let him use a car she didn‚Äôt use often but was running, and an uncle also offered up a car as well. 

Then, he called me and asked me if he could use my car, which is actually broken down right now too. When I told him this, he screamed at me and then hung up on me. I texted him after explaining myself more before I realized he had already blocked me on literally everything. So did his fianc√©. 

So I called my mom and explained what happened and she said that the vehicles her and my uncle offered had been offered about a week ago, so she couldn‚Äôt think of a reason why  he would ask me for my car in the first place (he‚Äôs known my car has had issues since I got it) especially since he already had two vehicles literally waiting for him to get. 

I came to the conclusion that he probably asked me for mine because he doesn‚Äôt actually like mom or the uncle who offered their cars and was hoping his sister (who he pretended to like) would be the better option to receive a vehicle from. 

I decided right then and there that I was completely done with him in every sense, blocked his phone number right back and will block him on whatever he eventually unblocks me on (he‚Äôs done this before)

"I (26F) am poor. I'm fucking poor. I don't make much and barely have enough for myself. I aged out of my insurance.  I work hard and I hope that one day, I'll make enough to live happily. I am not asking for career advice. This Christmas has been especially hard and I've been struggling. I budgeted as best I could, sold a lot of my clothes, and had enough to get presents for my sisters (24F, 20F) and parents (55M, 54F) as long as we split paying for our parents' gifts. The middle sister (Mina) is considered ""boujee"" and she's the most successful sister of us. She works in the city and makes the most money in the family after my dad (mom is a teacher). The baby sister (Sam) is in college and works a part-time campus job. I've always known that my sisters were more spoiled than I was and they are treated differently and coddled more than me.

Things came to a breaking point yesterday because I was out shopping for a gift for Sam, who wanted a shoulder bag and I was sending photos to Mina asking for opinions on the bags and she kept saying the bags I had were ""ugly"" and I needed to get her a nicer quality brand bag (I was at ALDO). She's only 20 and still in college, so I did not think she needed a high-end bag. She asked for a simple shoulder bag. I eventually went to TJ Maxx and found my sister a lovely shoulder bag with the help of an employee and it was a big-name brand bag I got for like $50 and the initial price was $300. I also saw a similar bracelet to the $100 one I saw on my sister's list so I got it for like 75% off. I told my sister and she was annoyed because it's ""embarrassing"" to shop at TJ Maxx and suggested I take off the tag to look like I had gotten it from the original brand store and then said she hoped I hadn't gotten her a gift from there. I cried in my car. I spent almost 5 hours shopping for my sisters and Mina had been nothing but mean to me and shaming me for the gifts I got. I showed my mom the bag and she thought it was really cute. which made me feel better but I still feel guilty. Sam isn't as spoiled as Mina, but I'm worried Mina won't like my gifts. This is because one year, Mina cried because I handmade her something for Christmas that year and was upset that I bought Sam a more ""expensive"" gift. My mom made me get Mina another gift. 

Now this morning, Mina brings up getting a gift for Nana and starts suggesting expensive things (Nana is not even an expensive kind of person) and I suggest cooking her a meal or buying her a new plant or fabric since she loves gardening and sewing. Mina shot that down and told me to stop being cheap and I finally admitted that I had only budgeted for the family and not for Nana. I wouldn't be able to pay anyone for anything until after Christmas since that's when I get paid. Mina went into me saying how I should have saved more and that she always gets nice things for us and always has to come through for everyone else (this is a lie but whatever). Sam said not to worry about it but I feel awful. I can't stop crying. I hate being treated differently by my parents. I feel so bad about even making a list, I just put cheaper items or things I need for work. I fucking hate being poor. 

Edit: Jeez, thank you guys for the positive messages! I am definitely rethinking my relationship with my family. I struggle with eldest daughter syndrome hard and it shows. I would also like to say I am autistic, I am not very good with saying how I feel, which is why I love gift giving and quality time, so I really love the holidays. Clearly, my sisters (and to extent, my parents) don‚Äôt get how my brain and feelings work and we‚Äôve gone down the group therapy hole a few times but I just don‚Äôt believe the emotional labor is worth it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be cutting anyone off anytime soon since I do live with my mom and she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot. I can‚Äôt mentally deal with her possibly bullying me because I ‚Äúruined Christmas‚Äù. I‚Äôm just going to keep working hard and saving money so I can move out on my own and start my own Christmas traditions!

I also ended up talking to Sam (she‚Äôs closer to Mina) some more and she understands my situation and told me not to take Mina‚Äôs words to heart as she‚Äôs dealing with some life stuff right now. Not going to put her business out there nor am I excusing her behavior but I‚Äôm not going to cut her out, I‚Äôm going to continue loving her from a safe distance. I also ended up getting my nana some Poinsettas. I also decided to keep the bracelet and writing Mina a letter and giving her $50 cash so she can buy whatever she wants.

Also omg, do not give me your money! Consider donating it to your local charities or buying some low income families gifts, kids deserve happy memories and that would be the greatest gift to me:)

One last thing since I‚Äôm over being sad, TJ MAXX IS THE FUCKING BEST!!! I won‚Äôt let anyone tell me otherwise.

"For some more context my bf was dating his ex when him and I met. To be totally honest I did think he was cute but I didn‚Äôt see why we couldn‚Äôt be friends. I never did anything to disrespect their relationship. Their relationship ended a few weeks later. He confessed his feelings for me shortly after. The guilt consumed me. He assured me I was not a factor just a catalyst. I‚Äôm not an idiot though. Needless to say his sister, a friend of hers, doesn‚Äôt like me and has made it very clear I‚Äôm the villain in this story. His ex hates me, well the idea of me‚Ä¶

Now almost two years later My (19f) boyfriend (22m) is out of town this week with his family. They have two cats, who are both absolute sweethearts. Last night we were out to dinner with some of his friends and his parents. He asked his mom who would be caring for the cats and she awkwardly and loudly said that his ex would be. She lives nearby, she‚Äôs done it before, it makes sense and it didn‚Äôt bother me. 

But as the night progressed and I lay awake in his bed my mind began to wonder. I am a very curious person. My line of work involves some light investigation. All to say, I know how curious people can be. I started to think, what if she comes in his room and looks around? What if she sees my pill bottles? And the clothes I have in his dresser? What would she think of my earrings or the notes I‚Äôve written for my love? I know I shouldn‚Äôt trouble myself with such thoughts. But I, as a 19 year old with generalized anxiety disorder, am not a master of my mind and that is a conversation for my therapist. 

This morning I brought him and his family to the airport. I returned the car back to his house and before I left I thought ‚Äúwell Ill just put my pill bottles away in case she comes in here, she doesn‚Äôt need to know about my health problems.‚Äù And while I was putting them away in his dresser I noticed my perfume and deodorant so I put that away too, maybe she doesn‚Äôt want to know what I smell like. Before I knew it, I was cleaning any trace I‚Äôd ever been in his house at all. My hairbrush, toothbrush, face wash, bright pink razor, my makeup remover, contacts, and all the other odds and ends in his bathroom I stuffed into a bag and hid in the back of a drawer. I collected up the drawer full of clothes I‚Äôve left at his house. I put them in bags and I hid them under his old coats in the closet. I took my black heels home. I found all the pictures of us and the scrapbook and I buried them under his graphic tees. I hid my duck from the set of matching porcelain ones we‚Äôd made together. I cleared my paper drafts from his desk and shoved them in my bag. I cleared my bottles iced coffees from his mini fridge. I tucked every poem and note I‚Äôve written him in his desk drawer. Everything that might indicate I had ever been there I buried and stashed and stuffed. Until it seemed like he might not have a girlfriend at all. 

When I had finished, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I did it for her or for me. Perhaps I had started because I was self concious what she‚Äôd think of me. But by the time I finished, I was thinking about what I wouldn‚Äôt want to see if I was her. Maybe it was guilt or just impulsivity or something else‚Ä¶ Regardless of the perspective taken I think it‚Äôs better I remain nothing more than an idea to her.

"Hello dear Redditors,

I'd like to tell you about my day today.

I woke up around 9:30am after watching a trash TV show until 4am or so and was feeling quite okay-ish. As an addendum, I would like to say that I am currently going through Kratom withdrawal, so it was quite hard all in all.

So I jumped out of bed more or less immediately as I am on vacation but wanted to buy Christmas presents for my family.

First of all, I brought all Pfand bottles back to the supermarket and then walked to McDonalds (which is a good 40-minute walk away) to redeem a few Monopoly vouchers that would otherwise expire.

After putting together a good late breakfast from all sorts of things for +-7 euros, I pinched off the next Monopoly stickers and got more vouchers (there were two of them, one either ice cream/fries or fries/drink).

Since I'm there very rarely and didn't want one of the vouchers to expire, I asked a group of young people if they were interested in a free french fry or an ice cream. One young lady agreed and I took her to the ordering terminal and ordered her the ice cream.

After I ordered the drink for me, I went all the way back to the supermarket to look for presents. I found some really nice things, mainly sweets but also two really cool wooden figurines and a large scented candle in a jar.

Afterwards, I walked for ages to the bus station, waited for the bus there and went home. When I got home, I just fell into bed.

"TL;DR at the bottom

I‚Äôve had a rough year. I had a stroke one year ago today. I‚Äôm fortunate in that I‚Äôm recovering well enough, but not enough that I can go back to a good job and return to my pre-stroke routines. The stroke happened after I just moved to a new state for work. I‚Äôve had several issues since then like limited use of my dominant hand, random dizzy spells, and am prone to vomiting seemingly out of nowhere. I met someone in the middle of the year and we dated for several months, we got very close quickly. She pushed for a relationship early into the friendship and I made it clear that my health isn‚Äôt great right now but she said she didn‚Äôt care.

A few months ago she called me and told me our relationship wasn‚Äôt working. I said I understood and then after a brief conversation she hung up. I had a lot going on and I figured it was best. My roommate in this new town didn‚Äôt disclose to me he was a sex offender when I moved in and that would be a problem for me applying for certain jobs. I moved out and had to move in with a family member who lives locally. I had to throw all of my stuff away in the process because I had burnt through my savings and couldn‚Äôt afford to move it/store it. So when she broke up with me I thought it would be best for her but I was sad.

The mutual friend that set us up would update me on her life occasionally and talk about her and I every so often. Last week she asked me to meet up with her, when I did she started crying. She told me my ex was in a new relationship and that her new boyfriend beat her and she was worried he was going to seriously hurt her. The implication was that I was to blame, my ex didn‚Äôt want to break up, she was testing to see if I cared. When I was ok with the breakup and didn‚Äôt maintain contact, she assumed I didn‚Äôt love her. I don‚Äôt have the health to get involved but I grew up in an environment of domestic abuse and felt obligated to do something, however I told the friend I didn‚Äôt want to get personally involved with my ex or her new boyfriend. Her friend wanted me to call her or go get her from her abusive boyfriend. I opted for contacting a family member to get her help. Maintaining that I didn‚Äôt want to be personally named or involved. 

All week I‚Äôve been throwing up and worried that she is in danger but had been assured she would get help. A couple days ago she texted me and asked what had been said because her family confronted her and mentioned my name. Admittedly I lost my cool, and said I didn‚Äôt want to hear from her or get directly involved but that her safety was the only thing I was concerned with. She told me I obviously did want to talk to her or I wouldn‚Äôt have done anything and got pissed and told me she was fine and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything. Her friend keeps texting me saying that she‚Äôs sorry for getting me involved. I love these two but my health is so bad I can‚Äôt take the stress. I‚Äôm moving back to my home state next week and can hopefully get my health in check and experience some peace.

TL;DR: stroke a year ago has left me with poor health. My ex-girlfriend broke up with me and the new guy beats her. I wanted to help but not get directly involved.

"I am on my phone so please forgive the formatting if it is wonky. 

I L and my partner B (both early 20s) decided to host a Halloween party this year. We planned a little over a month in advance. We invited my best friend (H) and his wife (S) (we are all friends mutualy, he is just my best friend as well lol), two other mutual friends and their people and B's friend. My younger sibling is living near us so would be there and my mother was coming as well. My older sibling said they were unsure but would keep us updated (they ended up going to their spouses work thing instead)

 The only ones that actually came were H and S and then S's friend (F) that we ok'd coming. Again my sibling and mother were already guaranteed.  We set a time and B and S kept talking about drinks, foods, decorations, and activities beforehand. The party was planned three weeks in advance and set for the 28th. 

We bought extra stuff and last minute touches. H and S came over earlier in the week to make drinks and such. B and I spent the morning cleaning and setting up with all the decorations. We had bought stuff for appetizers, treats, and then food for supper. H and S provided drink stuff.

 Everything came together pretty nicely and we were both excited to have a fun evening. I picked up the other three an hour after the party was supposed to start because they weren't ready but were tipsy which was already a red flag. We arrived and within 5 minutes S tells us that they will be leaving early as her other friend invited them to the bars a couple hours before hand. She never asked us if it was okay or anything to that effect.

After a little bit they did invite us with but we both declined. S did try to guilt us both by saying we were breaking her heart by not coming and that she really wanted us to go and would make sure B wasn't left out as she can't drink due to health reasons and therefore doesn't really enjoy bars. But she still participates to the best of her ability. We still refused as we planned on a night in. 

This was upsetting for me but more so for B as she put so much time, energy, and money into this evening. We didn't say anything as to not ruin the night. We played a game of beer pong, had a couple drinks and shots and they left within 3 hours of arriving which was by 8 p.m.

They never apologized or seem to care about the effort put into the night. They just dipped and didn't talk to us the rest of the night. The next morning H asked for a ride from F's house (20ish min away) as she had left her car at their house when they met up to ge ready. 

We talked about it today in a gc and they just kept saying we had shitty communication because we didn't voice ourselves the night of. B and I both stared we wanted to wait as we were both frustrated and sad so we didn't want to say anything out if anger. They didn't take any responsibility and said we hurt their feelings and were being mean to S because we were short in the gc. I apologized to them for hurting their feeling even though they never apologized really and my bsf said he accepted the apology then proceeded to give us examples of how we could have worded our opinion. They ended us leaving our gc a couple days later and removed just me from some social media. Neither of them have made any attempt to reach out or anything. 

Everyone we've told the story to says we didn't do anything wrong and that they are being petty/manipulative in their words. It just sucks cause B and I both thought these would be long time friends. We talked about being in eachothers weddings and going on a trip in February for B's birthday.",Supposed friends ditch party and are now no contact,18n2c7k,1703098915.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n2c7k/supposed_friends_ditch_party_and_are_now_no/,
"I want to be a stay at home parent. I feel like I don‚Äôt want to be judged by other women for wanting this. I feel like in this society women are encouraged to do it all, but I can‚Äôt.

I enjoy being a housewife, and all I want to do is raise my child and take care of the house. I shared this with a friend, and was criticized and questioned as to why I couldn‚Äôt manage everything. 

I asked my boss if it would be an option to work part-time, which was met with criticism, saying how ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a business owner and can manage everything‚Äù so why couldn‚Äôt I?

"I just want to start off with backstory. My father has never been around really. My mom and dad separated when I was around 5. My mom has always been mentally abusive, sometimes physically too until I outsized her. Around the age of 8 my mother broke her ankle and I was stuck with my grandma. My grandma also watched my cousin and the neighbors kids some time. Two important people are one of the neighbor girls, same age, and my female cousin, three years older. Both of these girls used me sexually until the age of about 11. The neighbor girl would take me to her house and strip and have me lick her body and kiss her mouth. My cousin would touch my crotch and straddle me. She would make me suck on her nipples and kiss her. My older sister also had friends who would make me be their ‚Äúlittle spoons‚Äù and they would also kiss me in private. The experiences with my mother and these girls have forced me to block out my childhood for a while. I have always had a resentment towards woman still.

When I entered highschool I became concussed after a bike crash. It was never treated which lead to me having issues for a few weeks. During this time I finally started talking to a girl who I had thought was pretty for a few years. Things were good except for when I‚Äôd have mental breaks. My emotions would surge and I didn‚Äôt know how to think and process. After a few months we stopped talking. Later on we regained contact but it‚Äôs been minimal. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her even though she‚Äôs changed she made me feel the most like me.

My sophomore year I got a girlfriend who was so kind to me. The kindness was only in the beginning though. I don‚Äôt know why I stayed with her. I‚Äôve tried to leave her 4 times. Though about it more but was worried about her being pregnant. She‚Äôs treated me like shit but I always forgive her. She ditched me multiple times for her friend, called me stupid, made fun of the way I look and what I do, she doesn‚Äôt understand me. I was so happy before getting with her and since then I‚Äôve constantly fantasized about my suicide. She always picks fights or lingers on things without telling me anything is wrong and then lashes out at me. She doesn‚Äôt hit me but she reminds me of my mother in the way she treats me. Things got bad when she made it onto homecoming court. She thought she was the greatest and essentially left me behind for a week. I took a pic with her at homecoming and that was it. After she got one pic she pushed me away and told me to get out because she needed other pictures. At this time, I confided in a teammate. She knew how I felt and what was happening and she used me like the other girls had. She rolled me over on top of her after a Halloween party and  had me rub my body up and down hers. I allowed it and I hate myself for it. She was the only person I had to talk to and I worried if I rejected I‚Äôd be alone again. She did it again a week later when I needed to grab something I left. I tried to break up with my girlfriend that week because of how she treated me and what happened but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I never told her what happened. Since that point I‚Äôll tell her what to fix and it‚Äôll be good for a few months then go back to being bad and then it repeats. I hate her now. I‚Äôve sexted random girls to try to make sure I‚Äôm not horny when I‚Äôm with my girlfriend because I didn‚Äôt want to wait around for a period to make sure nothing was going to happen if we broke up. To be honest it also felt good to reclaim control in my sexuality. We‚Äôre still together. I want to end it now but with Christmas and my birthday coming around I feel guilty. She‚Äôs spent money and so I have I. I want out and have for over a year. Things get bad and drink in my room when I can. I hate that I‚Äôm not strong enough to just leave.

"I suppose I'll start with everyone has their flaws, including myself. However I think I've hit my breaking point. 

My man is always in some kind of mood. Anger, frustration and irritation seems to be thr underlying problem here. Granted he works 50+ hour week sometimes. I have given him some slack in this area. However it's getting ridiculous. 

He's angry when he leave in the morning, when he comes home. 
Even On the phone and also by text he's offensive and seems frustrated. 
Even after he's relaxed alittle and ate dinner after coming home, he has some kind of irritated attitude. 
Even when the house is clean and things are done and laundry is put away or folded. 
There seems to be no pleasing him? 
‚Ä¢Should I confront him?‚Ä¢

It's embarrassing especially recently,  a long time friend has become the Roommate and she's somewhat subjected to this 6'2 man walking around in a ""mood"". She doesn't need this, she just has ptsd and past relationship trauma. It's must be triggering. Heck even when he comes home we message each other that we should ""run off and hide"", just to avoid the mood that he's in. 

I feel terrible my friend is subjected to this, all I can do is apologize. 

I don't want to be close to him. I'm somewhat afraid and yet disgusted by his behavior moods. 
It's made me distant.

"God idrk what to begin.. and they say trauma blocks out certain memories so I‚Äôll do my best to as accurate in what happened. Let‚Äôs go back to the end of 2022, near Xmas. At this point in time i (17M) met this wonderfully beautiful girl (16F). We began talkin and I‚Äôll admit, we moved rlly fast cuz the next month (January 5th 2023) we made official and public that we were together. (Side note to keep in mind, she had rlly strict parents and the ONLY time I have gotten to see her was at church related events/activities, we didn‚Äôt go to school tg or anything. And another thing ab her parents was that they didn‚Äôt like me to much being that I was 17 sayin ‚Äúthat I‚Äôm a grown man‚Äù) Now we had our problems yea but what couple doesn‚Äôt? I‚Äôll admit mine is that I am overprotective and I‚Äôm a huge over thinker and I can get attached easily.. And I wouldn‚Äôt say I ever accused her of cheating on me (and to this day I‚Äôll stand beside her and say she hasn‚Äôt ever cheated on me for the fact that everyone that‚Äôs tried to tell me she has, hasn‚Äôt been able to give me fools evidence of it) but she was always way to friendly towards other guys. And that was a problem for me. And anytime I‚Äôd bring it up she‚Äôd give me the whole ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry, im trying to change‚Äù run around. Anyway we continue to date on and off for 7 months (August 4th 2023, the day before our 7th month anniversary so I Js say 7 months) but like it wasn‚Äôt a breakup. It was Js supposed to be a break for her to work on herself. We had every intention of getting back together, so I thought.. after this break I‚Äôm still going to church with her tryin to be supportive of the brake but at the same time I‚Äôm scared shitless of losing the girl that I want to spend the rest of my life with, like honestly I wanted to marry her and have mini us‚Äôs running around our home. We‚Äôve talked ab getting married and what our future would be like tg all the time. I genuinely thought I had met the one.. so I‚Äôm still going to church right, but so is my hb (homeboy (17m)) that I would have to practically beg to come to church (most of the times he didn‚Äôt come) cuz I never got to hang out much and he lived in the town that we went to church in. And he‚Äôs coming more frequently than usual.. honestly I saw the sighs but I was to delulu to actually accept what was going on right before my eyes. (I‚Äôd tell her that I had saved her a seat next to me and she always chose to sit by him instead of me. She was getting more distant from me ect.) So after seeing this a couple of times, I asked them both ‚Äúare y‚Äôall going to be something soon? Cuz if you are tell me now so I can pack my shit and move‚Äù (figuratively speaking) and they both gave me the reply of ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I‚Äôve asked them this question MULTIPLE times during a two week time period. And finally one day I had a feeling that I didn‚Äôt like, I had to know for myself. They weren‚Äôt going to tell me, I had to know for myself.. so I went thru her Snapchat conversation between her and him.. and my worst nightmare and fears became reality in that moment.. how could I be so fuckin stupid.. confronting them ab it she goes of on me ab how I went thru her chats and what not. Not even touching the fact that they both have been lying to my face for two weeks. Keeping me in the dark ab their relationship and her keeping my hopes high of us getting back together. Fast forward to now (18M) (17F) (it‚Äôs been 4 months and 16 days- 138 days) we are on no contact and it‚Äôs killing me. I miss her so badly, well I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs her or the memories I miss. I‚Äôve been in one relationship after her and it failed terribly. I feel incapable of loving again. I feel unlovable.. it‚Äôs not fair that I‚Äôm living like this heartbroken and miserable and she‚Äôs having the time of her life.. I want her to feel pain, pain like never before‚Ä¶ I want her to think I‚Äôm dead. I want her to make her think it‚Äôs her fault,  I think that‚Äôs only fair being that I am dead inside. She‚Äôs ruined me for anyone after her. Dose that make me a terrible person for wanting that? Idk anymore, life is boring now and I have no motivation to do anything. Now I‚Äôm not gonna lie and tell u I‚Äôm not suicidal. I am but I‚Äôm not.. I‚Äôm what u would call ‚Äúpassive suicidalnes‚Äù if ur not familiar with this term plz google it. I‚Äôm scared of death but I‚Äôm okay with it. I‚Äôm not gonna off myself but I‚Äôd be okay if I‚Äôd happen to get in to some freak accident or something. But back to my point, I want her to think I‚Äôm dead. How could I go ab doing this?

"I clicked some selfies tonight after 2  months. I didn't use to click selfies at all before meeting her (my ex girlfriend) . It was like I would click selfies in super special occasions and those were also with other people because I didn't like the way I looked, dealt with lots of negative comments from people about my body. And after getting into the relationship with her, that is when I started clicking selfies, mainly to show her. She made me feel better about myself, about how I look. So finally I started liking myself too. Yes of course I still understand that I am not perfect nor that I am the best looking guy in the world but realising that someone liked me and told me I look beautiful was a huge thing for me. 

But then all those disgusting things happened exactly 2 months ago. She cheated on me and then dumped me for that guy when our relationship was of 2 years 8 months and 21 days. And that thing completely broke me. I don't know how some people deals with break up really easily. But I was completely devastated. Having to know what she did even after for more than 2 and a half years I did my everything to make her feel the most special person in the world completely destroyed me. Even from before that I was dealing woth some other major things too. My dad died few months before that, financial problems in my family. And the only thing that was holding me fromnot going insane was the thought and feelings kf having her with me and the dreams of our future together. And then when she destroyed my love and my trust by the worst possible way then I really lost all hope. I didn't want to love. Thoughts of killing myself came every single day and even though I am little better than before but still sometimes those thoughts and feelings gets so heavy. I lost my appetite. I cried multiple times every single day. Didn't have any energy to go to work but still I had to because otherwise me and my would have starved. Didn't want tk shave my beard, didn't want to trim my nails, didn't feel like doing anything for myself at all. 

And when some festivals were happening here in between this time, the thought of clicking selfies came to my mind. But before Ieven take out my phone the next thought that came in were how I used to take selfies every now and then and used to send her. And that would just kick in all the memories and thoughts all over again and made me feel like a zombie for hours. Like I didn't even belong anywhere. And I also didn't like how I was looking again. I was skinny before but now from eating less for over a month, I got more skinny. Then came the beard. And I also started feeling disgusted by how I looked. 

And yes, it took me time to control my emotions and feelings, took me days to not think about those things again and again. Took me weeks to make me understand tjat I have to take care of myself. And this evening, after coming back from work, I thought of shaving ny beard, trimming my nails and wanted to have a life for myself after spending weeks feeling so lost and crying myself to sleep every night. So I did, I shaved my beard, trimmed nails, my skin was getting really rough and bad because of the winter so applied cream and then after eating dinner I was in the mood of taking selfies again. I don't know why it came to my mind, I am just in home, not even in any occasion, but it came to my mind that ""lets click some selfies and see how am I looking"". So I did. Clicked some selfies sitting on the bed in my room. And it felt awesome. I don't want you will think when I am saying that clicking some selfies felt awesome but it really did. And looking at those pictures and seeing myself without the beard, a clean face felt even better.

Now I am hoping not to lose this energy from tomorrow. I don't know if those thoughts will come back again but it feels really good to not being sad for some hours, not killing my mind with sorrows.",I clicked some selfies tonight after 2 months dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts,18n248g,1703098369.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n248g/i_clicked_some_selfies_tonight_after_2_months/,

I feel like i kind of lost my friend but im not really sad about that because i understand we are adults now and things do change.  
I moved to the big city and so she sometimes comes to visit but it seems like evertime she comes to visit or we go out to a bar or anywhere really her boyfriend is always bound to as some point blow up her phone and accuse her of cheating or lying. I recall she posted a picture on instagram of us before going to dinner then he saw that and got upset because he had never seen that dress because it was to short. He basically wasted our night by keeping her on the phone for an hour for damage control. She apologizes then they are back in love again.  
The last Time she came we went to a bar i made sure she was comfortable even when guys would talk to us id say we have boyfriends or ask her if she was ok because shes not good with boundaires.

It will keep you safe from the dreams. I wish I could join you there. But everytime I go searching for that place, you leave it.

I see that you have choosen a train, no multiple trains, of thought to ride during the day. That's annoying because it's harder to find you then but no matter. Just be careful which train you choose. All the tracks intersect at random points and the conductors tend to scream.

It must be very loud. Maybe you wear earplugs. That would explain why you never hear me cursing your name. Why you never respond when I beg for you to finally leave.

Watch your step. The train tracks, like the rest of my mind are not well maintained. I put as much effort into it as a boomer did house maintenance during the depression. Maybe I should get help to repair it. But I probably won't.

I offerd for him to pick her up so they could resolve this privatly because im so exsausted of this constantly happening everytime she sleepsover.  
My friend said he was not gonna come hes lazy and just wanted to waste her time being controlling and fighting. It seems like shes not allowed to have fun without him. He tells her things like im runing their relatinship when i point out the truth to her. And when he gets like that she agrees and says yes hes crazy and he wont let me go and cries. He wouldnt pick her up and demanaded that she had to be at his house by noon the next morning when she was still drunk and hungover‚Ä¶he cares more about her following his rules then her own wellbeing to get some rest then they can resolve it.  
I pointed out these things to her the next morning but i guess he had already convinced her otherwise because she said that i think i am an expert on their relationahnip and i only see her once a month so i dont know anything and that its not fair that i think they are doomed forever and wont change. She also said it was her fault why she was mad and she gets shellshock when he calls and her and that makes him suspicious. Her bf doesnt like me because i see throiugh his bs and im everything he hates in a woman strong boundaires , independant ect that that threatens him so he doesnt like when she comes to the city to hangout.

My girlfriend texted and then called him for an hour discussing how his life has been and what he's done in life. Then, she proceeded to listen to an entire album this guy created for her, and she literally just sat there and listened to the entire thing, saying it was good while I was asleep (we called a little before I went to sleep, and she said she would ""soon"". She said she would be there for him if he ever needed to vent or anything, much more than she ever said to me :/.  She told me she didn't mean the stuff she said that night to him, which I partly believe (she said she was trying to get a rise out of him because she ""hated him so much"".

"I hate the way people have popularized this phrase and have learned to use it against anyone they disagree with to invalidate the other person's feelings. I've been dogpiled, bullied and ostracized repeatedly in different contexts over the years, online and offline, by belligerent people who get a kick out of fighting people. People who think only their feelings exist and only their opinions are correct.

It's a symptom of social media, tunnel vision and in-group/out-group dynamics. Empathy has completely gone out of the window and people treat each other as punchbags or disposable objects. It's given me PTSD because I'm sensitive to epistemic harm and I've been ostracized from community by bullies. I have a tendency of seeing the grey areas of everything but people online are so viciously black-and-white.

And what's worse is that people just double down on the abuse if you resist the victimization. People don't pause to take the other person's perspective. It feels like my head is repeatedly rammed down the toilet by school bullies. Pointing out that it's cruelty just enrages the bullies more, making them push the ""playing victim"" narrative even harder. People just don't want to empathize with their fellow human beings.

Mis-using ""playing victim"" is a form of coercive control and gaslighting (another mis-used phrase), it asserts the bully's reality over the victim's and puts them in a submissive position where they have no choice but to fawn or be punished worse. There's no compromise, listening or attempt at connection.

It's taken me a long time to learn to recognise this pattern and assert boundaries quickly. I'm still not good at trusting my own judgement when someone is cruel. It's difficult to know for sure because bullies are good at normalizing coercive control and it looks like normal behaviour at first. Today I blocked someone I followed on twitter who exhibited the same behaviour as my past bullies, before they had a chance to harm me, but I'm still uncertain and worried about giving them RSD.

I've been on social media more than a decade and it feels like a place of landmines now. I feel so sad and anxious that so many people have become like this, either a bully or an unwitting enabler/follower.","I can't stand the phrase ""playing victim"" anymore.

"CW: SA.
WHY
Just. Fucking. Why.

I was sexually assaulted in the building I live in a few months ago, and about 30 min ago I opened my door to a Red Cross volunteer. My mother chastised me on the phone because I opened my door to a Red Cross volunteer.

She used the fact I was sexually assaulted. She said ""Remember your previous venture"". FUCK YOU????? I was molested by this guy, he was dry-humping me and groping my breasts on the fucking corridor?? This dude that has just knocked on my door is volunteering for the Red Cross??????? THOSE SITUATIONS ARE NOTHING ALIKE.
Why do you do this mom. Do you think I am to be held responsible for what happened to me??? 

To be fair at this point I wouldn't be surprised if she thinks I am in the wrong for having been assaulted. I just want my mom to be just a normal mom. I want to be loved by my mom. Why can't I have a mom?

Edit about 2h later: I feel a bit calmer after a call with my girlfriend and reading to your messages helped me clear my head. To clarify: I am 20F, of petite stature, I have been living on my own since I am 18 about 600km away from my parents. I financially rely on them until the end of the school year (I'll have either a degree that allows me to enroll in a curriculum in which I will be able to work on the side, or get into a school and be paid to study for I will technically be an official in probation), so I have to stay in touch. 
My parents also threaten to put me in the psych yard if I don't call them every day and prove myself a sane individual (I am quite severely mentally ill, but I carry on as I can't give up on my studies).

"The most disorganized word dump I've ever contributed to the internet, and feeling very risky yet brave to do so:

I live with diagnosed depression, anxiety, suic!dal ideation, OCD, ADHD, and I suspect I also have autism. It's extremely hard living with these mental health issue. It's hard to lose family members to suic!de. It's hard to be away from my parents and freak out that they're aging. It's been hard to grow up and adult and see my siblings change, sometimes in ways that make me sad. It's hard to not have many friends and find the courage to let one of the 2 friends I did have go because of toxicity.

It's been hard to get out of bed most days, and there is so much shame how i just lay in bed or on the couch the majority of my time. Literally wasting my time and body and mind away. It's frustrating that despite therapy and medication, I still feel this way and sometimes it gets better but mostly it gets worse. And to have gained 30 pounds on my meds, before going off of them because it made my ED intensify, even though the meds were helping. And having relationships can be hard. Having a puppy, with extreme reactivity and separation anxiety, has been hard.

Feeling like a total idiot at work all the time, as if I really don't know anything about what I do, and not feeling confident to try, and being watched by preceptees and co-workers all the time intensifies it all. Feeling like I wasted 2 years of school for this, and 1 year working. Finally changing jobs in the new year, but still sticking with X-ray, and already regretting it because I could've gone a different route. I guess I still can. And I think about dying a lot. How death is so scary and my parents are aging and the anxiety about ""what if a loved one or i die driving to work today?"" Not having energy to lose weight even though I want to. Not having pride in my appearance and feeling ugly out in public all the time. feeling like a bad and lazy partner who doesn't clean or even really cook anymore, even though i love to. feeling judged by my family for not having kids by choice, and also still not sure i don't want kids by choice even though must days i feel i couldn't handle it (i mean, hello, look at this post).

Feel resentful most days since my husband has a job he does from home and likes it a lot. Which makes me feel like an ass because of course i want him to love his job but i am so jealous and envious that he does and i don't and i can't switch jobs because i'm the breadwinner. feeling guilt for being envious of his work from home status.

feeling a lot all the time.

it's been this way for 5+ years, and i can remember when it all started, and i just want things to go back to how they used to be, but they can't and they won't, and maybe they shouldn't. I feel like my life is on a downwards trend and continues to plummet, as i continue to age and my desire increases for change and happiness. all i want is happiness, or at least okayness, so life can feel exciting again and everything doesn't appear in shades of gray. i miss my family even though they're somewhat near. i miss myself, who i used to be in younger years- so social and attractive and fun and outgoing and lighthearted. now turned miserable, grouchy, anxious, depressed, ugly, fat, lazy. i recognize that i talk down to myself and about myself, but so it goes with confidence as low as mine. my working memory is all but anything anymore, i can't even remember what i did yesterday. something about how a brain in survival mode will let go of all non-essential information, but really- it makes me feel even more stupid and increases my health anxiety of ""what if i lose my mind in total?""

The OCD is hard, because all I do is obsess and obsess over work and my puppy's issues. I'm almost always thinking about work, even right now I know i have exactly 2 hours and 12 minutes before I need to start getting ready to go, because at all times it's a mental countdown in my brain about when i have to go next. and dreading every minute of it, again not being able to get out of bed for those 2 hours and 12 minutes because i am so stressed and worried about work, and have been since 24 hours before my next shift. i feel crazy that i do this to myself, and that my work has such a chokehold on me. it really does feel like i'm being choked, strangled. and having to drive to work for 30 minutes, having a low grade panic attack and on the brink of tears, or crying the entire drive. the obsessive and ruminating thoughts are so exhausting.

I'm sorry to go on and spew all of this out. I feel legitimately crazy and like i need to be institutionalized, yet i'm able to function in society at least at large, and nobody knows what goes on in my head. how can i hide it all so well? Is everyone else doing this too?

"Dating/flirting and getting into a relationship feels very equivalent to applying for a job.With job hunting you're looking for a great position that best aligns with your long term goals, what you want and what it provides you, while you also fit the needs of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Once established in your career with a few years of experience under your belt, finding another job is simple as you're in rythym... but getting that first entry level position is difficult and challenging. They all typically say they require ""5 years of experience"" and degrees for entry-level positions. Nowadays, degrees aren't even necessary for a lot of tech roles because experience and knowledge is valued much more highly.

&amp;#x200B;

If degrees are like past relationships, and experience is someone's social skills with flirting/hooking up,  getting an entry level position is not just difficult, it's borderline impossible if you have neither. The difficulty only gets even more challenging with each passing year you get older, as you are expected to have at least some experience due to age.

&amp;#x200B;

Being 32, and never been in a relationship is one thing and isn't super uncommon these days, but never having been on a single date is less common, and never had someone to even flirt with or talk to at all is even more rare...

&amp;#x200B;

Relating it back to the analogy, it's the same as if a 32 yr old who's never had a job and never learned how to read is applying for entry level jobs... good luck... is it possible they'll get a better job than working at McDonalds their entire life? Sure. but how? they don't even know where to start. They might have been a perfectly normal person with all the desire in the world to learn how to read like everyone else and just never got the opportunity. Now they're too old and after years (entire lifetime) of non-use their potential for those skills have dissolved to borderline retardation.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention internships and entry level roles (the great/ideal positions for people to finally enter a career) are ""locked"" only to younger adults just entering the workforce. So many people only see age in relationships. It doesn't matter how much or how little experience a 32 yr old has, according to them they should only go after relationships (jobs) within their range...  and for a 32 yr old that would be senior positions. Yes, a Senior position with entry level requirements is ideal since more money is always nice. but do they know how unrealistic that is? no. do they even care? also no. They only care about gatekeeping for god even knows what reason.

&amp;#x200B;

This creates a pleasant dynamic making it even more impossible than it already is to get into \*any\* position. Entry roles are being gatekept, and roles ""in range"" are way too demanding with too much responsibility right off the rip for someone with 0 experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Really they would be lucky to land any entry job. Forget what they personally would actually want to do for a career or ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" because it could never apply to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** if you've never landed an entry level job by 30, you're never going to get one. Similarly, if you've never been on a date by 30, I guess you should just go die and be alone forever.",Dating/Relationship Experience Is The Same As A Job,18n072s,1703093685.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18n072s/datingrelationship_experience_is_the_same_as_a_job/,

He would hold my hand, really open up to me and even once accidentally told me he loved me when we were having sex. There are so many instances of him showing this was more than sex but i was hesitant because he was going abroad in the spring. I made it clear I wouldn‚Äôt date him until he came back and we seemed on the same page. I made it very clear that I understand that this is really messy but i just needed complete honesty. Especially because it was clear we had both caught feelings. Right before he went abroad we were at our closest, sleep overs often, road trips and even tears. At first we still talked but it was difficult because the country he was in made it so hard to keep contact. We continued to sext and send pictures. It wasn‚Äôt till half way through the semester that I noticed something was off and I asked him what was going on. It triggered him to send this insane text being like ‚Äúbtw i don‚Äôt want to date you etc‚Äù. I was really annoyed because I didn‚Äôt ask, so I responded, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt flatter yourself‚Äù because i was the one who was more hesitant about dating. Within the same week he hard launches his new girlfriend that I knew nothing about it. All I knew is the timeline was making sense to me. I was pissed and decided i didn‚Äôt want to talk about it (message received) and was hoping eventually he‚Äôd reach out to make things right when he came home. Well he came home and would bump into my friends (we are in the same friend group) and he would say to them, ‚ÄúHow is she? I feel bad about what happened. I hope she isn‚Äôt mad at me etc‚Äù My friends would always tell him reach out and apologize and he said he would but I never received a text. This really annoyed me because it shows he knew it was fucked up but didn‚Äôt care enough to say anything, he only wanted to save face to his friends. I‚Äôve gotten over him since, to be completely honest i‚Äôm really upset about he treated me rather than mourning this ‚Äúrelationship.‚Äù All this anger came up recently because he showed up a conference I was helping to run. I can‚Äôt go into details but it was incredible inappropriate, especially because he needed special training to be there. This felt like the biggest betrayal because it really caught me off guard, him being in my space uninvited. I was livid but didn‚Äôt want to text him and make it seem
like I care. So my best friend (21F) texted him(in the same friend group) and told he shouldn‚Äôt have gone to the conference. He just never responded. How do I reckon with this rage I feel for him? Should I reach out? I really want him to suffer for this. I think about how I can get my revenge but i‚Äôm not sure the best way. I hate him but I want him to apologize.",I can‚Äôt get over my anger towards my ‚Äúex‚Äù,18mzv8s,1703092877.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mzv8s/i_cant_get_over_my_anger_towards_my_ex/,
"So I was dating my co-worker for a few months. She was both my first date, and my first kiss.

She said that while I was cute and she really liked me, she doesn‚Äôt believe in monogamy and she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship yet. I tried to read between the lines, and I asked if she wanted to be FWB. She turned that down, all good tho.

I guess she still really liked me as a friend, and I could make her laugh, so she wanted to keep being best friends at work. She would always come sit next to me at lunch which was cool.

So these are sort of the building blocks of what happened‚Ä¶

-She scrolls through sex ads while work, and talks to me about answering them

-Says that she misses doing sex work

-She thinks sex work is a fine thing to do

-She said she‚Äôs in a place where she doesn‚Äôt have to do that for money if she doesn‚Äôt want to

-She said she would totally answer them, if it weren‚Äôt for being potentially murdered by a stranger

-She repeatedly stated that she wasn‚Äôt joking


So on what ended up being my last day at work, she says ‚Äúhey look, someone will pay $200 for me to do XYZ, etc.‚Äù

I say I‚Äôd pay her 500 or like a grand. She called me out on that. I apologized, and told her I‚Äôd quit my job and leave her alone.

This led to her going to HR and getting me flagged for sexual misconduct and fired.


So about 6 months later, I ask if she would like to talk about what happened. (I text her first, saying that we don‚Äôt have to talk at all if she doesn‚Äôt want to, since I didn‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable. She says yes she wants to talk.)


She doesn‚Äôt reach out for a week, so I go and ask if she still wants to talk. I tell her that my autism makes it difficult to read cues, and it‚Äôs totally cool if she doesn‚Äôt want to talk or ever see me again. She says sorry ADHD made me forget, and that she really does want to talk, and she‚Äôll reach out in a couple of months.

I come back &gt;3 months later to see if she wants to talk now, or if she wants me to go away. She says yes, I‚Äôll text you later.

She texts me saying I‚Äôm harassing her, and that if I reach out again, she‚Äôll call the police. I didn‚Äôt respond to that text, and deleted her number. I‚Äôll leave her alone.


I feel awful about the whole thing. I‚Äôm nauseous and I fucking hate myself. I got abused before, so I wanted my first time to be with someone I was comfortable with, but I was so fucking selfish that I was willing to pester someone else for something like that. I feel like an irredeemable piece of shit.","I did a terrible thing, and I don‚Äôt know what to do",18mztds,1703092752.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mztds/i_did_a_terrible_thing_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,

I love my partner so much hes and amazing man and dad, he works to provide and stresses like every man would, he does the dishes helps me around the house cleaning, bins, recycling, etc. But I feel like I cant satisfy him as I have a low labido. I suffer with depression and emotional disregulation and the doctor put me on fluoxetine, i know that that can lower labido. I feel like I'm useless as a partner/wife. I love my family but i cant help feel the way I do. my partner has brought it up that I am distancing myself. But to be honest I dont think I have. I havent changed what I do or how I do it. I provide main care for our LO she does go to preschool while shes in preschool i walk the dog 3 milea and do a few simple chores for those 2 and half hours. I just dono what to do nor how I should feel. this isn't the first time my partners brought up that we arnt having sex regularly. Before you say hes toxic hes not he has a normal labido. Before our LO was born we had it a few times a week to nearly every day but since she was born its droped and I think we have it every 2-4 weeks now if that.

"I just got my last report card of the year and I'm through, I passed my grade. The issue is that my grades this time were really bad, like really really bad, why so? Because I practically knew I would go through, so I relaxed these last couple of months.

This isn't even the worst part, I knew my grades would be really bad, but I kind of forgot that my parents are really strict about my grades (I've been spanked a couple of times for getting a bad grade in a test), so now I'm really afraid of what's going to happen. (I did tell some of my family that my grades were going to be bad because I relaxed, but I can't remember if I told my parents about it). 

They're really strict about these types of things, they're really really demanding.

"I feel so tired of living but I feel like I shouldn't be. I live a comfy life for the most part. I grew up in a toxic household but thankfully that ended around 2020 when my parents separated but my childhood consisted a lot of my parents arguing and some domestic abuse here and there. I'm pretty sure I used games as a distraction as a kid and still do.  
  
I honestly feel like a big POS. I graduated high school and didn't really know what to do with my life. I expressed to my older brother that I wanted to take a gap year and see where I wanted to go but I remember he told me ""Only losers take gap years, you need to go to college"". So that's what I did. Signed an apartment with 2 friends and majored in CS at my state college. I hated the school work. I grew depressed and anxious and stopped doing the school work. I would go to lectures to just go and drift off. I just didn't want to do anything. At the same time, I ran into a health issue. I went to the ER cause I was paralyzed and I was diagnosed with Hyperthyroid. A fucking old woman disease I'm pretty sure I got from my aunt at 19 years old and male. Sucks, but whatever I'm on meds now and have stabilized. After failing my first college semester, I called my dad and cried to him how I couldn't do it anymore. While my peers were during their spring semester, I sat in my apartment depressed. Occasionally hanging out with my friends, but usually just playing games in my dark room. No direction, had no idea what to do with my life.  
  
I started having major anxiety problems in the summer after I figured out that my tuition bill had been sent to collections. These next situations I explain are gonna make me seem really stupid (because I was and am) but I understand people make mistakes and ultimately learning from them and growing is the only thing you can do with them. I basically didn't pay the bill during the semester and never knew withdrawing was a thing. I honestly don't know what was doing through my head thinking I could just ignore it. I made a plan and talked to my dad about it. I enrolled into my community college to pursue an AAS in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Computer Programming. I got a part time job at Walmart to pay off the tuition. I'm doing all this while working through the feeling of anxiety and unsureness.  
  
I hurt my leg while lifting a fucking case of water bottles. After a month of working, I quit because I'm physically unable. It's been 3 months and I'm still injured. I've been going to physical therapy. Luckily all my school works online so I don't have to worry about commuting and stuff.  
  
But I'm just so tired man. I don't know anymore. I don't know what to do or where I'm gonna be in the future. I understand if I just put my head down and worked and did my school work I can push through this but I just don't feel like pushing anymore. I don't know whats right or wrong to do. I feel like such a piece of shit because I don't have any motivation or drive to pursue anything beyond an associates degree. I feel like a piece of shit because my dad pays for my rent and tuition. I can't help but think but how dumb I am and these decisions I made. I don't know why I thought I could the ignore the tuition. I don't know why I decided to listen to my brother instead of doing what I want. I don't know what I'm doing in this apartment still. I don't have a fucking functioning left leg and was taken out by a 40 bottle case of water at 19 years old and have an autoimmune disease middle aged woman get. I understand I sound like a little whiny idiot but this is just my frustration built up. I feel so shit. I expressed to my dad I felt like a burden to him but he told me ""Money can be replaced but I cannot replace you"" and I just felt like dying. I told him when I move back, I'll do all the yard work and house cleaning so he can relax when he comes from work. When I look at him he looks so tired, and it's made me realize how much he's sacrificed to raise me and my brothers while going through a toxic relationship while also being an immigrant. I want to retire my parents but I don't know how realistic that is. My mom is poor and lives paycheck to paycheck and lives with my grandma and my dad works so much hours to provide while I'm here doing jackshit. I can't handle all the pressures of life. I don't even know if I'm ready to pay my own health insurance.  
  
It's like every worry is in my head. When my parents die, can I afford rent? Can I afford insurance? I just want to sleep in my dark room all day. I go to sleep excited for the nothingness and wake up wondering why I have to think again. I understand my situation is very very good compared to other people who have it worse, but I can't help but feel this way. I don't know if there's a point anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to dig a hole and live in it forever. Life seems so difficult right now when I have the least amount of responsibilities, I don't know where I'll be in the future. I'm just scared.

"A year ago I bought my sibling a beautiful ring-neck parakeet.

They'd had a bird a while ago and had been spending a lot of time researching and looking at these birds but had no means of acquiring one.

My sibling has a lot of social anxiety and other issues but has always been fond of animals. The whole family thought a parrot would help them with some of these issues. This was where I am to blame as I should never have put an animal in this situation.

Along with the parrot we bought them a ¬£1k massive  cage and filled it with toys and enough food to last a month or two. The bird was young and would need a lot of socialising.

I live on the other side of the country so after a week, I left quite happy that my sibling would be taking care of the bird.

I asked about it every time I called and slowly over months the talk about the bird was less enthused. 

So I came over to visit this Christmas. I went to see the bird and tbh I've been here two days stewing in absolute rage. I'm trying not to explode. I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable but all I feel is rage.

Of all the toys we bought the bird, a year later he has four in his cage and one perch, all in the same space they were put in. The bottom of the cage is filthy and his water bowl clearly not regular changed. Further, the bird looks dreadful and panics at the sight of me, it's like no effort to train or socialise it has occurred. I'm so so fucking angry. Further my siblings room is thick with dust and rubbish.

My sibling says ""I don't think it's happy, I want it but it's not happy."" Why the fuck do you think you waste of spunk!?

I angrily told them to clean the cage and they said, ""why does everyone tell me what to do?""

I'm furious.

I talked to my dad about it when he said I seem upset, he just went silent and changed the topic. My mom, said she'd do more for the bird, she's disabled and I didn't buy the bird for her. My sibling is thirty, works three days a week and does fuck all.

I'm so pissed.

I told him it needs to be taken to a rescue. He agreed but no one has done anything about it.

I want to call them myself but I keep getting ignored by all. Why is no one talking about what to do!? Why can no one look me in the eye and fucking discuss this!

I'm remaining calm when I talk to them but stern on how cruel and neglected this bird is and that is ignoring the fact I paid a lot of money for it and TRUSTED it would be well cared for.

I was thinking of taking it but it would be cruel as I own cats.

I'm leaving soon and stressed this poor bird will be living in that barren cage in filth because these lot are useless, so I have no choice but to be the villain and make the call to find it a home.

I have half a mind to return their presents and use the money to donate to a bird rescue just to spite them. I don't understand how they could do this.

Three adults in one home, could not one of them find any compassion.

Edit to add if not clear: I am absolutely not leaving the bird, I've found a parakeet sanctuary and will take the bird there. I think due to it hurting itself, it needs some specialized care and attention. I will also make sure to donate to the sanctuary and expect my sibling to as well for what they have done. After that, I don't know if I could talk to them again.",My sibling neglects their pet and I'm angry that people don't care or do anything about it.,18myazs,1703088906.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18myazs/my_sibling_neglects_their_pet_and_im_angry_that/,
"Hello, last night my girlfriend (F:23) (M:24)  told me she used to be involved in sex work.

"First, I have been feeling off about a few things and one day her phone was unlocked and I looked at a lot of things. 

Second, girlfriend is in quotes bc we have not verbally committed. We have been sleeping with each other exclusively, saying I love you, with each other every night, and been clear that talking to other people is inappropriate. 

We talked about her and her ex. She said she could still be cool with him. And in her phone she did message him setting a boundary about not bringing up reconciliation because that has sailed. However I saw she had called him and talked for an hour and he invited her to a holiday party and she said she may show up. 

I feel like this is something she should‚Äôve shared with me and I haven‚Äôt been told anything. 

She also lied about the timeline of dealing with someone. Weeks before she met me she was actually intimate with someone. And apparently they had history, but this time was just fwb. He was actually married and she found out and it ended a few weeks before we met. However when I asked who she dealt with before me she claims for months she was alone dealing with no one. And when I asked her specifically about that person, she lied as well. 

Finally, she told me there‚Äôs someone she works with who they messed around years ago. She says they are friends and he does get her a lot of gigs for her business and sends money her way. So she wants to keep the friendship. She asked me how I felt and I said, as long as it is platonic it‚Äôs fine. Well, although on her end it is he does text ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, I miss you, and call her babe. She doesn‚Äôt reciprocate at all and will stop texting when he says stuff like that to her credit. She also talks to him when I‚Äôm not around AND she will go out to dinner with him after work if she and I are beefing typically. 

We‚Äôve been dating going on 6 months. She‚Äôs not sleeping with anyone from what I see.

I just wonder why she doesn‚Äôt want to tell me these things or having these inappropriate dealings. I am not her typical type by age or look, and I think that may be stirring something up in me and maybe I‚Äôm a placeholder/experiment for her.

 Idk if she has feelings for her ex, and hoping she can get over him, our situation did move fast (although everything I get in moves fast) ‚Äî is there something here? Do I let this go? Are these not relationship breaking?

Me (24F) &amp; my partner (25F) have been together for almost 2 years. Lived together all except a few months, everything was really well at the start (as always) but things slowly have become worse, she suffers from ADHD &amp; Anxiety ect but we also both think it‚Äôs been wrongly diagnosed &amp; more on the fact of BPD or Bipolar but she also has been put on dexies which has 1 made her lose weight which she liked.. 2 gives her a high to match her brain &amp; she self diagnosed herself to take more than prescribed just to keep that feeling going &amp; now without them feels like utter shit. She also blames a lot of her actions which aren‚Äôt all about having mental problems &amp; taking pills about the way she acts on having them things wrong. 

We began have a bit of an off put for a bit, I think it was the spending too much time together, which was an easy fix, my mum then suddenly passed away, broke me &amp; also made me quite inpatient &amp; angry at the world, not her but the world &amp; down in the dumps. I would be told I‚Äôm being a burden cause I‚Äôm constantly unhappy &amp; don‚Äôt take medication to fix my problems was the apparent case. Now after that any conversation I have is preplanned in her head that I am not interested or shitty at her for something? I speak &amp; feel good but get shut down on &amp; told I am acting badly before a conversation has already begun since it‚Äôs been pre planned in her head. I also get told how I‚Äôm feeling about situations without actually saying I am feeling that way, it annoys me as I wouldn‚Äôt be feeling like that but being told I am feeling how I am not or would react how I am not is just exhausting as I feel like I can‚Äôt think or be my own way. 

Not long after my mum passed we had an argument over her sending naked photos to a long term male friend who she use to flirt &amp; send things to in the past ‚Äúto make work easier‚Äù she had also been just genuine friends with this person&amp; had not been talking/doing them things whilst we were together but she did in a cry for help ‚Äúmiss how I use to look‚Äù attention to her friend. Which I got the blame of ‚Äúbeing on her phone‚Äù for it &amp; that I‚Äôve seen it not how it was it wasn‚Äôt sexual ect. I said I don‚Äôt care how it was it was plainly disrespectful to me, our relationship &amp; also the man‚Äôs relationship that he is in (though he doesn‚Äôt care) &amp; his child. Anyway. Trust broken from that moment quite a bit, I offered that we need to build the relationship again showing trust, keeping to her word &amp; no white lies &amp; being open with me &amp; including me. 

Which is also a problem is her obsession with money spending.. I had always wanted a dachshund for years, I own a big mastiff x kelpie (WillowF8) since she was 6 weeks old, she came with me to live with her, my partner was not a dog person at all, had trouble but opened up a bit to Willow &amp; that felt nice. 
After my mum passed away, she randomly said to come with her after work &amp; we are getting  sausage dog, both working in mining close to home we make enough money to care for these animals by the way. But that was great, surprising but good. Not long afterwards they became an obsession to her &amp; she brought 3 more in a span of 5 months, 12K spent on sausage dog puppies that weren‚Äôt getting there one on one time they needed as babies before another one came in too so it was a struggle, she also isn‚Äôt a dog person so she doesn‚Äôt actually know how to train a dog &amp; treats them like babies. So they don‚Äôt get the proper training they need from both sides so it ends up not working good. We did sell one of the dogs to a lovely couple who had the time care &amp; love for her &amp; was wonderful to see her go to be so happy. But couldn‚Äôt tempt her that the others were a bit too much, they require a lot &amp; I don‚Äôt blame them for that they‚Äôre puppies but my partners mental health doesn‚Äôt help with dealing with them properly. 

Also just things like maxxing out her afterpay then maxxing mine out without me knowing, splurge spending on anything (new tv, a million things for the dogs, getting a 40k car loan, personalised plates for it that weren‚Äôt what we had discussed, selling the other car we had when we needed two &amp; plenty more) 

Our days are filled with arguments if I bring up something isn‚Äôt necessary to buy or to put some money away for a few weeks to then buy something worth a few thousand rather than spend it right then &amp; there because we just have enough at that point of time. I‚Äôm ‚Äústopping her‚Äù like everyone else in her life. 

We don‚Äôt communicate anything as if I start to express my feelings she doesn‚Äôt want to here it or says we can‚Äôt talk about it right now as she doesn‚Äôt want to, then she will go blurt everything she wants to say &amp; then shutdown again to not let me speak, if I do speak &amp; it‚Äôs not what she wants to here she just gets angry.

She wants a child, soon. She still acts like a kid in some ways &amp; she isn‚Äôt very mentally stable, money spending ect I say we should wait which pisses her off everytime &amp; if I don‚Äôt react like baby stuff is the greatest thing on the planet I don‚Äôt actually want a baby apparently. 

She wants to be proposed to, I would like to wait till we fix our self‚Äôs &amp; then our relationship a bit before that is done but then again the fact I haven‚Äôt yet spoken to her family about marrying her to brought one with the money from my mum passing already is depressing to her. 

We don‚Äôt have sex, her libido from her pills do make her not feel it as much, which is okay but we have done stuff maybe like twice in the past 6 months &amp; also if we do it always has to be if she is in the mood she gets it f she isn‚Äôt there is nothing I could to to make her feel in the mood, which then I get shamed for never initiating it but I have &amp; embarrassingly been just told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not horny‚Äù or ‚Äútired‚Äù every time. 

When she is feeling good &amp; we are getting along we get along like a fire in the bush, it‚Äôs great! We have laughs we connect &amp; we have something special. 

But it‚Äôs constantly backfired 

I also do things like massage her or play with her hair &amp; alll the nice things, I also do all the acting in sex, but I don‚Äôt get anything in return, I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs a phobia of giving people massages ect. 

She has a heart of gold but also the most selfish selfless person I‚Äôve ever met. She will do anything for anyone no matter how badly they‚Äôve treated her but also the ones who love her she will belittle.

I have no family in this town

"I've never really been genuinely loved or complimented by someone in my life as I had abusive parents who didn't let me really have friends or let me hang out. I didn't have any siblings or extended relatives to really hang out and I wasn't allowed to date, so I never really had anyone show genuine care for me. My parents didn't let me choose where to go to college or even grad school. I had to go to the local school because I got a full scholarship and was forced to stay there for grad school as well because they thought it would mean that they wouldn't have to co-sign loans and so they could control every aspect of my life. That led to having no friends or self-esteem and basically would get a positive interaction with someone who's ""close"" only to get used for something at the end whether it was at school or at home. The kicker is that they started making me cook for myself at age 12 and went to parent-teacher conferences to only say that I wasn't a good kid even though I had good grades and stuff. Never was told ""good job"" or anything but it wasn't the harsh stuff that strict parents would try to do so that their kid would try harder. It was like they didn't even care for me and wanted no responsibility but they forced me to do stuff they wanted me to do. They only let me work a part-time job during high school so I could have money for lunch money and buy my own phone or laptop.  You could think that because I'm now old enough that I can say that I'm moving out and they can't stop me but I have such low self-esteem that I can't really stand up for myself and they have control over every aspect in my life that it would be really hard to do so up until this point and I didn't have the money.

Starting in grad school, I started to hide money from them and once every while, I would use some of the funds to sneak out of the house for extended weekend trips to cities claiming that I had a workshop/conference/seminar. But really, it was to escape them and have a mental breather before having to go back. I also started to use dating apps when I'm on these trips. I didn't really have success until last night when I met this girl. We talked about vintage stuff and really hit it off dinner and we ended up back at the place I was staying. She kept showing me love and I almost broke down in the middle and she asked why. I opened up a little and she said that she can be there for me whenever I needed. We talked about our backgrounds and she was from the complete opposite and just bonded, talking all night. I woke up this morning and impulsively asked if she wanted to go out with me exclusively and to my surprise, she said that without any hesitation that she would want to be with me. That was six months ago and we're going strong and today we both agreed about getting a place together now that we both have enough money saved up and it's a thrill that I finally have a full way out of my old life.  

I wanted to get this off my chest because this is a real milestone in my life. Going 20+ years without someone caring about my feelings or really loving me to finally meeting that someone special and it feels unreal that every day I have someone who genuinely cares what I did that day and how I'm feeling.

"We met online, we both went into it knowing it was going to be short term as they were only here for a week or so but I don't think either of us expected to get on so well. We went to a bar one night and in the blink of an eye it had been 5 hours, after the place got too busy we went and walked around for a bit, all of a sudden it had been another 2 hours and it was 1.30am. We spoke about her work, how she was only here for another week and that early next year shes leaving for another country for 8 months. We both wanted to see eachother again so we sorted out another date the next day.

The next day we spent some time together going around some shops and just walking around before going back to my place and we watched a film. We cuddled and made out a bit and talked a lot and that was it. I walked her to the train station and bought a ticket to her first stop just to spend some more time with her. We spoke about her spending the night at mine the following day and we were clearly both looking forward to it. My train back arrived before hers so we kissed eachother goodbye and she watched me get on the train and we waved as the train pulled out.

The next day she said that she was going to explore the town she was staying in and then come over to mine later in the day. She sent me a text letting me know that she was back home and I replied saying ""hurry up and get here then"". She then sent me a text saying that she's been thinking about it alot and doesnt think its a good idea. Seeing me again would just make when she leaves on Thursday even more difficult. I spent some time trying to convince her that we should give it a go but she said that she has had bad experiences with long distance and that shes also never gone more than a short amount of time without a boyfriend and wants to see what thats like. I understood what she was feeling and told that I'd had an amazing weekend and asked her to let me know if anything changes.

This has absolutely destroyed me, I've never felt like this about someone before and especially not this quick. My last girlfriend and I were together almost 3 years and I never felt this way, not even once. She leaves tomorrow and all I want to do is reach out and make some stupid romantic gesture like in the movies but I know theres no point. I'm not built for long distance and it would be silly to commit to long distance after only a couple of dates.

I've spoken to friends since the start where they said ""Dont get too attached"" and now they say just to let it be but I just feel that something is meant to happen between us someday. I just dont know what to do about it. Do we just go radio silence, try to get on with our lives and hope that in a years time one of us reaches out? or do we try and keep in contact occasionally and see what happens. I obviously want to do the latter but don't know if thats smart.

"Slight trigger warning: mentions of grape and abuse !!! 

So my brother (21m) has ALWAYS been the only boy. We had not father, no other brothers, no uncles, no cousins, no grandpa. So you could imagine how lonely he‚Äôs felt all these years. I like to believe I tried my best to make him feel included (playing video games with him, taking the same in try with him, play cars with him etc.) and to add onto this, me, my mother and sister did let him get away with some things and gave him space away from the ‚Äúgirly‚Äù things. Ultimately, we did what we could to make him feel included, but that didn‚Äôt work.

Letting him get away with things and isolate himself might have been a horrible mistake, now he‚Äôs a jealous, abusive, selfish, self-entitled jerk who doesn‚Äôt understand how to treat women. For starters, if you even THINK about sharing you accomplishments, he would make it about himself so fast and turn it into a sob story. It made sharing ANY good news difficult. He would give and give, like give hundreds of dollars to people, or always drive people around, but if you set a boundary, he would take that ALL away. A good example is he would take a friend of his to work almost everyday. She respected him and acknowledged his boundaries, but when she set a boundary (to stop coming into her house randomly without asking) he stopped taking her to work and told her to find her own way to work.

When I set a boundary for him (not to get into my relationship issues) he blew up and called me ‚Äúfull of myself‚Äù and other hurtful things. He continued to be friends with my emotionally abusive ex and my highschool bully who dated girls WAY younger than him, pulled a pew pew on his wife AND graped a girl.

"There are events that separate life into before/after. Weddings, children being born, heartbreak. For me, it was a suicide.

Couple years back I had just started working as an EMT. The ink on my card was still wet and I was nieve as to what the world held. I was 20, still in college, and hadn‚Äôt yet had the smile wiped off my face. 

I was sitting on the couch at the station when the tones dropped: ‚ÄúEMS 1 respond to (local hotel) for the suicide‚Äù

Lights.
Sirens.
The ding of the elevator doors opening.

I walked into the hotel room and experienced what I can only describe as an sense of duty mixed with dread and dissociation.

A police officer stood at the foot of the bed. Laying peacefully was a young woman, hands crossed over her lap, her torso propped up by a couple pillows, chunky headphones on her head. For a moment I misinterpreted the officers lack of concern as reassurance that the woman was okay. 

CNN softly played in the background. It‚Äôs interesting what you remember, no?

She was pale as a ghost except for the tips of her fingers and lips which had turned jet black. The darkness had begun to seep down her fingers like ink on wet paper. Dried vomit caked her chin. 

Touching the dead is unnerving. A room temperature table feels like wood, a door handle feels like metal. A body sucks your warmth like ice. 

On the table next to her was her ID, a bottle of vodka, and pills. Under her ID was were two phone numbers to contact, one listed ‚Äúdad‚Äù and the other ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù. 

Her ID showed an attractive, bright, smiling young woman. The type of girl guys flock to. I still remember her name.

Next to the ID was about $50 in cash with a note ‚Äúfor whoever found me‚Äù, as though a few bills could undo any of this. 

Next to the floor to ceiling windows which overlooked the city across the river were several manilla envelopes each labeled for family members.

We pronounced, put our gear back in the truck, and I cried.

Since this call I‚Äôve responded to several other suicides: more overdoses, jumpers, a man hit by a train. But this one stuck. Partly because it was the first, but more so because it was clinical. Planned out like a permanent vacation.

For a week i couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I vividly found myself in her room again. If I did fall asleep I would wake up with my heart pounding from a nightmare or jolt up in a cold sweat thinking that she was standing over me. Eventually this subsided.

I‚Äôve suffered from depression over the course of my entire life. Suicides are the worst calls to respond to.

"Folks. I‚Äôm not proud of what has happened and Reddit is likely not the best place to go about asking for advice, but I need to get this off my chest. 

I (23F) went out with a few of my guy friends last night and got absolutely sloshed. My boyfriend (24M) and I have been long distance because of our careers in really different fields, and there hasn‚Äôt been an opening that we could make work to live together right now. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs easy to see where this is going. I had far too many drinks, so did one of my coworkers, and we end up making out all night. 

I should definitely tell my boyfriend, right? I feel like an awful person. We‚Äôre planning a future together, and I might‚Äôve thrown it away for one drunken kiss. The worst part is, maybe I‚Äôm not sober enough yet, but coworker seems like a good match. I hate to say that. Sometimes it just feels like my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt exist because long distance is so hard, and I think it just all came to a head last night. 

Anyway, I expect to get torn apart if this gets comments. I did cheat, after all. I know I‚Äôll feel terrible about it. So what should I do? 

Do I tell boyfriend and let him decide where our relationship goes, stay quiet (probably not a good option), or do I have to end it? I just never thought I would be the one cheating.

"Hi. Recently my wife was sexually assaulted. The man who sexually assaulted her was a personal friend of ours and also happened to be my wife's RMT. The event happened at the clinic he works out of.

I won't go into details because it's unnecessary but I've done a little research and discovered that it is actually quite common for woman to freeze up when things like this happen and my wife was pretending to be asleep so I don't even think the man in question is aware that she even experienced the whole ordeal.

Before she told me about it she asked me to promise that I wouldn't do anything drastic and that I would let her process and deal with it in her own way. To give some perspective, I have a significant history of violence that almost ruined my life but I haven't so much as flicked someone for more than a decade.

I am really fighting with myself to stay calm. It's all made worse by the fact that I know where this man lives and I keep thinking to myself ""he and my wife were the only ones present. It's all hearsay if she exposes him so I need to deal with this my way before he gets away with it"" but I have so far managed to talk myself down.

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? Ever since I learned of this I have felt and almost uncontrollable rage and the only things keeping me from acting on it are the promise I made to my wife and the potential impact it could have on my daughter.

"Just to premise, I (F19)  have no actual plans to take this action it‚Äôs just something that I‚Äôve been feeling for a while. I‚Äôve always been an anxious person. I think it may have started when I was told as a child (5-7) that police were supposed to help people but then my dad got arrested quite violently in front of me and I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on (I recently found out it was for having a weed business). A year later my dad was put in prison for murder and I didn‚Äôt see him for over a year. I felt like the world was taking my dad away and that if this can happen to him it can happen to me so I thought everyone had it out for me. This anxiety then morphed into a fear of being known. I didn‚Äôt want people to talk to me, think about me, or even know I existed. I would have friends but never anyone close who I felt completely safe telling them my secrets, so I was lonely all of the time.
This loneliness and self isolation led to me having an attempt when I was 14, I didn‚Äôt tell anyone for 2 days. The only reason I didn‚Äôt do it was bc I was worried that my younger brother was going to be the one to find me and I didn‚Äôt want to do that to him. No one acted differently to me after. Which makes it seem like I wanted attention but I just wanted to know that at least someone might miss me if I died but I guess not. This attempt actually gave my mum ammunition to be cruel to me. If my anxiety was too strong for me to even leave my bed she would say things like ‚ÄúI guess you should have been successful at dying‚Äù or ‚Äúkill yourself then‚Äù. This fucked me up so bad that I‚Äôve actually had another attempt when I was 16 that I haven‚Äôt actually told anyone about, I just woke up after taking half. A box of sleeping pills and decided next time would be the time.
After that I wasn‚Äôt functional, I would only leave the house for school and even then I was having panic attacks daily, it was so bad that I wasn‚Äôt even sleeping for days at a time. I managed to find a doctor that got me on some meds and I was doing really good. I got my drivers licence, had a boyfriend, graduated school, got into uni. But after getting into uni my life has gone down hill.
It was going fine for the first couple of months, but then I developed a binge eating disorder. I‚Äôve always been a heavy person but just this year I‚Äôve gone from 100 to 150kgs. I feel like shit and I‚Äôve been trying to cut back but I‚Äôm stressed all of the time and that is my main trigger. I also keep getting these deep existential dread episodes where I have panic attacks about how I need to find a job since I‚Äôm an adult now but that means I will then spend over 40hrs a week, every week for the rest of my life at a job I will hate only to not be able to afford to live. Like the idea that I will only spend 12hrs a day at home with 8 of them sleeping for the rest of my life sounds awful. I also don‚Äôt even know what I want to do and people I know are finding their thing.

For context I‚Äôm 16F and I‚Äôm currently taking the IB curriculum. Recently we had our second summative assessments.
I was studying really hard for the math exam, and a day before in my math tution class, I was getting all of the hardest questions right.

But in the day of the exam I just freaked out. It was a 50 minute exam with 2 separate papers. Paper 1 went black for a good 20 minutes. The worst part was that the paper was really easy. I could tell it was easy but I was so freaked out. My breathing got heavier and my head just was empty. Once the paper was done I could tell I did dogshit. I came home and sobbed for hours.

Why did that happen? I studied so hard. Why did that happen? I knew everything on that paper. Why did that happen? Am I stupid or something.

This isn‚Äôt a one time thing. I feel like no matter how prepared I am for math I‚Äôm never good enough at it. I just decided one day that I suck at the subject and ever since then I‚Äôve just rolled with it.

"Literally I cannot take it anymore, my parents are so shit they are shit to me and my sister but my sister is little ungrateful shit and doesnt appreciate how much I do to her.  
I will vent a bit sorry I am just done with them. (Idk if TW is needed but TW: physical abuse)

  
My parents had a lot of money when I was born because they had a fast food in touristy area so until my 4th year we would travel a lot, but then my mom got pregnant and when I was 5 my sister was born. The same year the city decided to build a parking lot in a place of  my family's fast food. I was 5 year old and for 2 years I had to do everything, cook clean, watch the baby sleep, and I thought our neighbour was my father, I called him dad till I was 7 and went to elementary school. I if didnt get the highest grade my mother would slap me multiple times, pull my ear and tell me that I want to be the worst. All that for getting 4 (B) and I would sometimes get a 3 (C) and I would stall going home because I was so scared. In I think 3rd grade I got a 2(D) and I didnt tell my mother because teaher said that she will not put the grade into a gradebook if we get a better grade the next day. I got 2 again, and I remember asking if I can go to the bathroom and just crying and shaking. I had to do all my homework alone and when asked for help from any of the parents it would always be ÀùWe dont understand that we cant helpÀù or a lecture about the other kids in class not asking for help and doing everything alone.

  
My dad was still so distant and we didnt spend much time but anytime they would cook something I dont like and I didnt finish the plate he would always beat me and say  that he would get rid of me if I dont finish the plate. And once when he was drunk his friend came and he told me to get another glass and I broke it, he launched at me and I went into my room and locked the door. I was screaming and crying, and he kicked the door until it fell of (not even a hole in them they just fell of from the wall) and picked me up and threw me on the floor and kicked me, and he was not stopping until my grandma entered and stopped him. No one else was doing anything. I still remember that day and his face and every time he gets mad and makes that face I get so fucking scared.

  
Now in fifth grade I was falling behind in math and english, and anytime I would ask if I can get a tutor or something ÀùNo moneyÀù or  ÀùYou can do it aloneÀù. And I just couldnt, every grade that was higher than 2 my english teacher would say ÀùMore luck than witÀù and would make fun of my mistakes in front of a class and in 8th grade when I didnt have any mistake she read my paper 5 times just to find a mistake that's how much she hated me. And for my math teacher she ignored me until I broke down once and only then she gave attention to me. And my parents did not care about me whatsoever because my sister started shcool.

  
No yelling, no granding, no beating, helping her, and even doing her homework. Praising her for bare minimum. When I was in highschool guess who did her math and english homework? Me. My exams or homework didnt matter ÀùCome help your sisterÀù.

I also started working as a 12 years old, and I would stand all day in the sun during summer for 20 euros and ever since that summer I worked all summers not because for myself but so they wouldnt need to spend on me. Clothes? I buy myslef. Food for school. My money. They need to go to a fancy dinner ÀùHoney could you lend us some moneyÀù. All jobs chosen by them all in the sun. But my sister is now 14 and didnt even work this summer in a store with AC when I said they are looking for workers and that I know the girl whose mother runs the store. Why? Cuz she is too young.

  
Now I'm in college and I'm struggling to read all the books and write all my papers and yesterday I came home at 21 and I had a test this morning and I wanted to prepare but no I had to spend 2 hours translating and writting how it's pronounced for my sister cuz she had two 1(F) in english and 3 more form other classes. And I said ÀùI'm done with your last text here is the translation and on the other side is how you pronounce it.Àù And went into my room, I didnt eat and now I didnt have any energy to prepare for it and just went to bed. I did my exam and I actually think I did good but we'll see.  
And I just came home and my mother comes screaming at me for not helping my sister properly because she got three more 1s and didnt fix the other two from english. And I didnt even have anything to do with another 3 classed I didnt even know. So I try to explain that I didnt know about the other things she needs and that I only knew of english. My mother just ignored me and called me all kind of names and I blew up and said that I'm not her teacher, I am not her mother, nor her father, and that I am tired and stressed and that they dont give a crap about me because I actually worked on myself instead of always crying for help and that now they think everything comes easy for me.

  
AND MY GOD DAMN SISTER comes at me screaming how I dont know how it's in her life and how her childhood was horrible and that I traveled all across the country and she didnt. (This is true because we didnt have the money after her birth also 2008 yk how it went) She then said she never had a good childhood like me and that everyone hates her and my mother was on her side saying dumb stuff how I dont want to put myself in her shoes. And I then started screaming at the two of them and reminding my mother of all beatings I endured and my father gets up and asks me in this horrible tone ( I dont know how to describe it but it was like making fun of me) ÀùWhat beatings?Àù and started laughing and bringing how he was in war and how his father used to punish him and that I should be grateful of what they did to me and that I live in their house and that I should go Àôuck myself.

  
And I just went into my room I am so done with them. What did I ever do for them to hate me so much. I am so frustrated right now my head is full of horrible thoughts I just cant anymore.  
I know my sister didnt have the best childhood and that she is kind of distant from our mother and I am not saying she deserved what I went through, I dont wanna be my father. I just think her treatment of me is unfair. She is 14 years old and I feel like at her age I could grasp the head around the fact that others can have it bad too but she is so out of touch.

"Edit title: boss 31M 

Not sure how to tag my last post but I'm sure you'll find it since it's my only one I posted ever.

I made this account so I can share my story with you and get it off my chest, because I know IT guys from the company I worked in scroll through reddit and could find the post under my real nickname.

So many people reacted to my post, so I'd like to inform you about what happened after it. I warn you, it¬¥s going to be a long post.

I'd like to add that the morning after it happened I had a really bad hangover and covers of the bed were covered in my blood... I went out and cried... called my sister-in-law who I was pretty close to. She told me that this stuff happens, two people get drunk and have sex... so I just didn't think it was an SA. I took a pill ""after sex"" just for sure even though he ""pulled out on time"" as he said.

Well, you know how I said it wasn't an SA and how it's my fault it happened? Yes I thought I provoked him but most of the memories from the night are just really painful, also it's one of the first things he told me. I was in a really really bad mental state of mind and after it happened, I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, I was pale and people asked me if I was okay regularly. I was texting with my boss at the time after it happened and he acted like a piece of shit he is - gaslighting in every text and telling me how every men would do the same thing he did after I told him that I can't take it so I will quit my job and I got really really angry, he's lost all the authority respect from me and I couldn't take it anymore and told him I'll say anything just for him to leave me alone. He told me that I'm acting in extreme measures.

I kept telling myself ""it's my own fault I got drunk"".

I really wanted to tell someone from the company. There was this girl, who works as a receptionist at the company and I hung out with her a few times before and I just felt like she was a good person, like I felt like she was the only one from the company who should know what happened. So I told her and ever since, she's been my support in life and one of my closest friends. She obviously didn't think what happened between me and my boss was okay and she was convinced it was an sexual assault. Unfortunately, where I live, sexual assault is a crime only when it's violent, so all I could do was report my boss to the company management (I didn't want to tell...) and leave.

At that time I gave my HR a notice. Notice period lasts two months.

I went to work a few times after the incident happened, but my colleagues noticed how sick I look, noticed that I no longer talk to my boss or go to lunch with him and I didn't want to say anything.

Well, the boss of my boss - let's call him M, asked for a meeting with me and discuss why I suddenly want to leave. At first I didn't want to tell the management but since he wants to know, I told myself I'll just tell him the truth.

There was one girl in particular, who also had talked to my boss. She and my boss had a history - let's call her B. B and my boss texted a bit. She is also married to a lawyer and she sent (a few months before this all happened) my boss pic in underwear AND HE SHOWED ME.... I didn't think very much of her... but after my incident, she looked at me really weird, so I thought that he might have told her. I told her, when I saw her in the company kitchen, that if she wants to talk she should just tell me, not just look at me weird everytime. After that, she contacted me and asked me to meet her after work, I agreed and told her the whole story. She said she didn't think he would ever do something like that and told me that she'll tell her husband to arrange a meeting with one of lawyers from her husband's company. I was hesitant, because I didn't want to pay anything and I still didn't think of it as a SA but she was trying to convince me a several days after I refused at first and because B told me she'll bring out the ""lawyer's wife card"" even though it could ruin her marriage and I wouldn't have to pay a thing. Though eventually I agreed after a lot of convincing from B.

After this I had meeting with M, HR employee and HR manager. I told them everything and M was furious and he immediately arranged a meeting with my boss and also B. Of course he hated the fact that we didn't have two rooms and told me that I should stay at home for a week.

When I had all of that free time I went to meet the lawyer B arranged meeting with (not B's husband, but a woman because I didn't want to talk to a man) and she told me that we should press charges and I should visit a therapist. Therapist told me that this was obviously a rape and that I was in no state of mind to give consent to sex. Also the laywer and the therapist both said that victims usually at first refuse to call it an SA and it takes a lot of time to for them to actually realise what happened and how they feel about it. I was only once on a session, because it was really expensive and I couldn't afford more sessions since I had to leave my job in a month.

I thought about it a lot and asked everyone close to me what they think about it and they all said but my sister-in-law I should follow my heart. My sister-in-law said that this shit happens and I shouldn't press charges, just reporting him at the company was enough. My mind was a complete mess, I told myself all the time that it wasn't an SA and I asked myself ""Would I say yes if I was sober or just a little bit tipsy?"", well the answer is NO and I never thought about doing it with MY BOSS. 

So I agreed to press charges, told the police and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. When I confessed about it in front of police officer I felt like I'll fall apart in a second. My friend (the receptionist) sat there with me and held my hand through it all. Then it all started. They interrogated literally every single person I talked about in the confession and also people who the interrogated people talked about. I felt terrible, like I've put a burden on every single person around me. Lots of them were supportive and didn't mind but I felt that they didn't like to being put through all this drama.

Few obviously thought that it's my fault I got drunk.

The company called and told me I'll work in a different workplace for the rest of the notice period so I wouldn't see my boss around. 

Rumours spread around, soon everyone knew what happened and they despised him for a while, some people didn't really care. It quickly changed because lots of people from work had to go through interrogation at a police station and they were really annoyed by it. My boss tried to show people text messages where I wrote that I'll say anything just to get him in trouble. 

I also found out that his girlfriend that broke up with him that year was abused by him for 10 years and was interrogated as well. She basically said that she wasn't that surprised he would rape someone just to get a trophy of a ""I fucked a gay girl"". (Funny thing is that this girl was a classmate of my lawyer in high school so they know each other)

My family except my brother and sister-in-law really supported me and that was really surprising because I didn't have good a relationship with them since my parents are unstable as hell... My sister-in-law basically cut off my brother a herself from our family because they ""support a lie"". She was interrogated as well and my lawyer told me she basically destroyed my chance to win.

I was a mess for a few months, couldn't find a job and then intense anxiety and panic attacks came. It was horrible. My roommate got fired so I had to borrow money from my friends just to pay rent...

So yeah, I lost the case.

My boss got demoted, he's not a boss anymore. He chose a new employee that helps him do the same job I did, they also forbid him to choose a girl.


I have a different roommate (a man from the company I worked in! And now he's my best friend. Never hit on me even though he's straight). I have a different job for 9 months now. I went to therapy few times, got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and I'll move to a different city in a few months for a better paying job. My (previous) boss sometimes tries to convince my friends (from the previous company) to hear his side of the story, but my friends couldn't care less.

My brother and his family won't talk to me but I texted him that I miss him and wished him happy birthday. He doesn't respond.

This year was a fucking rollercoaster let me tell you. But I'm greatful - it helped me find great people and I had wonderful rest of the year, honestly. I'm on antidepressants but I've never been better. Sometimes tho when I go out I fear I'll see him somewhere. Sometimes tho when someone looks remotely like him I get shivers and feel sick.

... but honestly, talking about my brother hurts the most. Even though this all happened, I feel like it's my fault my brother doesn't talk to my family anymore. I know it isn't but when I see my mom cry because of him, it feels terrible.

Thank you for all the responses in the previous post. I should've listened.

Edit: btw, I'm sure a lot of ppl will call out that I acted different in the first post, but you have to understand it was just a few days after it happened and it honestly feels like it wasn't written by me.

"Just to note there is discussion on sensitive topics such as eating disorders and alcoholism 

So for reference, I (20m) grew up very overweight and unhappy. I didn‚Äôt socialise and was jealous of others who would have fun and had been fit enough to enjoy staying active. Over the last 2 years I have transformed my life and lost 100 pounds, was feeling happy, and developed some amazing relationships. Last spring I really struggled with an ED and at one point quit my job in the service industry as a result. I became so fixated on dieting and had so much free time out of work that I filled with paralyzed thoughts of eating. Then people noticed and started showing concern.
I soon had a shift in perspective how bored and unhappy I had become so I went back to work and allowed myself more dietary freedoms. 
I am currently trying to be less restrictive but at the same time, I have also been socializing more. Going out for drinks, staying out late, and let‚Äôs just say when I have one drink I tend to binge eat as well. So now I‚Äôm seeing a reverse in all the progress I‚Äôve made and I am becoming very self destructive. I know I can‚Äôt rely on others to make my issues go away but I am feeling very unmotivated and scared.

"Long story story I dated my ex bf for 1.5 years. He was 23. He broke it off with me a month ago due to being in different paths in life? And it felt sudden. He had just told me that he wanted to talk and work on some things so it sounded like a more serious convo. But in his head he was going to end it, messed up right?
When I went on the first date with him things felt right, he came off as serious and respectful. Didn‚Äôt do or say anything to make me uncomfortable. Asked when he could see me again. And the rest was history. I met his mom like 2 weeks in and he made it official 3 weeks in. We hung out a lot.
He met my family I met his, went down to his hometown for the holidays etc etc. He seemed so serious about me! Would speak on our future and future kids, marriage, etc. And my stupid self fell for it and believed he was serious since he would say these things. However as the honey moon phase died off a bit I saw he was a financially unstable guy, in debt, who started doing less for me. The guy who I had met didn‚Äôt seem to be fully there and present with me anymore.
Would make snarky comments to me and sometimes get angry with me quick over stuff like how I drive or how I do something. Wouldn‚Äôt help me much around my apartment etc.
I started nursing school in august and ever since that things really declined. He pulled away from me and I don‚Äôt feel like he understood this would change our dynamic, as it‚Äôs a new priority in my life. But so was he. 
So I find out yesterday he apparently would tell me he was going to play poker which he was on nights I would be studying and this bartender girl told me he would flirt with her at work etc. They never did anything though and she got a bf a month ago and deleted him. 
This hurt, what he thought ended on good terms changed. I told him, unleashed my hurt, and the first thing he said is he should‚Äôve ended it months ago and in his head he was going to leave me in a few weeks anyways. I was speechless. I told his mom as his biological dad he never met cheated on his mom. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to be like his dad. 
This is all to say I feel disgust‚Ä¶ he showed little remorse even before I found this out just towards me. Seemed so happy to get rid of me as if I hurt him? I did nothing to him except have other major things in my life to build a better future. He took it to heart from the beginning.
What do I do? I feel so numb I can‚Äôt cry anymore. I vent to people and I‚Äôm sick of hearing I deserve better. I thought I was gonna get better, I took a chance on someone who told me to trust him from the beginning.
I should‚Äôve known. I feel broken inside and outside, I can barely smile. I feel alone even with friends and family, it‚Äôs an indescribable feeling. I gave him so much and he didn‚Äôt appreciate shit.

I really thought I was giving a different type of guy a chance, like it would lead to a better outcome but I‚Äôm wrong. I was his peace and comfort, I took him in when he was new to this city, but yet he doesn't seem to be struggling without me.

I‚Äôm also an idiot for sleeping with him post break up when he wanted to meet up for more closure. I just wanted his comfort. It‚Äôs stupid I know. I‚Äôm so ashamed of who I became. It went from him chasing me to me wanting his validation again or comfort. Again I‚Äôm sick of being told I deserve better that‚Äôs not changing anything. What am I doing wrong??? I went from being wifey material in his eyes to him regretting he ever said that about me. Again he made me the villain while he was in the wrong!

"For context.

Me and my bf (we call him p) are together for a time now. Almost a year. 

I got abused pretty bad at home and that‚Äôs when my bf offered me to live w him and his mom. (After 4 months) I know that was soon but we didn‚Äôt had a choice. I wanted to stay up in Berlin and didn‚Äôt want to move down on the other side of the country

We renovated the attic and moved in there. After time we even adopted 2 cats.

Me and my bf are going along pretty well. We have the same hobby‚Äôs, humor and are pretty much alike. We help each other out and are a really good team. 

So I guess his mom started to get jealous ?

So you know, his father cheated a lot 5 years ago and they devorced.
Yeah his dad was an a hole. Fr he was not hitting my bf or her but he was abusive in any other way.

They were married for 20 years and even moved from Poland to Germany just because he wanted to. So she gave up her life for him.

After he cheated she lost all her trust in humanity. The only ones that she atleast trust a bit are P and the neighbors. (They help out a lot)

She became someone w no empathy. But she‚Äôs actually already a still person. She can‚Äôt even say no to someone. She‚Äôs a afraid little mouse.

Thing is. My bf and I argue sometimes. Okay. We had some huge fights goin on. They never went over a day but still. We told her of my illness bpd. That I feel emotions more intense and that sometimes when I have an episode. Might rage really bad because something triggered me and that they have to give me my medication if so.

I don‚Äôt blame her that she never knows what to do in such situations. And that she asked the neighbors for help. They actually listen to me and calmed me very quickly.

So. My bf and his mom started to argue a lot in the last 2 months. Like fr screaming and saying really mean stuff. 
At first I was mad at my bf, why would you treat your mom like this and he told me. When she starts to act how she acts to him I would understand.

I do understand now.

The neighbor told me that she probably sees me as rival and sent my bf mssgs saying (I left my ex too for you) she‚Äôs like putting him to choose or some.

I never done anything to her. I‚Äôm helping in the house. I listened to her for hours when she was hurting. I bought gifts. Always took her side in fights even tho she was in the wrong, just because I know she will be crying when we both be against her. When my bf was in a bad mood I would correct him, saying don‚Äôt talk to your mother like that. 

She started to run over to the neighbors all the time telling them me and my bfs struggles.

Okay my bf did a mistake there. We argued 2 times heavily in our relationship. And this one time he went up to her crying saying I broke up. 

Now she doesn‚Äôt talk to me. 

Is closing doors extra loud. Doesn‚Äôt look at me. Doesn‚Äôt text me anymore. Doesn‚Äôt help. Doesn‚Äôt communicate. Nothing.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but it stresses me and I don‚Äôt feel at home here. I feel like a parasite to her. 
I have big trauma from Abusing and closing a door aggressively to show off ‚ÄûI‚Äôm mad‚Äú triggers bad trauma. 

Big trauma is also that my mom beated me up but I was the problem ‚Äûyeah what did you do to make her hit you?‚Äú

And it‚Äôs the same here, sometimes my bf did smt wrong, ‚Äûno, can‚Äôt be. What did you do that he‚Äôs like this‚Äú

His behavior is probably also my fault in her head 

And yes we tried to talk to her. We tried to convince her for therapy.

When we say hey we don‚Äôt like that 

‚ÄûYEAH I‚Äôm such a bad mother‚Äú

When we try to tell her therapy might work

‚ÄûI don‚Äôt have time and I‚Äôm fine‚Äú

We ask her if she wants to join us on our little trip. 

‚ÄûI don‚Äôt want to‚Äú

We hug her

She pushes us off

We try to talk to her about her behavior 

‚ÄûYeah I‚Äôm doing everything wrong I‚Äôm so bad‚Äú

And is only saying this then.

‚ÄûI‚Äôm doing everything myself, I‚Äôm used to it‚Äú

That‚Äôs what she says a lot too. But we do the laundry. The dishwasher, cleaning, cooking.

And then the neighbors ask (cause she run up to them telling them we‚Äôre so bad) ‚Äûwhy don‚Äôt you help her, or talk?‚Äú WE DID

Isn‚Äôt this already manipulating? Turning people against me w wrong statements?


I don‚Äôt get it 
I know she might be afraid to loose him to but ofc he‚Äôs on my side. I‚Äôm his girlfriend. His other half. We want kids. But most important. 

I didn‚Äôt do anything to upset her at all.
( and that is the main reason)

But what hurts me most.. 

She‚Äôs was my mother.

I started to copy everything she does. I love her. When I was having stomach pain she helped me. When I threw up she helped me. 

I never experienced mother love, neither father love, neither family love. 

I took her in my heart. Sometimes I even thought ‚Äûshe will be proud of me when I do this‚Äú kept me working only w this mindset.

And she sees me as a rival..

"[LONG READ, but I need your thoughts, so if you could spare some time to read my post and give some feedback, it would be very much appreciated.]

I grew up with a comfortable life. My parents gave my siblings and me pretty much everything we needed and more. I am beyond grateful for everything they have given me. However, I couldn‚Äôt stand my dad‚Äôs narcissistic behaviour anymore.

My father is a politician. In my country, if you are a politician, you are a ‚Äúcelebrity.‚Äù Growing up, we always had to look good, look presentable, have good table manners, etc. (especially in public). Otherwise, my Dad would get mad at us when we got home.

Growing up, my eldest sibling and I have been aware that my Dad is cheating on my Mum. Him being in the public eye and not being discreet about it, I would have people go up to me and tell me that they saw my Dad with another girl on a date. I would relay it to my Mum, making sure first that the story is real. My Dad being a MEGA cheater, I have six half-siblings (that we know of so far) with different women. My Mum has never been accepting towards my half-siblings - which is understandable in my opinion. She‚Äôs been tolerating my Dad‚Äôs cheating habits for the sake of us, her kids.

As I‚Äôve matured, I‚Äôve come to realise that my father is a narcissist. When he finds out that I told my Mum something about him cheating on her, he would ignore me for a while. Instead of apologising, he wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for months. And of course, his favourite, he would cut off my allowance. He loves holding money over our heads.

My Mum is my Dad‚Äôs sole business partner with all our family businesses, but he would not allow her to be involved in anything business-related. She is pretty much just a business partner on paper, that‚Äôs it.

My Mum has always wanted to open a business of her own so she doesn‚Äôt have to rely so much on my Dad. Being that my narcissistic father is our sole provider, he would not give her funds to open up her own business because (I think) he thinks he would not have any control over her anymore when she starts making her own money.

A few years back, my Dad sent me overseas to finish my degree (which I‚Äôm very grateful for). After graduating, I‚Äôve stayed overseas as I have made a lot of friends and just enjoyed the freedom of being able to do whatever I want and not having my Dad breathing down my neck all the time. Lately, however, I‚Äôve come to realise the reason why my Dad sent me overseas - so that he could cheat on my Mum, and no one would tell her anything because I‚Äôm the main person who snitches on him.

It was the elections recently in my home country. My Dad never invited my half-siblings to join his campaigns, as this would tarnish his ‚Äúperfect‚Äù public image, even when the public already knows he‚Äôs a massive cheater. 

When we (his ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù family) would join his campaigns every single day during the campaign period, he would never introduce us to the public - since the public already knows who we are (I think?). However, on the last day of the campaign period, one of my half-siblings who has a dream of becoming a public servant as well was introduced to the public by my father. He did not ask permission from my Mum that he was going to do it. So when my Mum found out, she got really sad and because she felt she got so disrespected and betrayed by my father AGAIN. And me being overseas, she would call me every single day just to cry. It breaks my heart to see my Mum in pain. My Mum is now talking to a lawyer and planning on getting a divorce which I am 1000% in support of. I told her that all of us are now adults so she shouldn‚Äôt worry about us anymore and just start living her life again for her.

I am done with my father. I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore.

I have a decent job, a stable income. I‚Äôve been paying all my bills on my own. However, I still get an allowance here and there from my Dad. But after what he‚Äôs done recently and seeing my Mum in so much pain, I want to completely cut him out of my life. I know this would mean he would completely cut me off financially, but I‚Äôve just had enough. I‚Äôd still be okay financially, but I have an even more comfortable life with the allowance I get from him. But I just couldn‚Äôt tolerate him and his narcissistic behavior anymore.

"I don‚Äôt understand why people tell you that you have to ‚Äúput yourself first‚Äù for everything. I work a regular retail job but it‚Äôs very unstaffed. A few days ago one of my coworkers went on their two week vaca, usually on Sunday it‚Äôs me, her and one other coworker that work on the front of the store, and registers. But because she‚Äôs on vacation, it was just me and the other coworker and the store was extremely busy, so my boss took someone from the back of the store and put him on the register with us. It was honestly probably the worse work day I‚Äôve had so far working there. The customers were rude, the tablets for pricing weren‚Äôt working, and unfortunately I don‚Äôt speak Spanish and there were a lot of Spanish speaking customers (my coworker on vacation usually translates for us). The person we took from the back was acting like he ran the register, saying he would take his break whenever he felt like it after I told him, up here, we discuss breaks and when to take them. The frankly other coworker there doesn‚Äôt do much work. There were over several rushes that took hours to get rid of and I didn‚Äôt have time to order food for my break because my boss demanded I go on my break so the guy from the back could take his after me, because he didn‚Äôt want to take his so early. He had 2 breaks. At some point I got overwhelmed I went to the bathroom and cried for around 10 minutes. I considered quitting in that moment, as I realized that this job wasn‚Äôt something I really wanted to do for much longer. But I decided against it as we are understaffed, and a different coworker I would call a friend, have two shifts in a row the follow day where it would be just the two of us a person in the back. So I obviously didn‚Äôt quit. But I told two friends of mine about what happened that day and they suggested I quit. I told them my reasoning and they said I should put myself first? I didn‚Äôt understand as it would cause much more harm for me to leave for my coworker friend, and the company, although I care more about my coworker.  I told them that it felt wrong but they said it was more important for me to worry about myself but it feels selfish to leave my coworker for something as little as my ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù as it happens often to me. For some context; It‚Äôs very likely I‚Äôm autistic as it runs in my family, I get very overwhelmed very quickly by loud noise, or sometimes the tone of people‚Äôs voices; in those times I just relax for X amount of time and I‚Äôm fine afterwards. 
Anyways, I don‚Äôt understand why everyone thinks that you should put yourself over others in every situation. I think the position I was put in was unfair yeah, but wouldn‚Äôt it more unfair to leave my coworkers behind in a time of need. It just seems selfish to always think about yourself.

"i have let down myself and all the dreams and aspirations i once had, I am still young (16m) but i have done short of nothing in life. I feel as ive always been a side character in everyone else‚Äôs story, Never ever had really close friends whom i had good inside jokes with never really perfectly fit in always had to mould myself to sort of fit in, no one really likes me or hates me i just sort of exist. I feel bad about my mind i have gotten addicted to jacking off and cant get rid of it no matter what i do, and i want to get better and ive given it so many attempts now that it just seems pointless and hopeless, I know this may sound cliche and crazy to you older people since im very young but i really sometimes wish to end it all, i am not a good son even when i try to be i end up being rude, annoyed and secretive to my good parents who deserved a much better son who isnt so indifferent and rude and is just a burden, I am not a good person either im jealous, self obsessed ,a narcissist, rude, pompous perhaps and idk and i want to change all that desperately but it seems nothing short of impossible since about a million attempts end up in me relapsing, giving up and being a b1tch. 

i want to do something great be someone great and i used to be able to believe that i will and that i was special but this life keeps shootingthese difficult shots and i keep taking them and bleeding and one day i feel ill just bleed out
i have never been able to give something my all
i always give. up prematurely and idk i am lazy too. Though ive been good in school and stuff but im just losing the point of it anymore like what the fuck does it matter if u get an a or a + or a b or u fail (always been a straight a student ) 


i have a major exam next year its my countries law qualification exam sort of and it determines the college you get i thought i really wanted to be a lawyer i was sure as fuck but now its just eh im confused and definitely scared asf seeing my competition people without any preparation giving the exam are getting scores that the top 10 scorers of this year had when attempting the question paper and im even scared to attempt this years paper because in my mind it is a measure of my capabilities and my chance to get my desired college and i am utterly lost i cant sit for an hour without going to the dark place in my head and i cant stop overthinking and ive never ever cried which may seem weird but i probably cried last time when i was 5 or something but i always want to let it all out but i just dont. And i just keep being a softie and let myself go into my anxious depressed self and just give up easily now theres not much in my life to feel good about as the things that are good are the people im letting down by not doing my work. 


I had a girlfriend last year whom i ended the relationship with for some reason i cant remember it was messy , we still talk sometimes and idk if we should as it might distract me from my goals and it‚Äôs difficult to be in this new gen z world without letting broken ideologies influence you like social media paints as all girls always cheat and stuff.  idk what im saying this is the first time ive ever put what i think into something
also ignore my bad english ik its bad.

"Context: I had been with my bf for 7/8 months by this point. I had a friend (FTM, same age as me). Ive identified as bi back then, but am straight now. 

So, what happened. In the past, this friend at parties has a habit of getting drunk and then continuously asking people to kiss him. Ive never seen him as more than a friend, so I never said yes. We had a few silly kisses back in the day, but that was before I met my bf. After I started dating, I explicitly told the friend that the kissing and stuff wasnt appropriate now and I dont want to do that stuff anymore as I consider it cheating and so does my bf. He said fair enough. I thought that was the end of it.

Then, I went round to his one evening has he had broken up with his gf (she cheated on him) and we were best friends so I went to comfort and get his mind off things. My bf has also met him and they got along well. The friend told me his other friend was coming round, and then we had to go find her because she didnt know where she was. Friend mixed multiple types of alcohol into a bottle before we left. I thought it would be fine to drink- I usually feel safe around him when I drink. We went to find her, it was fun we were singing etc. 

We got on the wrong bus home and ended up waiting at a bus stop for 20 or so minutes. By this point, I had drunk most of the bottle and hed had a couple swigs. Tbh I was fucked- although I know its no excuse.

Then he started doing this bit: ‚ÄúI really wish I could kiss someone right now‚Äù etcetc. I said well I have a bf soooo kiss your other friend. She said no. Then they both started saying its not cheating were just friends, your bf doesnt have to know, etcetc. I had already told him sober I dont wanna do that anymore. And at first I said no. Then they kept on saying this shit and I felt trapped. I gave in eventually. I felt horrible. 

We went to a park after, and he kissed me again. He said he didnt want to do it if Id regret it, I said I would. He started laughing and saying well whyd you do it in the first place blah blah and made me feel guilty and then we kissed again. The entire time I felt horrible. Ive never had feelings for him, but the act of kissing I feel is still completely only for my bf, and even though I could physically never have feelings for this other guy, I still feel horrible for allowing it to happen in a sense.

I woke up the next day sick to my stomach with guilt. I messaged them saying I dont want to be around them anymore and cut them out of my life, I immediately told my bf what happened and he forgave me saying it wasnt my fault.

I am not saying its not my fault. I know I couldve left or said no more abruptly. But in my state of mind at the time i thought my bff wouldnt do anything to hurt me or my relationship- and i was wrong.

Now, a few months down the line. I shouldve completely forgot about this like my bf has. But occasionally I remember and feel this horrible guilt for days at a time.

"So I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I just really wanted to vent. Ever since I‚Äôve had my daughter back in August things have been tense with my family. Mostly my mom and grandmother. 

I live with my in laws and have since 2017. They had bought a big 110 acre farmland and invited us to live with them and help them take care of it. We were living in a pretty bad place at the time so we jumped at the opportunity and moved in. It‚Äôs honestly been great overall, it‚Äôs beautiful out in the country, our dogs got plenty of room to run and there‚Äôs hardly any neighbors. We‚Äôve also been saving a lot of money up to build on the property and are actually getting things together to start next year. We‚Äôve been pretty lucky in how things have been going, especially since having our daughter after battling 5 years of infertility. My in laws have been nothing but supportive as well.

The problems started shortly after having my daughter however. My mom and grandmother would start making comments about things I should do like how I should just be letting her cry it out and that I should be giving her water etc etc and would get really upset when I would turn down their suggestions. I know they were just trying to help but I had my own ideas on how I wanted to raise her, but they took it as personal attacks. My grandmother even decided to call my MIL and ask questions about the babies weight since I‚Äôm breastfeeding and got offended when she found out my MIL told me.

Then the last time my mom visited she somehow got it in her head the my MIL is out to get her and came up with weird ideas that she‚Äôs rubbing it in her face that her grandchild lives with her and now refuses to come over. Even though my in laws have always tried to invite them over and understand how it can be an unfair situation. They even leave the house when my family comes over so they‚Äôre more comfortable. Now they can‚Äôt even post pictures of our baby on Facebook without upsetting my mom and grandmother. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to them before but it usually ends up with my mom just even more upset and pouting and just keeps thinking she‚Äôs still in the right on everything. She‚Äôs a constant ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù person and almost likes, I think, telling everyone about her trauma cause she always brings it up in about every situation.

Overall it‚Äôs just been stressful. I try and take her over during the weekends but I only have a couple days to catch up on house work and taking care of her. Not to mention she hates car rides so I have to endure 40 minutes of screaming to and from. I also made the mistake of telling my husband everything my mom said so he went off on her this past weekend after she got mad at me over the fact that me, him and his parents went to Gatlinburg over the weekend with the baby. Now she won‚Äôt talk to me and I‚Äôve been a mess since. I begged my husband not to say anything about what I told him and that I was just venting but he just went off and now I feel like an outcast. I‚Äôm still pretty mad at him over it even though I get he was just trying to defend me and his family.

I 18(F) thought I had a crush on this guy 19(M) after sitting with myself and the feeling it made me feel almost suicidal liking him. He reminded me of this woman I love but can have 19(F). They both have really similar names(different by 1 letter) look quite similar same eye colour and similar hair colour both white. And to the reason I can‚Äôt be with this woman is family and cultural pressure I love her more than anything but I‚Äôm so scared of my family‚Äôs reaction the shame it would bring to my whole family in the community, even being honour killed which feels irrational.  I know they say relationships at our age don‚Äôt last long so why not just go for it but with her I can see our whole lives together and it‚Äôs a perfect one. I always imagine us in a wood ceiling kitchen in a flat where it‚Äôs warm and cozy with a dog just like hers and I‚Äôm cooking and she‚Äôs with me and then I snap into reality and i remember how we tried and it didn‚Äôt work because I was too scared and finding it hard to sleep and getting panic attacks thinking of what it might do to her too.

 it‚Äôs hard to move on and I know I need to and maybe I could try with this man almost like a substitute (who says he even likes me back) but how am I supposed to ever move on when no one can love the way she does and I don‚Äôt think I could ever feel even close to loving anyone the way I love her. I don‚Äôt know what to do last time I ended things was because it would hurt even more if we both got more attached and would have inevitably end it sometimes I wish she‚Äôd move on so I can tell myself to stop feeling the way I do and give up on the false hope I have. If she did I‚Äôd be happy for her but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to hear about the details it would crush me but I know that in order for me to go forward she‚Äôs going to have to take the step first because I‚Äôm too much of a coward to let go. 

 Its my fault for sending mixed signals because I just can‚Äôt hold myself back when she gives me affection it felt so peaceful when she slept on my shoulder but I felt so guilty because it gave her hope that I had changed my mind and I don‚Äôt know if my mind has changed or if I can give up everything I‚Äôve known.",Thought I had a crush turns out he reminds me of the love I couldn‚Äôt have.,18mu6j2,1703077639.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mu6j2/thought_i_had_a_crush_turns_out_he_reminds_me_of/,

Mom and dad works in different places so mostly I was with my grandparents and later years I stayed at home alone when they were working,also mom works alot just to keep me happy and all my needs fulfilled I respect her alot, she's even more lonelier than me I guess but she somehow manages everything

The stories that people share are outstanding and reflect a side of humanity that I thought lost. The advice people share can be so wise and thougthful.

As I read and reflect I am compelled to be more compassionate, understanding, patient, and thankful. On the other hand I also think of that line from Cypress Hill ""Just to stay alive, ay yo, I gotta say ""Fuck it"".

"So, firstly, I (29F) just got out of a narcissistically abusive relationship a few weeks ago, and I'm realizing how it's affecting my ability to trust people and interact with people.

I moved about 45 minutes away from my family's house a couple years ago, and was transferred to the local restaraunt up that way. I was living with my bf at that time, ended up leaving him because he would ignore me for 12+hrs a day at times and his kid was absolute hell. I felt like I was basically a live in maid. Ended up getting with my mechanic, who I found out the hard way was a very abusive covert narcissist. I finally escaped him a few weeks ago, and moved back with my family, but I didn't transfer back down to the other store.

And I started to realize something... I realized how absolutely ecstatic I've always been to go to work - because of one person. Everytime I see my one manager, I excitedly tell him hi, and I actually smile. I love talking with him, and we have this dynamic that is so uplifting and enjoyable. For the past couple years, he's been listening to me cry and complain about dealing with these assholes that break my heart. And he always tells me that I'm a bright, beautiful woman and I deserve to be happy. When I was with my narc ex, he told me that I have too good of a heart and I was wasting it on someone who only cared about himself. He was right for sure, and that really stuck with me.

It's driving me crazy. He's like 20ish years older than me, but we get along as well as I do with my brother. I've always been able to just be myself around him, and he still says I'm unique and it's a good thing lol. I won't transfer stores to one that's 5 minutes away, because I'd miss him. So I keep driving my shitty car 45 minutes to work everyday. I think he's been asking me to hang out without directly asking me, and because of the narcissistic abuse I just endured, I feel to distrustful and awkward around people to hang out. Last night, I drove him home from work before I went to therapy, because his car wasn't starting, and I became hyper self aware and it made me even more awkward, like I forgot how to form sentences and use words.

Everytime I feel like we're getting closer, I unintentionally fight it, because I'm afraid of being close with somebody again so soon. Even though it's someone I've known and been open and honest with for roughly 2 years now.

I think everyone at work can tell. Last night, my one coworker called me out on it. He said, ""You dont work today. Youre just here to see him."" I said, ""Yep, you caught me,"" lol. They probably knew before I knew, because it was just like a couple days ago that i realized how I've felt for the past couple years. When there's no customers, I wonder off to go talk to him and I'll just follow him around like I'm in a trance or something. Yesterday I noticed how I smile everytime he does, and I think his missing tooth is the cutest thing ever. I feel this energetic rush when I see him, like my whole world just lights up.

I really just want to tell him how I feel, because I can't bear keeping anything to myself. But I'm afraid of that. Because once I say it, then what's next? I just went through a pretty traumatic experience and am not ready for a relationship. But everytime I talk to him, it's like much wow, I'm so excited and elated and happy. I can't take it. I get so happy that I become afraid of losing it, so I just take two steps back. And then I reprimand myself for taking steps back.

Should I tell him how I feel? I feel like it's pretty obvious, but maybe its not. He seems to be about as awkward as I am, so it might be really awkward for both of us. I almost wish he'd just stumble upon this post, and then I wouldn't have to say it lol.","I think my one manager &amp; I like each other, but neither of us will say anything",18mtogw,1703076036.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mtogw/i_think_my_one_manager_i_like_each_other_but/,

"Hi guys so this is a long story... I don't really remember much of my childhood but all in all it was pretty happy. It was my sibling and both my parents. We always had movie nights on the weekends and as I got older (I think around 10 maybe? || noticed my mom making weird movements like she would be masturbating.. but thought that that couldn't be true.. But one day it was me and her in the room with the lights and she was barely covered by a blanket and I saw everything, she was actually doing it. I looked at her and just ran out of the room and never watched a movie with them again. I didn't confront her about it, I mean I was very young I wasn't brave enough to do that. I forgot about it or pushed it away for a few years.
But it all came back recently (2 years ago maybe) and I'm so mad and disgusted at her for doing that I can't stand her anymore... I confronted her about it now that I'm older and know that this is so wrong but she never admit it and said it was because of some drugs that I did when I was younger (had a really really rough teenage years including heavy drinking, drugs, oversexualizing myself at a super early age and just doing stupid thing, now looking back I am asking myself if any of this could be related to the things my mom has done?? Or am I just delusional?
But I'm pretty sure about what I saw I get lots of flashbacks and just feel so disgusted towards her. But the thing is I still have to live with her since I'm 19 and can't at all afford to live by myself and everything she does just makes me so mad... But also being away from her for some time like did when I went to a school farther away and stayed there for some months did not help I still felt all of the disgust.

"I need to get this off my chest because my close friends are going through difficult times and I have no one else that can listen or talk some sense into me, so hello Reddit.

A bit of info regarding our relationship for context:

My former partner and I dated for about 8 months and we are both in our 30s. We 'met' online playing a video game. Our connection deepened due to uncanny coincidences stemming from shared past experiences, similar lifestyles, core values, childhoods, and even a striking physical resemblance. After about a year of online friendship we met up and decided to pursue a relationship. I know the relationship didn't last for a long time but it was the most intense relationship that I've had and the strongest connection I've shared with anyone. As weird as it might sound I felt as if I found the one, I felt it and it also scared me. We made arrangements to move together into a new place 6 months into our relationship, I had a job lined up and he has a job he is happy with so it felt right. He pulled away after him bringing up marriage. He has been married once before and that relationship was very abusive but they got married anyway thinking that it might solve their issues. He told me it was the first time he didn't feel pressured into marriage and it was something he wanted to experience with me but the timing was wrong and he simply can't commit to anything at the moment.

We both had multiple long term relationships, not all my past relationships were ideal but they have made me who I am today and I am grateful for that. None of them felt like 'the one' until this relationship, it was drama free, calm and for the first time I could actually see a future with him, something that never happened to me before, I usually just live in the moment without thinking much about the future, that's just how I am. Whenever we had a 'conflict' it was easily solved because we both have good communication skills.

Yesterday my ex's closest friend reached out to me, it's been about 4 months after the breakup. He tried to open the subject on different occasions but he didn't know how I would react or how to approach the situation so he delayed having this conversation for months. He shared screenshots of conversations with my ex where he said he regrets letting me go but had too many past relationship fears messing with his head. My ex started drinking heavily, being very depressed and overall not in a good place mentally and confessed to him that he broke up with me because he was afraid I was too good for him and he would drag me down with him.

Despite the breakup, I maintain occasional communication with my ex, approximately once a month. Our exchanges avoid discussions about our feelings or relationship. Oddly, I find comfort in keeping him in my life, no matter how messed up it might sound to some, I love him and want the best for him. He also initiates more than I do but when I initiate it takes him days or weeks to reply but his friend said he just disabled notifications for most socials, because when I text him he gets emotional. He told me he doesn't want to cut me off.

I am in a spot where I don't know what to do or how to react because it's a lot and emotionally I am a mess. Unfortunately looking so alike doesn't help me either because many times when I look into the mirror I can see him, I feel doomed.

"I'm 18. I told myself I was never going to install those shitty flirt apps again. But I did, because I'm addicted to it. Yesterday, I went to a guy's house to have sex. I risked my well being, the safety of my house. I was happy there with my family but for some reason I felt the need to have body contact with someone so I did. 

I only realized he had some acnes around his mouth after some time. They were separated one from another, it doesn't look like herpes. He told me they were just acnes that got worse because he scratched, and that he always makes tests and is clean of diseases. But I deep down know that I cannot believe him, I cannot believe anyone in those shitty apps, this is why I hate them but I can't get rid of them. He asked me if I wanted to keep having sex and I refused, he was cool about it. I didn't do oral sex nor anal thanks God. 


So, now, I have mouth ulcers. Our kissing was very intense, and took sometime, around 10 minutes of kissing, so I think the inner ulcers could've been made by friction. But I'm still freaking out.

My grandma (dad‚Äôs mother) basically raised me as both my parents work. My grandparents lived with us growing up. My grandma hates my mom and her side of the family and would often talk shit about my mom and her family when I was little. When I would try to defend my mom, she would call me my mom‚Äôs lawyer as an insult. My mom is a lovely lady who has worked her ass off all her life to provide for our family. My mom would literally go to work during the day and come back home to cook dinner for us while my dad didn‚Äôt lift a finger. My grandma loves my dad and still babies him and cannot see any fault in him. I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with my dad either. My grandma would start fights with me over the smallest things and monitor my every move. She‚Äôs also brainwashed my dad and he follows all of her commands and wishes. My grandparents moved out when I was 12 nearby when my parents bought the place for them. But grandma would still come over during the day to babysit my brother and I. She and I would get into fights all the time and I would stay at my school for longer to avoid coming home to her. She would still constantly talk shit about me and my mom and my mom‚Äôs parents. She had a terrible relationship with my grandpa and they would constantly fight in front of me since I was little. As I grew up she would play the card of her raising me and making food for me and stuff to guilt trip me. 

I moved out for college to a different country. My grandpa passed away during that time and he was the last person who actually nice to my mom in the house. Since he died, grandma had been getting worse and she would stay over at my parents place and butt in their life which made my mom‚Äôs life hell as my dad would never take her side and would get mad at my mom. He‚Äôs a true mama‚Äôs boy. 

Last time I was home, my grandma got to know about my bf and got mad at me as she expects me to be with her friend‚Äôs grandson. I‚Äôm back home now for holidays and my parents got into an argument because my dad wanted to do something that my grandma wanted and my mom wanted to go on a mini vacation. Grandma invited me over for lunch. We had an argument and I got super emotional and told her she‚Äôs making my mom‚Äôs life hell and she got mad and started saying that she serves my mom instead of vice versa which is a blatant lie. She started talking about how much of great person she is and how everyone around her loves her and she has never caused anyone any harm. She wouldn‚Äôt listen to anything I was saying. At one point she said ‚Äúyou guys talk so much shit maybe this is why he(my dead uncle) got a heart attack.‚Äù My mom‚Äôs only brother died of a heart attack a few years ago. I started crying and was like how can you say something like that and she completely denied it. She said I made it up and I‚Äôm an awful person for making up stories like that. She‚Äôs playing the victim by saying that me and my mom have been mean to her since grandpa died and she‚Äôs been so sad. But she never liked him in the first place.

"Ok so this is my first reddit post so i guess i just speak my heart and post. There is a bit of time jumping so im sry for any mix ups. The problem is i wanna/ gonna cheat on my wife and dont care. Im a 32(m) been married to my wife (32) since 2018, but been with her since 2010. Their has been a great deal of ups and downs in the those years, and has been a great deal of sacrifice on my behalf. Im not gonna sugarcoat it, i was an emotionally hostage for years in the relationship. Anytime i would take time to myself was an issue with her. Could barely play my Xbox without you wanting to cuddle next to me. Wanting to be the only girl amongst a bunch of dudes so you dnt have to be alone. Refusing to socialize at parties just so you can be around me. It was like having a cat that constantly wants to climb your shirt and sit on your shoulder. Its cute the first few times but then its like, ""Ok seriously go away"". Everytime i tried to leave or take a break, i was emotionally manipulated into staying and there was even a point where i was living with her and felt if i didnt accept certain behaviors i would be homeless. And when i had the balls to make manly decisions, she would legit hurt herself. Like running her head into walls and cutting herself. I genuinely felt that if i broke up with her that so would kill herself, and i didnt want that on my conscience for the rest of my life. Cant go anywhere without her. Cant have a personal relationship without you having to know everything about the other person. I had no fun in my 20s. No memorable nights with the bros, no 1 night stands, no waking up in the drunk tank, and i even missed out on a all expenses paid trip to Las Vegas, all because i was tied down to her and wanted to be a ""good boyfriend"". I focused so hard on not fucking this up and being a good dude that i never got a chance to be me or work on myself as a man. I was a weaker man back then and accepted those actions instead just leaving, but i loved her a lot and wanted it to work. Or so i thought. And i dont want ppl to think we had a toxic relationship, it wasnt but there were questionable moments when i look back at it. Around my 30th b day, i had a mental breakdown from all the stress in our relationship and work that i had pent up through the year, and ended up in a therapist's office. I just looked at my life and where it was and didn't like what i had seen.  I then realized everytime i tried to better myself, you know... be a real man. She had a reason to get in my way and slow down my progress. She was scared that if i became a better man mentally and physically, that i would find a better woman. In a nutshell i realized she was manipulating me for years and i missed out on soooooo much all because she's a jealous person who didnt want to grow up. I left therapy with resentment in stead of resolutions. The trust was broken and the fake image of what our relationship was, was shattered. If she wolud have told the truth instead of lying, things wiuld be different. If i would've done therapy before we got married, i never would've married her and she knows this. After therapy, i didnt talk to her for about a month and even thought about legal separation and divorce. I know that i still love her to death but im not blinded by love anymore. The problem is that i cant get all the time back i wasted and im sry is not gonna fix the lies and manipulation. She has openly omitted to manipulating me!!! And she is ""very sorry, but i didnt want to loss you"" Now here is where the scumlord in me takes over. Im not a vain man but im pretty handsome. Im a bit chunky but not super out of shape, i got charm, a great smile, im very smooth, funny, i smell good, and im just genuinely a nice person.  So the amount of women that i have denied thoughout the entire relationship is substantial.(2010- present) However recently in the last few years, basically since thearpy Ive been wanting vengeance. Her biggest flex in life is me. How ""loyal and honest"" i am. Im the reason she legit has anything in her adult life. Even her mental stability is good because i put in the work.... but what about me. Mens mental health gets overlooked a fuck ton in life and we are expected to take it on the chin. ""Get Over It"" "" Be a Real Man"" they say.  Shit like that happening to good men constantly is how evil genius villians and serial killers are made. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT IN MY COME UP!!! STAYED OUT OF JAIL, DIDNT CHEAT, STAYED LOYAL, DID SHIT I DIDNT WANT TO DO, OR GO PLACES I DIDNT WANT TO GO, all for me to be LIED TO. I WILL NOT TAKE THIS LYING DOWN. Why is it after you seriously see how easy it would be for me to leave you, now you wanna act right?  I feel im owed something. And to me that thing is another woman. There have been a number of women who have wanted me over the years knowing i have a woman and willing to keep it a secret, but i have said no everytime. My coworkers, her co-workers, friends both exclusive and mutual all have tried to fuck me. I have had various woman show me there "" various parts"" at parties or at work. Ive even had random nudes sent to me that i didn't ask for btw. I have had opportunities to have 2 side chicks in a whole other city and she would've never known about it. Recently my thoughts have changed. The opportunity has show is face again and this time im not running from it. A gorgeous coworker at my job has been eyeing me for sometime apparently and she basically told me, we can have some sneaky link shit going on. We haven't done anything yet. Just a bit of grab assing and light touching. She is planning alot behind the scenes so we can mess around and not get caught because she has a spouse too. In the past when this happened, i respectfully told them no but how flattered I was. Now i can wait to be inside someone else. I should feel like an asshole but i dont. Why dont i care? Why do i make this decision now and not years ago. I know im not being an adult about this whole situation, but i just dont care.","Is it Vengeance or Excuses, either way I dont care.",18msaqt,1703071052.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18msaqt/is_it_vengeance_or_excuses_either_way_i_dont_care/,
"So I have seen and read many stories on this site where people don't let their abusive parents see their grandchildren. I all those cases, it's clear the grandparents will certainly do to the grandchildren what they did to their children. However, what about the cases where the abusive parents either change for the better or the stressors/circumstances that exacerbated their bad behavior in their life are gone?

I've heard horror stories from my mother about how bad it could be growing up with my grandparents and some of the terrible things they did. My mother was the oldest and they parentified her. Pushing her from a young age to look after her younger brother and sister. To this day my mother has anxiety issues. My aunt and uncle while not put upon as much didn't walk away unscathed either.

And all of this confused me when I was younger because my grandparents where very nice and good to my sister, cousins and me growing up. We'd spend lots of time at their house and play with each other. They pick us up and care for us during the day if we got sick and had to leave school until our parents got off work and could pick us up. They gave us lots of gifts on birthdays and holidays. They took us out places for fun and their home was a second home to all the grandchildren.

I guess this leads me to my question. I was watching some reruns of Roseanne when it got the episode of Jackie not wanting their mother Bev to be a part of her grandchild's life. Roseanne and Jackie had a very abusive father who beat them and their mother. And their mother often did what my own grandmother did when my grandfather would be abusive and let it happen because she didn't want to be the target. Jackie hated her mother for what happened and couldn't forgive what she and Roseanne suffered. But Dan mentioned to Jackie that they let Bev watch their kids. Then Dan hits Jackie with a powerful question with that being if Jackie honestly thought Bev would hurt Jackie's child. It made me think hard because Roseanne and Jackies childhood mirrored my mother and her sibling's childhood.

What I learned more about my grandparents were that their own families were much worse with uncles that my grandparents forbade to even meet their children because they wanted closeness with children, my mother and her siblings, in all the wrong ways. My grandfather had to work hard in a factory and coped with his issues using alchohol. My grandmother's experiences where even more horrendous with her and a few of her sisters being sent away so they wouldn't be sexually abused. For my grandmother, survival came first.

By the time we grandchildren came around, my grandfather stopped drinking and was retired. Most of my grandmother's relatives were either dead or very far away. They didn't need to work anymore and most of the stresses they had when they were younger were all gone. Further, the more I heard about the stories, the more I realized that my grandparents did care about their kids but they were just really screwed up by their own experiences. They were also good people under the damage as they sheltered a neighbor's daughter from her brother and predatory male relatives (yeah, this was all before the sixties so sexual assault was something people were very uncomfortable about policing or even reporting). They never acted badly towards people based on their religion, race or even sexual orientation (My sister once brought a gay friend over to our grandparent's house and when she told our grandfather that her friend was gay, his response was basically, ""huh? really? Well, I guess that's OK""). Even when my grandparents showed behaviors that they were a product of their times, it never came off as offensive so much as ignorant (my grandfather once made a remark about how African Americans where so good a sports because slave owners in the past made them participate in sporting events due to rivalries between plantation families. My only response to that was, ""......What..?"". Honestly it was more baffling/ridiculous than offensive).

So now, finally, my question. When is it fine to let your abusive parents be grandparents? I think the answer is when they aren't abusive because it's inherent in their personality but because there are outside circumstances that push them and they're too weak keep it from  bringing out the worst in them. All of the grandparents that weren't allowed to see their grandchildren from the stories on this site seemed like trash people to begin with. Others, like my grandparents, who were allowed to see their grandkids weren't inherently bad people but just very damaged yet well-meaning and their positive qualities came out for their grandchildren. I'm not going to try to justify the abuse of their own childdren and I know it's hard from seeing my mother to accept parents who where terrible at being parents but great at being grandparents, but in the end I think whether or not they should be allowed to see their grandkids should be based off whether or not their children think they are going to hurt their grandchildren.

I wanted to write this post to perhaps help others who have been abused by their parents and now struggle to decide whether or not to let them have anything to do with their grandkids. I encourage others to add their experiences so those who have had to suffer don't feel alone and can make informed decisions.

"Hi Reddit, I need a safe space to vent about a situation I am probably an asshole in but which deeply bothers me. Thank you so much for understanding my side of the story.

 My mom has a heart condition that is heavily influenced by emotions, like, she gets scared or angry and than will have an episode that will put her in discomfort for hours or even a day. Her whole life evolves around avoiding these episodes that do occur every week multiple times the last 10+ years with whatever intervention she does. It is mostly due to social tension so she even ghosted her children and husband to leave her alone for months and not visit. That‚Äôs over now but still her whole life is planned on ‚Äòwhat if this will induce an episode, let‚Äôs not do it and stay home alone.‚Äô

Now, she has never been able to express anger in the moment, like never, also not to us in our younger years. Now in adult life, she always has to fester for days upon a response before she replies with a very too much thought trough response that clearly shows, yes that little joke did hurt her feelings. While in the moment she seems alllllll fine. I can‚Äôt really explain how passive aggressive it actually feels. 

Like; I‚Äôve been a bit of a dick and said something a little hurtful via the app in the moment that I deeply regret and apologize for soon after. She first ghosted me for two days and was avoidant on the phone when I called her to discuss it. It took her 3 days to write a response. And that is because I specifically asked her to do so so she would express that yes in fact she was mad and, if not she would just ignore it and me for a while and cover all in a blanket of love as if it was okay for me to say that. And yes I would obviously know by her behavior that she was mad, but noooo we do not openly express that or talk about it. Just walk on eggshells and guess what the other person is feeling right?

But in a normal relationship would you not need to be able to express anger? I get sooooo furious with her avoidant fragile state i want to punch a hole in the wall. I have never been able, also not as a teen, to express my anger towards my parents because only small criticism would already hurt their feelings and give me a parent who shuts down emotionally. 
They could not, by far, handle my emotions neither could or can they handle their own. I know in fact that she is still mad now even though she said it is ‚Äòokay‚Äô.
And it is pure poison to me.

I am somewhat dependent on them because they take care of my kids every once I a while and help out a little financially. I could not go without, but I am going through some very serious things in my life that put me on edge and make me emotionally unstable. Like I am mad and feel rage sometimes. And yes, often times it is not with good reason and I need to contain it. But recently I find myself struggling with that and lashing out to my family, kids and also her. I hate it and I really feel sorry and apologize. But I need to walk on eggshells with her in this sense, I cannot just be angry bout stuff from now or the past without her getting a heart episode (that is not dangerous, just really inconvenient). It is infuriating to not be able to be real with her without small stuff becoming big stuff because of it.

In her way she is learning, she said, in her overly thought out reply two days after I made a wrong comment that I almost immediately apologized for, ‚Äòsmall stuff never will become big stuff,  it‚Äôs okay let it go.‚Äô Whilst the delay in response and the not immediately sharing that yes she was angry for that comment and it hurt, made it a big thing. She as super hurt and just does not have the balls to say so.. But she is almost 70 and I slowly start to accept she will never be able to change, I and childishly hate her for it because it is so unhealthy.

Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of txt. I would like to say all this to her but she will crumble and I don‚Äôt want to hurt my own mother.","Dealing with anger towards my fragile mom, that i can‚Äôt express ‚Äòcause she won‚Äôt be able to handle it.",18ms9y2,1703070970.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ms9y2/dealing_with_anger_towards_my_fragile_mom_that_i/,

"Hello! I guess I just need to get this ‚Äúoff my chest‚Äù

I started to write a doc about it as if I was going to make some big speech but realized I was saying a lot and nothing at the same time.

There is so much to life. The world is so big and I‚Äôm both nothing and everything. I have me and no one else for certain, and nothing matters. But at the same time, everything does because my life will be affected by decisions I make. But why do I need to make these decisions? I‚Äôm just so lost.

Why do things like money even exist? Why do we waste so much time on social media? 

Like there is so much. How do phones exist?? Why do we need to get jobs and then work till we die?? 

I want to die so bad to end my life and stress but I am also so scared of death and feel like I‚Äôm being dramatic.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having a crisis but at the same time I‚Äôm just typing this emotion into a reddit post like there‚Äôs going to be some huge answer and like I‚Äôm not just going to put my phone away and go about my day after. 

I still function, I still do what I need to do but my mind is everywhere. 

The world is so big, and there are so many things and I am so small so why is everything so serious? 

But I am also everything I have. My life is what I know and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll die or what happens when I do. I don‚Äôt want to die because there is so much but I also do because I‚Äôm going nowhere in life, and I‚Äôll be in pain my whole life just to die regardless of how successful I am.

But that‚Äôs also just the human experience and how life is and I need to live in the moment.

I just feel crazy, I feel like no one talks about it but also how could they because I don‚Äôt even understand what I‚Äôm saying or how to express the complex feeling I have.

I cannot put it into words and I wish I could. The best representation I can give are those videos on Youtube about how a video game is ‚Äújust a game‚Äù and the emotion they make you feel. Or those videos containing what seems like a lot of memories but also dread. 

I simply cannot explain it. I feel insane and dramatic but also like I‚Äôm not putting enough care into this thought and I‚Äôm not reacting enough.

"I had a normalish childhood.

My dad worked, my mom stayed home.

A few years into school my mom took up night work and that's when things kinda changed.

I didn't see it at the time, I was just a kid, but my dad, he's traditional, and by that I mean a fucking man child. 

He didn't want a partner. He wanted a replacement for mommy who would clean up his messes, cook him dinner, do the finances, take care of the kids etc.

When he suddenly had to take care of the kids a couple hours every night, things started getting tense.

But it wasn't obvious.

All I knew as a kid was that I'd wake up on the weekend, mom would be angry. I was mad at her. 

Why was she always angry?

Why was she mean to me?

I didn't understand, so I blamed her.

Dad would take me fishing, or to the woods etc. Dad must be cool right? 

You know, except when he'd get mad at me for being a kid and doing kid things. It was the usual ""help dad fix the car and get yelled at for not being able to find the right screwdriver."" 

As I got older, my parents got more bitter. My dad drank more, smoked more, the house got more messy. He would smoke and drink non stop and watch Fox news more often than not.

He stopped wanting to go out.

He didn't want to talk about anything but his work and politics. Didn't care about you or your life or what you had going on. It was about how good he is at his job and everyone else is so stupid and the democrats are trying to ruin the country.

He stopped going to visit his mother who literally lives in our 2 family house. Wouldn't help her with simple fixes and stuff. 

His family stopped talking to him because of his selfish behavior and it just made him more bitter.

He got fired for talking politics at work and retired. The drinking and smoking got worse 

He was hospitalized for a severe electrolyte imbalance. He's borderline liver disease. He has sores on his legs from bad circulation caused by smoking. He's sick and can barely move. 

Doctors told him he needs to quit smoking and drinking.

He blames the covid vaccine, and keeps drinking and smoking. 

He's getting worse and I don't think he will last much longer like this.

I'm sick of it. I'm sick of his stubborn bullshit, his narcissistic behavior, inability to admit he's ever wrong, inability to see his own flaws.

The hell of a life he has made for my mother enrages me.

If anything, it will be a blessing to her when he's gone. She will finally be free. 

I feel nothing, because the only goodness I knew died a long time ago. All I've known for over a decade now is the man who was mad I didn't shovel the driveway when my crohn's disease had me disabled. The man who refused to take me to social events after school. The man who refused to acknowledge my transition. The man who would pretty much only speak to me if he wanted to talk about himself, needed something, or had something about me he wanted to critisize.

"Hey there, first time posting here, so pardon any slip-ups. I (F20) have never been in a romantic relationship or even close to one. Not even holding hands non platonically. I'm content with my platonic relationships and not desperately seeking a relationship, but sometimes I can't shakethe feeling of being unwanted or unloved. It doesn't help that more as those close to me are starting to prioritise their romantic relationships, having less time for me. I know people will say I'm young with time ahead, but that's not what I want to hear. What if I'm 23 and still haven't experienced that non-platonic connection? It's not about being unattractive or unkind‚ÄîI enjoy fashion, and dressing up when I go out. I've tried dating apps this year, but they feel like a scam, and I'm lost on how else to meet people. Work, uni, and occasional hangouts with friends don't offer those chances.  
  
I've had multiple 'talking stages' and six first dates, but nothing has progressed. My current talking stage was promising weeks ago, but now he takes ages to respond, claiming busyness, yet I see him online. I try mirroring his response time to avoid looking stupid, but this game wears me out. The dating pool feels bleak, and I wonder if something's wrong with me. My friend has tried dating apps for less time than me but she has already gotten a bf. I'm not even sure if I want a full-on relationship or just some romantic fun.  
  
Living in Melbourne, I initially thought dating might be easier, given the diverse dating scene here where it seems like everyone's dating everyone. Yet, despite that, I find myself facing these challenges in forging a meaningful romantic connection.

"So I (24) have been with my boyfriend officially for about 4 months, but unofficially for longer than a year. The scales have always been tipped in his favor since the very beginning. He was my first casual relationship, first boyfriend, and overall before him I had just never been so close to a person before. When I met him I instantly felt a connection, and I made all the moves. Well for a long time before we became official I was cooking for him all the time, he would stay the night at my place (I used to rent an apartment with my brother), we would say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and just generally act couple-y. But the whole time everything has been on his terms. When my lease was up and I had to move back in with my parents last April, he made it seem like we were over, which really broke my heart. By late June we were texting again, saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and I was paying for hotel rooms every couple of weeks so we could spend time together. Our whole relationship has hinged on me being the move maker, when any decision is left to him nothing happens. He rarely even says I love you first. There‚Äôs a lot worse that he‚Äôs done beyond everything being financially dependent on me, and truthfully for a long while I wasn‚Äôt realizing I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. I had become a completely different person, and began changing things I did, who I talked to, and how I talked to him. I was always scared to do the wrong thing.
Well November of this year I found out I‚Äôm pregnant. When I told him his first response was telling me to get an abortion. I called him the next day and told him that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing that. He cried and begged me to reconsider but I wouldn‚Äôt give in. 
Now I haven‚Äôt seen him since that day, and we rarely text anymore. It feels like we‚Äôre already broken up. We‚Äôre only still together on a technicality, but the time apart has made me realize all the things he‚Äôs done to me. And how I‚Äôd never want that for my child. So now I know what I need to do I‚Äôm just unsure how to do it. I feel weak for still caring this last little bit, but he was my first love, and now no matter what a part of him is always going to be with me.

We've tried talking through it, it gets better for few days then goes back to how it was before,  she's blaming herself for this whole thing, saying it's not me, it's her, that I'm an ideal partner, yet she feels emotionally detached, she wants to say she loves me, but ends up saying that she doesn't want to lie.

It's like she fortified herself from everything, telling me that she feels like she's betraying me, and wants to be alone for the rest of her life, promising to never date anyone ever again because she'll not find better.

I was in an abusive relationship for a while which initially made me stop processing how the things around me affect me and now that it is finally over my Life is destroyed. Regardless of the logistics of it my mind is gone. I cannot find a parallel between ‚Äúreality‚Äù and the reality in my head. I spend all day petrified because everything seemingly normal feels so distant in my head. I used to have a place to live and friends and work and it was all taken from me in the span of a days in the blink of an eye. Now I cannot get up to do most things other than get my next fix. I cannot do anything my ability to do stuff has also been taken away. I have had everything taken and have no other rational way to express my autonomy and courage all at once. I miss when I could go grocery shopping and go from store to store to get the best prices as well as cook but now that‚Äôs just a distant dystopian memory. I used to tell you I wanted children but now I can tell you my brain is infinite regardless of your fake reality. I do believe this is my brain trying to reassure me that this is not illness rather an awakening in my mind. However the awakening is enlightening and painful all at once. If everything didn‚Äôt feel so distant I would ask someone to hold me just for a second. After a while of being abused I realized no matter how nice I would still act and how I would carefully tread on eggshells in the face of scary and disgusting anger and manipulation the abuse still happened just the same. Once I realized it became physical abuse as well I realized how little autonomy I really do have. Either I am an object or I am just trying to be taught reality by whatever higher power is out there and I choose the second option.  But maybe it is a mix of both.

We met on reddit, we had a good bond. It was my first year at uni, we watched shows together and made each other less lonely. As the friendship progressed some sort of emotional dependence developed and it was fine, we actually supported each other through a lot. But ngl it also started to rub off a negative effect on me real quick. During the first year and a half he was suicidal and self harmed a lot and even sent me pictures of the blood and it started affecting me. I was 17, and I kinda learned from that behavior and started releasing my stress and anxiety in similar ways. I don‚Äôt blame him for my decisions, but otherwise it was really hard to deal with a depressed 22 year old man. He had depression and he was miserable and I didn‚Äôt know how to support. Rip all the hours (or days) I spend tryna fix something that needed more than a friend‚Äôs support, the guy needed therapy. Throughout the next years we would talk and have a good time but most of the time was about his problems, his obsessions, his insecurities, etc. I talked about my problems a fair amount too so I was fine with it, but at some point it got too much. Fast forward to the beginning of this year. I felt like I lost all connection with him, I stopped feeling comfortable opening up to him, felt like I was forcing myself to listen to a wall most of the time. I was nice though because he was my friend. I thought about letting the friendship die off a hundred times, but he was lonely and he didn‚Äôt have a good environment or a good network of support yet‚Ä¶ uni was near and I knew he‚Äôd meet people there. He met this girl he liked, and he was new to dating, so he was excited but also very naive, and when she didn‚Äôt give him the attention he wanted he kinda let it ruin everyday of his week for a couple of weeks. And I had to listen to that despair every single day and I was very bored‚Ä¶ but hey at least he‚Äôs starting to meet people and become less lonely. A couple of months ago he started to stabilize and find people and I was legitimately happy for him. We still talked but I had moments where I was done and I knew this had to end soon. So one day I just said fuck it let‚Äôs have that talk. I made it clear that we drifted apart, that I can‚Äôt be close friends anymore, and that it was not his fault, it‚Äôs just how things go sometimes, etc. I don‚Äôt like ghosting because I don‚Äôt like to be ghosted especially in a friendship that meant a lot to me. I feel like I gave him the closure he deserves without compromising my feelings or my comfort. I told him I don‚Äôt think we can be friends anymore but we can still talk every now and then because I don‚Äôt wanna abruptly cut it off in case his mental health didn‚Äôt help him. We didn‚Äôt talk for a month, and I felt like a giant weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Yesterday he texted and I was like fuck it let‚Äôs see how he‚Äôs doing, I hope he‚Äôs doing well. He gave me an update but he got way too comfortable talking about details of details like we‚Äôre still close and in my head I‚Äôm weirded out like I made things clear that we aren‚Äôt that close? I replied to him and made sure everything is fine but the next morning I decided that hey he‚Äôs doing fine‚Ä¶ let me just close it off properly this time. After I gave him the closure and made everything clear and made sure he is doing fine and has a good support system, and I tried to be gentle and least hurtful. I realized that I don‚Äôt think I owe him anything else. I sent him one last honest message and wished him well, then I blocked him everywhere. And I feel‚Ä¶ relief. Like man I don‚Äôt have to feel this exhaustion ever again, like I don‚Äôt have to adjust my boundaries for someone ever again.
This is more like a message to myself since it‚Äôs my turn to give myself closure. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",I feel relief.,18mquty,1703065298.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mquty/i_feel_relief/,

"5 years ago I started a loving friendship with a person who I was ride or die for and I thought he felt the same way.

I was very clear about not wanting a relationship with him, and dated someone during the time we were friends for a period.

After 1 year he came clean about his feelings, he's had for me since the moment we met. I felt betrayed because he lied and. I still decided to hang out with him (my mistake) because my mindset was ""he can't do anything about his feelings, I shouldn't feel like this it's not his fault, maybe I was too excited about our friendship"" 

He then multiple times tried to gaslight me, tried to put me against my partner. and just kept on saying things over and over like ""I have a good job, lots of money, we can move in together,...) trying to correct and buy my love, as if he was god.

The end of our ""bond"" was when he tried to kiss me and ""feel"" me and I fawned, didn't dare to say anything, apart from ""dont do that"" with an awkward smile bc I didn't want him to get mad at me (my mistake again) and I just went ""to the bathroom"" to ""wash up"". Then he saw red and started screaming at me (for leaving to the bathroom i guess) and I kicked him out of my house.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived with my partner at the time and he was sick so I took care of him for a year. Didn't see my friends (also he has the same friend group so I just wanted to stay away for awhile.)

News came to me through one of my friends: he's bad mouthing me to all of our mutuals and people from my school I haven't talked to in years, to everyone he knows I know in one way or another.

Twisted truths, full blown lies.

Then more time passes I started going out again, he was there, trying to reconcile etc.. I trusted him bc ""it was so long ago"" his excuse for talking about me like that was ""people can say anything about you when you're not there to defend yourself"" wtf is even wrong with me to engage further w someone like that. I think I ignored that comment at the time because I saw some truth in it, It was my fault I wasn't there to defend myself.

that trust quickly changed when I find out this man is still slandering me to this day, 4 years after I kicked him out of my house. I'm getting scared now bc everytime I see him he comes to me and says ""hi friend"" and tries to interact with me, I'm too gutless to do anything about it., or speak my mind. 

I don't want to make him even more angry but it' starting to feel a little at least ""bullying and power movey"" at the most ""stalkerish and terrorizing me.""

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago after a party, we talked for awhile, while walking to the station he kept asking me to ""go home with him"" when I said no multiple times and made a kind goodbye and I said ""we can hangout next weekend if you want"" he got angry again in the middle of the fucking road and just yelled something along the lines ""if you don't come with me right now blabla"" idk what he said at the end bc at that point I already turned around and started walking away from him.

I just wanted to share bc i'm losing sleep over this for a year now, he took a lot of my friends and still stalks me and tries to gaslight me. 

Thank god to my friends who were honest to me about the things he said about me, they said it was full on brainwashing and if they wouldn't have asked me about it they would've taken his side.

I know this sounds stupid and that i'm completely, utterly gutless. But i just want my friends back and this man out of my life. It seems impossible bc he's so integrated in my friend group.

"im not asking for advice but i just havent been truthfull about my academics to anyone. Not family, not my closest friends, not even my boyfriend.

For the summer semester I took semester a classes but not b for a break as I almost failed all the classes taken in a. 

I spoke with my academic advisor so I would be able to enroll into fall classes and keep my gpa above a 2.5 as required. I did try for the first few weeks into semester a of fall but I quickly just dropped interest the last two weeks in class.

I received notifications to check my school email for the past week and i've just now opened it since im alone and no ones awake. Im suspended. Im able to appeal the suspension so I am taking the steps to do so, i've made an appointment with my advisor for today (its 4:30am) at 10:30am. 

I dont have any reasons to be failing, I have a great job that allows me to work on schoolwork without being interrupted. I earn more than I used to when I was starting college and I work in a less stressful environment with great hours.

I feel so incompetent and I have severe anxiety over my academics. If I fail school, im failing at life. 

I need to write an essay and present an academic plan to show that I care and really want to change. I really do, I know that as a first gen student I should be taking this more seriously, that many of my other classmates my age have already graduated. I have already given a season in which I was supposed to graduate as everyone kept asking. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EVEN SAY

Theres just this huge weight of guilt for not being able to meet their expectations, hell even MY expectations. I was on the dean's list before these past few semesters.

If the appeal doesn't work, (Im working hard to make it work), then I would tell them but if the appeal goes through, I will not be uttering a WHISPER of this. Not until I graduate at least.

"Title. 
I moved in around August. 
And I feel like I'm going insane. The old man that lives in the flat under me is coughing the whole fucking day. One of those.. Fake ass sounding old man coughs. It does things to me. The sound moves into every cell of my body and creates anger. 
Some people have told me ""well if he really is coughing all day like that he probably won't live much longer"" but I honestly don't have much hope for that. I know I shouldn't wish death upon someone else but gosh damnit.. 
I honestly don't know how the people living next to him cope with that. I've honestly dreaded going home from work because I knew the troll of annoying coughs is gonna be waiting for me. 
During the day I turn on the TV or put on headphones so i can kinda deal with it but the second I go to bed and just..like the minutes before I put in my ear plugs (which I have to wear every night now because of him) are painful... 

This whole feeling might be fueled by my anxiety and stuff and I just don't like the sound of coughing old man in my safety bubble but.. Just.. You know imagine a knife.. A very dull knife digging into you.. Every single day.. And that knife is a coughing old man.

"I (18f) feel like I've lost my value or possibility to be a good partner to whoever I meet in the future. I feel so disgusting and ashamed about my past. I started sending nudes to people when I was 10 years old, because when my grandma gave me my first phone in 4th grade, it unfortunately led to me talking to much older people online, and I ended up getting groomed several times. Not to mention, I was also being molested by my step father from the ages 11 to 14. My biological father has also been pretty absent from my life. I believe my fathers lack of presence caused me to seek attention and validation from older men. At this point, I've totaled over 50 people that I've sent nudes to. I feel so fucking horrible about it. It peaked when I was 13-14, as I went through a phase of hypersexuality as a trauma response to the molestation and grooming. Despite knowing this is not entirely my fault, I can't help but take the blame for it. I hate myself for getting into situations where I KNEW the people I was speaking to were bad news. For example, when I was 17 I began talking to a convicted sex offender online, just to feel desired. I also consistently spoke to this particular guy who groomed me for 4 years, knowing he was no good for me, I was just masturbation material to him. How could my future spouse not be disappointed in me for this? I feel like at this point my only valuable attribute is my body, because I'm so used to it being the only thing I get praised for. I have only ever known being loved for my sex appeal, so I kept doing it. The only way I felt appreciated was by being complimented by horny males online. I'm trying my best to break this habit, I've still sent nude/lewd photos in the past year, but 'only' to 4 people. That's not a lot for me. I'm improving, but I have no idea how I'm going to be open about this to my future partner. I still feel somewhat hopeful as I have no physical sexual experience, but I assume it's going to hurt my future spouse to hear that I've shared images of my body to over 50 people. I feel so fucking guilty. How is anyone ever going to respect me?

"I've been gradually falling in love with a friend over the course of a little under a year. For security, we'll give her a fake name and call her Laura. I met Laura when I moved states through a mutual friend and we hit it off instantly. We shared a lot of interests and have insanely good chemistry. However, there are a few problems. When I met her, she was already in a year long relationship with another girl. This girl is also in the same friend group as Laura and I.

Laura moved to a different state a few months after I met her, so we tried to spend a lot of time together before she had to go. We shared a lot of laughs and talked about things we normally wouldn't with other people. She told me that she was having some relationship issues with her girlfriend and it was stressing her out. Laura's tried to communicate these issues, but it's never been sorted out. Some of these issues include being long distance, communication and emotional maturity. 

Recently, I visited Laura for a few days and we had a blast. She made me realize a few things about myself, and she constantly challenges my way of thinking. We learn a lot from each other, which I really enjoy. I also learned that I have major feelings for her now. I feel immense guilt because I am in the same friend group as Laura and her girlfriend. I know I shouldn't be having these feelings, but I can't help but notice my chemistry with Laura and wonder what it would be like if we were together.

I know some of you might judge me, and I accept that. I can't help how I'm feeling, as much as I would like to.

"Like the title says, I ªm being singled out by my professor and it ªs incredibly irritating. I'm not looking for advice or anything like that, I'd just like to vent and I figured this place was where my story belongs. If this wasn ªt a class I absolutely needed, I ªd have dropped it within the first week of the semester.  
This particular professor had done little things through each class as the weeks went on but what really upset me at first was they'd take art pencils right out of my hand and start drawing on my paper for me. Not little adjustments here and there but make incredibly huge changes. Scribbling all over my work. What really set me off one day was this professor would keep coming up to me every 5 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) and tell me what I'm doing wrong. This is a 3 hour class. I guess they saw the look on my face and asked if I wanted help, to which I snapped at them and said I didn't. They just sheepishly walked away but left me alone for the most part the rest of the class period. The following class, the professor came up to me and asked, once again, if I wanted help with the drawing we were doing. I said I didn't as politely as I could (way more polite than the first time I said I didn't need help) and they had this look on their face like they were just so annoyed but put on a smile anyway. It was the same feeling of biting into a rotten peach with honey on it. They asked to talk to me outside and basically told me I'd better shut up and take their help or risk my grade falling. With their college experience under their belt, I should sit tf down and be open to learn. Of course I turned them in, but it just got worse for me there.  
It isn't to say I can't handle being told where I can improve. I love to learn how I can improve as an artist, however, I have been drawing literally since I could hold a pencil. I come from a family of artists, I know a thing or two about art, I've even taught a small art class once before and this wasn't my first art class. I transferred from a different college and not all my credits followed me, that's why I had to take this class. Coming into a beginner's art class (again), I figured it would be an easy A but I was also ready to learn how to grow. Y'know, re-learn the fundamentals and basics. Instead, my art pencil is being torn from my hands and my papers being drawn on without a word why. I'm being interrupted and micro-managed through my art pieces. I'm hearing my classmates being told to start over 50 minutes into an hour long life-study session. Not to mention that this professor will tell you how well they think your piece is coming along and not give you full points on it for a grade. The most recent egregious act they've pulled is changing the syllabus 2 weeks before the end of the semester and getting mad at us for ""not being prepared"" for class the next day. They've even gotten to the point of yelling at us for not being able to understand what exactly they want (they're never clear).  
After I had turned them in for doing what they did, I noticed they started separating me from the friends I had made in class (I'm not the best at making friends so this really hurt). Each class they'd have me sit in a different area where I had been sitting originally. They don't do this with anyone else in the class despite there being other cliques. Any time there's a lecture of some sort, the professor is always picking me if I have any questions or comments or if I understand what's going on and they don't do this with anyone else. It's gotten to the point where my friends think it could be racially motivated. It's a big accusation and it isn't the first card I would have pulled, but I'm also the only person in the class who looks very obviously of a certain race.  
Anyway, sorry for the long rant. Thank you if you read everything. Please comment if you have any comments or questions.  
TL;DR my professor is on a power trip despite only teaching for less than a year and my friends think they're singling me out because of my race.

Here's the update:

Probably not the update some of you were hoping for. I couldn't really do anything. I met with the head of the department but the meeting wasn't productive at all. My best hope is people read the new RateMyProfessor page on them and see the terrible score. To be completely fair, of the 40+ drawings we had to turn in, there were a handful I couldn't do. To be less fair, there were scores I got that were like 4.5/5, 4.75/5, or 3.5/7 with no explanation why. Those stacked up against me and I ended the course with a C+. I'm not the best artist in the world but I know I'm better than a C+ in an entry level art class. This whole situation has been so extremely upsetting and frustrating but there's nothing more I can do but move on and try to not let it bother me. 

This professor has made too many of us cry in and out of class. They've even straight up told students to drop the course if we don't wanna be there or if we don't ""wanna learn"".

"So I'm 26 (F) an only child and have a strange relationship with my mom.

I have had the opportunity through my parents to live abroad and moved frequently. When I graduated highschool I moved to the netherlands for Uni cause I had a high school boyfriend who basically made me believe that this was THE place to be (I was a pick me girl just so you know). My mom already had a huge issue with me leaving the country and move by myself to study and be with my boyfriend. Not so long after I had moved to the Netherlands, I broke up with him cause the whole relationship was basically one sided (took me quite some time to realize haha). 

My mother always cried, made me feel like crap for having ""left her behind"", and ""being selfish"" for leaving her. I never considered to wanting to stay, as our relationship was always so emotionally fueled and i really just wanted to find my own direction in life. Being young, I basically did what everyone did in their uni - single ilfe. My mom constantly told herself that I was going to come back after Uni to work at home. Side note: My parents live literally by plane max. 2 hours away, which is really not like me sitting in Australia and them being in you know what I mean. Anyways, time has gone by and I have lived constantly with this guilt that I love it in the Netherlands, but I also love being at home in my home country and with my parents. Time goes by and I had met a Dutch guy, fallen in love, bought a house, and he is honestly my partner in crime who is completely the opposite to my ex. We are together for nearly 6 years. My mom likes him and makes comments like: he can find a job here and you guys can come back. Or she makes comments to me: You can just pack your stuff and come back and find the same jobs you are working in the Netherlands here. These comments hurt, a lot. Not only is she being selfish, but she is also not really thinking about anything I have built there. 

I live now 8 years in the Netherlands, I visit my parents 4 times a year. In the time span of living abroad, my parents have only visited me 4 times. I bought a house with a guest room, but my mom is ""too tired"" to wanting to visit me. 

I always feel like I am the bad person for making my own life decisions. I am the one always hurting her. I even find it hard to talk to her about it, because she is so blindsided by her emotions so she doesnt even bother putting herself in my shoes. 

Oh, and another very important side note, my mom left her country over 30 years ago, never came back except for visiting. Met my dad and also traveled and lived in other countries (even in asia). In my eyes, I was raised to travel. Her mom lives also in another european country with my aunt and uncle. They made their life choices to be abroad like this from each other, which should not be basically expected of me to be in any way different!! 

For those who have read my post till here, thanks for hearing me out. I live with this guilt a long time already and also start to get tired of my own complaining.

Now college is over, has been for a couple months. I‚Äôm still going to therapy and have gotten a little better. But I‚Äôm struggling to let it go. I don‚Äôt feel proud of completing my degree, there‚Äôs no pride in what caused me immense pain.

"Before telling you what i feel like doing when i feel low i want to describe my medical history..
I‚Äôm having hyperthyroidism and i take medication for it and it is under control.
Also have acne so the dermatologist suggested me it is because of hormonal issues and i will experience mood swings because of it.
My periods are regular so i do not think i have pcod but i will visit gynecologist once my mom comes over. (I do not know how will i tell her about the same)
Also since i was a kid, my parents separated (not divorced) and my mom left to work in a different country leaving me with her sister who didn‚Äôt treat me well and she left me when her house was built. I was traumatized with all this initially trying to learn how to manage things all by myself while also continuing the studies.
I graduated last year and i am preparing for licensing exam for a different country. I‚Äôve the support from my mother but Im scared what if I won‚Äôt crack the exam which is expensive.
I‚Äôve been trying to stay strong in front of my relatives and friends but i feel low many times and i do not know why i feel this way.
I thought of visiting psychologist but like many people i just do not know how to approach them and talk about all these issues because i feel i do not want to blame anyone for the way i feel. 
When i feel low i push people away! I feel i want to be alone all my life to avoid complications. I started dating a guy who is genuinely kind person i met. I am not used to all this love from anyone so tend to push him away without a reason when i feel low. I do feel bad for him and often say him to leave me on my own as he deserves someone better who is caring, kind and loving just like him. 
Just wanted to put it out here so you guys can give me honest advice on what I should be doing to not be this hard on myself.
(I will talk to therapist after my exams if this is what depression is)

"I have been with him for almost a year and I‚Äôm very in love with him. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before and I‚Äôm so grateful he‚Äôs in my life. I‚Äôm going to miss him so much. I have no idea how I‚Äôll move forward but I just can‚Äôt stay with him. To be honest, I have known for some time he was going to do this. But, every time he would get close to transitioning in even small beginner ways (going by a new name, changing clothes, telling people etc) he would never do it. He seems miserable living as a woman but for some reason he can‚Äôt seem to take charge of his transition (I am transgender myself) but now he is going to start medically transitioning soon and he has told many people in his life. He even wants to tell my parents. Again I have known that he wanted to transition, but selfishly, being with him as a woman has been amazing. I love his hair and his smell. His body is incredible. He is so good to me and completely out of my league. I‚Äôve never been attracted to someone like this. I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs even been mine for this long. Now that he is getting closer to really transitioning it is changing our relationship, seemingly starting with our sex life. He doesn‚Äôt want to have sex in the same way which is understandable but also makes it more clear to me that this isn‚Äôt going to work. Even if I didn‚Äôt need to make any accommodations for his dysphoria, the chemistry just won‚Äôt be there once he is on testosterone. I have talked to him about this and we have both expressed our concern that when he transitions that I will loose my physical attraction to him. I told him that I want to stay together for as long as possible and see what happens in case I do not loose feelings but I already know I will. I‚Äôve been knowing it isn‚Äôt going to work. The transition hasn‚Äôt even really begun and its making things more complicated. I want to make it clear to anyone who reads this that I want him more than anything to transition. I tell him over and over again that this is something he must do for himself even if I‚Äôm out of the picture as a result. His life will be so much better and I‚Äôm genuinely excited for his future and the man he will become but there‚Äôs no way I can keep ‚Äúmy girlfriend‚Äù in the process. 

I think I‚Äôve made myself out to not be a horrible person with that first paragraph, but it gets a bit more murky from here. I will genuinely miss him - but if I‚Äôm being totally honest with myself - selfishly I don‚Äôt know when another relationship will come. I have no friends other than him. Most women just aren‚Äôt attracted to me for understandable reasons. I‚Äôm short, weak, horribly introverted, have no penis, and covered in acne among many other things. I‚Äôm an extremely unselfish lover and I genuinely think I‚Äôm ‚Äúgood at sex‚Äù and pleasing my partner, but I can‚Äôt prove that to anyone if I never get the chance. I can‚Äôt deny that part of the reason I‚Äôve held on to this relationship longer than I know I should have is because after he is gone I don‚Äôt know what is in store for my social and sexual life. I don‚Äôt think its unrealistic to think I will be alone for some time. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve vented to someone or something and I generally feel embarrassed or ashamed of this kind of thing.

"On Monday, my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs best friend called me and said she locked herself in their bathroom and refused to come out. She has been going through an extremely rough period involving her parents and two weeks ago something happened regarding her mom that might have broken her. She stopped taking her meds and disappeared for two days before coming back to her dorm and locking herself in the bathroom. When I got there it took my friend and I an hour to convince her to open the door but we should have called the police instead. She opened the door and attacked her friend and started punching her in the face while screaming someone‚Äôs name. My ex has a red belt in taekwondo and it was difficult getting her off her friend. I ended up taking multiple elbows in the face and received a black eye as a result. I was able to push her off but she ran back to the bathroom and tried taking her life. I called the police and they were able to get to her and she was taken to the hospital. She had a severe mental breakdown and yesterday her brother texted me to say she made another attempt on her life and she is not leaving the psych ward for a while. Her friend ended up breaking her orbital bone and nose and lost multiple teeth and is filing charges against her. I feel so bad for her.

Two days later one of her friends sent me a DM with screenshots of my ex-girlfriend making fun of my speech impediment and myself in general. I have trouble pronouncing the letter ‚Äúr‚Äù and I have made progress but I have not fully overcome it yet. She mentioned using my body for sex and made fun of my sister getting diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She said I am too nice of a person and it was easy for her to manipulate me. I was confused when I read it but when it set in I lost my cool. I blocked my ex and all her friends and deactivated my social media accounts. I punched my bathroom wall multiple times and ended up spending $100 afterward repairing it. My ex-girlfriend and I were together for three months and I thought everything was fine but her friends kept warning me that she was extremely manipulative and I did not believe them but I should have. I told her things I have not said to anyone else and I feel like my privacy has been violated.

I was able to suppress my feelings since it was finals week and blocked everything out of my mind and I drove home for winter break but more things happened. My sister was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last month and it sucks watching her energetic personality be dormant. She was scheduled to have surgery tomorrow but on Friday her appendix burst in the middle of class while taking a final and was brought to the hospital. They removed her appendix but her surgery has been moved back.

I got home when my parents were at the hospital with my sister and none of them were picking up my phone so I was left alone and I finally began to process the entire week. I did not leave my room for three days and just laid down on the floor replaying the same events. My mom was worried about me but was occupied with my sister but she knocked on my door and asked if I was okay. I usually would say yes but I said no and she laid next to me and started asking questions. Suddenly I burst into tears and could not stop crying. I have not cried in front of my mother since I was probably ten years old and I never cry in general but all the stress and anger I feel boiled over. It took my mom and dad three hours to calm me down and I fell asleep as soon as I stopped crying. This has been the worst week of my life and I feel absolutely exhausted.

"on top of my natural urge to always sorta cringe when I look back on my old self, the significant increase in alcohol consumption during this time has made looking back even more painful. 

I‚Äôve had a weird relationship with alcohol. I was in love with it freshman/sophomore year of college. and even when I slightly distanced from it by senior year, I didn‚Äôt realize how wild it made me until recently. 

idk I just watched a bunch of old snapchats. I acted so foolish and would post the most gooberish and confusing videos of me drunk and going out with friends on my private story. I would say absolutely out of pocket stuff or just stuff that made no sense. looking back I can‚Äôt help but to imagine how I could‚Äôve offended people or just made them think I was a complete fool. 

idk why this is sending me into an identity crisis. bc my past 4 years have some way or another revolved around alcohol. I‚Äôve barely drank these past 4 months, I feel pretty good about it, but I don‚Äôt even known who I am anymore. 

I like sober me, but this sober me is very different than sober me from high school. I know that‚Äôs the point of life, to always keep changing, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less startling when it happens. I just wonder when I‚Äôll be able to look back on myself and not be in complete shock over how much I followed my wild emotions and preferences over logic and staying grounded.

"So a bit of backstory, i graduated with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering in January of 2021, doing fairly well all things considering, not honor roll, but still.

I didnt get a job until December of that year after countless applications and a handful of interviews at some big shot petrochemical companies. This job was at a music store, and as a musician, I didnt mind this at all. Learnt a lot from there and I just enjoyed learning how to repair and set up instruments.

This job only lasted a year because the ownership was a shitshow and laid almost everyone off in February of this year, so it ended on a pretty sour note. Got a really sick guitar out of it (one of the most expensive ones we carried) as compensation seeing that they refused to pay cash.

During the music store job i went through a fairly long interview process that went on from September to Nov 2022. It was at THE bigshot petrochemical company in my country and i was on course to doubling my paycheck and finally getting into the field that i bust my ass 5.5 years for. I tried to keep my excitement under check but towards November it was looking pretty much certain and just a matter of signing the job offer. 3 months of screening and medicals, just to be told no because of a preexisting disability i have, ive been blind in my left eye since i was 10. Fair to say that was an absolute kick in the dick, and then just to be let go some 3 months laterdidnt help matters.

Our government has an unemployment program where companies can post job listings and you apply and so on, so forth. Granted the filtering is absolute trash, as it supposedly filters listings by your qualifications, but somehow i get suggested truck driver and compsci positions. But anywho, I found a listing from the company im currently at for a Healthy and Safety Engineer, not really in my field but i thought it could be a good foothold to get into at least, so i applied, and I got hired this March.

Ill spare all the bullshit Ive been though as thing is already long as it is, but this place is run like absolute dogshit. Its all nepotism at the top, HR is family, ""management"" is family, there is no management to be heard of here. Theyve moved me around 3 fucking departments where i do absolutely fuck all regardless of how many times ive brought it up that this was below all my expectations. Ive completely checked out mentally now, I would usually make sure everything is done perfectly, organized, and ready before my manager even asks for it. But now i couldnt give less of a shit. I do less than the bare minimum, if they fire me, theyd be doing me favour.

One major thing I despise about this place is the fucking hypocrisy. They try to make such a big fuss about making your mentality health a priority, but within the last 4 months, 9 people have had heart attacks, 3 of them fatal, one of which was this last saturday. Not a word from these fuckers, not a single one, just brushed under the carpet.

My contract ends at the end of March, and im counting the fucking days. A good chunk of our QC team all resigned at the same because they had it with this shithhole. Ive got a couple of jobs in my sights, just waiting on the ball to start rolling. I really really really fucking hate this place, every morning when i park i just get a headache. We just came back from a long weekend because of our national day holidays and i nearly had a breakdown in the car on the way here. I fucking hate this place.

I hope i get to leave before I get a heart attack myself, or I just straight up off myself.",I hate my job and its deteriorating my mental health,18moibv,1703055634.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18moibv/i_hate_my_job_and_its_deteriorating_my_mental/,
"9am - Driving to work this morning I came over a hill on a major highway (75mph limit) to witness a man bolt across 3 lanes of traffic to the median. Had there been a second less, the person in front of me would have hit him and so would I.

"	Hello everyone, sorry this update has taken so long. Once my friend arrived things got really hectic. She‚Äôs been settling in well, and it has been a huge relief to have her here with me, as it gives me a sense of security that I didn‚Äôt really have before. We‚Äôve been taking time to build new routines, finding a new normal I guess that works for us both. It‚Äôs been a challenge but at the same time, everything has been so different one day to the next that it‚Äôs kept the days from seeming boring or blurring together.  
	One of the elderly neighbors I‚Äôve been talking to a lot since I moved here has also invited the both of us to spend Christmas with her and her family. They‚Äôre going to have a goat as the main meat, which is different but I‚Äôm excited to try. It‚Äôs odd to not see Christmas trees everywhere, but that‚Äôs still a new thing so it‚Äôs not common here. But her granddaughter is teaching my friend and I some of the dances we‚Äôll be doing, as Christmas celebrations here a more like a festive party and gathering rather than a slow day spent with just gifts.  
	It‚Äôs odd, as even in my family we‚Äôd only every be given three gifts. One for our body, one for the mind and the last for the soul to honor the trinity according to my parents. Last year I think I received a new Sunday dress, a set of physics textbooks and a new log journal for my scripture reading. After gift openings we‚Äôd each retreat to our rooms and remain there until dinner was ready usually made by mother and myself. Yet here, they‚Äôre planning on doing our hair, having dances and music with food and laughter. Gifts are still given obviously but the day is spent more with those around you than on material things.  
	I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ excited. I‚Äôve decided to ignore my family for now. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of questions on why I didn‚Äôt report them or confront them and the answer is easy and may seem a bit‚Ä¶ childish but the thought of facing them like that terrifies me. I just ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to be around them, talk to them or think about them. I‚Äôm genuinely scared that trying to ‚Äòbring justice‚Äô will only drag me right back into the mess I ran from. I‚Äôm 22 and yet I‚Äôm terrified of my own family. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not doing anything to them, I just want to pretend, even if only for a bit that my life isn‚Äôt messed up and freakish, if that makes any sense at all.  
	I don‚Äôt know where I will be a year from now, but somehow, the thought doesn‚Äôt worry me. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy, genuinely happy, and excited to see where things will go from here. Thank you everyone. Really I mean it. Looking back, it‚Äôs mind-blowing how things have changed, and there is still so much I get to do!

I know there are people here from all over the world, I'd love to hear your holiday traditions I don't care if it's not Christmas I'd just love to hear what you do this time of year and your traditions. I'm trying to figure out my new normal, and what I like so I'd love any suggestions be it food, music, dances, anything really!

"I first heard this little nugget of wisdom from a team lead at my company maybe two years ago; since then I‚Äôve tried to incorporate the idea behind it into my day to day life. 

This year was a doozy, and I slowly challenged that idea more and more as it wore on. I‚Äôve gotta say though, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been told. Everyone has their own skills and niches, myself included- it‚Äôs made it easier to try to build new skills in a year where I was unable to work on the ones I‚Äôve been focusing on years prior.

I dunno where I‚Äôm going with this honestly. I just wanted to get the idea out and look at it head on again. I‚Äôve got a lot to be grateful for, even at this time of year that always makes me sad, and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm doing new things every day in spite of my anxieties and hesitations.

"We got together at a young age and it's always been a rollercoaster of ups and downs, now we have multiple kids together. We constantly argue and yell at each other and she always tears me down instead of building me up. We have totally different views on life and I don't like the things she teaches our children. Currently the house we live in is in her mother's name and she has always been mommy's spoiled angel so once we split I will be homeless. I honestly don't even care about being homeless because I'll be able to sleep in peace I mean we don't sleep together anymore anyway I've slept on the couch for months so sleeping in my truck can't be much worse. I do not have family who will just buy me a house or rent me a house or give me a place to stay. My main thing is my kids, where will I take them when it's my time to watch them? What should I do? I watched my parents argue everyday until they finally split up when I was about 8, I remember my household always feeling not welcoming when they were in the house together and I always preferred being with my father even though he was the stricter parent. I don't want my kids to grow up the same way that I did in that regard. What should I do? I'd hate to leave my family right before Christmas because it would ruin my kids Christmas but I'm starting to loose my mind. I can't stand being in the same room as this woman all she does is talk about money and if she had a man with money how much better her life is and she's always comparing her life to her rich sisters life who has no kids and is about 8 years younger than her.... She hates her own life so she tries to make my life miserable and blames me for all her problems even though I try my hardest. I work construction but only here and there because she expects me to drop the kids off at school and pick them up everyday when they get out of school halfway through the day. Construction doesn't work like that it's early in the am until the sun goes down so of course I don't have any money but she won't make the changes of her regular 9-5 job to just work night shifts or something and then has the audacity to cut me down about how I don't do anything to provide or take care of the family. She tells me I can't eat the food in the house or complains when I do even if I bought the food, she constantly kicks me out for 2-3 days at a time and then when I come back I keep all my clothes and work tools in a closet, she's called the police on me for ""hitting her"" when I've never in my life hit her the worst I've done is push her off of me when she was scratching me and punching me. It's crazy the things I deal with on a weekly basis. I have nothing because I give her all my money or spend all my money on our kids childcare, school clothes, etc. Someone give me some real advice please because I'm loosing my mind.",I hate my wife,18mo4rl,1703054191.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mo4rl/i_hate_my_wife/,

"So a few months ago, I (20M) went to meet my long distance girlfriend (19F) of a year and a half. When we met, things were great at first in pretty much every way, but near the end of the 2 week trip, she was acting a bit off. A week after I went home, she broke up with me saying that she didn't want a relationship until she finished medical school, which she had never mentioned before and is years and years into the future, so it never felt like the real reason to me.

Fast forward to today and I checked her Twitter for the first time in a few weeks because I get curious from time to time - after all, I really did love and care for this girl, so while I don't contact her to respect that she wants to be left alone, I still want to make sure she's doing alright - and she just recently posted her results on one of those ""what type of lesbian am I"" tests saying she's a femme lesbian.

Right now, I'm a little confused on how to feel. I can't say I didn't see it coming at all - when we broke up, I spent weeks, maybe months thinking of what I could've done or why she might have wanted to break up, and her being lesbian was one of the possibilities. I am still a bit confused though, especially since (don't ask how I know, she can be quite public with these things) she was still listening to male NSFW audios last month, and she was actually *more* sexual towards the end of our relationship which wouldn't make much sense if I was turning her off.

Mostly, I'm just not sure how to feel. Apparently when I looked it up, most people in my situation get sort of insecure about their masculinity, which isn't really a problem for me. Girls are hot, I love them too, so I can't blame her. What I am concerned about is that I somehow fucked things up for her. I wasn't the first guy she had been with, she'd had at least 2 or 3 relationships with guys before me, so the fact that I was the tipping point for her coming out as lesbian kind of concerns me. I also knew she was into girls when we met originally, she was just pansexual as am I, so it's not that she suddenly likes women, it's that she suddenly is no longer into men. Was I really that bad?

Anyways, yeah, that's about how I'm feeling right now. Anyone else in a similar situation, especially if you ever reconciled with your ex and got an explanation on things, please do let me know because I'm feeling very confused right now.

"So this image actually appeared on TheYNC (gore site) about 2 years ago, it depicted a completely Naked Woman between 28-29 years of age, if I had to guess. She was very curvy, she was getting her throat slit like a wild Hog out in the country side. This kind of pissed me off in a way back then because she had a really nice body. I mean like very curvy, and they could've at least used her for fucking purposes first, g-damn. They were probably fgts anyway.

When I complained on a post thread on that site (for when they used to have it) people told me that photo was actually fake and it was photoshopped, I called bullshit on this claim, because they could not provide me a source for which they came to this conclusion. Not only that, why the fuck would anyone photoshop something like that? They are either mentally unstable or just crazy in general. Or they want to hunt down Women, whatever the reason might have been.

I just remembered this image buried deep within my subconscious, I guess I repressed it all these years. She had her hands tied behind her back and her ankles were tied down and there was torrents of blood coming out.

The thing about TheYNC it turned into complete shit in recent times. especially now, I tried going on there, the server lag was incredibly bad.

"Keeping it short, in struggling with the question of whether to report my former teacher (three years ago, high school) to CPS.

When I first met him, we really hit it off- I thought he was a great guy. I probably revealed too much of myself and my struggles to him, which made me very vulnerable. I think he knew that. He had me do a virtual ‚Äúmeet up‚Äù after school (during COVID). Then when he had me do another one, a second time, he had me make a Snapchat. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing so because of a previous experience on Snapchat, but he said it could just be for us to talk and to use a fake name- which he picked and was ‚Äúsnow white‚Äù. After that, contact extended wayyy beyond school topics and hours‚Ä¶ he started telling me how bad his love life was, how lonely he was, about his mental illness, and he kept asking for pictures of my face. Whenever I would say I don‚Äôt like taking or seeing photos of myself, he would just say he thought I was beautiful and should send them, but usually wouldn‚Äôt push it further until the next time.

In February of that year, I got a surgery on my foot and wasn‚Äôt able to attend his class due to the medication and pain from PT- and over Snapchat messages, he flipped out on me because he thought I was attending other teacher‚Äôs classes and not his. I was really scared and stopped messaging him, as well as attending any of my classes for the rest of the year. I was afraid that if I attended my other classes, he would find out, and make me go back to attending his again. But at the end of the day, nothing actually happened and no crime was committed.

So, I‚Äôm hesitant to call CPS. It‚Äôs been three years since the incident and what if I truly am overreacting? What if he was just lonely? CPS is awful and often either does nothing or ruins a person‚Äôs life. But, on the other hand, if he was doing that to another sixteen year old girl and I didn‚Äôt report it, I don‚Äôt think I could forgive myself. I know for a fact that he‚Äôs still teaching there.

Whenever I try talk about what happened she gets angry and turns into an argument. I think I love her in the way that I just want to take care of her and make her happy, but there is no happy feelings or butterflies, and I feel im never happy when not with her and always overthinking all her actions since the contiki, like if she doesn‚Äôt want to have sex I overthink and compare her choosing the other guys on the contiki over me. I don‚Äôt know what to do, it‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve wanted out of a relationship, but I‚Äôm still hurt and I don‚Äôt want to lose her, but I just don‚Äôt think I love her. We are very codependent on each other and spend nearly every night of the week with each other. I feel like I rushed into it and needed time to be single after what happened, my feelings aren‚Äôt back to where they were before the contiki, any advice would be helpful. She does treat me well now, but can be quite moody and feel doesn‚Äôt wants to go the events I want to and am usually catering to her, but she still is all I‚Äôve ever wanted from a gf, but at the same time I don‚Äôt know what to expect since she is my first gf",Don‚Äôt love my best friend,18mnc66,1703051416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mnc66/dont_love_my_best_friend/,
"for context: 23f with MDD with onset around 12yo. started medication and therapy in 2020. therapy sessions ended in 2021 since my therapist moved to another clinic that didn‚Äôt accept my insurance. made the unwise decision to taper off my meds in late 2022, spiraled, and got back on them in march 2023.

i‚Äôve been in therapy before and it, along with medication, helped tremendously. i think without it, i wouldn‚Äôt be able to function as well as i do now. of course, medication and a couple years of therapy won‚Äôt solve everything and i do still have intrusive thoughts, especially when i‚Äôm either physically or mentally tired. these thoughts are not frequent enough to cause concern and i‚Äôm able to push them out fairly easily. i don‚Äôt dwell on them and usually they‚Äôre not very distressing because i know they don‚Äôt represent my true thoughts and feelings.

i recently started therapy again and have only had maybe 4 or 5 sessions with this person. he is a resident psychiatrist (baby doctor) who is currently specializing in therapy with only a little focus on medication management. i am slow to open up so we were still working on getting a good picture of my life experiences leading up to now. i was very open and honest. i don‚Äôt see the point in lying in therapy, so yesterday, when he asked about any disturbing thoughts, i was honest and said yes. he asked how recently and i said the night before. i clarified that it was intrusive, i had no plan, intent, or desire. at that point, nothing i said mattered. he said he did not feel safe with me leaving and asked if i would consider inpatient treatment. i said no. i know myself well enough and have dealt with these thoughts and feelings for 10+ years now. i know when i do and don‚Äôt need treatment. that didn‚Äôt matter either. he escalated the situation, and ems, firefighters, and police showed up to the clinic to escort me to the ER for an assessment and admission. at this point i was very upset and crying. no one was listening or believed me. they said i could go voluntarily or involuntarily. either way i had no choice. i went voluntarily without making a scene. we got to the ER, explained the situation to every doctor and nurse. some believed me and some didn‚Äôt. ultimately, i was admitted to the psych floor ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù. otherwise i would‚Äôve been guaranteed a 3 day stay in hell. i have been inpatient before and at the time, i needed it. i enjoyed my time there and felt safe. however, in this situation, i did not need to be admitted. thankfully, i was discharged less than 24 hours later because the attending (doctor in charge) believed me when i said there was no reason for me to be there.

i‚Äôm at home now where i usually feel safe. i haven‚Äôt eaten all day, i‚Äôm anxious, angry, and holding back tears. i can‚Äôt sleep. i feel violated. i was paraded out of a clinic in front of everyone, stripped of all my personal belongings without the opportunity to make arrangements for my dog to be taken care of, my car to be moved, for me to call in to work, or even notify my family and friends. i had to call my mom from the unit. to make things worse, i work at the hospital that i was sent to and know people that work on the psych unit.

my mom had to call in to work to drive 3 hours to where i live in order to take care of my dog and bring me clothes. i explained what happened and i‚Äôm sure even my own mother doesn‚Äôt believe me. she went through my apartment and removed anything dangerous. i am afraid to go back into therapy, even if i won‚Äôt see the same person. i think this experience has ruined mental health care for me.",i feel violated,18mnbek,1703051346.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mnbek/i_feel_violated/,

"This isn't a story, but more like telling you information. I (14 M), am absolutely lost. I'm a loser who just sits around playing videogames for hours at a time, several times a day, every single day. I eat like shit, and I eat a lot more than I should, which is because both I already have problems with going to the bathroom regularly and I'm skinny. I don't have a girlfriend, and while I've ""been with"" girls online before, it just didn't work out. And that's because I'm a douche. I watch porn frequently, and it's not just normal porn, but I really don't want to talk about that. I've even gone as far as staying up late, or missing a whole night of sleep and missing school the next day ""because I couldn't sleep for some reason"", just because I wanted to watch porn instead. I'm not blaming anyone or anything but myself for it, and it's not easy to quit. Anyway, I'm not the type of person who sees myself as ugly or anything, and that's because I'm a narcissist, so I don't think that's why I'm not able to attract any girls. I assume it's my awkwardness. Because holy hell am I awkward, especially when it comes to the simplest things, like the transition period at school. The only thing that goes through my mind, is ""What do these people think of me?"" And though I'm a narcissist, I just can't not care about what others think. But no one has ever told me something negative they thought about my appearance. To help you understand what kind of person I am, think of me like this: An asshole who does barely anything more than what he complains his family and friends don't do enough of. He hates people just because they aren't doing something the same way as him. He thinks this because he also thinks that the way he does everything is the right way to do it, no matter how shitty it actually is. But through all this, his pride shatters when he's surrounded by those same people. The self-diagnosed ""social anxiety disorder, adhd, ocd, and autism"" all reveal who he actually is inside. But no one actually gives two shits about him. They never look at him. But he still feels like they do, even though he knows they don't. Yeah, I'm a total ass. Even as I type this, I cringe at my apparent self victimization. But I'm only trying to tell the truth. And I'm not proud of making this post. I wish I wasn't this person, who goes on Reddit like a loser and wants answers from other losers. I titled this post ""I don't know what to do."" because I really don't. I'm depressed, I don't know for how long. Both me and my siblings had a rough early childhood experience, which has probably affected who we are right now. I don't blame anyone for that either. There's this girl that I like, but she's not interested in me, which is pretty reasonable. I don't want to give away any details about who she is because I want to be respectful. But I'll say why I like her. It's really not anything complex, just I think she's really cute and she's a cool person. I already told her that I like her, so don't assume I'm asking for a way to do that. She didn't really seem to mind too much when I told her. I actually thought I was ""reminding her"" because I thought she already knew I liked her. I brought it up with her because I was making that the reason why I wanted to cut her off, and it was and still is. I've tried to stop talking to her completely like 4 times now, but everytime I just relapse and reinstall Snap and Insta and re-add her and say sorry, because I somehow convince myself that she cares when I stop talking to her. We're good friends in general, so I guess I could see why she might actually be a little sad about that. But I can tell she doesn't feel the same way about me, in terms of ""liking"". I only see her every few weeks, even though she doesn't live far. But whatever yk. She's a few years older and has a job so she's always pretty busy. I don't really care too much about seeing her or hanging out with her because 50% of the times we have before, it was awkward as shit or just short and gloomy because we're both depressed. I guess I should or can include that I almost killed myself in July of this year because I thought my friendship with her was over. I know that sounds extreme, and it is, but I was just in a deeper hole than I am now and she was all I could think about at that time. And mind that at that time she had a boyfriend, who I knew and still know now, and I still liked her for some reason. He's cool too, even though they're not together now. But other than all that shit, I can't really say my life is horrible. I'm just miserable man. I'm not healthy, and I no longer have good hygiene. I was doing pretty well a few months back, but fuck that fake ""self improvement"" shit. I'm not really feeling too sad anymore, even though I'm depressed, only because I constantly consume dopamine in the form of shit food or videogames and social media. Thanks if you made it this far.

"I (23F) recently quit my corporate job in august because it made me unhappy. I worked there for a little over a year and a half, this only being my second corporate job. This decision was made after almost a year of going back and forth with myself weighing the pros and cons. Everyday when I logged into work I felt absolutely miserable. On paper, it was the perfect job, the job I journaled about having, my dream pay and ideal working environment (I worked 100% remotely with the occasional travel) but I felt as if I was suffocating being there. I was being overworked and felt like I wasnt being treated fairly within the work environment I was in. I gaslit myself and my experience for a while and then I started speaking to my therapist, family and friends about how I was feeling. I began to apply to new roles around May, and I I applied to around 80 and only heard back from a few but even though I followed up multiple times I never received interviews.

Anyways, at the beginning of August, I really couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I put my two weeks notice in. I had 3 months of bills saved up and an emergency fund so I felt comfortable leaving with no job lined up, even though it isn‚Äôt something I would ideally want to do. I continued the job search and now since have applied to over 200 jobs, I have had a few interviews but mostly rejections and just dead ends. I‚Äôve spoken with recruiters, gotten my resume checked, and have even received good feedback from interviewers and still nothing, it honestly all feels so defeating. I know a lot of my colleagues and close friends have been saying the job market is bad right now especially in the tech field, which is the field I work in, but after nearly four months I‚Äôm starting to lose all hope. I even went back to being a server last month to get some extra income in to pay bills for the following months to come. While I don‚Äôt regret quitting my job, it‚Äôs been rough with the job search and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve also just been very conflicted on what I even want to do with my life. I know I‚Äôm still young, but I never even expected make it to 23 so now I just feel like I‚Äôm just here living with no plans and I don‚Äôt know.

"This is my first post, so please excuse any errors. Still don't really know how Reddit works either.

I, (15f) have no idea what's wrong with me. From the outside looking in, I have a great life. And I do, I'm extremely privileged, I'm top of my class, I do more activities than any of my friends combined, and I do about 4 hours of volunteer work per week. But for the past year 1/2, I've barely been able to start anything new. I love writing, cooking, reading. But I haven't been able to pick up a book in 6 months. The last story I wrote was for my 9th grade English class. I have a passion project that I've been trying to start for months now, but every time I just push it back. For god sake, I can't even watch a movie because I don't have the motivation to start one. It just feels like life is passing me by. I've never dated anyone, no boy has even shown interest in me for that matter. I spend all of my free time on the internet, scrolling until my brain melts. Even now, I'm writing this instead of doing my homework which I've put off for the past hour. All of my friends know exactly what they want to do. They have their lives figured out, and they're happy. I graduate high school in 3 years, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I've got this paralyzing fear of just working some desk job and being forgotten 30 years after I die. The thing is, I know I can make an impact. I'm smart, I know I am. But I just can't seem to do anything.On another topic, I'm so lonely it hurts. I have maybe 7 people I would consider to be my ""close"" friends, and maybe about 5 of those consider me theirs. But I don't have a best friend. I thought I did. I have two friends, and they spent the entirety of quarantine at my house doing virtual school. I've known my ""best friend"" since preschool. But lately, it's like she doesn't even know I exist. I've haven't talked to her in over a week. I'm not mad at her, but I just wanted to see how long it would take for her to talk to me, text me, call me, anything. Just to even notice that I hadn't talked to her. It's not that hard. We do Girl Scouts together, we carpool to and from school every single day. She hasn't said a word, and she's the type who would if she thought something was wrong. I haven't been over to her house in 3+ years, despite us living 2 minutes apart. She doesn't wait for me outside of class like I do for her, she just leaves. Last year, she didn't even get me a Christmas present. I can't remember the last time we had a meaningful conversation. I don't hate her, but being around her is just so hard. I can't even look at her without feeling like my chest is being ripped out of my body. There's so much more, but it probably wouldn't fit. As for my other friends, the situation is pretty much the same. I wave ""hi"" when I see them in the hallways, they'll wave back. They were never as close though, so it doesn't hurt as much. It's my birthday next week, and I don't think anyone really remembers. I do have one friend who's pretty close, but she's very closed off, and we've only started growing closer in the past few months. She's also very particular, a tad bit anti-social, and can be hard to plan hangouts with, so pretty much any and all effort has been on my part. I know I've got my own issues. I'm weird, I can be loud, I can be pushy, and I'm sure there are others. But I know what my problems are, and I've been trying to work on them the past few years. It's just exhausting, seeing your friends care about each other so much and then not really pay attention to you. It feels like I've been glued in place, and everything around me is going forward. I'm crying while typing this, and I've felt this way for so long now that I can hardly remember what it feels like to be proud of who I am, to not be an afterthought to some of the most important people in my life.I feel like a literal piece of gum stuck to the bottom of someone's shoe. I know all of these are first world problems. I'm not suicidal, and I've only ever self-harmed a couple of times. I'm a realist. I know that life will get better. But as of now, I just want to disappear into a void and never come out. I guess I'm not really asking for advice, I already know what I should do.

"So my gf is having a graduation party which she was younger than me so i was not there. It was actually sorted out to be a prom night but since they cant get a hold on a venue they decided to make it a party. The party was at an air bnb at a villa and a pretty good one at that. Its pretty and all that but there were guys there too. Knowing myself that i think alot about it when all of them are staying there overnight.

Gray, 

I know it‚Äôs been a few years, and you may not recognize me. It‚Äôs me, Ezra, remember? Vidcon 2018 in the Escape The Night Panel floor. I had never had a friend like you, someone who was interested in what I was interested in. Someone who listened when I talked and didn‚Äôt find it annoying. It was nice.

When I got the text, saying that your mom was breaking your contact to me, I was shattered. I didn‚Äôt leave my house for a week, and barely ate or slept. To this day I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve cried that much. It was earth shattering, and still is if I think about it for too long.

Even though now, I know it was probably your way of getting out of talking to me. I know that I was a lot. I had Autism and ADHD and didn‚Äôt know how to talk to people. I don‚Äôt blame your for that, I know now exactly what I was. 

For years, I wondered if you were even alive, since I knew what you were struggling with. Honestly, at some point, so I could get some closure, I just assumed that you were dead. For years, I held on to that sliver of hope that you would text me back and everything would go back to normal. 

I‚Äôm sorry if I scared you off, I didn‚Äôt mean to. I know I‚Äôm loud and annoying and dramatic. 

Since then, I‚Äôve graduated, become a dance teacher, got a boyfriend, and survived. I‚Äôm finally medicated and diagnosed, and in the process of leaving my narcissistic mothers home. I‚Äôve changed my name‚Ä¶ again‚Ä¶. And again.

"I never thought this would be happening to me but I feel so lost and hurt right now. 

I just found out my bf of over two years has been texting nudes of himself to a random girl behind my back. First, to give some context we are in a long distance relationship as of April of this year. We have been dating since November 2021 but my bf just left for training in April of this year as he is an officer in the US Military. We come from different cultural and religious backgrounds something that does bring some conflict in our relationship that we have thankfully been able to work through for the most part. 

So for the story, today we were out and at one point I saw a name pop up on snapchat recent add. It was a girl that I had never seen before. It wasn‚Äôt a friend so my bf quickly brushed it off and said accounts randomly show up and they aren‚Äôt people he knows and he usually ignores it. I believed him for the most part but wanted to make sure as I had a feeling in my gut that told me he was lying and the only other name that showed up as quick add was me, that girl and another man i had never seen before. I quickly added that person and checked to see if there were any messages between them and my bf and I saw a few nudes and pictures until my bf quickly snatched him phone from my hand and said they were old pics. I did not see much but I also saw that some of the messages were in October which I believe is October of this year as it would have had a year if it was from a previous year. I did not believe him as his reaction was as if he were guilty. I quickly left the place we were and told him to take me to my car as I parked a bit further and he drove us to this spot.

As we were driving I tried to get more information out of him, which was extremely difficult as he quickly resorted to the notion that it didn‚Äôt matter and that we weren‚Äôt going to work out as i clearly didn‚Äôt trust him. He also gave a bunch of other excuses and kept avoiding the actual situation at hand something that infuriated me greatly. He would not let me see his phone or explain the time line. He never outwardly admitted to this being a recent fling and just apologized for a very similar situation in the past that I foolishly forgave him for. He kept going in circles and never admitted fully to this. He did however admit to finding this person on Grindr and that he had ‚Äúurges‚Äù and ‚Äúdesires‚Äù that he could not control. He told me that he was attracted to trans women and sought them out on these apps but was also extremely attracted to me. Frankly if this is his sick idea of coming out to me I did not sympathize as there are healthier better ways to tell ur partner than cheat on them. I do not judge or discriminate and can understand difference in sexual orientation, it is a spectrum but I held no sympathy for him and his feelings considering how reckless he was with mine. He apologized but still offered up very little information about the situation. 

Anyways we have broken up and I finally feel at ease. I am glad I now this now than 10yrs later with kids and a family. I can‚Äôt help but be a little scared and nervous about my future, we were looking at rings and wedding venues just today and yesterday now I will have to find someone new to start all over with.

"25M and I'm just kind of done trying to make connections with people. 

Ever since I was a kid I've always been the picked last sort of person. My family never came to my school dinner because my other siblings needed them. They never came to my after school activities. Hell I couldn't even do anything after school unless someone else's mom/dad would bring me home, because my other siblings were the priority. 

Not even one family, but 3. I was in foster care for a few years, and I don't know what it is about me, but I was always last in every family. An afterthought. Even when nothing else was going on. I was left alone. 

This doesn't stop with family. It's been the same with friends. I text first, call first, make plans first. Even then, it's once on a blue moon where the plans aren't canceled because something came up with other friends. I'm only invited if a space opens up that NEEDS to be filled. My friends actively make plans in front of me without asking if I want to go.

Everyone tells me I just chose bad friends. Which could be true. But when the same issue spans 25 years with Friends, Family, Co-workers, there's only one common link, and it's me. Something has to be wrong with me. 

I've tried changing my attitude, I've tried reaching our more, reaching out less. Nothing works. 

I just wanna be first in 1 person's mind. The first person they think of when they need to tell someone something. The first person they ask to hang out. I'd even settle for 3rd or 4th. I'm just so tired of being last or completely excluded. 

But even now, even if I did find someone, I think I'm just so irreversibly damaged emotionally that I'd screw it up. The past 2 years of my life I've stopped trying. No one's even noticed. No one reaches out. Because I was never invited to things to begin with, so in their eyes nothing has changed.  

I don't know what to do. Or how to fix it. And the older I get, the harder it gets to just accept it. I see people out having fun with their friends while I'm stuck at home, hoping someone invites me, being ignored by my in person and online friend.",I Just Want to Be First,18mlt4p,1703046299.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mlt4p/i_just_want_to_be_first/,

So ima just give some insiders about me that I would think probably played into why I just did what I did. So I 22m never been in a relationship and I used to be a frequent corn watcher and use to masturbate 2x a day as well hell even more. But since a couple years ago I only do it 2x a week now and hopefully eventually stop. So im someone who's kinda weird asf and stuff so I like to get off to nature and music. Ik mad weird but there's more. So I kinda always wanted to bust a nut in nature outside so I thought to myself theres no better time than now. So its pretty cold outside where I live and gets dark pretty quick. Also its late almost midnight so I aint have to worry about seeing me as I did this by a bush by my car in my driveway so kinda isolated but not all the way. I was kinda quick wit it as it was a overall different stimulation. When I was done I cleaned up quick and im pretty sure not a single soul saw me. I wear all black to be seen less just in case. I never done this before but I have to admit it felt good. I don't even usually feel good busting nut as I eventually want to stop for good but doing something different like that was kinda amazing. And the cold weather really didn't even effect my as well because im pretty use to all seasons as where I live goes through them all. Idk if ill do it again tho because its very risky but high reward as well. Idk if anyone else has done this or maybe im wrong for doing this but it just felt so refreshing to be connected wit nature in a different way. It kinda does sound like some chicken head stuff now im reading what im typing lmao but I felt relieved in a new way. And I was high just off a cart no hard substance and I had this low frequency play in my earbuds as well so all that came into play.

"Backstory: My sister and her fianc√© have a group of friends which are his friends and she came along when they started dating and there was one single guy who I ended up with. One of the guys is my bf's ""cousin"" and he as a gf (lets call her Mia) of 10 years so my bf would third wheel a lot with them so he was very close with both of them. I started coming around the group because my sister and her then bf would bring me with them and everything was fine but I could tell that Mia was a mean girl but I liked her still and wanted to be friends and I would be nice to her and show her I'm not a mean girl she doesn't need to have her guard up with me that I'm nice and have good intentions of being friends. Months later me and my bf started dating and now I'm coming around the group more often because he is bringing me as his girlfriend.

At a 4th of July party I experienced my first mean girl act from her. She was drunk and saying mean things and her bf and mine were telling her to chill and she would tell them to shut up. We started walking inside the house and she kept making comments and I tried to go the bathroom bc I started crying and someone was in there so I was in the corner crying lol. I was in shock and literally thought to myself this is shit that happens in a mean girls movie.

After she would give me forced ass hi's and when she would greet others her attitude would change and she would be all excited like ""omg hi!"" One day her family had a party and we went and when we got there she didn't say hi to us and I am not rude, I am at her family party so I decided to go up to her and say hi and she said ""oh hey"" with a half ass smile. I started to think she does not like me. My sister who became bff with her noticed how she would treat me and figured herself that she doesn't like me. So after that for some reason Mia's bf who is my bf's ""cousin"" and her stopped talking to my bf completely and would hang out with everyone and not invite my bf anymore and Mia would post my sister a lot and I thought to myself she is trying to turn my sister against me. Sooo I'm going to skip parts and fast forward to my bf reaching out to them to fix things and invite them over for his dad's bday. They come over I'm welcoming them trying to make conversation and they look uninterested and all night she is giving me dirty looks. My bf's dad cuts his finger and is in the bathroom with my bf and his aunts to try to stop the bleeding and Mia is drunk tries to go in there and they say its busy to go downstairs and she walks by me and my bfs mom and she tells Mia yeah to go downstairs. Mia later is crying to my sister and her bf and I later find out she is saying that my bf's mom accused her of trying to get in the bathroom with her husband and to ask me because I was there and that DID NOT HAPPEN! She tends to take things the wrong way and has even made stuff up and argued with her bf's mom. After they still continued to ignore my bf even after he reached and they agreed to make up. 

One day my sister hangs out with Mia and her bf and Mia starts talking shit about me to my sister and my sister got mad and defended me and Mia got mad at my sister and asked her why is she defending me. So I felt like I was right about her trying to turn my sister against, the whole time she thought my sister was going to be on her side because why was she surprised and mad she defended me? My sister told her she is a mean girl and shit went down. They stopped being close for a couple months and my sister knows she does not like me and knows of everything she's done to me and now I think they are back to being friends and I feel betrayed and hurt that my sister still wants a friendship with this girl. Mia has started a problem with my sister twice before and my sister forgave her. This girl has started a problem with multiple people and everyone that meets her says she is a mean girl.

"Hello everyone i‚Äôm 18M. The past 2-3 years have been rough. 

When i was 16-ish i started dating this girl, and it was my first girlfriend. I won‚Äôt go in detail about this relationship but all you have to know is that at the time i realized too late that i was looking for new experiences rather than love or a genuine relationship.

As a young, healthy guy, who just broke up with his girlfriend which was in the SAME school and the SAME class as me, what do i do ? I decide to abuse drugs ! Yay ! (A teenager's coping mechanism is pretty fascinating). Tbh, i almost don‚Äôt remember anything from the period of September 2022 until May 2023, when i was smoking at least 1g of hash a day and lots of alcohol because why not right ?

Anyway, since this 9 months long complete blackout, i cut off all the people from my last school (the one where my ex is, and where she gets her little fun telling bullshit about me to everyone, and apparently some pretty fucked up shit), and i changed school for a much bigger one. 

And after being used to see the same people for 10 years, im seeing a lot of new people everyday. And this is where i realized how unimportant i am, and how much i do not matter. Im just not especially attractive, not the funniest, not the most scholar, and i don‚Äôt really have any talents or things im good at. 

I know im still young, and i know that i don‚Äôt know so many thing about this world and about myself,  but idk man, i feel very weird.

I wish i could talk about this with my friends, but most of them just don‚Äôt know me good enough (even though we knew each other for 6-7+ years xd) and they would be weirded out because they think im legit someone that im not. That im not anymore at least.

This is just so tiring how my brain works and this is why i put that im falling down a mental rabbit hole as a title because i overthink absolutely everything and anything. I have thoughts that are very complex that I couldn‚Äôt explain with words. Its like everything connects in my head and it makes sense to me, but i couldn‚Äôt explain what‚Äôs on my head to anyone.

And this has been the case for at least a good year now, i don‚Äôt even know. Fuck.

To conclude, let‚Äôs say Im just not really excited about having to wake up tomorrow, and the day after, as well as the day after etc‚Ä¶

I know i have so much more things to say but i just can‚Äôt express myself, i can‚Äôt put any of my thoughts into words.

We met from on of those dating apps. We said we were looking for casual but from the first day we started talking it was anything but. He asked me to be his girlfriend 2 weeks in and we said I love you around that time. We just fell into each other. We can talk for hours and hours about anything and everything. 

I met him at a time in my life where I was new to a city and really knew no one. From the day we met we hung out everyday. The beginnings felt pretty magical and I think I cling on to how perfect it felt at the start. However,  I think quite early on while I knew he loved me I just always knew he was never going to meet all my needs. 

He‚Äôs a wonderful amazing person but someone with a lot of issues and baggage. Stuff that he hasn‚Äôt dealt with emotionally and I think it holds him back in many areas in his life. We‚Äôve broken up and gotten back together more than a handful of times. Each time I swear I won‚Äôt do it again, but god damn I love this man. This silly man with all his flaws. I told my therapist, I think he‚Äôs one of the few people who makes me feel truly seen. 

We broke up for good a year ago. But we still keep in close contact and we have our ups and downs. We still have emotional conversations and sometimes we even fantasise about getting back together and have moments where we think we might and then reality hits us. 

He‚Äôs let me down a million times, not because he‚Äôs bad or anything but because of his mental health issues. He has a lot of heavy things to deal with and never goes for therapy or anything. I‚Äôve watched him have so much self hatred for himself and he‚Äôs always an anxious mess. As someone with my own problems, it often gets too overwhelming to be the adult for both of us. He is unable to consistently be there for me becuase he is unable to even be there for himself. Being with him I worry about his well-being too often, if he‚Äôs taking care of himself, if he‚Äôs alright.

"Hey everyone  
  
I am a 31-year-old gay male from Hong Kong, and 3 days ago I tested positive for HIV.  
  
I took two HIV test kits and both came back positive. I am now waiting for another more accurate blood test to confirm the results, although I believe it is highly likely that I am HIV positive. I think of the only one unsafe sex I had one month ago and that is most likely how I contracted the virus.  
  
For these few weeks I experienced a low-grade fever and found myself falling ill easily. I had a gut feeling that these were symptoms of the early HIV acute infection phase and yea it turned out i am probably right  
  
When I saw the line on the test kit, my mind went blank. The personnel from the NGO that helped me with the testing immediately arranged for a blood test. They said if I am indeed diagnosed with HIV, they will provide all the necessary medical and mental support. They are really really good person.  
  
I reached out to my best friend and shared the news with her. I'm not completely frustrated, but I am worried because I know my life will never be the same after this. I'm concerned about potential lifelong side effects from the medication, about losing friends, also how to disclose my status to my family and anticipate their reaction. I also worry about not being able to pursue the things I want to do and the potential for depression. There are so many thoughts swirling in my head.  
  
I am a Christian and I can't help but see this as a punishment from God because of my willfulness and I know I can totally avoid the situation if I am not tempted to go for those unsafe behavior. My best friend has been supportive and reminded me that it could be a message or warning to lead a healthier life moving forward, rather than a punishment.   
  
I worry that I am now different from others, and that people may be afraid of me, viewing me as toxic.  
My best friend told me that true friends will accept and support me, regardless of my status, and that their love for me will remain unconditional and only people with insufficient knowledge will judge and stigmatize me. 

I am better now but I still feel a sense of unease. The whole situation feels surreal, and I am scared that I may lose my passion for life. The idea of having to take medication for the rest of my life feels like a lifelong imprisonment. I understand that HIV is manageable, but I can't help feeling trapped by this condition. I am uncertain if I will be able to date again. I'm trying my best to overcome these emotions

"Like the title says. I had an emotional affair with a closeted and married prison guard while incarcerated. I was incarcerated for 6 months while awaiting trial, and she was a transport officer charged with accompanying me to my medical appointments which I had a lot of because I have a tumor.
She was responsible for conducting ‚Äúpat downs,‚Äù which are usually just that, a ‚Äúpat down.‚Äù But not with her. Her unusually invasive pat downs started with some measure of plausible deniability, but quickly escalated, it‚Äôs as if she was testing for a desired outcome. She began by kneading my breasts and soon graduated to rubbing between my legs. I would have never noticed her in that way, and would have written her off for the fact that she is married.
While waiting for my medical appointments she began to enthusiastically initiate conversations. She was actually very kind and genuine, not to mention charming. She began to field all of my appointments, and the way she would look at me was unmistakable, and I soon responded in kind. I told her of a dream that I had of she and I at an airport, and she would bring up that dream constantly after that, even mentioning that she had told everyone that she was going to ‚Äúwin the lottery,‚Äù and leave her responsibilities behind to travel the world with me. I‚Äôm 41 years old and have had my share of relationships, but I‚Äôve never experienced chemistry like this with another person, ever. I fell in love with her.
The day before my release, she was transporting me back to my cell, and I mouthed the words ‚Äúf*#k me,‚Äù as there were other officers close by. She responded by saying ‚Äúcode word,‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe you‚Äôll win the lottery,‚Äù as we walked into the next hallway. Well I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwin the lottery,‚Äù and I feel heartbroken, used and preyed upon. I feel totally undesirable and trapped by circumstances now beyond my control. If she weren‚Äôt a closeted married woman in the homophobic south, I would view her as a predator, and S/A on a prisoner that she was paid to look after. But I view her as a victim of unfortunate circumstances herself. I can‚Äôt reasonably say that I had any expectations, but I am deeply heartbroken nonetheless. I miss her deeply and struggle with the fact that I will never see her again, while also feeling used and discarded.

"I have a partner and find someone else attractive. I don‚Äôt talk to this person and don‚Äôt even know their name, but I find myself constantly aware of their presence. I found myself thinking about them in wrong way and it has worried me. Objectively, I always found this other person attractive, but it‚Äôs just recently become a gnawing thought in my head.

It started after I found out my partner was liking and following inappropriate accounts online and liking bikini pictures from girls he went to college with-after I asked months ago for him to stop. I found out because I got recommended to follow one of the ladies he follows and her content was very inappropriate. It took me sobbing in utter frustration for him to admit that following these public accounts and liking *only* the revealing pictures of girls he knew in the past was wrong and hurtful.

After being in a distant limbo for two weeks, we have talked it out throughly. We both are very young and still learning from each other what it means to love each other the right way. I have total faith in him and know that his online behavior was something that stemmed from early adolescence that no relationship had challenged before and it was hard to break the habit. He made a mistake, he was not messaging anyone or cheating. That simplifies where we are, even if it does still feel a bit raw and did awaken insecurities I thought I had settled.

There is definitely a correlation between me wanting attention from someone else and the insecurities his transgressions brought up. I know this behavior is not correct and want to open up to my partner about it. My partner and I both see this stranger on an almost daily basis in a public setting and I know ultimately it will hurt him and make him uncomfortable on an almost daily basis. It could really hurt our relationship to put such a strain on him for a human emotion that is already passing. 

Is it best to leave it alone and say nothing? I feel if I say something know the consequences, I will be sabotaging us, but there is also a feeling of guilt for having the crush at all that makes me feel must let him know.

"Now look I am really fucked up about this but I tried to make this a little more entertaining so it's not just the sad ramblings of an idiot who spent too much money. 

Now this is gonna sound insane and even fake to some people. But I swear to you, you can go look up the sign on bonuses for Pharmacist at Walgreens and you'll see. 

When I started as a pharmacist I was given a 75,000 sign on bonus! Yes really, a whole fucking down payment on a house and then some. Even after taxes I was basically looking at 50,000. And I had no debts, no loans, nothing to pay off. 

But boy did I fuck up in many ways 

Starting with forming a rather unfortunate gambling based hobby due to my hyperfixation as one with ADHD and other brain issues. 

My childhood self saw I was making good money and went ""I'M GONNA LIVE OUT THE DREAM"" and so I bought fucking everything from MTG to Pokemon to Yugioh plus a PC and a ton of games. I had a serious gambling issue in the form of what was essentially cardboard crack. 

I bought duplicates of practically every product I opened and kept one aside saying it'll be a good return investment in the future. Unfortunately it's an exotic investment that takes up space and time and is entirely a gamble or waiting game. 
And while sometimes I got cool stuff I usually ended up having to buy the cards I wanted anyway CUZ ITS FUCKING GAMBLING 

Once I came to my senses I lost a good amount of money, even after selling off 90% of my sealed collection and I'm still sorting through the mess of cards and crap I bought and finding I dislike alot of cards artwork that I bought cuz it was just FOMO FROM THE FUCKING MARKETING. 

BUT IT ISNT OVER

I got a 3000 dollar PC, I got my partner a 3000 PC, I got about 50 video games ranging from 20 to 60 dollars a piece, I got a bunch of stupid display stuff of different characters and games and TV shows I liked (halo, skyrim, etc)

THEN MY CAR BASICALLY FUCKING EXPLODED CUZ IT WAS HANGING ON BY A THREAD AND HAD 350,000 MILES ON IT. 

SO WHAT DO I DO? do I get a nice normal car?? A cheaper one thats reliable? NO!

I BUY A FUCKING HYBRID RAV4 2023 THAT COST 46,000 AND PUT 15,000 DOWN ON IT. 

SO here's the math: 

15,000 for the car + 6,000 for the computers + 10,000 or so in SHINY FUCKING CARDBOARD + 5,000 in other stupid dumb bullshit + GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH IN ORDERING FOOD. 

IN THE END I was left with about 7,000

BUT WAIT THERES MORE! 

I WAS FIRED CUZ I WAS A STUPID FUCKING MORON. 

Then I have no insurance, 7000 to my name, and end up needing to go to the ER! 

SO there goes like 3500 of that 7000 and the rest goes to bills and rent. 

I eventually found a new job, made some good money back and I kept my credit at around a 790 and ended up with a 17,000 in an IRA. 

BUT THEN, THE WORST PART HAPPENS. 

I HAVE PAY BACK 70,000 

yeah, with 8% interest mind you, I have to pay it all back plus the taxes the government took cuz I only get that back after I get a W-2c. So I have to pay my full bonus and then some back. 

And do I have a house or anything to show for it? Anything at all where I can at least say ""well I guess it was like a loan, at least we got something out of it"" 

NO, I DONT, CUZ IM A FUCKING IDIOT WHO IS PAYING A $70,000 LOAN OFF SO THAT I DONT GET SUED BY A COLLECTION AGENCY (if I wasn't paying it'd go there) 

So yeah...take this however you want. Maybe it'll make you feel better. Maybe nothing at all. Maybe you can shit all over me in the comments and act like you're better than me after reading this one story. I do not care. 

Just make sure you plan things out and think things through and talk to people and self reflect before you make hasty decisions. Especially as someone young looking at alot of money. I'll never make this mistake again and now am far more concerned about retirement accounts, keeping my debts paid, and saving up for life and actual tangible experiences.

"Around 7 years ago I managed to get myself out of an abusive relationship 

I was with him for nearly 5 years and he was abusive in every way possible (physically, emotionally, sexually, financially etc). I still suffer badly from the trauma, for example I was waiting in my car for my fianc√© at the shops and he jumped out and scared me as a joke and it reminded me of the time I was hiding in my car while my ex was raging and he broke my windscreen to try to get to me and I went in to a panic attack and couldn‚Äôt stop crying

I stayed because he had the most beautiful daughter and I loved them both and I loved our little family, but I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and it got to a point where I didn‚Äôt want her to see the way he treated me anymore and think that is normal and ok to be treated that way 

It was the hardest thing I have ever done walking away from them, especially because even though I saw her every weekend for years and cooked for her and cleaned and spent holidays and so much time with her he never let me say goodbye, but I knew it had to be done

Every now and then I look at his social media profiles to see if he has out any updates about her and any photos to see how she is doing and although it‚Äôs probably not the most healthy thing I love it when I get to see photos of her smiling and happy

But this brings me to my problem‚Ä¶

I see him, his life, his successes 

He, in his horrid manipulative way, convinced everyone I was a liar and a cheat and I just ended it for no reason (I had a friend come stay with me the night he left my house because I knew he would come back and start trouble, which he did, and my friend and him ended up in a fight after my ex shoved me and he told everyone I was cheating with him and moved my ex out so I could move my friend in)

I want the world to know what he is like really, he shouldn‚Äôt be successful, he shouldn‚Äôt me a state manager of a well known company, he shouldn‚Äôt be on a board of a kids sporting club, he shouldn‚Äôt be happy with his new fianc√© and baby‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not fair!!!

I never pressed charges because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his daughter, in his attempts to win me back he did say he was seeing a therapist, maybe he is a better person now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know

I am happy, I have a baby and a fianc√© of my own, it just seems unfair that good things happened for him while I‚Äôm still suffering from the trauma he put me through

When we first started dating I would Be say we‚Äôre were on even playing fields but he‚Äôs lost a lot of weight, and he is just all around looks better taken care of since we‚Äôve been dating and I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs more confident now, but also worry that he‚Äôll use that confidence to ‚Äúdo better‚Äù than me because I really haven‚Äôt changed any except gaining a shit ton of weight after starting birth control. 

I wasn‚Äôt telling him all of this but a summary was just explaining how I worry about our relationship.

His response was along the lines of

Of course I wouldn‚Äôt ever leave you, who else would do my laundry and clean up the house like you do.

I visibly wasn‚Äôt happy about this and I‚Äôm not sure if it was even intended to be a joke but he recovered with an ‚ÄúI love you no matter what‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how he seems to only like me because I‚Äôm a free maid or some shit.

"i broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and even though my friends have told me not to worry and that they aren‚Äôt picking a side, it still kind of feels that way. our normal bar we always go to is our version of cheers and you‚Äôre bound to run into someone you‚Äôve slept with/dated so i was prepared for that. but my ex has pretty much completely taken up residence at the bar which means every single time i try to go in and sit by myself he‚Äôs there sitting with one of my friends. so i can‚Äôt really cozy up next to them and join their conversation because the breakup is so fresh‚Ä¶but my friends never make an attempt to come over and say hi while i‚Äôm there and it just feels like they‚Äôve chosen him over me. 

i also feel alienated at work. i started this job a few months ago and it‚Äôs a job i‚Äôve done before but my boss has very particular standards that seem to change every single time i try to do something. i‚Äôm constantly being nitpicked for tiny little things i‚Äôm doing wrong and never being given a compliment for the things im doing right. i just feel like im being cut down more and more but never being built up. and the people at work that i look up to seem to not want me around. any time i try to join in a conversation they change the subject or move their conversation physically out of the room. 

i‚Äôm not one who typically cares what people think of me and i handle criticism quite well compared to others. i have thick skin because i do tend to march to the beat of my own drum and im used to people thinking im weird and different. but when the people you look up to treat you like you don‚Äôt belong, that‚Äôs a special type of shitty feeling. 

i just feel the urge to become more and more of a silent recluse. i feel like my voice isn‚Äôt important, that my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, and that i‚Äôm replaceable and forgettable. the best part is that my family lives on the opposite side of the country. i just want to be around people who like me. that‚Äôs all i want right now.",i feel massively alienated by everyone in my life lately,18mj56t,1703038163.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mj56t/i_feel_massively_alienated_by_everyone_in_my_life/,
"Tomorrow would officially mark 4 years since his Death back in December 2019. We never visited that parasite besides the funeral, a lot of people showed up, as if they even gave a true fuck about the man. Fake pieces of crap. When he (grampa) was alive, they hardly said a word to the man, now suddenly that he died they all act like he mattered. I felt absolutely fucking nothing when I heard that he passed.

That man, is currently in Hell. I don't know what he was smiling about in his Death bed. Demons are the artists of deceit. So he probably saw his wife, only it wasn't his wife. It was in a sense just a Demon in disguise. Have fun.

This man once stole change from the 7 eleven charity boxes, back when I was 6 years old, I saw him take money from those boxes, back in the 90s they used to have these large clear charity donation boxes filled with money. Mostly quarters a few dollars etc.....but he stole from that. I thought that was just free to take when I was 6 years old. I didn't realize what he was doing until years later. That's just incredibly sad. 

It's not like he was poor or broke or anything. He was constantly going back to Europe. To get treatment there. 

When I was 12 back in 2004, I was hungry one time when we were going out, I asked for Papa Johns pizza and he was acting like he didn't want to buy a single thing, he ""asked"" me what I wanted, but just settled for a small pepperoni, single size serving. Cheap shit got thousands of dollars from the SSI senior citizen program benefits, this man was also under disability, that payout was astronomical. 

He never left us anything when he died. I haven't seen a single thing come out of this man. The only thing we got was his stupid fucking framed picture with his wife, as if I wanna see that shit.

"My cheating ex wife finally moved in June. We had been amicable over the 16 months she stayed as she got her shit together. Yes I was done with her, but I wasn‚Äôt about to make her homeless. 

We still shared phone plans, and our viewer subscriptions. She pays for Spotify, I paid for Disney. Listen, she‚Äôs a cheater but she‚Äôs gone and money is money!
She sends money for her phone every month, and I kept a lot of her stuff in the garage for storage and we‚Äôve been amicable. She was also keeping me on the insurance. 

This year has been a minor medical challenge. Meds and such cost money, but the insurance helped a lot. 

Anyway, I go to Renew my meds today and was told my policy was cancelled. 
I thought that was weird since I just saw her and she never mentioned anything. I texted her and no response. I called the company and they said it was cancelled last month by her and hers is still active. 

So then she responds saying maybe they made a mistake since we are separated. That‚Äôs BS, she specifically called to remove me. The agent told me everything. She continued to lie and gaslight. Need I remind everyone she works in insurance. She knows how these things work, she is the one who fills out the paperwork. 

So now, I‚Äôm just pissed off. I wouldn‚Äôt have been mad if she said she‚Äôs ending it, but at least give a dude a heads up. I‚Äôve been nothing but accommodating despite her banging her coworker‚Äôs brains into the ground.

She is 19yo. We haven‚Äôt had sex for a long time and had one recently(I didn‚Äôt finish, but we still used a condom). Everything was fine things wise. She had her period literally like 5-6 hours after that. So like the very beginning of cycle I guess. She is now exactly in the middle and has ovulation(it‚Äôs like when she has peak hormones I guess) today is the 14th day. Her boobs hurt for about 4 days now, not too bad but she feels them, uncomfortable let‚Äôs say. Nothing changed look wise, feeling, nipple, everything is the same. The important thing is that she doesn‚Äôt think she had this feeling mid-cycle in about last 6 months or so. So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs not common for her.

She is very concerned that she could be pregnant, at first I just brushed it off, and was reassuring her and telling that there is no chance.(she is quite panicky in those terms, it happened before) but like today she told me about that twice. I‚Äôm just a little bit worried, I still reassured her and said that there is no chance but in my thoughts I started to worry a little(even though honestly I understand that it should be stupid to suppose that).

"Hey there, so for the sake of the topic of this post, I'm going to make my gender remain anonymous due to the nature of the video. Basically this video has been blowing up and it's about this woman who is explaining why more people (specifically women) are choosing to remain single. She does go over some valid points (although I found it to be crast and crude the way she presented her information) and went on to say some really... Well let's just say insensitive stuff about both genders (particularly with men). After reading the comments and falling down the rabbit hole of inexplicable voices of opinions, I started to cry...

It's strange to say but ever since I was a kid, I've seen the hardships of people who were labeled by gender first hand and how society imposes their views on others. My best friend was molested when I was young and people assumed it was because they were easy. My closets relative who I treated like the brother I never had was falsely accused of sexual assault and was harassed to the point that he was almost successful with his suicide attempt. I've seen the harsh truths of both sides and it makes me cry every time someone tries to blame an issue on something so simplistic and material like race or gender. Why do we subjugate ourselves to something as crude and crast as someone's physical appearance and not judge them based on their actions, based on the truth we all fear to face?

Why can't we just chaulk it up to what people emotionally want in the moment and are swept by the roil of selfishness that dictaes their actions rather than just saying that they're acting like this because ""they're a woman"" or a ""privileged white mother fucker"". Why do we do this to ourselves! I know the past is filled with scars that still need time to heal but isn't the point of having a future with someone is to move forward and support each other because you genuinely care for one another? Call me an idiot but I still believe in love and I've remained single because I want to find someone who feels the same way as I do and just find happiness with each other. I know this is the childish ramblings of a total stranger but why can't we just get along with each other and admit to our flaws, not based on race or gender, but by the actions we take?

Sorry, I didn't mean to drag it out for this long. I'm still crying because it's kills me to know that there are a group of people who consolidate things in their most simple form like gender rather than actually facing the truth of the matter that people deject blame on to others when most of the time the problem lays within themselves.

"I've been experiencing the same symptoms for the past 4-5 months now. I've been to the primary doctor (sent to get xrays in another 2-3 months, no answers), urgent care twice (misdiagnosed with two UTIs), been to the ER because of the agonizing pain (given morphine, no answers), and now I'm going to a GI doctor with no hope of any help.
 I can't stomach much food anymore. I have so much fatigue I can barely get out of bed from how much pain my body is in (right side all the way to lower stomach, all over stomach). I've been actively losing weight. It feels like I'm going to actually die before the doctors do anything about it, so I'm writing this in desperation to give my mind a way to release all my pent up thoughts. I can feel my body shutting down slowly. It's only a matter of time before I fall asleep again to just not wake up. I'm completely and utterly helpless.
 I still don't know what's wrong with me, so I can't help myself.

"I've been with my (f25) boyfriend (M28) for 3.5 years and we don't live together. I hit him many times at the beginning of the relationship because of unresolved trauma and triggers but have been in therapy for almost 3 years and haven't done it since.

Recently, I've been extremely stressed with things and kept having mental breakdowns, which made me take it out on him, generally just starting needless arguments. He was very understanding at the beginning and just trying to help me get through it, but eventually got fed up with it and started questioning the relationship. 

After 2 months or so of this I got better and extremely greatful for his patience. It was my first weekend/day off after a few weeks and I was celebrating a deadline but he didn't make sure to spend some quality time together plans and just kept signing up to see more people and only planning to see me for a few hours on Sunday. He completely forgot I asked to see him that Saturday a week before and made plans with a friend. So we talked about possibly seeing eachother Friday night after we're done with whatever we were doing that night if it's still early, however my plans fell through and I was free, but he forgot and booked more things for Saturday daytime. So I was upset he didn't plan to see me over some old colleague. He claimed he didn't know I was free on Saturday and he's busy Friday night so coming to see me after was never his priority. This wasn't a big argument in my eyes, I told him I wasn't happy cos I just wanted to see him but it is what it is.

Fast forward Friday night, he messages me some slurs in the middle of the night, keeps ringing me, I ignored it, then as I forgot to lock the front door he comes into my bedroom and gets into my bed trying to cuddle me, at 2am. I was half asleep and quietly said ""I thought it wasn't your priority to see me tonight"". He pins me down shouting in my face how he didn't know I was free on Saturday and how dare I question him and how he hasn't seen his old colleague in 3 weeks. I keep telling him to be quiet cos I have flatmates and he just gets progressively worse, shaking me, pinning me down to the bed so I can't move an inch. Says he loves me so much and I need to stop being such a B. He hits me in the face with an open palm, hard. I told him to be quiet and to stop cos I'm scared. He continues pinning me down shouting how I don't get to tell him what to do, that he tells me what to do. I'm crying, he tries to kiss me, gets me off the floor very ""lovingly"". 

In the morning he tries to cuddle me and I just remind him what he's done last night. He doesn't seem bothered and barely manages to say ""sorry"". I'm still not okay and ask if he thinks that he's done was ok. He raises his voice saying how I pushed him to do it but eventually apologises. For the day, we were fine cos I think I was in denial and he became more apologetic later on. 

I don't know what to do, what to think. One part of me understands cos I used to be aggressive and eventually stopped but of course this shouldn't be an excuse for him, I guess? He's a tall, strong man and I'm powerless. Could this behaviour stop? Looking back he used to be aggressive before just not to this extent.",Tw: abuse.

"My (20F) parents divorced when I was 11, it was a messy divorce that involved me having to clean up a lot of alcohol bottles off the floor and being a relationship counsellor for my parents for almost a year. Also having to watch my parents leave the house for hours and days at a time not knowing when they‚Äôd come back.

My dad cheated on my mum and left us more or less homeless. He is now married to this lady and has a kid with her. As well as raising her kid from the previous marriage she had. I didn‚Äôt get the option to choose which parent I wanted to live with, but I would‚Äôve chosen my mum anyway. The divorce caused me a lot of mental trauma that I haven‚Äôt recovered from

My dad was good to me at first, but we‚Äôve drifted a lot. Over the years he would do things like mock my tics (I have a tic disorder that can include coughing a lot. He would mock my coughing tic and laugh about it to everyone). He once didn‚Äôt believe me when I was having an anaphylactic shock and left me in the house to nearly die because ‚ÄúI was just imagining there were nuts in the dish‚Äù

Everytime my ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù did something, it was okay. If i did the same? He would not let me hear the end of it. He also forgot to give me a Christmas card when I spent Christmas with him, and I got my gifts in a cardboard box. But my ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù got cards and amazing gifts and they all took a photo without me in it. 

However there were also times where he was amazing. He‚Äôd drive 4hours to me and 4hours back to see me every weekend before I got a weekend job. He‚Äôd take me out to dinner sometimes , and do things with just me and him. He would brag about my academics to all of his friends also, how proud he was of me.

I resent him now. He‚Äôs the reason my parents divorced and he treated my mum like shit. He treats me like I‚Äôm less favoured than my brothers and it obviously shows. And he makes me cry often as he doesn‚Äôt let me see my dying grandparents but he‚Äôll take my siblings to see them.

However I feel guilty I hate him because he‚Äôs still my dad. And he used to do a lot for me and I do believe he still loves me somewhere. I haven‚Äôt seen him in two years but we text and call every month or so (if he replies to me). He sent me a Christmas card today with a gift voucher attached to it and I just feel guilty for resenting him and trying to shut him out as much as I do. Even though he‚Äôs caused me a lot of emotional trauma I will never properly be able to recover from.

Now she‚Äôs claiming they got back together last month. 

She said a lot of hurtful words like ang sabi sa kanya nung siya bumalik nung October ay wala lang naman kami, hindi lang ako mahiwalayan ng bf ko kasi marami ako problema, etc..

When I finally talked with my bf, he said ang totoo lang yung Feb pero naguluhan lang siya. Now, hindi sila nagkabalikan pero inamin nya na nag-iistay yung ex nya sa condo nila halos gabi gabi this last month pero lagi daw kasi pumupunta sa kanila ng walang paalam, ang kasalanan daw nya naging mabait siya at hinayaan nya. At alam ng ex nya na may gf siya. Her ex is also a family friend and nasanay daw talaga na pumupunta sa kanila ng walang paalam nung andito pa family ni bf, nagmigrate na kasi ng states so bf ko na lang mag-isa sa condo.

Aminado siya cheating yun kasi nagtago at sinungaling siya pero he sweared awa lang nararamdaman nya at wala na siya feelings dun.

He‚Äôs begging me na ayusin namin, nalaman na rin ng parents nya at pinagalitan siya at yung girl, ang sabi sa girl baka namisinterpret lang nya kabaitan ng bf ko kaya akala nya sila na ulit.

Ganito pala yung feeling, sobrang sakit, may times na akala mo okay ka na tapos biglang magbrebreakdown ka ulit lalo na pag naisip mo ano mga pwede nila ginawa. Na ako nga hindi nagpupunta sa unit nya dahil miss ko lang siya kasi pinagbabawal din talaga ng parents nya. Tapos nung nagkasakit siya nalaman ko nagsinungaling siya na nasa kabilang unit siya sa lola nya para baka siguro dalawin ko siya at makita ko na yung ex nya nag aalaga sa kanya.

"I am a 15 year old transgender male, though I‚Äôd prefer not to be labeled as such. I am on the autism spectrum and I have a chronic physical illness. I have been diagnosed with a colorful variety of mental disorders ‚Äî including gender dysphoria. For those who don‚Äôt know, gender dysphoria is a condition characterized by feeling uneasy with your assigned sex at birth. Not all trans people have gender dysphoria. I, of course, didn‚Äôt get so lucky. My gender dysphoria is so bad to the point where it CONSTANTLY interferes with EVERYTHING in my day to day life. Using the bathroom in a public setting is one of the most nerve-wracking experiences for me. I have to use the girls bathroom at school currently because my gender hasn‚Äôt been changed in the school system yet. Changing in the locker room at school with all the girls feels so horrible and wrong and I despise it. Hell, even just changing in general. Even in the comfort of my own room, I refuse to open my eyes while I‚Äôm changing. I don‚Äôt want to see what my body looks like. I can‚Äôt look down while showering or using the bathroom. I genuinely feel trapped in my body. It doesn‚Äôt even feel like MY body. It feels like I‚Äôve been shoved into someone else‚Äôs body against my will. I have a lot of disassociation problems and I often feel disconnected from reality and/or my body. I am genuinely convinced that my body is not my own and it terrifies me. Nearly every day, I claw at my own skin until it‚Äôs red and sore because I just want out of it. I want out of this body that I‚Äôm trapped in. Every time someone calls me my birth name, it feels like an actual stab in the chest. Every time someone calls me ‚Äúshe‚Äù or a girl, I feel sick to my stomach. I try to correct them. I want to correct them. But it‚Äôs just so hard. I‚Äôve been bullied and harassed my entire life since elementary school. It‚Äôs completely diminished my confidence and self-worth to the point where I can‚Äôt stand up for myself whatsoever. I‚Äôm lucky to have supportive parents; however, everyone else at school, online, in public, etc practically torment me. My mind constantly tells me that I‚Äôll never be a man and I will always be that little girl I once was. I hate her. And I want her dead. I want that little girl gone. I see my younger self as a whole different person. I don‚Äôt know whether to love her or want her dead. But I want this body gone. I still remember this thanksgiving when my aunt grabbed my breast after hugging me and said that I had bigger breasts than she did. I knew I should‚Äôve worn my binder that day. But wearing my binder is a constant reminder of what I am. I am a freak; an abnormality. That‚Äôs what everyone has told me. I don‚Äôt even want to be labeled as ‚Äútransgender‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want ANYONE to know that I was born as a girl. I hate even IMPLYING it. I feel like such a fraud. And such an idiot, because really; it‚Äôs obvious. That‚Äôs what some of my online friends have told me when I finally got the courage to tell them I was trans. That it was obvious. It was obvious I wasn‚Äôt truly a boy.

Do you really want every single player in these games to go up to you and lay their hands on you?? In fact, do you all want to drown in a horde of ""tall guys"" and drown in their stench??? In your eyes apparently that's what ""masculinity"" means... Do you really get attracted to those obnoxious perverted tall guys from school that gawk at the girls and scream with their tongues out???

"So I tried to talk to my husband about his driving once again, refer to my previous post for context, and it turned out even worse than I thought it would. 

I‚Äôm feeling lonely and more disgusted with myself than I have in awhile. He pretty much got super mad, more so then I‚Äôve seen him in a long time, and pretty much through up every negative thing in our relationship. I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail, but it‚Äôs like we avoided the one topic I wanted to talk about all together. 

Not only that he went from wanting kids to saying that just because I try to talk to him about things so much that he doesn‚Äôt think he wants kids at all now. We had always planned to have kids in a couple years, mainly on his part, but now that‚Äôs been threw out the window.

He also said that if it makes me so upset don‚Äôt ride with him, but the thing is, the only other car we have is a stick shift. Which I can‚Äôt drive. He also said he loves me but he doesn‚Äôt know why we even got married because I have trouble with intimacy, which he already knew when we got together due to me being sexually abused by my ex. 

I‚Äôm in a point in my life that I‚Äôve mentally checked out and he is the type of guy that he has a hard time speaking about anything deep and when he finally does it‚Äôs built up so long that he blows up. Which is caused by trauma from being raised by an abusive father. 

Then it‚Äôs just deflection after deflection. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do, and I‚Äôm not perfect and maybe I try to over communicate sometimes but I just want to talk to him about these things. I just want us to be safe and it‚Äôs like everything blew up all at once.

Maybe I‚Äôm grasping at straws but I just want to communicate better and I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything wrong. I feel stuck in this for financial reasons and while I do love him it‚Äôs just getting harder and harder for me to make excuses.

"I was homeless in the winter, 2018 in CO. I almost froze to death in a tent in the woods, and in fact worry I may have actually dipped outta this plane for a minute. I never let the ppl I was with know how bad off we were, how close we were to freezing, and I made sure them and the dog had adequate warmth when possible. My goal was the survival of what I saw as my small family, and I was willing to be a little more cold and hungry if it meant they weren't.  My sleeping bag got wet a few days before the really cold weather came on, I think the dogs water bowl may have spilled on it or something but it never dried. I can vividly remember going into nothingness, unable to move and hearing a faint heartbeat in the way the winter holds sound in the air. Like everything crept away and it was just nothing. I remember waking up unable to move, coughing and struggling for air. My dog was next to me fussing, I'm not sure if she was scared cuz I woke her suddenly or if she had been knocking her mouth and paws into my back and armpits for a while. Like digging on me basically. When I could finally move again I took her in my arms and just stared for the longest time. Just listening to the wind and the coyotes in the distance terrified to fall asleep, just shivering with my dog. I don't know if the girls with me noticed, they were in a smaller tent with some blankets over it, I slept in the 6 person we had their 2 person it. A bear would come up on the campsite each night to look around, so I stayed in the main tent with my car keys to set off the alarm laid on top of my dogs crate. She had her own sleeping bag I'd wrap her in then pull her in with me and cover us up with some blankets. I think she may be the only other soul rn who knows, actually. 

I didn't like to think about the hardest times, I know I kept the people and pet with me safe and alive and they've all gone onto survive and thrive, but I never really let myself think about it. I had sleep paralysis a week or so ago, the room was cold and black and I couldn't move and I was suddenly back in the forest on the floor of the tent losing consciousness. My spouse had to wake me up, they've never felt the need to do that in all the times they've calmed me in my sleep but this time they were actually scared. I clung to them and told them some of it when I could speak again, but the more I let myself think about it the more I remember and frankly what do I do? That's such a terrible bit of lore for ppl who I care about to know, like I straight up lied and told them I was fine and went on to lose so much weight from not eating to make sure the others had food and the car had gas so we didn't die, I don't want them to worry about what's done and I dont regret making sure the people I cared about were safe either but I don't have insurance or a therapist rn and this feels like something I need to tell someone lol 

Idk if there's advice for this other than ""go to therapy"" or ""you have trauma"".

so, to get it out of my system, a few years ago when i was still a teenager someone broke into my house during the night thru my bedroom window, luckily nothing happened because I called for my dad fast enough and the man ran away, this ended up being a big issue and in result I developed PTSD, the worst part of it was me not being able to sleep. I remember it felt like I was on guard in a survival mode ALL THE TIME. This worn me out physically and emotionally, since I couldn‚Äôt force myself to sleep at night for like a solid month, my principal didn‚Äôt want to deal with this and kicked me out of the school. This resulted in bigger mental issues blah blah blah.

"Hi. So I have a big problem on my hands, and no, I can't simply use ""a cloth or rag"" Those are fucking disgusting, you know how much shit hand towels collect? And it's not like machine washing this crap every day is the solution either.

Anyway, I was digressing. I live with 2 other Maniacs (family members), which constantly make a Mess and I have to constantly clean their bullshit up. This requires me to use paper towels, and not hand towels or rags of any kind, to me those are more unsanitary than paper towels.

Paper towels come out essentially sterile, hand towels just collect bacteria, snot, hair,  shit on the counter and you're just reusing them. On your skin, you're just putting these bacteria back on your skin when you wash your hands. That doesn't happen with paper towels.

Anyway, I bought 50 rolls of the high quality paper towels and wasted about $112 or so on them, now one by one it's beginning to waste again. I'd say we go through about 23 rolls a Month.

I always just roll it out like 3-4 sheets, who the fuck only rolls one sheet and calls it a day? You're nasty. And people who only use it when it's necessary. Bro IDGAF. I just roll the whole shit in one day if I'm cleaning the fridge and bathroom. I am not touching that with my bare skin.

Bad enough I stopped buying gloves since that shit is also a ripoff. I bought a $14 pair of gloves, it ripped a small hole inside, rendering it useless, even when they were okay, the gloves would always dry up and stick together after about 1 month of usage.

Bounty is shit quality as of 2023. Their quality degraded since 2020.

"i'm trying to sleep and i just remembered when i told a couple of friends from high-school that i had talked about a mutual friend we had back then in therapy. 

this person made my life hell and made so many people hate me, they orchestrated sessions where everyone would talk about me and say horrible things (i was told about this way after it started happening), they took other peoples phones and messaged me horrible things off of them. i went to the parties my friends were at but i never had fun because of them. every single thing i did was up for criticism and a reason for them to make me feel horrific about myself. i remember one time i was cornered at a party. 

""do you think you're cute posting that photo on instagram?"" 
""i just thought i looked nice"" 
""well you don't, your hair looks so stupid and what are you even wearing?"" 
""have you noticed i don't say anything about the way you look?""
""that's because i'm pretty""

i didnt like that. everyone rushed into the room and it was my fault i got angry.
they told me it was all a joke. when i was pushed to tears every day because of comments on how i look and how i act it was all a joke. i shouldn't have been upset because it was just a joke.

one of the friends i was speaking to said ""i'm sure they talk about you in therapy as well""

i didnt always act nice towards this person, i said some weird shit to them. i was too dependent on this person. i was too much. i was a mentally ill child who didn't understand boundaries and who had crazy attachment and abandonment issues. i sent them mean anon messages on tumblr. i am sorry for what i did. but i never got others to join in, i never embarrassed them at every opportunity, i never told anyone their secrets and i spent a lot time pining for their validation, i apologised for the things i knew were wrong at the time. i never got my apology. they have never acknowledged what they did wrong to me. i tried to support them when they weren't actively bullying me but it always happened again. when they came out as nb i was the only person in our group that made the effort and called them the right name and used the right pronouns. i don't expect an award for this but i really tried to make them more comfortable, i corrected our friends, i learned about trans people and nonbinary people.

i'm not the person who did the horrible things anymore. so why is it keeping me up at night? why do i feel so horrible for the things i said 10 years ago to someone who did all of these things to me? i've been honest about the things i said and did, i've told people i trust to tell me the truth about how bad my behaviour was, they are people who knew me and this person at the time. nobody has told me that i did something really wrong in response to what was happening. i know i hurt this person and i'm sorry. i'm really truly sorry.",i know i have hurt people,18mgdhe,1703030119.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mgdhe/i_know_i_have_hurt_people/,
"I‚Äôve been with my bf for almost 8 years, and honestly the relationship has always been horribly toxic and a bad fit. I‚Äôm a giver, and he‚Äôs a taker who feels no obligation to ever give in return. I feel like I have changed as a person since being with him, and not in a good way; I feel like I‚Äôm constantly clinging to the best parts of me and fighting to keep them alive.

He‚Äôs not physically abusive, but I think could be categorized as emotionally abusive. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs a narcissist too. He takes no accountability, constantly gaslights me, and is really good at turning things around no matter how culpable he is. I‚Äôm more of his mother in this relationship than his partner. And I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it, but at the end of every day I find myself questioning if I really am the problem, am I really being completely unreasonable, is this actually my fault like he always claims? Am I not as good of a person as I think I am, am I the reason for this broken relationship?

I fantasize constantly about moving out and buying my own house, and having my own place for me and my animals, about creating my own safety, and feeling comfortable in my own home.

I cannot afford to in this current economic climate. He makes twice as much as me and pays the big ticket bills like the mortgage and car payments, but I use a higher percentage of my income to pay the utilities and for shared expenses, such as groceries. I have two jobs, I make a higher hourly amount than many jobs in my area pay, but I still live practically paycheck to paycheck. I also have almost $30,000 in student loan and credit card debt, the latter of which I racked up over the past year trying to pay our bills - and also by making poor financial decisions by trying to fix my unhappiness with material things and food. I feel like such a miserable failure, because poor financial planning over the past decade has left me where I am now - desperate to start over on my own, but unable to afford it. 

Renting is not a good option, because in my area it‚Äôs cheaper to buy a house, and most rentals do not allow pets - I would sincerely die before living without my dog and 2 cats, they‚Äôre all I have here. My car is in his name, but even if I could take it with me I couldn‚Äôt afford the payments. Breaking up but still living together isn‚Äôt an option - he would make it miserable, and the thought makes me feel physically ill. Leaving my area isn‚Äôt really an option; I absolutely love my main job and it gives my life purpose, plus in my state this area is one of the more affordable. 

When I think about all of this, I continue to feel like a miserable, whiny failure. Like I‚Äôm not trying hard enough, I‚Äôm not giving it my all - even though I try the hardest everyday, and I have nothing left to give. I feel like I chose to stay here for all of these years, so I now have to reap what I sow. Like I have no one to blame but myself.

"My first head injury was when I was 12 during gym class on the side of my head. My dad picked me up from school and I stayed with him at work the rest of the day and then he took me to the ER and they pretty much just said ""yeah thats some pretty significant trauma. Go home and rest"" note that this hospital is awful, but it's rhe only one around (I'm very rural). After that, for around 3 years I was extremely sensitive to light to the point where I couldn't be outside when it was sunny without being in constant pain. My pupils looked like David Bowie's, and the side of my head that got hit was a constant dull ache, but even the slightest brush against it at that spot caused nauseating pain. Eventually though these symptoms gradually subsided. 

When I was 15 or 16, I had Meningitis B. It was bad. I only was allowed to get medical treatment after I had that instinct and gut feeling that I was dying, which was then confirmed that my body was indeed shutting down. For those who don't know, 20% of meningitis B survivors suffer long term consequences like loss of hearing, limb weakness. brain damage, among some other things.

The most recent incident was when I was almost 19. I was playing hockey without any head protection. Really stupid decision I know. I ended up getting hit and the back of my head got slammed against the wall and then a second time on the ice as I fell. This time I was unconscious for a brief moment. No more than 15-20 seconds. When I came too I just rememver thinking ""ah shit everyone's probably worried"" so I just gave a thumbs up and took a break for about 5 minutes and kept playing. Sure my head hurt  but I felt okay. I didn't go to the doctor at all cause I was always raised under the guise of ""if you're not broken or bleeding nothings wrong"" My ears were ringing like crazy and after I went home and as the day went on my head started to ache, I got really dizzy, nauseous, vision was blurry, very sensitive to light and sound, trouble concentrating, and there was an intense pressure in my head. It got worse over a couple days and like before it slowly subsided. 

I noticed and my teachers noticed (I went to a k-12 school so I was around the same teachers and classmates my whole school career) that after the first incident when I was 12 that my comprehension and learning ability declined very quickly. I still did great in school and I tried my hardest, but I really struggled. When comparing our elementary grades, I did much better than my 3 older siblings. After my first injury, that quickly flip flopped. I've noticed as time went on that my memory, speech and reading comprehension, attention span, and general cognitive ability dropped significantly from what I remember it being. I also have trouble forming words when I want to talk, kinda like how some stroke victims can write just fine but they have trouble getting words to leave their mouth (isn't that called broca aphasia or wernickes aphasia or something? Im not positive). Is it possible that I've got some sort of brain damage from these events? How do I get assessed to figure this out? What do I do?

"Hello, 

I need help, advice, suggestions, anything at this point. I've read and reread this multiple times trying to find the best possible way to put my thoughts into words. 

I 24(f) can't seem to get over my ex no matter what. Everytime I try to move on he unexpectedly pops back in my life. Is it on purpose? Does the universe just refuse to let me forget? Idk 

A little back story on this, we started going out at the age of 14 and ended the relationship when we were both 17. We didn't end on good terms yet, kept hooking up in my car till the age of 18.  All while keeping it a secret from most people. Everything was fine until my senior year of high school, I was 17 at the time. He became my safety net throughout the years, he was my first everything, first kiss, first to lose my virginity too, first guy (and only guy) I snuck out for. We trauma bonded, we were both the oldest sibling, and came from impoverished families. This played a huge role in my mental thinking, I knew I wanted to escape the cycle of poverty with him, to build ourselves up. Senior year came around he became distant, saying ""we need a break"". To this day I stand by my belief that, ""I don't do breaks we either talk it out and figure things out, or we're done.""  So he broke up with me without an explanation. I knew I should've given him space, but I wanted to know the reason. I would pester him, text him, I cried and screamed, during this time I started to self harm again, though I never told him, cause I was not going to guilt trip him into coming back. He would call me a manipulator, two faced, etc. Again, I should've given him time.

Fast-forward to a couple of months, despite us breaking up we still texted daily. I, 18 at this point remember starting my freshman year of college. I was the first to get a car out of the two. I would drive from the place I worked at, to the other side of town to pick him up. Which was a 30 minute drive by car. I did this for a couple of weeks because I so desperately wanted it to work out again, also hoping he'd tell me the reason why. During those times we would hook up in my car after he got out of work. He would tell me that he loved me, would say how he'd ask my mom for permission to date me. Again this went on for a couple of weeks. I remember telling my mom about him wanting to talk with her and ask for permission. She said she was okay with it, and wanted to hear him out and get to know him more. 

That same school year I got a call from him, I remember this day because it was the first time I ever skipped class. The conversation went around the lines of, ""are you happy?"" To which I responded with, ""I am, and I'll be happy with or without you."" Till this day I regret what I said, but it's all in the past and I've honestly tried my best. After that phone call he went radio silent, I heard nothing from him. Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. My mother would ask me here and there about him and I embarrassingly would respond, ""I don't know"". His birthday passed and I wished him a happy birthday. It was around this time that I flew out of country as my father, whom I had no relationship with, passed away. Days before flying out he had posted on his SC and It was of another girl, claiming to be his girlfriend. To say that I was heartbroken would an understatement. 


While out of the country, my friend who had him on SC at the time called me. She told me that there had been a post on his story about him being sad that she wasn't pregnant. This broke me, what really tore me apart was when I came back to the news that they were expecting a child. Mind you a total of 6 months had passed since he was telling me how he loved me and how we were going to build a future together. So like the broken person I was I deleted everything. I buried myself in my studies, overworked myself, talked to other guys, but mostly isolated myself, just to forget him. 


2 years later I get a message from him saying he was sorry, but also mentioning that he's apologizing because he doesn't want his child to think that he's like the other guys out there. I replied through a mutual friend, as I had heard that the mother of his child is jealous and insecure.
I wrote to him saying, that though his apology doesn't sound sincere it's all in the past. That was the end of that, or so I believed.

 
Fastfoward another 2 years beginning of 2023, I get a notification that the mother of his child has followed me on one of my social media's. Later learning that they had broken up. So in theory she followed me because she assumed he would potentially seek me out. (Which was definitely not the case. Just her being insecure). I also have screenshots to prove it, just in case I get called a liar and manipulator again.


To wrap this up, I met with said girly talked it out and she's definitely insecure, and the jealous type. I don't want to be involved with this anymore. I've blocked them on every social media, I even tried LinkedIn but couldn't find a way. There are days I find myself thinking, ""if I had done this, if I had tried harder, would we still be together."" My gut is telling me to wait, and hold on but it's depressing. I still bury myself in my studies and work, as I'm now in my masters program and work at a hospital. I've dated but I compare them to my ex. He was never mean, he was the kindest thing out there, and paid attention to the smallest detail. Fron my end we were young, dumb, and in love, we talked about marriage and our plans for the future. I can't get over him no matter what I try. Dating other people doesn't feel right. I've closed myself off emotionally. What should I do? I've done therapy, I've progressed greatly in my studies and career, I'm feet away from my goals in life yet, I keep looking at the past. The ""what if's or what could've been.""

Any advice? Personal experience? Thoughts?

"i (17) have these two friends i made our second year of high school. oscar (17) and olivia (17)). it was harder to get along with olivia, but when we did we got really close. kinda long story 

our friendship had a few bumps at first, pretty arguments, a lot of boundary setting. it was something we got through and arguments happened less and less. we were listening to each other about how we were feeling and communicating whenever something crossed the line. they helped me out when i finally stopped being friends with my abuser and those who decided to keep friends with him, and oscar and olivia were my biggest supporters. they helped me cut communication, cut people off, and stayed by my side when i was struggling with a declining mental health when everything first started. i love them so much. 

lately it just kinda seems like they‚Äôre annoyed with my existence. they were already friends prior to me being introduced. oscar made friends with me first before introducing me to olivia. this is something i‚Äôve always felt insecure about, i tend to make friends in pairs rather than just meeting people on my own. it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve discussed with all my friends like this and for the most part, they all understood and they made sure to reassure me that it would never be a friendship where i‚Äôd be excluded or pushed out of. it felt really good to know someone was finally listening and respecting my boundaries. over the summer they went on vacation together, i wasn‚Äôt allowed to go (parent choice). and during that entire time i felt like a ghost. i would barely receive messages, whenever we were on the phone they would whisper to each other instead of listening to me. during that time i would avoid phone calls and barely communicate with them. ever since then it feels like things have changed, it‚Äôs happened in stages but my therapist said it‚Äôs a pattern they‚Äôve been noticing. 

in groups where i‚Äôm the odd person, im often left out while everyone else talked to each other. the arguments have started up again and it‚Äôs over pettier and pettier things. 

more recently, (as in yesterday and today) there was an incident regarding a school event taking place after school. i had asked if they were going to go because it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve done every year since we‚Äôve known each other.  i was told that no they weren‚Äôt gonna go this year and i accepted that and said i wasn‚Äôt gonna go either. i‚Äôd have no one else to go with and there‚Äôs too many people to go and do anything by myself. especially when they know my abuser always goes. in result i was given the response of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have other friends?‚Äù which yeah i do, but not friends willing to go and not friends im close enough with. they‚Äôll be in their own groups and ill be the odd one out. i don‚Äôt like things like that. i asked about what other friends i have as i dont know very many people, and most of my ‚Äòfriends‚Äô are people who strictly talk to me in class and not even often. they began laughing at me (something i had already established as a boundary maybe a month prior). it was frustrating because this is something they‚Äôve started to do a lot more often and it‚Äôs getting more and more irritating. 

one brought up something about ‚Äòall‚Äô my friends and how i‚Äôve basically boasted about having all these friends. never once in my life have i ever said something like that, i swear to god i genuinely don‚Äôt know where the hell something like that came from because i don‚Äôt fucking talk like that. i just don‚Äôt. and i asked for a time on when i have ever said that because id like to know genuinely id like to know when ive said that because i dont believe it. they said they‚Äôre was no point in telling me because i would‚Äôve believe them anyways. it was getting too much and olivia started to raise her voice at me, so the teacher ended up intervening and sending me off to do an assignment. after that it felt like i was being ignored for the rest of the day never even received any texts later on in the day 

today i went in thinking that the situation was going to be done and over with. but still in the morning it seemed they were reluctant to talk to me and again it started to hurt my feelings. during our midday period, they brought it up again. they asked who i sat with the day previous and i named one of my friends. they began to laugh again and look at me as if i was stupid i hate when they do that. had to explain i never said i didn‚Äôt have friends at all and they had such a dramatic reaction oscar got out of his seat laughing and they were both still cracking jokes even when i told them they weren‚Äôt listening to me and they proceeded to ignore what i said.

"In the vast expanse where stars ignite,
A tale of love, both cosmic and bright,
Two souls entwined, their hearts aflame,
Bound by a love that had no name.

Across the galaxies, they danced as one,
Their love outshining every blazing sun,
They painted nebulae with hues of affection,
Creating constellations of their connection.

Their love was a symphony, harmonious and true,
Echoing through the cosmos, a celestial debut,
But fate, a silent force, had a different plan,
It whispered cruel winds, a tempest began.

As galaxies collided and worlds collided,
The cosmic love they shared slowly subsided,
A rift in space, a fracture in their hearts,
Tearing them apart, drifting in celestial parts.

The stars wept diamonds, their light grew dim,
For a love so pure, now lost within a whim,
Across the cosmic distance, they yearned to touch,
But their love, once boundless, now became a crutch.

Like comets passing, their paths diverged,
Leaving behind a love that once surged,
In the black abyss, their hearts did ache,
For a love that now seemed a cosmic mistake.

Yet in the night sky, a faint glimmer remained,
A reminder of love, though it seemed restrained,
For even in loss, love's ember still glows,
In the depths of the universe, forever it flows.

So let the stars bear witness to this cosmic love lost,
A bittersweet tale, at an immeasurable cost,
For in the tapestry of the cosmos, love endures,
Though they're apart, their love forever ensures.",Happy Memories,18mf6fv,1703026880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18mf6fv/happy_memories/,

"Ever since I was a little kid I have HATED buttons. The kind you get on clothes. I cannot precisely describe the feeling they give me. It's not fear, or disgust necessarily, it's a weird indescribable hatred of them I have never really been able to articulate. It's not enough to stop me wearing clothing with buttons when I  have to. I just don't like doing so. Especially when it comes to eating. I can remember being a kid and not wanting to look at them while eating and to this day I will try and avoid eye contact with buttons when sitting down for a meal. It's not enough to make me not eat my food, but it's enough to worsen my experience at restaurants.

When I told my mum about this, she said that she would buy me shirts when I was a little kid and I would scream and cry and not want to wear them, so I've obviously had this from a very young age. When I was at school I would always wear a jumper over my shirt because I hated seeing them on my own clothes and I would never keep any item of clothing that had buttons on for any longer than necessary. I remember recently being at this girls house and she was wearing a pair of pyjama bottoms with three buttons where the fly would be. But there was no fly. This really bothered me and I was instantly less attracted to her simply because i now associate her with that.

As you can imagine this has limited my choice of clothing. I do own clothing with buttons such as trousers that have buttons on the back pockets, but don't own any smart shirts for example. One concern I have is that upon finishing my degree I'll have to work a job that makes me wear a buttoned shirt every day. NIGHTMARE!

I know this sounds silly but this mild phobia of buttons has impacted what I can wear, my enjoyment of meals and potentially what kind of career I choose. I'm scared to tell this to people I know because I don't want people to think I'm a weirdo, and apart from this I'm a pretty normal person.

"This is probably going to be a long rant but I would appreciate it if someone at least read it. I'm F20 not in a relationship every relationship I've been in has lasted like 3 months. The only guy I have ever properly loved treated me horribly and for whatever messed up reason I still miss him, and I wish I hadn't of cut him off even though, that was very clearly the right thing to do. 

I have hardly any social life I have one friend who I message frequently but can never meet because we live far from each other. We only get to speak face to face at university so, most of the time I feel so lonely especially when I see my sisters hanging out with their friends.

I just sit in my room watching YouTube videos or sleeping, I have all these things I want to do like making films and screenwriting which, I have been doing such as the screenwriting I've been trying to write a scene everyday and like give myself an hour or 2 dedicated to that. Most of the time however, I have no motivation to do anything like I'd think about doing something and then procrastinating all day till there's no time left to do it, whatever ""it"" is.

I don't get taken seriously with any of the creative stuff I want to do, like the filmmaking and the screenwriting because I'm so shy and awkward around anyone I don't know. I just make myself look stupid whenever I do try to interact with people because I never know what to say or do. I probably look really lazy to people in my film class because I don't always go in and not because I don't want to, Its because I have no friends in there and most of the work is group work so its just so awkward for me.

I procrastinate a lot on assignments and leave things till the last minute and when I try to change and set goals and a routine for myself, I don't follow through and sometimes that feeling of wanting to do something will only last a week. Most of the time I'd rather stay in bed and sleep and drink a whole bottle of coke I know that's not healthy, but its the only thing that makes me feel happy right now.

I have no confidence and compared to other family members my life looks horrible everyone has something going for them, and I don't. Sure, I'm at university but I'm doing film and media and as much as I'd love to do that as a job, It wont happen. I can't see myself having a family of my own or many friends. I can't see myself getting on with life never mind having a nice full filling life.

I have all these problems with my kidneys and I'm in hospital a lot and I can't go out or drink nothing like that which to you guys, It might not look like a big deal but when I see other people doing it, people my age I feel like I've missed out or am missing out. I feel like because of these medical problems nobody is going to want me because I'd be a burden to them like that's how they would feel.

I can't do anything right I had my second drivers test today I really thought I was going to pass since, on my first test I only got 1 serious fault and 7 minors and, the lessons leading up to my test have been going really well but this time, I did even worse. I was just so anxious and overthinking every single thing. It's like nothing goes my way and I can never have one thing go right its like life works out for everyone around me, but nothing works out for me. 

The only thing I'm doing apart from uni is working, I work part time but its not even a permanent job its a temporary job till January. Every permanent job I went to apply for didn't want me and I probably wont be able to get a job for a while after this one ends because, nowhere is hiring. The places that are hiring are hard to get to because they're far and I can't drive and have nobody to take me, the buses and trains near me are so unreliable. 

I spend hours in my room daydreaming of being a different person and having a fun life and having a lot of friends etc which sounds weird, but it makes me feel happier and it keeps me busy.

I just don't see things working in my favour life just seems to suck right now.

"Last time (2014) the scumbags at Papajohns Pizza handed me a Pepperoni pizza at the establishment, this wasn't for Delivery. I didn't know what the dude was smiling about he said ""Enjoy your food bro"" I said ""thanks I will"" but then I got home, on the very first slice, I noticed a LONG thick curly fucking Pube just sticking out of the corner of the pizza. 

That instantly ruined my appetite for about 2 days. I called papajohns and said they can offer a replacement, but I just opted for a refund. They agreed and the employee was probably fired I assume. 

To this day, I always lift the cheese up and check under it to make sure there are no Worms, pubes, razor blades of any kind. It's kind of an annoying habit. But I'd rather be safe than sorry.

"So y'all already know what time it is. 6 days from now we're supposed to go to my Cousin's house for CHRISTMAS dinner because he has a big house and no one wants to stay over at our little peasant box, so we just always go over to theirs. Whole fam is there of course. But the main reason why I wanted to write this is because my Female Cousin (28) has really nice hot fucking thighs. I just don't have the courage to tell her that unfortunately. Last Christmas, not so much the years prior, she wore this one short Santa skirt with the stockings, I don't know what you would call them, but it was very hot, I wonder if she wore this on purpose? Anyway, her thighs are very smooth and very squishy looking. Like she has nice legs okay?

I even got to a point so fucking close to actually saying that but opted out before things escalated, and that was last year. This time I hope she wears something hot as well. I just really wanna see what her Vagina looks like. I wonder if it's tightly closed, or if it's already penetrated? She was engaged but she ended up breaking it up because she found out her fiance was texting another Woman, crazy story about that. I wonder if she ended up opening her legs to that scumbag? They've only been together 3 years prior to that incident, they were planning on getting married soon, but that incident just broke her heart and it pissed me off as well. I am very glad that she handled it maturely by just kicking him out of her life instead of throwing a huge fit, that most Women do.

"I am new to the reddit community but would like some advice on my situation. First a bit of background before I describe the situation. When I was one year old, my dad abandoned my mom, my sister and me and we grew up in my maternal grandparents‚Äô house. My dad then came back when I was about 18 and my mom reunited with my dad. After I got married, my parents and my sister treated my wife horribly and I separated with my parents. I later moved to another city but I still helped out my parents when they needed it. My dad couldn't get a loan for his house due to his bad credit and borrowed a loan under my name. Then in 2015, my dad declared business bankruptcy and couldn't pay his mortgage payments so I bought a house for them for about $550K with my savings and about $125K they got for their house. I told them that they could stay there rent-free for a couple of years and then I would sell. I explicitly told them not to spend any money on upgrades because my dad always tries to show off, which is why he couldn‚Äôt pay off his house even after 25 years. This continued until 2019 and I offered to buy their own house in Chicago or I could buy them a smaller house in my city with a budget of $500-550K. I told them that my daughter was about to go to college and I couldn‚Äôt afford paying over $10K property taxes/insurance. They finally found a townhouse in 2021 and my dad told me to bid $20K over price and $60K overprice in case of bidding. I agreed to all of their demands and told them that they would have to pay property taxes/insurance, which they agreed. However, then they told me to put the house in my sister‚Äôs name, which I refused and they started blaming me for not helping my sister and cursing me and my wife. I explained that I have a lot of expenses for supporting my family and my second daughter was also about to go to college. I again offered them that I could buy her a house in Chicago and called my real-estate agent to cancel the contract and forfeit their money but then they changed their mind again. I explicitly told them that I won't sell the new house soon and they can live in the house as long as they want as long as they pay expenses without rent. But they still tried to maneuver me to give the house to my sister‚Äôs name and even tried to get our real-estate agent to send them the contract so that house can be under her name, which I had to change later. Despite all that, I gave them $10K for moving expenses but they kept a hostile attitude towards me and my wife; and then tried to sabotage the sale.   
Fast forward to now, my parents never actually paid any property taxes/insurance and I continued to support them. Then in early December my dad gave me a notice that they want $300K from me and want to leave the house in 30-60 days. Despite paying zero rent, they made up fake charges for upgrades to the house that I didn‚Äôt authorize or agree to. I told them again that they have lived rent free for about nine years and saved hundreds of thousands, which has also cost me hundreds of thousands in interest/taxes/insurance. I told them that if they want to leave then I would list the house and pay back their actual balance after the sale. However, after my reply, started cursing us, accusing my wife of black magic and all sorts of slanders. My dad continued to lie to everyone that I am not paying him back and two years ago when I bought them another new house, he told everyone that I was putting them on the streets. Further, the housing market has been down here and my estimated loss from the sale including all taxes/insurance/real-estate fees/closing is at least $100-120K. I explained all this but they didn‚Äôt care and then started cursing me and told me that they are ending our relations. Despite abusive treatment from my parents and my sister, they are still living in the house that I bought and paying for them. However, I am done with their emotional blackmail and have refused their demands of upfront payment of their balance with made up charges. They have lived rent free for about nine years where I had to pay hundreds of thousands in interest/taxes/insurance/closing-fees/etc while balancing all of my family expenses with one job. In the past, my dad has forged my signatures to cash my checks and charged thousands of dollars on my credit card without my knowledge. My sister has always manipulated me and both my dad and sister have cheated a number of other people but they always portray themselves as victims. In my culture and broader family, everyone tells me to obey my parents despite their awful attitude but my patience has reached the limit and would like some legal options and advice to get the house back peacefully, list the house and then settle their actual balance after the sale.

"I (16F) don't know how to feel about what my father did years ago. So for the context of this, we need to go back to mid 2019, a little before covid went down. I was 12 at the time, and me and my family had moved into a nice house at the back of a nice upper-middle class neighborhood. My parents had always fought, and as time went on, things never really got better. It wasn't until I was woken up by my mom at roughly 1AM that things got bad. Turns out, my father had been caught in a youtube video texting a supposed 16 y/o on grindr. It was one of those catching pedophile videos, showing the texts of my father acknowledging what he was doing with a picture of him beside it and then the confrontation of the youtubers and my father at the discussed meet up point. My father had fled, cops were called, and I went and stayed with my grandparents that night with my mother and sister. The next day I ended up watching my father get arrested, as he had come by the house to pick up a few things to leave again. He threatened to kill me and my family, then himself, and thus he was hospitalized. My father was let go since he technically never did anything with a 16 y/o because it was just a YouTube channel making a video. I didn't speak to my father for five months after that. I was terrified of him. Eventually I spoke to my family's former marriage counselor, and during the second session was when I spoke to my father for the first time since the incident. During that session, the counselor told me that what my father did was comparable to a teenager acting out and that it wasn't that serious. My father was 52 years old at that time. I broke down, and didn't attend to another session after that, knowing what he told me was a lie and that what my father did was horrible. However, I did start seeing my dad again after that.

Fast forward to now, and I'm conflicted. Recently I can't stop thinking about what my father did and what he's done throughout my life. I know what he did was wrong but I feel like I choose to just ignore it. I hate how normalized it feels in my mind, like it's just a common thing. I hate the way I tried to defend him, and I question the relationship I have with him now. I feel horrible for telling myself it is normal, yet I keep choosing to brush it off like it's nothing? I don't know what to do. I can't tell my mother or she'll use it to make it so I stop seeing my dad, but I can't ignore it anymore. Both of my parents have done things that have hurt me in some ways, and they use me as a mortar to get back at each other. I feel trapped in a way, like both sides will jump at the opportunity to turn me against the other.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, or if it doesn't explain things well.

"It's always been scary to let go and really get close to people, physically and emotionally. I've always feared that they will leave me if I come too close. Wether because they might be scared if they see me from too close, or they might be scared if I'm being too pushy. I've always felt like a burden who had to go trough long ways to make others happy and make up for the piece of shit that I (presumably) am.
I've never had sex because i was scared of getting so close to woman as to allow this level of intimacy to happen, altough it pains me when i see a beautiful girl walking by, it pains me how beautiful she is and how far away from my reach she is.
I've tried everything to be outgoing. I've scared myself to the bone. Went to every party i could, approached a lot of random people, went to improv classes, sang and played Instruments on stage, i was even like quite popular at some point, i was having people approaching me, but out of fear of rejection, i was unconsciously keeping them at bay, one way or another.
I was even in bed with one girl, but never took of my underwear. I just foreplayed from evening till dawn, wich was beautiful but I wish i had experienced sex.

"Hi! I am a female, 19 years old, 5'0, 55kg, and have had my fair share of bullying throughout my life. for the past 18 years, I have been able to just brush off any comments regarding my looks as most of them were made out of ""fun"" and it honestly didnt really bother me. I was considered the ugliest out of the friend group, so much that people would question why these attractive, tall and intelligent people hang out with me. I would also be called fat and people at my high school would straight up point out physical things that is ""wrong"" with me (like how my eyes are too small for my face or how big my head is). 

During the pandemic I gained a lot of confidence, i got to experiment and play around with different things that could make me look better. I felt amazing. I felt comfortable in my own skin for once. I would start posting pictures of myself online whenever I felt pretty. I also lost some weight during this time. My confidence was the highest it has ever been. 

Though I thought I had a stable self esteem by this time my self doubt started to resurface when I listened to a comment from my cousin about me being the ""ugliest"" cousin. Apparently she showed her aunt (who i am not related or have ever spoken to in my life) a picture of my 18th birthday celebration and she said that I was the ugliest one of all of us. I felt bad because I didnt think I was, and I got all done up for that day just to look the ugliest? I also felt betrayed because this particular cousin would vent to me about her looks and how she did not feel comfortable with her body yet she would blatantly tell me something like this without thinking how it would make me feel. I could have went on with my life not knowing about a comment someone i dont even know and care about made but no, she had to tell me. I guess it validated her in some way because it would mean that she looked better than me. Still, I was able to brush it off, it hurt but I didnt wanna care too much. 

The last straw was this past week. I have been having severe acne breakouts and have gained some weight for the past year. Even so, these things hardly affected my confidence. I still thought I looked good. My parents now keep commenting on my face and body. First it was my dad who would call me fat, ugly and how disgusting (yes, his words) my skin, armpits, and hair were almost everyday, but now my mom has started to do the same. I am actively trying to fix myself but at the same time I didnt want to waste the confidence that I've spent such a long time earning. 

Truthfully, I do not think I am ugly. Ex-boyfriends have told me that I looked attractive and my body looked healthy and good. I feel confident about my fashion sense and I can proudly walk outside with my head held up high but I just want to point out how confidence‚Äîyes starts with how you view yourself but‚Äîhow could someone ever feel comfortable in their own skin if everyone around them tells them they are ugly and unworthy? It baffles me so much that I had to vent. I am proud of the improvements I've gained throughout the years especially the ones that only I am able to see.

"So I have a pretty unusual problem. Me (26F) and my mom (56F) were never really super close and even though that made me upset during my childhood, I‚Äôm mostly ok nowadays.
However, ever since my grandfather (my mom‚Äôs dad) passed away, she‚Äôs been depressed and going to therapy, and seems to be making progress, and I‚Äôm happy for her.
Here‚Äôs where the problem begins: she has always had issues with her body and weight and has had eating disorders since she was a teenager. She has always expressed her self loathing very openly and is on a constant battle to get thinner and suffering a lot from it. Therapy has been helping her see that her relationship with food is not healthy and that she needs to attend to her needs better.
But in the process, she thinks she has caused me to hate my body too, which I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm comfortable with my body, I think I‚Äôm a pretty girl, despite not being on the ‚Äústandards of beauty‚Äù because I lean on the heavier side and am a bit muscular, but I feel pretty, I feel desirable, I‚Äôm healthy and do sports and have a pretty nice relationship with food.

"I have never felt like more of a terrible human than I do now. Please bear with me.

I'm a young adult and about to move out with my girlfriend. and I get pretty upset about housing where I live sometimes. It's expensive and not many people my age can even afford a house. Me and my girlfriend together have worked our butts off to even get a starter's house but I can't help but complain about how bad the situation is right now and how there are so many people that are just a year older than me and are way better off than me.

I complain too much.

My dad, asking what's on my mind, got angry at me for complaining about the same thing again. It ended up in me yelling ""then why do you even bother asking?!"". He shut the door, which was a good move. I went upstairs.

When my mom came home, my dad started complaining about how ungrateful we are (yes also my mother). My dad does the housekeeping and was just done cooking dinner.

My parents have pretty bad fights often. Their marriage isn't what it used to be. They ended up screaming at each other. This time it was really bad. My mom ended up throwing a plate at the wall, which is a complete first. My dad got so angry that he destroyed my mom's knitting work. Then he threw a heavy wooden chair at her after which she called out to me to come and save her.

When I came down I was shocked to find that my parents had ruined their own home. Then my dad grabbed my mom's phone and smashed it against the wall.

I was so shocked I could not even yell anymore. I picked up the phone and I could only calmly ask ""why did you have to throw her phone?"" to which he said ""Oh is it broken? Let me see, let me see."" only to grab it out of my hands and smash it full force against the wall again, breaking the phone in two.

I hated my dad for it. I yelled ""you stupid idiot"" and pushed him. My intention was to just push him backwards a little bit to show my disaproval but he flew backwards and fell and hit his head against a chair causing a scratch on his head and leaving him in a light daze.

My dad is getting older and he was sick from COVID so in retrospect I shouldn't have pushed him as hard as I did. I shouldn't have pushed him at all. I have never ever touched anyone in an angry fit and I never intended him to be hurt in any way at all.

He wasn't angry in the slightest. I cried and apologized profusely while holding my dad as he was recovering from his fall. He understood where I was coming from and the fight between my parents ended there.

I ended up talking it out with my mom and my dad. They were never angry with me. They always protect me and give me everything they can offer, even if it's not a lot, which only makes me feel worse about it. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy them something they like.

Still, I feel so bad. Again, I never intended for anyone to be hurt. Now it feels like I caused all of this.

I feel like an aggressive monster.

"i love his face, he's so pretty. he's so beautiful i fight the urge to just say like...you're so pretty. (i feel that it would be inappropriate). my friends don't know that i am obsessed with him. they would find it random and strange. 


his philtrum is so nice like the space between his nose and mouth and his cupids bow is really defined.  i love the little cowlick, the little hair that splits his glasses in two and i love his sharp jaw that i could use to slice vegetables.
i appreciate how he takes care of himself! he dresses well even in freezing temperatures when most people dress for comfort over style.

i can tell he is a guy who like, works out and Tracks His Macros‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and i like that he seems to trim his eyebrows as well. i can notice when a guy takes care of his eyebrows and i admire that he does so. i like the puffy bags under his eyes that make him seem more youthful and cuter.

he's so passionate about what he believes in! he is so serious and focused on making the world a better place. i truly have never seen him distracted or off task. i am curious about what he thinks about or how he acts when he gets silly.

i love his upper lip. it's like small but very curly and curvy and curvaceous. it has a lot of personality and character. i literally love watching him talk to see how his upper lip moves and the sides of his mouth. its mesmerizing. his upper lip naturally looks the way others lips do when they put on makeup to overline their lips. god truly spent time on him.

people put on makeup trying to make their bottom lip looks like his as well. he has a natural shadow under his lower lip that makes it look very full. in his side profile, his lips jut out in a way i find very pleasing to the eye.

i also think his cheekbones naturally look very defined. celebrities get buccal fat removal surgery trying to look like him. he even trims his sideburns. he is so meticulous!

he unbuttons the top of his shirt but i dont see anything. i wonder whether or not he has chest hair.  i sort of see pecs through his shirt :( i wish i could see more. his arms seem defined as well...i'll never know.

"This is just something that‚Äôs been on my mind recently because I‚Äôm starting to think about settling down and having children. I‚Äôm a 26-year-old woman and I always planned on having children on my own. I never really wanted to get married. This was never something at the top of my list that bothered me about men up until recently, but now it has become another point on the list. Why I think I‚Äôm making the right decision to have kids on my own (with the support of my family, of course). I have always wanted a daughter,but I remember what it is like to be a teenage girl and the attention you get from older men even men in their 40s and 50s and lately that has been hitting me as a big fear I have for bringing a girl into the world. I remember my prom when I was a senior there was a junior in our prom party who was indeed very beautiful, but she was only 16. One of the fathers got belligerent pretty early on during the photos and would not stop making comments about her and her body and how beautiful she was all night to the point where even other parents picked up on how weird it was. things like this happened to me in my youth as well.
During Covid I took a gender studies class to fill up a couple of credits I needed, as well as started reading some feminist and watching debates, particularly stuff centered on anti-porn, it really pained me to read the statistics on the amount of grown men that seek out, barely legal and schoolgirl themed porn videos, and how normalized it is in society for young girls to be sexual very early on. I try not to think about the stuff all the time because I can make you miserable but it is something that weighs on my mind. It has already been a battle even just dating men after finding out these statistics, but I can‚Äôt lie and say I don‚Äôt find great comfort in the fact that I will never have a man around the house that can potentially make my daughters or her friends uncomfortable.
Before anybody comes after me I‚Äôm not trying to say that all men are predators ,and I know there are women predators, too, however, the numbers just do not match up, women are simply not as much of a threat overall as men are toward younger people, specifically women.
I also think there are behaviors we let men participate in (the normalization of teen porn, countdowns until certain celebrities turn 18,etc‚Ä¶) that we do not vilify as much as we should.

"We noticed a weird 1-2x a day cough from our dog last week and noticed on Saturday that his lymph nodes were swollen, like the size of a marble. We went to go see a movie and came back and he was extremely lethargic and started crossing his feet to move, so we took him to an emergency vet. $1.5k later and we got a diagnosis that it's large cell lymphoma but they didn't have the equipment to discern if it was type B or type T.

Monday we hit the phones frantically calling and no oncologist in a 50 mile radius had any availability until Jan 2nd. I know that's not a long wait but for something like this I'd much prefer to act as quickly as possible, especially with the impending holiday coming around. On top of that, it was very frustrating talking to front desk clerks. One lady was particularly rude and said ""I can't make appointments appear magically out of thin air."" Like I know we were pushing to get our dog seen but the snark wasn't appreciated. Luckily there was a cancellation and we're taking him in tomorrow.

My wife and I have taken turns crying and holding each other. This boy is just so sweet and such a light on our life. He's the kindest, most patient, and the most considerate dog I've ever had (I mean if we say while playing he stops to check on us, he takes food gently from us, he'll cuddle us unprompted if we're sad or sick, etc). Reading stories about large cell lymphoma on here and various websites is a sad journey. I was looking for a sliver of hope, but most stories end up sad where they had to put their dogs down in a matter of weeks or a few months after treatment.

Regrets flood my mind: regrets of not walking him more, not taking him to more parks, not playing with him as much because I was ""tired"", no impromptu car rides, etc. I just regret so much that I didn't do with him. Equally my mind is flooded with thoughts of him not being home when I get back from work, his bark to let us know about literally any car that comes in our cul-de-sac, him booping and giving us kisses when he's bored, him playing tug and cuddling with his brother dachshund (who is in the process of going blind due to a genetic disposition), his cuddling style where if you try to cuddle him he'll get up but if you're patient he'll lay his head on your leg as you sleep.... I'm going to miss these things very much.

He's literally so healthy in every other way. We thought we'd have him into his teens, but it looks like that might not be the case now. I know he was loved and had a wonderful home with loving parents. I knew it wouldn't last forever but holy fuck I wasn't expecting things to end so abruptly. We wanted him to be around for our first child, to help our next puppy learn the roost of the home, etc. He's such an integral part of our life that we are not ready to say goodbye yet, not so abruptly.

My wife and I have no doubt we'll do chemo treatment. Luckily we have insurance to help with reimbursement for treatment. Every day I can squeeze out with my boy without him being in pain or suffering. He deserves the best and so we're going to try and give him that. He's a Heinz 57 dog and it's hard to discern what he actually is. We ordered a DNA + Health test (which too late for the health test but it was on sale so w/e) to get his heritage.

I'm pessimistically optimistic about remission and longevity. I'm hopeful that we can give him more time with us but I'm also equally pessimistic with reading anecdotal evidence from others who have already experienced this.

Fuck cancer and fuck whatever caused this. I love my boy with every fiber of my being and I'm feeling deep mixtures of anger and sadness (and a lot of disbelief).

edit: I'm also not saying that I'll force him through pain for the sake of our sadness. If worst comes to worst or he wouldn't have a lot of time regardless of treatment then we'll of course do the humane thing and make his time as comfortable as possible and then put him to sleep when its his time. But I'm trying all my options until we can get to that point.

"I have this one guy in some of my classes, he's in my 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 8th period. We'll call him Rocky. 

I used to 'have a crush' on on Rocky when I first came to school (I am new and only came this year). Rocky acts like an 8th grade boy in a way, just less mean. A lot of his friends are like him but more mean, especially to me since I am openly queer at school. 

I decided after a while that it wasn't a crush I had on him, and it was just me finding him pretty and sometimes funny too. I left it at that.

At some point though, he and his friends group came to the conclusion that I liked him and started asking me all the time if I liked Rocky. I have a suspicion a group of girls I was friends with (before they TRIED spreading rumors about me) told them. 

I had originally kept denying that I liked him when his friends would ask, which I'm still doing. However, he has done lots of things to mess with me about it.

He asked me on a date during class, he's called me hot twice, and he's shouted pick up lines to me in front of the class...

In 7th period yesterday, some of his friends asked if I was dating him and he came up behind me and said 'Yeah she's my girlfriend. ____ please don't leave me, I'll be very sad.' In a voice that sounded like his normal voice pretty much. 

I give him my gum and candy so much, he came up and just took some of my gum in 2nd period today... two different times.

Then today in 8th period, some of my friends (and people I typically avoid) shipped me with him. Another friend said me and another girl (who Mason 'flirts with, but has a boyfriend) have competition with each other. Mason also said he was madly in love with her, then he said it about me too when asked about me. 
Another girl also pressured me into giving him one of my bracelets, to which I said yes to because it was funny and I had a spare of that bracelet.

I don't know what to do. One of my friends asked him about it back when he had used pick up lines on me. And while they didn't tell me exactly what he said, they made it seem like he said he didn't mean any of it.

I don't know what to do or how I'm supposed to feel about any of this. I can't do anything about it myself because I'm not even confident enough to correct people on my pronouns here because of how much bullying I have faced since I came to school. I can't go to any of my friends either because some of them don't go to my school, and the ones who do, I don't trust enough yet.

All of my friends finished their internship today, and they'll all be graduating this winter. I won't; I'm redoing my internship and will be graduating in the winter semester of 2025. I've been seeing everyone post their graduation pictures on Facebook and Instagram. I feel so sad.

I have really good grades in school, I've worked for 2 years in my field and have gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback. When I get negative feedback, I see with my superiors what I can do better and change to meet expectations. Yet, my internship went so badly, despite being open to critique and changing my behaviour. I always finished my tasks on time, I did my best to integrate well into the team. I showed interest. But I couldn't make it work.

I feel like a failure because all my friends will be moving on with their life, and I'll be stuck in school for another year. This experience has made me question wether or not I'm cut out for this job. I just wanted to do good but this has become the worst year of my life. I want to be happy for my friends but whenever I hear them talk about how well their internship went, when I hear them talk about how excited they are to graduate and go to their prom, I just feel so sad and angry at myself.

I wish I could be like them. I wish I could have followed the same path as them. I wish my internship had gone well. I wish my life would have gone differently. I wish I could be happy, but I'm just sad. I don't know how to cope with the sadness I feel.

TL;DR: I was meant to graduate in winter 2024 but my intership went very badly. I had to put an end to it and will be graduating in winter 2025. I'm sad at seeing all my friends graduate, despite trying to be happy for them.

When i was 16, i met a man, 28. We chatted just fine for a bit until he made me see porn without my consent. I gave in to him. All because i was tired of not having someone in my life who could understand my problems and not shame me for having a mental health disorder, ocd. It went till this point where we would do sexual things and i would hate every bit of it.

I started self harm, and my suicidal ideation kept getting worse and worse until one day, i was just prepared to end it all.

I did cut myself, though not anywhere close to it being fatal but my hands nevertheless had horrible gashes

I blocked him a month later because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. No closure.

But i was stupid enough to reach out to him less than 2 months later because i was worried about him; he has a personality disorder, bpd.

Ive had to deal with issues like binge eating and attempts to purge afterwards, I've starved myself many times just because he likes ‚Äúskinny girls‚Äù. I still have body image issues. All of this and i‚Äôm still unable to get professional help for this.

I don‚Äôt also have the best relationship with my parents. My dad once tried to kill me and my mom tried to gaslight me into thinking that never happened. My dad always body shamed me and my mum still occasionally does it very casually. I try to feel good about myself but not with these obstacles lying around.

I have so much rage and frustration over what happened to me and i cant seem to calm myself down sometimes.

I hate that he got away with it. I know his name, what he looks like, where he works, all of this but no evidence of what he did to me!

I feel horrible that i let all this happen to me. All my friends, teachers, and family saw the gashes but they never cared enough to actually help me out, given that i was a minor then.

Now, I'm 18 and I'm doing much better. I don‚Äôt deal with suicidal thoughts anymore and i‚Äôm happier and healthier today than Ive ever been before. But these feelings of well being are usually temporary.

But i‚Äôm still proud that I'm still alive and well, Ive been a super resilient person, and i‚Äôll always be one no matter what.

"Her and a mutual friend of ours arranged a surprise meeting between us. The mutual friend invited me out somewhere, and then she met us there. I had no idea that was going to happen at all. It was strange to me, I certainly would have agreed to see her without the surprise. I think she thought I was mad at her or would have declined to meet or something (I wasn‚Äôt and I wouldn‚Äôt have declined). I was really happy to see her, since it‚Äôs been about 4 years since we saw each other or talked (we‚Äôve been friends in some form for about 15 years), but I was extremely taken off guard and the resulting feelings have been really hard for me to process. 

The main feeling is overwhelming guilt. I feel awful about how the last 10 years for us have gone. I ghosted her very harshly about 10 years ago. She was my closest friend, and she said I was hers, and I just suddenly dropped her and refused to reciprocate any efforts to maintain our friendship. I was going through a lot at the time but wasn‚Äôt capable of explaining it. I was still a teenager, having lots of issues at home and with my friends. I felt extreme pressure from all around, which led to really chronic depression and anxiety that I still haven‚Äôt gotten over. I was also in a very toxic relationship with someone who wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet‚Äù me talk to her. I detached from a lot of other people as well, but none quite as harshly. This lasted for about two years, and she made several very strong attempts to get me to talk about what happened (or even just reconnect without explaining anything) but I just couldn‚Äôt do it. The last time, she finally really tore into me (the only time I‚Äôve ever seen her legitimately angry, and even then she was incredibly level headed about it). After sitting with that for a few months, I finally admitted to myself that what I was doing was really fucked up, and I reached out to her to apologize for it. She accepted, even though (imo) my apology really wasn‚Äôt adequate, and we started talking again. It kinda came and went from there, with stretches where it felt like we were fully ‚Äúback‚Äù and stretches where we really didn‚Äôt talk that much. This lasted for a few years until it fully stopped. 

I‚Äôve always had some romantic interest in her. That, and being a stupid teenager, was a big factor in why I ghosted her 10 years ago and I feel so dumb and guilty about it. I wish I could go back in time and hit myself with a hammer. At the time, I felt like that interest wasn‚Äôt reciprocated, but in hindsight now I feel like she probably at least somewhat felt the same way, I just had really awful self esteem and assumed she (and everyone else) hated me. She actually specifically called me out on that when we were arguing. 

I want to be over it and just be a decent friend. I know it‚Äôs not right for me to continue this friendship with any hope of that happening. I absolutely feel like if I had the closure of knowing how she felt I would be more than okay with whatever that was. Obviously I don‚Äôt think now is the right time. I also don‚Äôt feel good about continuing on in hopes of it being the right time. I regret so much about everything that‚Äôs happened. I wish I would have just expressed everything a long time ago and we could‚Äôve just went from there, but I always felt like that would likely be the end if she didn‚Äôt feel the same. 

I have an incredibly hard time admitting to all of this. It‚Äôs taken me almost 2 hours to type this out because I feel so guilty about how things have gone and my role in them and I have a hard time expressing it in any way other than just thinking about it. I‚Äôve been in therapy for a few months, and my therapist has helped me identify all of these issues (fear of abandonment, intense feelings of guilt, emotional distancing, anxiety, etc) in my relationships with my family and friends, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to talk there about anything relating to dating or romantic relationships. I feel like I need to talk about it, given all the feelings this has brought up for me in the past week and how much it relates to what I‚Äôve been working on in therapy, as well as how much it affects my personal happiness and the happiness of others. I don‚Äôt want to be like this. I feel embarrassed about how this post would read from her perspective. I really want to do better.

"I (28F) slept with my best friend (28F) about 6 years back (making us both 22ish at the time). For the sake of this tale we will call her Maggie.

Sorry in advance if this is sort of all over the place or in the wrong sub.

Maggie and I were inseparable for most of college. Same major, same friend group, same extracurriculars, etc. I was out of the closet for several years and had a couple of girlfriends over the course of mine and Maggie's friendship. She always seemed to have an issue with my girlfriends and never really liked any of them. To be fair they weren't the best people, but out of everyone in my life Maggie seemed to make the biggest stink about them. Maggie was straight and had slept with several guys during our college years. Back to us being inseparable...we slept with a few of the same guys but it was never a source of turmoil and it was something that we often laughed about.

Fast forward to one night when we are out at a bar and Maggie asks if she can makeout with my gf at the time (we'll call her Tessa). I go up to Tessa and tell her about Maggie's request and they do indeed makeout. This continues on and off throughout the night. Tessa and Maggie happen to live in the same apartment building. Super convenient for me having my gf and my best friend under one roof. The day after the bar makeout I go to to Tessa's and we are talking about what happened with Maggie the night before. Tessa told me that Maggie told her that she thought she was bisexual. I shortly after bring this up to Maggie and she is hysterically crying saying that Tessa lied and that she would never say that.

Fast forward again and we have since graduated. We meet up at gathering with all of our friends from college. Maggie and I are supposed to be sharing a bed that night as we have countless times before. We come home from the bars and we're both drunk. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. I'll spare you the details.

It has now been almost 7 years since that night and Maggie hasn't slept with ANYONE since and our friendship has never been the same.

Did I traumatize her? Or is she just closeted? Am I wrong for having slept with her?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: We have talked about this and she dances around the subject. I have tried to talk it through several times. Mutual friends of ours that are looped in and know the story have also said that she refuses to say much about it.

EDIT EDIT: I know I said I'd spare you all the of the details regarding what went down (pun intended) during sex, but it is very important to note that it was consensual for both parties. There was verbal consent basically step-by-step as I knew it was her first time with a girl. For those asking why I care and telling me to move on...friend ""breakups"" fucking suck and I still care about her. I think it is fair to wonder if I adversely impacted her life.  

Also, thank you all for the insight and replies. I have never posted on reddit before and honestly wasn't expecting a response.

"Well, as the title says, me and my then-boyfriend were planning on getting engaged this month, I didn't know exactly when and how he was going to propose but I knew he had gotten a ring and intended to do it in December so we could start wedding planning and discussing budgets from January on. I was already in contact with someone in the bank and a few apartment options because I planned to buy our first home in the next year so we wouldn't need to rent a place once the wedding happened. We had discussed everything and I was just waiting for the big proposal to happen.

Now, of course, since we're here, it all went south... Last month, during a family gathering, I noticed a weird talk between him and some girl and my anxiety got the best of me, so I did what I had never done before and looked through his phone. Thank God I did because I found several conversations with women that he deleted from time to time but left some loose ends that I found. Honestly it would hurt too much to go into detail, but there were very gross sexual texts from him to some girls and he swears it never happened and was just a dumb joke, wich I can't bring myself to believe it's true. Even if it was true, I couldn't trust him anymore and things would never be the same so I broke up with him as soon as this happened.

Bottom line is I'm very much broken, have been drinking and abusing meds since this happened to numb the pain of knowing our dreams together will never happen and none of our moments were 100% true because he was lying to me the whole time. I thought I would never be single again, that this was the real deal and, by now, I would be his fiance, we would be so happy and I had everything I could hope for. It just hurts so much to deal with the fact that all of those things aren't going to happen and I honestly wish I would just die a peaceful death and be done with all of this... I know it seems dramatic but my life has always been so difficult, I've fought anxiety and depression since I was a teen and everyone I've loved romantically has been a huge ass to me. My biggest dream has always been to get married and start a family and since this happened it's getting harder and harder to believe this is even possible for me. 

I have only kept going and gotten out of bed everyday since this happened because of my parents and siblings. If I had no one else left, I'd rather just step into traffic and never have to trust anyone again because over and over people tear me apart when I do. My only reason to fight is that they don't deserve this kind of pain and I know they would hurt so much if I did it, so everyday I am struggling to keep breathing for the ones that really matter...

Now, the only thing I ask of you is please don't tell me to forgive him. It's not just that he cheated, but the way it happened was very cruel and there's no turning back.

"Living authentically is not an option when the world finds your existence unpalatable.

"I do want to put up a disclosure, I do love my boyfriend and I don‚Äôt want to leave him, I just needed to vent the entire story out to gather my own thoughts; I think writing helps you find yourself, figure out how you feel and helps you some-what manage things.

My boyfriend and I have been together now for almost a year, and we‚Äôve been through many trials and tribulations. We moved in together fairly shortly after just starting dating, partially due to him living 45 minutes from where I lived previously with my dad and my step mother and me spending every single night over there and then the other reason was due to my step mother putting all of my things into boxes. She made the excuse saying she was only doing it because she thought she was doing me a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù but I do know that she doesn‚Äôt really like me or my brothers due to her own issues. Prior to me moving in, my boyfriend and I have talked about finances. I do want to mention, he had a house prior to meeting me and he does have a very good paying job. I do make drastically less than he does. I‚Äôm also hourly and he is salary, so if I get sick and I don‚Äôt go to work I miss out on money. I was sick a lot at the beginning of our relationship also admittedly. So if I miss, then I‚Äôm kind of SOL on money for that week. My boyfriend and I came to terms that I can pay him 150$‚Äôs per week. This also had left things very tight for me, and he knew this. I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to pay my way either, it was never like that‚Ä¶ but I was scared of moving in officially with him. I was starting to struggle to pay my bills that I had before him, pushing my cell phone bill back a week etc just so I could afford to pay him. Even that was still strenuous for me. I‚Äôm not saying things weren‚Äôt rough for my boyfriend, and that he wasn‚Äôt struggling as well‚Ä¶ A few times I wasn‚Äôt able to pay him my part because I literally just couldn‚Äôt afford it. Though, I do want to mention I had never communicated with him that I was struggling. By now, also any extra money I had I would buy things for the house. We also, at this time, were trying to go on a pre-existing vacation he had planned with his friends prior to even meeting me. I couldn‚Äôt afford it, so my boyfriend had ended up paying for me. He also later on resented me for this, holding it essentially over my head. Even though he'd say that wasn‚Äôt his intention. I started out trying to pay him back for vacation in little spurts, 25$ here 50$ there on top of what I was already paying him. Until I literally could not afford it any longer. So I stopped for about 2 weeks because I almost could not afford gas to get to and from work. I was struggling. At the same time, so was my boyfriend. We were struggling apart. Until he asked to talk and told me to either pay or get out. I was given an ultimatum. I never expected him to pay for me, for anything. I was terrified of losing him because I loved him, so I paid him. I thought things would be okay, but fast forward to the vacation. He was being snarky, rude and honestly I felt I didn‚Äôt fit in with his friends or him the entire trip. This will be explained later. I do also want to mention I get along with one of his friends' wives, we‚Äôre good friends. One night on the trip, at dinner on the trip one of his friends asked him ‚ÄúWould you save your girlfriend or my wife if you had to save one?‚Äù And my boyfriend immediately threw me under the bus, and said his friend's wife. This kind of broke me. His friends would have never said that about their wives. I know I‚Äôm not his wife, but I wanted to be treated better. I think this was the first time I felt like he wasn‚Äôt in my corner, on my side. After the dinner, I explained how I felt and he apologized. The rest of the trip goes okay. When we get back, the night is even okay. The next morning, we go to the store and he‚Äôs grumbly. I had also informed him I could only pay him a portion because I had made a stupid purchase on the trip, that is entirely my fault. At the grocery store, I buy myself a coffee. On the way back home, he‚Äôs more grumbly and making rude comments. I shut down, so I just went and sat outside in the back, and he comes out and tells me that we need to talk. He tells me that he is struggling and that he wants me to pay or leave again, that maybe we need to live apart from each other. We managed to move past this and talked it out and everything. I did find out though that he was planning to leave me before our trip with his friends, that‚Äôs why his friends were treating me differently. It makes me feel like I was lied to, the entire trip he would tell me that he loves me, and we even slept together. I just felt like I couldn‚Äôt trust him anymore. I felt like the slightest thing he‚Äôs going to leave. 

A few months later, he brought up wanting more time for himself, which is okay. It‚Äôs okay to want time for yourself, but what he wanted to take away from me is us going to bed together and sleeping together every night. I wasn‚Äôt okay with that, this was and still is important to me. He also brought up how he‚Äôs the only one making sacrifices essentially. Mind you, I had given up a lot to make him feel comfortable. I had given up a lot of my friends, they were mostly guys though so I understood. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like him talking to a bunch of females either, so I was okay with this. However, a lot of them were friends that I‚Äôve known for 5+ years. He also never downright asked me to give up my friends, but I did. I wanted him to be happy. This was not even the only thing I‚Äôve given up for him. He was asking me to give up another thing, and the only thing I wanted to do was be selfish. Only the thing he wanted me to give up was falling asleep with him at night time. I kind of broke down in tears because I just remembered the past from when the first week of a video game came out and literally that entire week I basically slept alone. I don‚Äôt want that for the rest of my life. He said okay, left it at that, no changes were made to our life. A few weeks later, I was out all day working with my friend and when we were done working I went home and my boyfriend came out of his room and said, ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up with you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not happy.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you so this is hard.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to try with you because I don‚Äôt think this is going to go anywhere so let‚Äôs just move on.‚Äù I just remember completely breaking and begging him to stay.

"Hey all,  


Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I felt like airing my thoughts out somewhere. For a while now, I've been dealing with major depressive disorder. Things got really bad this year, and I had to start taking medication (something I've never had to do). I hit rock bottom, as getting through the day and going to school took up so much of my energy. I pushed away so many important people in my life like my friends and my family. I felt so angry at the world for making me deal with these feelings of hopelessness and abandonment. It took everything in me to put on a brave face every time my parents asked me how I was doing when I visited them. I knew that I couldn't tell them about what I was going through. I didn't want to seem weak to them so I bottled up my feelings for as long as I could until one day I just couldn't do it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I must've cried for a good 5 hours, just letting every feeling I had pushed back for so long consume me. It was at that point that I knew I needed to accept my situation and get the help I needed. I ended up getting connected to a psychiatrist provided by my health insurance and he prescribed me medication and referred me to a therapist. Honestly, he was a godsend. He made me feel understood, like I wasn't crazy, and that my feelings were valid. Sure, that's his job, but I felt like he genuinely cared about me. He made me feel like I was more than just another patient and at the time, I really needed to hear the kind words he said to me. He told me that he believed in me, and that I was going to be a great doctor someday and that he hopes that one day he'll be there to see me get my white coat.

&amp;#x200B;

He also encouraged me to not give up and to keep fighting. For the longest time, I felt like I didn't matter to anyone, that I had no real purpose in this world other than to be miserable. But what he said reminded me of the promise I made to my grandma when she passed from cancer. I told her that no matter how difficult things get, I won't give up and I'll save as many people as I can one day. I'll never forget my interaction with my psychiatrist, and I'll forever be grateful for his empathy and wisdom. Since that appointment, I've been feeling a lot better. I've been pushing myself to keep going and developing healthy habits to continue battling my depression. I just feel like I'm in an overall better place and I know that I will only keep working hard to make sure that I continue feeling this way.

I am relatively young to have gone through what I went through, and was in good health prior.  Before my diagnosis, I loved to go running and was creative.  I feel like all of 2023 I just checked out mentally.  I tried doing the things that previously brought me joy, I would get started and then just quit.  Most people take a cancer diagnosis and use it to make some profound life change, use it as a wake up call.  I didn't, I am in worse health now than I was prior.  I gained a bunch of weight and drink more.  I just feel lost.  I think that I shut down and stopped caring about my health because I didn't want to think about health.  I spent months getting beat down physically, being injected with all kinds of chemicals and barely able to get out of bed.  So, the last thing I want to think about is the state of my body, and I just shut it all out and ignored it.  I also had a profound sense of survivor guilt. There are amazing people who do great things, that die of cancer.  Yet here a am, an average person with no great contribution to society, surviving.

"Just for context. I‚Äôm 32 now. Amab individual.

This is a long story so get ready.

When I was a kid maybe 5 or 6 years old my mom worked really long hours. I was mostly a latchkey kid growing up, but during this time my sister was taking care of me and watching me.

We got along really well aside from the typical sibling rivalry stuff. My memory is pretty fuzzy about this situation but one night my sister wanted to talk to me about something while my mom was at work. She told me she wanted to tell me something that was a secret. She taught me how babies are made and told me the truth. She said when two people really love eachother they have sex. Then she told me she wanted to try it with me because she thinks it‚Äôs really fun.

I won‚Äôt go into further details but it happened to me.

I think it happened multiple times before it stopped. She told me some really gross stuff about her fantasies and told me some other things too. I thought this person loved me so I trusted her. Turns out I was groomed.

She told me not to tell anyone and that mom would get really angry if she found out. I kept that secret.

Her friend also molested me too. It happened twice. Once in a room of people (who didn‚Äôt do anything for some reason) and once when we were alone.

I didn‚Äôt understand that what happened to me was not ok, I was lead to believe it was normal and I what was happening was a good thing. I feel disgusted typing this.

I grew up in a very run down apartment complex and was very poor. Imagine the movie Gummo, that‚Äôs how I lived. I always had dirty shitty clothes cause my mom didn‚Äôt care or couldn‚Äôt afford to get me nice clothes. She never paid attention to me. I was alone a lot because my sister would ‚Äúforget‚Äù to pick me up from school. I started walking home by myself since I was 8 years old. 

When I say this place was fucked. I saw a lot of crazy shit. I used to hangout with these two brothers and one of them tried to molest his sister inside of his house. The neighbors were drug addicts and I used to hangout with their kids, both younger than me. The daughter would always get excited to see me and one day she tried jumping on top of me over and over again. The brother said she was trying to have sex with me. One time I was hanging out with the neighbor kid and an older girl who lived at a house over the fence hopped over it. She pushed me down and started humping me very aggressively (clothes on) and I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

They were all probably abused too.

Dad was never around cause he‚Äôs a dead beat. Hit my mom so we had to leave. I don‚Äôt know him to this day and he never calls.

I tried to tell my mom at age 14 what happened to me and she took me to the police. I wasn‚Äôt ready to talk yet so I said nothing.

I cut my mom off at age 24 cause she wouldn‚Äôt believe me anymore. She still kept this abusive person in her life even though she‚Äôs a gaslighter and manipulator. I confronted her through text when my mom was in the hospital and told her what she did to me, that she took my innocence. She told me I was crazy and needed help, that I‚Äôm a liar, and that she can‚Äôt imagine anyone making up such a gross lie. I told her if she ever talks to me again I‚Äôm going to call the cops and get her kids taken away. She got her kids taken away because she‚Äôs a meth addict.

I was an alcoholic for most of my 20‚Äôs. Drank to escape. I didn‚Äôt know myself and was so lost in depression and trauma. I also think I have autism and ADHD (I never look people in the eyes when I speak to them, I don‚Äôt drive a car cause I‚Äôm scared, and have tons of sensory issues/triggers).

I quit drinking for about 4 years and have gone to therapy for a few months during this time. I learned that I repress my emotions because of the guilt and shame of what happened to me. I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm bothering people and that people won‚Äôt love me if I talk about my trauma. Turns out it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt love myself.

I thought about reporting my sister even to this day. She‚Äôs an awful person that deserves accountability. But I have a niece who‚Äôs 19, autistic and schizophrenic. She was also hurt by someone she was living with. I don‚Äôt know why this is has to happen. It hurts me to know that. I don‚Äôt want to tell her the truth.

I talk to my mom now but our relationship feels distant. I don‚Äôt have any family.

I‚Äôve had relationships that were healthy during this time and most of them know about what has happened to me. I can talk about it sometimes.

I went through a breakup 2 weeks ago where I still really love this person. I just couldn‚Äôt be with them anymore because we were having problems. They were harmed too and it kills me inside.

Makes me really sad that someone I love so much has had this happen to them. Or anyone really. It takes away your innocence, it makes you feel hollow. It makes you feel alone.

Right now I‚Äôm thinking about drinking again. I‚Äôm really depressed and I hate the winter time. I feel really alone and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going backwards in all of the progress I‚Äôve made in my life. I have a lot of family trauma, fear of abandonment, fear of not knowing a lot of my family (on my dads side) because my dad walked out on me, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

"Wanna clarify before anyone assumes something, no, I don‚Äôt consider myself trans. I don‚Äôt identify as trans. And no, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm an ‚Äúegg‚Äù or in denial. I have nothing but respect for the trans community, but I don‚Äôt believe myself to be apart of it. 

I‚Äôm content with being a guy. I identify as a guy. And I‚Äôm fine with living life as a guy. It‚Äôs just that, if I could go back in time and have the power to change things, I feel like I‚Äôd prefer it if I was born a girl instead of a boy.

I walked in and one of my managers stopped me and asked if I was coming in at all this week and I said no. She asked me if I wanted to go around and say goodbye to some of the people I got along with and I told her that I didn't know if I should. 

I went to my locker and my best friend, who still works there, followed me and took the things that I had to leave at work, I went over to one of the tables and spoke to my friend J. 

I told her I was coming to say goodbye and she said that this isn't goodbye, it's see you later. I got a hug off of my friend A, who no one likes apart from me and my stepbrother who also works there was just staring at me as I was talking to my friends. 

He had ruined my reputation at that place so I am thankful to have left it.

"When I was roughly 10 years old I started to watch pornography. Since I started watching so young I was hooked on it. My parents were not (and still aren‚Äôt) tech savvy so they did not monitor my internet usage. I‚Äôve been watching it ever since. Back then when I was younger I would look at pictures and videos of fictional characters around my age. At some point without being aware of it, I began using porn to numb and escape my negative feelings and I think this is why I have been watching it for as long as I have. Now I am 20 years old and I‚Äôm still watching pornography, but I want to quit because it is affecting my mental health greatly. Even after I turned 18 I still looked at hentai with underaged characters and I feel such intense guilt and shame for it that I do not know how to live with myself anymore. I cannot look at myself in the mirror the same way anymore. I know that hentai is not real and they are just drawings and nobody was hurt, but thats besides the point. I am deeply concerned about what this says about me as a person.

Since I‚Äôve been watching porn for years and years, I cannot imagine the extent to how much it has affected my brain. I feel like anytime I see a woman in real life I am instantly reminded of porn and it makes me sick to my stomach. Women are not sexual objects, they are people just like me but I‚Äôve watched porn for so many years that my brain automatically has thoughts about porn because I‚Äôve just seen so much. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish that I had never watched porn in the first place. I feel so unimaginably terrible about my actions because no matter how much I wish that things were different, I did what I did and there is zero way for me to change my past. And it‚Äôs not even like I am a victim; it‚Äôs not like I was wronged and have a good reason to feel bad. I feel like I have fucked up royally to the point of no return. What is concerning me the most is how I view teenagers now in the same way that I view adults, I am immediately reminded of porn when I see women that look similar to the porn that I have watched. I am extremely concerned about what my thoughts say about me as a person, I don‚Äôt want to have these thoughts!!! Being attracted to underaged girls is NOT okay!! I cannnot tell if I am attracted or if I am just being reminded of porn because of how much I have watched but either way I feel deeply betrayed by myself. I feel like I am a horrible person. To be clear I would NEVER hurt anyone underaged because that is just truly an evil thing to do. But the fact that I am having these thoughts about teenagers when I am 20 years old is freaking me out. I think people who are attracted to minors are horrible people and now I fear that I might be one of those people.

I think the fact that I feel so bad about this tells me that I might still be a good person but I still cannot get over the gravity of my actions. I don‚Äôt want to have these thoughts anymore!! I want to view teenagers as they are; teenagers, not sexual objects. I can‚Äôt tell if I am actually attracted to them or if these thoughts are the product of watching porn for years and years, and the uncertainty is eating me alive. I don‚Äôt want to be a pedophile. I have no idea if i am blowing this entire thing out of proportion but its fucking freaking me out. I would like to think that this is all just because I‚Äôve watched so much porn and my brain has strengthened the connection between seeing women and then seeing them as sexual objects, and aside from that I am actually still a good person and if i quit watching porn my thoughts will go back to normal. I don‚Äôt know if I am the only one who is going through this, I don‚Äôt know if im crazy. I just feel so, so defeated and incredibly ashamed of myself. I have thought about killing myself but I just can‚Äôt, it would bring too much sorrow to my friends and family and I cant put them through that. But I don‚Äôt know what else I am supposed to do. Except to quit porn, that much is obvious. I don‚Äôt know how I am supposed to forgive myself for this, or even if I should. What I do know is that I miss my innocence. I miss seeing myself as a good person with a good heart and a strong moral compass.

"This poem is the only way I could explain what I'm feeling. Because what I'm  going through is a very basic cliche thing that many people have experienced, but I feel so alone and so sad. 

My three year relationship ended a couple weeks ago for reasons I nor my boyfriend could control. It was long distance and we rarely saw each other and it would be a miracle for us to bring it to the next step, since we live in two different countries and aren't even financially independent and not even done with college, blah blah. 

But we both agreed that if we move on, this would be the best that we've ever experienced. I've never felt love for someone like that nor did I feel more loved than that and I can't imagine its possible to have something better-- we were so compatible he made me believe in soulmates. and to think that I'll never experience his warmth again depresses me. I don't see myself moving on at all. This is not my first breakup. I've had one serious relationship and couple non serious, pretty much situationships. But this guy impacted me and changed me and I changed him too. We watched each other grow and change into better people.

I don't wana move on because it simply won't be fair to the next person. I compare him to everyone else and he really is perfect for me in every aspect. And I know all the advice many people would give and all the comments because that's what I always tell myself but it's just depressing as hell. 

I have no friends. I don't even feel an emotional attachment to anyone. I wish I had a best friend since this breakup took that away too. I have a huge family but im the oldest and nobody can really support me emotionally since I closed myself off to everyone. I'm the only person who comforts me. My only hope is to pray to God to give me patience and hope. But sometimes I get paralyzed and cant function. It feels like three years of goodness went down the drain.

I'm not doing relationships anymore. I've experienced the best and the worst of them, and that's enough for me. I can talk abt my devastation for so long but what's the point?

I‚Äôve known her about four years and while she‚Äôs done some questionable things to other people for her own gain, she‚Äôs always been fairly nice to me. She is very vain. 

Last week, I went on Instagram and saw a post she‚Äôd made saying that needed a job. I asked her what happened, and she said that she‚Äôd lost her job. This isn‚Äôt the first time that she‚Äôs been suddenly out of work; she tends to burn bridges everywhere she goes. 

Anyway, long story short, I helped her search jobs on Indeed, Google, etc and made some really helpful suggestions. She said she needed cash right away, so I suggested some restaurants to apply to. This took a couple of days. She was very thankful as it was clear that she was having a really hard time. As a side note, she never once asked me about myself. 

Well, today I saw a new post of her wearing some flashy outfit and bragging about how obsessed she is with designer clothes. Hair and nails freshly done. She had this very smug look on her face. I don‚Äôt know why, but that really pissed me off.

"Ok so I just wanted to recap the past couple months because so much shit has happened and I want to get it off my chest so this might be a long one(btw this is not to make my ex look bad or to say anything about her character, it takes both parties to create issues in a relationship so I don‚Äôt hold anything against her)

So come august 2023, I (20m) and my ex (20f) had been living together in an apartment for about a year &amp; 1/2 and had been dating for nearly three years. I was madly in love at the time and although we had our differences, I cared deeply for her and wanted to continue our relationship despite some difficulties. We would fight to the point of screaming so much  I would have to walk out but we shared many moments of joy on top of the frustration and I loved her for all of it. As the days passed after summer, it felt as if we were growing apart, either because of different life directions and/or just a matter of time of realizing that maybe we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúmeant to be‚Äù and that was one of the hardest parts seeing her slowly becoming  distant from me. I admit to making a ton of mistakes in our relationship but there was nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do for her. It was one day we were just discussing the plans for the next lease or apt building we might want and she said that she wanted to move back in with her mother, she told me that she didn‚Äôt want to live with me anymore bc I was a slob and she didn‚Äôt like living with a man. I understood why and promised to change my bad habits. I‚Äôm not the best at quick changes but I really meant it when I said I was getting better so that we could mend what was slipping away in front of me. She didn‚Äôt believe me and still continued to want to live with her mom. I said that I didn‚Äôt want to stay together if she wanted to move back in with her parents, mostly because if we had already lived together for a Year and a half and we weren‚Äôt able to get along then maybe it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. (And throughout I thought about every option and staying together I just wasn‚Äôt sure what to do because I didn‚Äôt want to lose her which ended up making her leave) our lease ‚Äúended‚Äù in a month so I thought that it would be a good amount of time to think about our next steps but she still was deadest on moving out. Then after a conversation that was not particularly productive I left to go to work and didn‚Äôt not leave on good terms. The whole work day I felt sick to me stomach and I was texting her the whole time to responses that made me more and more worried. My shift ended and she had said she was ‚Äústaying the night with her mom‚Äù of course I didn‚Äôt believe this because her location was off and she wouldn‚Äôt text me very much at all. I was worried sick about where she could be, call me crazy but I knew something was up so I drive to her parents house only to find her car was not there. I knew exactly what she was doing but I didn‚Äôt want to believe it, I tried calling so many times in the middle of the night only to a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy can‚Äôt call rn‚Äù she returned that night and wouldn‚Äôt even let me touch her in the same bed I slept in. A week passed and she felt so guilty she confessed that she had slept with some random tinder guy that night and I was furious. Never had I felt that way and hopefully never again, it was such a horrible feeling of rage and betrayal. I got as much of my stuff as I could and moved out as soon as she told me. We still texted and I missed her but I couldn‚Äôt see her after she cheated, she said she missed me and that she was sorry and she wanted to keep dating but I couldn‚Äôt stand to even talk to much less keep the relationship going. I was devastated for months, I had never been cheated on before this so I really couldn‚Äôt control how I felt.  

After almost three years with someone, they leave this piece with you that creates a hole when they leave, you change a lot with them and become a different person. It took a while to try and get over it but it just stings so much, cutting ties with her helped though and after taking with friends and family, I realized that she wasn‚Äôt as good to me as I thought. During the relationship she would isolate me from my friends but I didn‚Äôt want to admit that, this and a bunch of other shit I don‚Äôt want to get into made me think less of what we had. Being broken up I gathered more self worth from people who really cared about. I thought that it was just meant to be and I would roll with what comes my way. 
Coming up to October I had been meeting new people and taking more chances improving my outlook. I saw a insta post about 13$ tattoos on Friday the 13th at a local shop. Of course a deal so good I couldn‚Äôt pass it up so I go there on that day and there is a massive line of people outside the shop, with everyone getting up to three tattoos I was waiting all day to get inside. After 6 hours i was finally let inside and sat down, and sitting across from me was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I had seen her in the line as she pulled up but didn‚Äôt have the courage to say anythign. We locked eyes and then she started talking to me ‚Äúare you single‚Äù ‚Äúfrom around here‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù They say it‚Äôs an unlucky day but god damn I should‚Äôve bought a lottery ticket. We had sparks unlike any person I‚Äôve ever met and it sounds cliche but it was love at first sight. Ever day after that we talked and called and saw eachother, this girl was absolutely amazing and as gorgeous as an angel on top of it. We are still talking and dating to this day and I will never be happier that my ex cheated on me. Not to compare but this new love was everything I ever wanted in a relationship and everything my exs couldn‚Äôt give me and she‚Äôs my same age!!!!

"I have a mental illness (diagnosed by a psychiatrist) that causes me severe trust issues and fear of rejection. It prevents me from forming close relationships. It's ironic, but I don't really have an issue with talking to people. I'm fairly decent in small-talk, and I get along fine with most of my peers at college. The problem is, they're just that: ""school friends"". I only meet them at college and never go with them anywhere else. They seem to be perfectly okay with this state, probably because they already have their own social lives. I struggle to develop friendships from acquaintances. I think my every attempt to invite them somewhere would come off as desperate and begging for their company.

I'm not part of any other community outside of college, partly because the vicious cycle of ""How am I supposed to go to a new place all alone, where everyone goes with a friend, or all of them are already an established friend group in the first place?"" Maybe an extremely confident and charismatic person would be able to pull that off, but I'm not that person.

Despite not having a friend group, I crave the company of others very much. Thankfully I have a half-sister who is 3 years older than me and a cousin who is 2 years younger. I get along with them very well, we like hanging out with each other. They're the only people that I can invite to the movies or a cafeteria because I don't have to worry that they'll reject me due to not liking me as a person.

I live with our mom, and my sister did too, up until this point. We were quite close in our entire lives. Even though she has her own friend group that I'm not part of, she gladly makes time to hang out with me (and our cousin). We can share our personal problems with each other. We go out together fairly regularly, we discuss and joke about all sorts of things. I can count on her in the case of an emergency. In a nutshell, she is a real friend.

Next week she's going to move abroad due to her job. I know that we can still call, videochat, and sometimes visit each other, but it clearly won't be the same. I never complained about this, because I respect that it's her life and decision, but it still pains me. She told me that she'll miss me, but I know that not to the same extent as I'll miss her. She's a social butterly who'll stand her ground, no matter where she goes. But my social life will be a complete dead end, apart from the occasions when I can meet my cousin (she lives in a different town).

I'm so afraid of social isolation, and everyday I'm getting angrier with myself for not being able to break out of it. I should move on with my life, make other friends and seek out a social life of my own. But it feels too overwhelming, which makes me feel even worse, because having a social life shouldn't be this impossible task, it's a non-issue for most poeple.

"I consider this person an aquaintaince, more accurately, a colleague because we work together, not friends. I've been constantly put down by him for the past few months for the dumbest reasons, and it's seriously affecting my mood when I'm in the office, and I find myself pissed off when I remember the things he had said about me. To put it simply, our work is relatively easy, we just sit at our desks until we're needed, and we're mostly just doing our own things. This person had only recently moved right next to me, and we didn't interact at all before he did, and now that we sit right next to each other, I just only realised how toxic he is since I'm right next to him, and because I have the Mr nice guy personality, I tried to accommodate and tolerate him as much as I can, but it's really too much. 

I'll write about certain incidents that happened, it would be pretty long since I'm being as descriptive as I can.

He constantly puts me down for things that I do not know about. For example, he loves video games, and I don't, I don't play a lot of games, and even if I do, it's casual. He'd make random game references and get offended when I don't get them. He's called me doofus, uncultured, that I suck, to name a few simply because of that. There are times when I voiced out and said for the 10000th time that I don't play these games, and he'd go like, ""you don't have to play it to know it"", or, ""I didn't play those games but even I know it"". It gets more and more ridiculous, I don't know details about world war 2, weapony, cars, stuff like that, and he gets offended, and calls me those names as well. Every single time he points out how dumb I am for not knowing stuff that he knows, and it pisses me off because I do not have to know these things, it's called a preference for a reason, but he doesn't care and continues doing so anyways. Even if it turns out that I happen to  know something he knows, he would still get mad and say that ""it's common sense and I'm not special"". I'm going to call it as it is, that he has an extreme superiority complex, he doesn't take in any other's opinions, and insist his own the truth. Another example is  movie preferences, and he'll make a big deal out of it. For context, he loves anime, and absolutely looks down on live action content, whereas I watch both and don't have a preference. He always points out when I'm watching something that's not anime on how inferior it is to the content he watches. Even if it's something that he's never watched, as long as it's anime, he will say it's better, it's superficial and annoying, because I didn't even ask. (For example, James Cameron's Avatar &amp; Avatar And The Last Airbender, it's not even anime but as long as it's animated, he will say it's better even though he has never watched either of them) Even when I am watching an anime, I would prefer to watch it subbed, but he kept mocking the Japanese language simply because he doesn't understand it. And he does this on an almost daily basis. At one point, he recommended me a few movies to watch, and I agreed because why not, I'm not picky when it comes to movies since I don't take in other's opinions or online ratings before watching them, and he gets absolutely furious when I don't like what he likes, and even when I do like what he recommended me, he would say that he's the bigger fan regardless even though I don't think it has to be a competition. It just seems that no matter what, you can't please him, and I do not want to please him, but I am just so super annoyed. He went as far to say that people who don't like anime or animated content are stupid because they don't like ""colours and comedic elements"", there was once where I got pissed and just said that people who likes anime doesn't like reality and prefer to be delusional (I don't mean it of course but i was pissed) and he exploded. Oh, for the people who wants to check off lists for the anime stereotypes, he's admitted to being a furry, or he likes that content anyways, and I've seen him watch anime that focuses on body, he mainly likes female protagonist and avoids anime with male protagonists, only watched dub because he finds sub inferior since he can't understand it.

Adding on, I mentioned that he mocks the Japanese language because he doesn't understand it. He does that to other languages too, Chinese and Tamil especially. We have staff who cannot speak English, and he makes fun of them behind their back, when he himself doesn't know a second language either, what's especially more ironic is that he doesn't even know his own mother tongue, and I know his mother tongue more than he did, but he corrected me wrongly on several occasions and I just couldn't be bothered. 

Thirdly, bringing back the point where he has that superiority complex. He's also constantly mocking other people for their appearance. Context: he's extremely skinny, short and is always hunching his back. He's made fun of me for being fat, and blamed it on me. I said the word gym, and he went ""you need it"" and then almost immediately before I could process it, he added on with ""if you didn't say that word I don't have to say it"" like, what the hell kind of blame shifting is that? He also has a peanut allergy, but he mocks another colleague of mine for having a seafood allergy, which is so ironic as well. Oh, and he's also assumed my mother to be fat because I'm fat, yeah, LOL. Disclaimer, I don't get offended at being called fat, I am fat, it's the truth, but to be mocked for it for absolutely no reason is just uncalled for, and there is no justifying it.

Lastly, I have a hearing condition that is not extremely serious, but can affect my hearing at times. Sometimes I hear things incorrectly, and I would immediately ask the person to repeat it after I've mentioned what I've heard, and on several occasions he called me dumb, and the r word for dumb (got striked for writing that) because ""I do it way too often"" like, no shit, my hearing condition doesn't just take a vacation when it feels like it and gives me perfect hearing. He's also said that I need to get my brain checked and examined. Writing this made me realized how much I've tolerated, and on so many occasions I felt like flaring up, and honestly, I'm so close to it, I wouldn't be surprised if I do.",Toxic Co-Worker/Aquaintaince,18m9a7c,1703011820.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m9a7c/toxic_coworkeraquaintaince/,
"I'm a good listener, very supportive and I can be a lot of fun.

But I don't think there is anyone in my life who actually sees me as a person. Someone with their own thoughts and issues and feelings. I am simply there to act as a sounding board and to do favours or entertain.

I had a talk with my Mom a few months ago about this. How alone I feel and like there is no one who makes me feel like a priority and how low my self-esteem is. She told me at the end of it that she was really glad I had opened up. She told me she loved me and wanted to start doing a weekly phone call to ""stay in better touch with how I'm feeling"". She called once. Mostly to talk about what she'd made for her lunches that week and my brother's work schedule.

Last week, my best friend of 15 years and I had a fight. Or I guess a break up. She had a habit of just ignoring me. Not responding for weeks or months at a time. I called her on it before and told her it hurts me. When she did it again this week, it was kind of a last straw and I told her I wasn't interested in a friendship that only goes one way. Her response was essentially, ""I hear you, that sucks, but I am not going to do anything any differently"".

This was very hurtful and upsetting. I saw my mom last week and told her about it. I started to cry. She told me to stop and to focus on trying to have a good day. That was the end of it. No follow ups on how I'm feeling. No texts checking in.

"I try to live my life with environmental sustainability in mind; I am well aware individuals aren‚Äôt the ones capable of making a difference with our climate but still there is a weight on my conscience when I throw out paper towels or end up with excessive amounts of single use plastic packaging from purchases, and so I try to avoid these things. I‚Äôm not going to get into all the problems with the recycling industry in this rant ‚Äî I‚Äôll just say I try to avoid single use materials in any part of my life. I buy almost everything secondhand: clothes, furniture, appliances, tools, hobby things. This eliminates a lot of packaging and allows me to take from waste streams rather than production streams. I buy raw ingredients and make my food from scratch (as well as my pet‚Äôs food). I don‚Äôt own a car. I don‚Äôt have heating/AC (my climate allows for this semi-comfortably). 

But alas! I am poor. Always have been always will be. So there are some unsustainable living practices I cannot escape. I live in a small apartment with traditional plumbing and electricity from the city. I don‚Äôt have a place for a garden and the community gardens have a year long waitlist to get a plot, so I buy all my food.

That means buying most foods wrapped in plastic and giving my money to nasty corporations who operate on exploitation of people and the natural world.

"I've not grown up being used to going out and having my freedom &amp; having fun. I come from a dysfunctional family, I'm the older child &amp; I (23F) still have to live with my parents who function, well, dysfunctionally. It's hard to describe their behaviours because you can't rationally explain their behaviours because much of it doesn't make sense or is just very far gone. 
They're very antisocial people, they have no friends they keep in touch with, hardly connect with family, they're quite boring and actually, they don't know how to have fun. And for some reason, since the both of them are like that and are happy to be that way they, they expect their children also to be that way. My younger brother is to a great extent, very much like that so he is in their good books, as opposed to me who has always been different from them. Because of this I've grown up being the black sheep and they don't accept how I am. 

It's such a huge struggle for me to be allowed my freedom to do things other people my age do. Even ordinary things like going out to meet friends. I have to go through hurdles upon hurdles. It's exhausting. And I have to abide by their rules. For so long I have been fighting for my true freedom to live my own life and not have it controlled by others. But unfortunately I can't yet move out. I would've in a heartbeat if I could afford to. 

Because of the background I've come from, where it's not often that I get to socialise and experience social events etc. and let loose, I honestly feel like I don't know how to. And it's eating at me. Because I worry that I am stunted in this way. And I don't know to what extent exactly. 

During the seldom times I have gone out, much of the time mentally unpleasant for me because I'm not used to it. The thing is, I want to be there so that's not the problem but I struggle to. I may either feel overwhelmed or overstimulated or anxious or irritable and there have been times where I dissociated. So I don't know how to handle myself in these situations and I end up feeling and/or looking uncomfortable/distressed/like I don't want to be there. And what sucks a lot is that it affects my friends when I don't feel okay, which I hate because it's dampening their time too. 
I hate that this is another way where my upbringing and childhood trauma has messed things up for me and the messes my parents made I have to clean. It's just so exhausting. And they don't understand, refuse to listen and accept.

I like to go out and socialise, and have the chance to stay out in the night and have fun. Without having to ask permission , or face interrogations from them before I go out, while I'm out, and after I've come home. When I'm not they call me constantly ordering me to come home soon, asking excessive details, scolding me- these things happen every time I am out and I can't explain jusy how much it ruins my time, my mood, and the vibe. I can't truly let loose and enjoy myself I always have this thing looming over me. Anticipating the time coming closer for me to go home or to receive the calls from my mother. Having to prepare all my answers in my head and keep them ready. I can't really relax and have fun when I'm out because of all these things. I'm just a ball of anxious, unsettled energy when I'm out and that's NOT how i want to be. it just doesn't align with my spirit. but my experiences have made me this way. 

I guess I just wanted to say this here because it's heavy for me to carry around and I think about the repercussions of my experiences a lot and how it's going to shape my life. In fact it haunts me, i feel plagued. So wanted to put this out here because I could really do with a kind voice and some support.

"I'm a 21-year-old college student. I live off campus in an apartment complex with another student. He's the same major as me, and we do have some shared interests. I've been living with him for 4 months. He's a good guy, but tbh I'm kinda bored of him.

While we do talk from time to time, there are times when we're in the kitchen or living room and we don't say anything. It can get really awkward. We don't have any classes and we don't hang out outside of school or the apartment.

Some nights he's up late in his bedroom playing video games and chatting online with his friends. There were a few nights where I'd be asleep in bed and I could hear him yelling and laughing from his room.

Almost every weekend (not every weekend), he either goes home to his parents or goes on a trip with his friends. Sometimes he doesn't tell me he's going out for the weekend. Not that his outings are any of my business, but it feels a bit weird that he doesn't tell me. Also it's like why bother living somewhere if you're not there almost every weekend. Idk if I sound like an ass for saying that, but that's just on my mind. He might be going home less frequently now that he has a job.

"I'm just at my wits end and just not too long ago got off the phone with my brother. He has been having some issues and I've been trying to get him to open up and speak with someone that may be able to help him figure things out. 

Back story is needed. My mom lost custody of me and my two other siblings to our grandmother. The courts at some point did look to have us reunite but decided aginist it after some things came to light. one being her boyfriend at the time of us being taken had molested me. My father who found out apparently tried to kill her by shooting up her house with them in it. Im not saying he was right im just saying i understand. My other brothers suffered abuse too but it's not my place to say and they don't even remember it since they were young. Since then my mom has had 6 more kids with 2 diffrent dads. 
One of the boys dads abused my younger brother who we will call A. A was a 4.0 student until he wasn't. Our grandmother got a chance to speak with him and i happended to hear him say moms boyfriend hits me. Our mom acted like she didnt know. Our grandmother tried to get custody of him from there but our mom disappeared. Later i found out part of the reason she disappeared was because she was trying to stop my grandmother from adopting us. A's dad also went on to abuse the other four kids by the other children's fathers. She went back and forth for years between the two men. At some point our grandmother got too sick and couldn't fight her and had to let a lot of stuff go. Throughout the years the kids were taken on and off by CPS and placed with us or their other grandparents. 

This leads to J. J is a teen and is not in the right head space. Back ground for him is our mom invited to her house a know child molester and let him babysit J who was only maybe 6 at the time. our grandmother was beyound mad when it came out that he touched him. My grandmother was screaming that you knew he molested his sisters why would you leave him there with your baby. sometime later it was stated by our mom that J was making it up because his dad got involved and made him say it was one of the other brothers that did it(J later said he was molested by that cousin and said it happend and thought everyone knew. Our brother was not involved) Not knowing that our mom told everyone his dad,who is  J and A's dad, lied on the cousin and our brother. Throughout J life I wasn't really there since It was advised by a therapist that I don't be around my mother since she tends to make me uncomfortable and I also was diagnosed with PTSD. I've since found out from J that his life sucked.

 More Background on A is needed. A apparently acted as a father to J. J and A's dad was a ahole and abusive to him. From what I was able to gather he talked down to A and made sure he knew he was nothing. Our mother allowed this and even participated. She would bully him and mistreat him also. A ended up trying to separate himself from her a few times but they all failed. i remember to this day begging him not to co sign a car with her because she would screw him over. What she did was worst. She didnt pay the car and filed bankruptcy and didnt tell him. The car loan fell on him and his checks for his family was garnished. Mind you he just had a baby and his gf at the time could not work right away. So they had to  move and he ended up in jail a few times for traffic tickets he couldnt pay. At the end of the day i think he felt like a failure because he lost his job also. Sometime later I get a call that they found him after he commited suicide by hanging. He was discovered by the 2nd oldest.
Before A died my mom moved all the kids to another state 5 hours away and she would leave them there on thier own.she would work up here and claim she was in school down there. I come to find out A would take J with him back to our home state when everyone would leave or when he needed him. A was his dad. 

 My thoughts are all over the place but I say all this to say A was a big part of J life. And when A died I'm pretty sure something happend to J. From what I heard he shut down and started having thoughts of harming himself. It got so bad that the other brothers reached out to me and the other brother I was raised with to ask for help and  we ened up getting all of them back up here after harassing our mother.  Typing this out makes me dislike her more. To this day I remember A's goofy smile that made me laugh.  We cant get that back. 

J this morning called me crying. He said he wanted to die. I couldn't do anything but talk him down and wait for someone ro pick him up while we were on the phone. He just was crying and saying its not going to get better and me trying to tell him it would. Ive been also trying to get him in therapy. Our mother comes up with every excuse of why its not possable right now. I went through the work of getting the resources for her ro help him more than once. Shes just a lazy b who only knows how to lay on her back and have kids and suck d. She really made me upset. I cant make him go now either bacause no matter what i say its considered getting too involved. I cant take him in because she wont allow it. I really love him but i cant stand her ass. I resent her posting her dead sons all on face book but wont lift a fingerto help the ones alive. I feel like my hands are tied because no one will acknowledge its more going on then what people want to talk about. 

He told me how she use to bring men home and have loud sex so they could hear them. Or how she would have him sit in the car while someone had sex with her in the house she would take him too. she would take him to the booty calls and have him sit in the car. how fucked up is that. Why would she do it. She brags about drinking while carrying us. He said it's messed up that she thinks it's funny. And it is. To hear how she stole a burger out A's hand when she came home drunk after he said he just got it and to please not eat it  And to hear J explain she ate it in his face and stared at him. Mind you she didnt always have food in the house. He turned around and hit her. I don't agree with it but I feel it. You never suppose to hit your mother but man was she even acting like one. Then to hear how his dad tries to jump him until one day A realized he wasn't a kid no more and could fight back. This really is messing with me. 

I've signed him up for therapy to see if I can get him to just have a few appointments with them. I won't tell her anything. I just dont want amother sibling in the ground before his time.

"Throughout my short professional career as an IT guy i have managed to progress fairly quickly to a senior sys admin role, it pays great and has great flexibility. I realised early on after university that I always struggle to make friendships in a professional environment because of various reasons. We're either on completely different wavelengths in our attitudes towards work, or I'm generally not interested in them as people and their chat is draining to me. Now don't get me wrong, outside of work I have lots of friends and close friends, and generally never had an issue with making friends throughout my life, it just seems that inside the work environment I sense something within others that turns me off the idea of socialising with them. 

Some things I often sense, using conversation as a way to attempt to appear superior in the company, leeching something from me, attempting to act like something in order to keep up face with others, it's just generally mind boggling and I'm not sure if it's my issue, or if I'm simply a guy that goes to work to work and get paid.  I have no interest in sucking up to the higher ups, or talking about hair appointments and the issues you have with your partner...

I do have friends in work, but these are very few and I will talk to them about things we're interested in, but with others I just have no drive to engage.

I‚Äôm not quite sure what‚Äôs wrong with me. I had a very bad breakup with my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years. She caused me and my best friend since late 2017 to have a falling out and I lost contact with all of my friends from high school as a result. About 5 1/2 months later, I met a girl on facebook dating. She isn‚Äôt as pretty as my ex in some ways but is in others. It‚Äôs hard to explain. My new girlfriend is a sweetheart, she watches anime with me, plays video games with me, and is pretty much down for whatever. Her parents let her stay at my place for the weekend because she lives 2 hours away. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the drive, the fact that she‚Äôs further behind in life than my ex‚Ä¶ but for some reason.. I am just not happy. But I am seriously questioning myself. There were times I wasn‚Äôt happy with my ex but‚Ä¶ it was never like this. I genuinely looked forward to seeing them every time. I don‚Äôt feel the same with this girl. I feel like it may be that I can‚Äôt feel that way right now because of the post break up pain. I don‚Äôt want to be single again. I really like my new girlfriend and I care about her, but I don‚Äôt feel the same type of love I did for my ex. 

I‚Äôm not sure if another person would make me feel different. But I don‚Äôt want to break this girl‚Äôs heart in order to find out. Plus finding a girlfriend these days is super hard. I feel like I should just force myself to be happy. I went from dating someone who was 15 mins away. Knew me since high school, we grew up together.. to dating someone who moved to this country in March. It‚Äôs hard to replace that. I feel annoyed at myself. So many guys want what I have, a decent car, a job that can pay the bills, and a nice girlfriend. Yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not happy. I just keep wishing that time can accelerate and I become old fast so this nightmare can all be over. I think about the afterlife a lot, if I‚Äôll get a chance to start over with the same souls. Make things better, but the reality is that even if that were true. I‚Äôm only 22 and I have a whole life ahead, yet I have no idea how I‚Äôll be happy all these decades.

"I am 20 years old and I‚Äôm currently 20 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I work at a major retail store (not too comfortable saying which one in case this post is found and I end up getting in even more trouble) in the ‚Äòclothing‚Äô department. I have worked at this location for about a year and 3 months now, and originally I worked as a cashier. I ended up moving to my current department because of abuse of power from a specific ‚Äòmanager‚Äô which included said manager attempting to get me terminated nearly every day and when that failed, specifically singling me out and moving me between tasks for no reason other than to cause me to be upset.

Things were peaceful for a while, until that manager came over to my current area. Not too long after that move was made, I became pregnant. I waited a little bit and then made it public information to the rest of the associates, and in turn, to all of management.

But ever since my pregnancy was made public, I have been targeted. I was pulled off of a task that had been personally assigned to me because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt grasping it‚Äù immediately after my pregnancy was made public, and every single instance that could be deemed as ‚Äòinsubordination‚Äô (I have never ever refused to do a task that has been assigned to me or made any comments or gestures that could be considered attitude, but my managers have decided to claim that I have regardless so that I face disciplinary action) has been turned into ‚Äòpersonal discussions‚Äô involving my management.
 When I was 19 weeks, I was pulled into an office and screamed at for over 20 minutes about my ‚Äòattitude‚Äô even though I hadn‚Äôt said anything to anybody I‚Äôm my management or to my fellow associates. During that ‚Äòpersonal discussion‚Äô a threat was made by the specific manager that has been targeting me that she would have enough ‚Äòpersonal discussions‚Äô with me that I eventually get fired. I reported this instance a few days later, and ever since that report, things have gotten worse.
Every day that I come in, more and more tasks are piled onto my workload and my workload alone. There will be other associates on the clock and available, yet I will be the only one assigned to them. The only time that these tasks are assigned to a different associate is when I am pulled to a different department and I am physically incapable of completing the tasks in a ‚Äòtimely‚Äô manner.

Im a bit afraid to raise this issue with upper management, as the last time that I raised concerned about being singled out (when I was still a cashier) it was reported back to that manager and I was pulled into the office and screamed at again.

I dread coming in every single day, and I have barely felt a moment without stress in weeks.

"I (20M) just wanna start this off by stating that she (20F) hasn‚Äôt done anything intentionally wrong or with a malicious intent, at least from my perspective. She really is nice, sweet and just all around caring for those in her life, and I try to be that way too. Recently though, it feels like I‚Äôve been drifting apart from her in terms of how I view our friendship. I don‚Äôt want to use her real name so I‚Äôll just be calling her ‚ÄòSarah.‚Äô

Now, Sarah and I have technically known eachother since Kindergarten, but she left our elementary school around Grade 2, so we never knew eachother much back then, and we weren‚Äôt really friends. Skipping forward to highschool, we start becoming closer and establish a friendship with one another around Grade 10. We would hangout lots and shared many of the same classes together, such as Drama.

Anyways, most of the things that began to arise and that I started having trouble dealing with started this year. Beginning in June, Sarah came over (I would invite her) and hangout every Friday. Around August, I was beginning to feel a bit burnt out but, at the risk of sounding rude, I didn‚Äôt say anything. It was also around this time that she began making me more uncomfortable in other ways (knocking over drinks, making a mess while eating), and a lot of the things that once brought us closer together now just make me uncomfortable.

An example of this is, when we were in highschool and in drama class, we would often have fake fights with one another to practice our acting in a play we were both in. Even outside of drama class, we would still do this from time to time as a way of just having fun. Now though, whenever she says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fight!,‚Äù and raises her fists, I don‚Äôt even feel a hint of eagerness to engage / take part, rather, I just feel annoyed. When I respond with ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo thanks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt take that as a sign to stop.

Another thing that‚Äôs been bothering me lately is how she puts words in my mouth and tells me I‚Äôve said something when I really haven‚Äôt. Just a few days ago, we were hanging out at a mutual friends of ours (Jennifer‚Äôs) house watching SpongeBob while also hanging out with another friend, Casey. Sarah then suddenly mentioned to us that earlier in the day when we were hanging out, she said I had say to her that she ‚Äúlooked like a rat‚Äù and pointed to a picture on Jennifer‚Äôs wall, which I don‚Äôt at all remembering doing. While we were all smoking marijuana at the time, I have a fairly high tolerance, and I feel like I would have also remembered if I said that or not. There have also been other times in the past where she has said that I‚Äôve said something when I don‚Äôt at all remember saying that thing or I am absolutely certain I did NOT say that. 

Jennifer isn‚Äôt without her own thoughts on this either. While we were at her house, Sarah was late to our hangout by about 3-4 hours, and while she does live in the city (which is about 15-20 minutes away), Sarah is consistently always late whenever it comes to hanging out, either in groups or one on one. I know that shouldn‚Äôt even be a pet peeve of mine, but it just feels inconsiderate when we plan something and then she arrives hours after we initially scheduled it, and then chalks it up to ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just how my family is.‚Äù 

Another thing that happened while we were at Jennifer‚Äôs house that made Jennifer somewhat irritated is that Sarah had knocked over a coke can onto Jennifer‚Äôs floor, made a mess with Timbits in Jennifer‚Äôs bed, and also made a bit of a mess in Jennifer‚Äôs garage while eating (she cleaned most of that up though). When it was time for Sarah and I to leave Jennifer‚Äôs house around 8:30PM and go our separate ways (for context we were all hanging out since about 2:00PM), I texted my parents and got a ride from them. Sarah though, who had texted her ride to come pick her up around 8:30pm at 6:00pm, fell asleep right afterwards in Jennifer‚Äôs bed and then didn‚Äôt check her phone until 8:30pm, to which she then told Jennifer that her ride would be 40 minutes late, making Jennifer visibly upset while Sarah went back to sleep. Sarah has also done this before when it‚Äôs just us two hanging out and Jennifer isn‚Äôt around. 

Something else that bothers me when Sarah and I hangout is how she sometimes will only want to talk to me / be focused on me whenever we are talking in group settings. When we were hanging out at Jennifer‚Äôs house and chilling in Jennifer‚Äôs garage, Casey was talking about something to all of us that I was trying to pay attention to / focus on. Sarah though kept trying to just talk to me and was only looking / directing her attention at me for much of the time we were all sitting in the garage together. Later when we were in the garage, Jennifer was talking about some renovations she‚Äôs been planning for her bedroom, and I was trying to listen. Sarah kept talking to me though / kept trying to bring up a new conversation while I was trying to just focus on Jennifer and hear what she was saying. Sarah then asked in front of everyone if ‚ÄúI was okay‚Äù to which I got kind of annoyed and said I was just trying to listen to Jennifer talk about her room. Also a few weeks ago ago, Jennifer came over to my house while Sarah was here so we could all hangout. We were outside talking for awhile with my sister, Emily (23F), and throughout most of our conversations, I could always see Sarah looking at just me from the corner of my eye, which made me super uncomfortable. I have autism and have trouble with making eye contact sometimes, which she is aware of. During that same conversation, she came a little too close to me and was still not breaking any sort of eye contact, so I just said I was cold and walked to a different part of the yard and continued talking with everyone. At one point she asked in front of Emily and Jennifer if I ‚Äúneeded a hug,‚Äù while felt kind of demeaning, even if she didn‚Äôt mean for it to come across that way. I didn‚Äôt bring my feelings on that situation up with her because I feel like I‚Äôm just being a weirdo for even caring about this. 

One final specific thing I want to talk about is her lack of basic manners. Whenever we hangout, I can always expect a big burp or belch to be let out right beside me at some point throughout the night. I know that shouldn‚Äôt even be something I‚Äôm annoyed by but it is. Whenever I‚Äôve brought this up with her, she says that she has to burp out loud or she‚Äôll throw up. I also can‚Äôt tell sometimes on whether or not she‚Äôs lying / exaggerating something when explaining something. When at Jennifer‚Äôs house and as we were handing out presents to one another, she said she ‚Äúhad a dream‚Äù about one of the gifts she received. 

Am I overreacting with all of this? Jennifer thinks that I may just be drifting apart from Sarah but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being an asshole about this or not and I would really appreciate some feedback.",I (20M) don‚Äôt really enjoy hanging out with my friend (20F) anymore,18m7ko9,1703007486.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m7ko9/i_20m_dont_really_enjoy_hanging_out_with_my/,

"TW: harassment 

I (14f) have always been close with my younger  sister (5f), but recently she has been acting strangely; ever since she started watching YouTube shorts, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs not an innocent five year old girl, but rather a creepy 60 year old man, I simply don‚Äôt know what to do.

When I was younger, I had always wanted a sibling, it had been my dream and I wouldn‚Äôt stop annoying my parents with one, and I used to always get what I wanted when I was younger, because of always being well behaved and kind. The joy I felt when I first met my sister was indescribable, even if I was far older than her, and would probably not want to play any longer by the time she could, I would still love her with all of my heart. 
But now it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs different, and I can‚Äôt seem to phantom when it happened, it was all normal before, just hugs and kisses, in my family, kissing on the mouth was always platonic, so whenever she did it, I never really minded. But ever since we moved, she started getting out of hand; she once told me to close my eyes and went to the closet, and came out fully naked, however, it wasn‚Äôt too much of a surprise for me, since I very often had to change, and bathe her when my parents didn‚Äôt feel like doing it, but what sent a chill down my spine was when she whispered in my ear something along the lines of ‚ÄúNow that I have taken off my clothes for you, you have to do the same‚Äù. This creeped me out, and I simply said no, I think she assumed that I didn‚Äôt know how intimacy was done, and I felt like jumping off a bridge when I was getting the talk about the birds and the bees with my five year old sister. This, however, is not the only time things like this had happened, she very constantly has tried touching my intimate areas, and it disturbs me a lot, I tell my parents about this but they just tell her to stop and not scold her or give her a talk about it, even. My parents, especially my father, always spoil and believe my sister, my mother is not as extreme as he is, however, I can‚Äôt bare to explain the repulse I felt when my little sister forcefully kissed me while groping my breast as I yelled and pushed her way terrified only for my parents to turn a blind eye at this, many times I‚Äôve ran around the house from my sister who is trying to forcefully kiss me on the lips, or even worse, with tongue. I‚Äôm not truly sure because she‚Äôs never succeeded, the easy it is to get her off of me is the thing that reminds me she is my five year old sister and not an old pervert.

it hurts me that I can‚Äôt avoid her because of how much she needs me, maybe it‚Äôs the things she‚Äôs watching in YouTube, maybe it‚Äôs that maxing digital circus fan content that is corrupting her? Maybe I should tell my parents and hope they do something this time, or maybe it‚Äôs normal and I‚Äôm just overreacting? I‚Äôm backed up in a dead end and I can‚Äôt do more than skip as many years as I can and hope to graduate and escape this misery, I still love my sister, with all of my heart, but I also fear her the most.

"my (24F) ex (27M) and I broke up years ago. we had an incredibly abusive relationship. when we met, I was not doing well mentally - I was severely depressed and him being a nurse and all, almost ‚Äòtook me under his wing‚Äô. he coerced me into a relationship with him, raped me, and tldr, it was not a healthy relationship. when we ended things, he tried to ruin my life by telling all our friends I had slept with him after we were broken up just because he was jealous I was seeing someone else and it got to the point that he was stalking me so I wouldn‚Äôt leave his sight. I had to relocate to another city in order to get away from him. deleted socials, the whole nine. when we broke up, he told me that I *had* to stay with him because he was a nurse and was the only one who could take care of me.

only 2 people in my life know that he raped me, and the extent of how bad things got, but I have always felt tremendous guilt for not speaking up to someone about this because he is a nurse and works for the NHS. I do not believe people like him should hold positions where they are taking care of others. I feel fear every time I think about the possibility that someone is being cared for by him. 

I know some people would strongly disagree, but I have not said anything or raised anything here because I always feared him finding me and where I am.

"I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm hoping to get out of writing this. Maybe i just want to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù it more? 

This probably happened about a year ago. Some backstory‚Äî my half-brother is 16 years older then me. Right now I‚Äôm 22f and he‚Äôs 37. 

Besides some recent unrelated drama, my older brother and I have always been really close. He spent a lot of time with me when i was a baby, child, and teen. He really was always a good older brother up until i turned 19, but that drama is pretty unrelated. 

I mention this because i want it to be known that i grew up with knowing him, and nothing like this had ever happened before. 

One day lots of my family, including my older brother were hanging out at my moms house, just spending time together and the adults drinking. My brother was pretty drunk at this point, nothing new, I‚Äôve been with him while he‚Äôs drunk and gotten drunk with him plenty of times before. He also gets pretty lovey dovey when he drinks, that and annoying i guess. Nothing new either. 

What really caught me off guard is when he hugged me, saying whatever lovey drunk shit, and then proceeds to grab my ass. Not just a grab either, a complete grab, grip, shake, and feel it up. It couldn‚Äôt have lasted more then 10 seconds, and after he let go he said ‚Äúthanks for that‚Äù. And then the night when on like nothing. 

I was frozen when he did it. How do you even react to that? I felt pretty disgusting after i processed what just happened. He had never done anything like that before. And i had never felt like he wanted to do anything like that before. 

I tried to tell myself it was just a quick ass grab, no big deal. But then again, an ass grab from your brother? I just don‚Äôt know what to think. 

I still think about it from time to time, and i feel disgusted each and every time. I don‚Äôt know what i want out of this, maybe someone to just tell me what they think? Was it just a stupid drunk thing?

Edit: 

I know it‚Äôs only been about an hour since i posted this. But i have a question i wanted to add. 

Something that i think about that really makes me feel sick wondering about is if he had been thinking about this before? Could it just have been a last minute impulse grab? Had he been wanting to do that to me before? With what purpose would a brother do that to his sister? I just don‚Äôt understand.

"When I was a teenager, I thought I did not care about our relationship. Oh how surprised I was when I started to care more and more during my late teen years. I‚Äôm 27 now and even though I do not see him and do not talk to him anymore, I still think about him and me quite often. 
I think we were good when I was a kid, though I always have feared him a little.
Then I was 8 and my sister was born. I remember when my family got back from the hospital, I was not invited to spend time together. Instead, I was told by him to go wash the dishes.
When I entered early adolescence, my family started going to nudist beaches. I was uncomfortable since he would walk around naked and some passerbys would say something about us. I still don‚Äôt know how I feel about it and if it was okay or not.
We started talking less and did not spend time together. 
When I was 13 or 14, I went to an volunteer camp. I accidentally used up all of my phones data and the bill was quite high. After I came back, he did not say anything. Instead, he has sent me emails warning me that I have to pay the bill. I was a teenager, I did not read emails. On the last day, he started threatening me that if I dont pay the bill, all of the family wont be able to use their phones. It was the first time I heard that I have to pay quite a lot of money and I was terrified for my mom and him not being able to use the phone too. I cried so much I could not talk and he just kept asking me why am I silent and not speaking.
Once I left an empty ice cream box near the PC. He put my stuff, including my phone, into it. Melted residues of icecream got into the phone (charger port, microphone) and ruined it.
We stopped talking. I would get back home from highschool and tell stories in the kitchen. I would hear him closing the door from the noise I made. Later he would even leave the room if I came into it. When I tried to tell him about how I feel, I was angry. I was crying and shouting sometimes even. He told me it was all my fault. But I was just a kid.
When his father died, he stopped working. Would spend all days lying on the sofa. My mother was caring for the family. Once he ran out of money and took 2k euros from my bank account (it was money that I have saved during all of my life, i got it from my grandparents). He did not ask if he could borrow it (I would have borrowed them to him). Eventually I got them back. And then he did exactly the same thing to my sister.
He told me I was angry and scary. That he was scared of me. I was just a freaking kid. Never got into huge trouble. Tried to tip toe around him and not make him mad. Always the first in class. Got into med school and finished it. I could never figure out why he hated me so much. 
I don‚Äôt think we will ever be able to have a relationship. I mourn it. My parents got divorced. I have no idea how he is doing. I tried asking but conversation is not going. He never asked first how I was doing. I dont know how to help him, I have a feeling that he is not doing well.

"I have a shitzu named puppet and since about a year ago he started doing very stance things. He would turn is head at me and then turn it back quickly, almost like a door blowing back and forth in the wind. He would do it mostly at night and unprompted. 

He started making noises like a bulldozer only when he came into my guest room. It got so loud I would have to run into the basement and put pencils in my ears. 

Another weird thing happened was I had a dream about my ex girlfriend who was a blonde model and would work out almost everyday. She left me for another guy who cheated on her anyway. But in the dream we were having sex in my room

Then as we progressed and it got intense roaches started coming out of her you know where. There were probably 150 roaches and the went all over the bed and on my face. She kept going even though I was screaming to stop. I could only hear the intense clasping of her cheeks on my thighs loudly.

Since that dream puppet has been talking to me in bible verses and even recites king Solomon (or who we says that is) he told me that we are in the end of days and that humanity will be awoken to the full truth.

"To start I‚Äôve known my roommate since we were very young and even our parents were friends growing up, throughout middle school and high school we kind of grew apart but was much needed and rekindled our friendship junior to senior year and eventually we moved into college together this past year. I‚Äôve had many little issues living with her but just common things like what chores each of us are supposed to maintain and things like that. Although, I‚Äôve noticed before we moved in together we each had our own vibe and clothing preferences, etc. but now that we have moved in I‚Äôve noticed she started getting things that were very similar to mine or started wearing her hair how I wear my hair which is something she‚Äôs never done before. Recently we had to move back home over break and she had posted pictures in my jacket which was in my own closet at our dorm. When I saw this I was a little shocked because I know I had left that specific jacket in my closet at our dorm and it was pretty far in there and I just feel a little violated. Is this valid? I mean it just makes me wonder what else she may have gone through if mine and made me feel this type of way about her to where I lost a sense of trust within the friendship.",Roommate conflicts,18m6lo6,1703005038.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m6lo6/roommate_conflicts/,

"I just snooped so I'm sensitive right now and I just need to talk about it. It's our two year anniversary today which is definitely making it worse. This isn't a crazy story or anything I just need to get my feelings out and I'm too embarrassed to talk about it with my friends. 

My boyfriend made a bunch of new friends from a class he's taking (we're in college) and he got especially close with one girl in particular. I don't have a problem with this, he told me they were friends so he isn't hiding anything there. What bothers me is they text each other all the time, way more than he texts me. He's very introverted and doesn't talk to a lot of people, so it did stand out when he started texting her all the time. 

It may be all in my head because he's generally kind of nonchalant, but he didn't seem excited about our anniversary either, I have been trying to get him to go out to eat but he says he has to study, which he does and I do too because it's finals week, but I was hoping he could take two hours off to eat dinner with me on our anniversary.

This morning I decided to look at his text messages with her while he was in the shower, which I would never normally do but I felt like I needed to know. They weren't explicit or anything but they were kind of flirty (they talked about sharing alcohol, watching a movie together, made jokes about each other's height) it's at least pretty clear that she doesn't know he has a girlfriend lol

 I don't know if I'm overreacting but I feel awful and I don't know what to say to him about it because I feel bad for reading his messages. Naturally I can't stop crying and I left his apartment without really telling him what was wrong, so now we're in a weird state where I don't know what to say without lying to him. 

I just feel terrible and I don't know what to do.

I had a weekend at a cabin by a lake. It was cozy and calming, but I couldn't ignore a weird sinking sensation in my chest, the same feeling you get when you fall in a dream and wake up sweating. I love going to that lake, I hadn't gone in a year, but the trip was just another reminder of what's missing: genuine feelings. It's like I ran out of happiness, leaving me with this empty, ""it is what it is"" mentality.

Things got bad when I was eight. ""B,"" the narcissistic asshole who used to be my stepparent, came into my life when I was eight, and was in it untill mid-March of last year. They got arrested a few months later for other reasons. There were constant arguments and fistfights with my mom when they were around, which led me to start fantasizing about death at 10. COVID hit after some time, which made me more reserved, and then June last year, I got diagnosed with a breathing condition I can't fix until I'm 21, giving me horrible sleep apnea. I fall asleep while eating, spend days without proper sleep, and completely forget what day it is. I haven't been to school regularly since 4th grade because of it and don't have much friends.

Mom says it's not my words most of the time, it's my tone, but I don't get it. We have similar personalities, though she's a tad more open than I am. I'm not mean on purpose, I try my best to keep in mind that not everyone has the same personality as me, and that they might take things the wrong way,, but it's hard when I've been like this ever since I can remember. I try, I do. I talk to this therapist my mom pushed me to go to once a week. I like her, she's been helping me accept my past. I had been doing better these last few months, but right now, it feels like I'm one bad day from walking to my nearest bridge.

Today, it was Grandma. I got home from my trip to my favorite dish on the table and some decorations. She stayed home from work to do it, and I know it took her a couple hours to make. I chuckled awkwardly, hugged her, said thanks, and told her I'd eat once I changed. I changed and went back to the kitchen, she was gone. I went to her room and found her crying. I didn't react enough, apparently. She said she wanted to be alone, so I left. I took some food and ate in my room since when didn't want to be out anyway. She used to tell me I was cold and heartless when I was younger. I'm not, I'm just tired.

I wish I could feel something, anything. Anger, sadness, hell, even boredom would be an upgrade from constant numbness. I try to have more energy and enthusiasm about simple things, but I can't.

"Hey yall. 

I (30f) was dating a woman seriously for about 4 years. About 2 and half weeks ago, we broke up. We had been fighting a lot more and been generally unhappy. I have to move back to my hometown to care for my sick parents anyway, and it almost felt right to say goodbye now, though I did dream we would move together. 

My emotional disregulation contributed to a lot of unhappiness in our early days. Even though things had massively changed, those early years still caused some of our drama.  So, when we broke it off, i respected it. I knew if she needed to heal, I could respect that. Of course i was so sad. I had this whole life planned with her going forward, but i cant make someone move somewhere they dont want to go. 

Well, cut to a few days ago, she's drunk calling me bawling. Says she loves me, needs me, and wants me in her life. Naturally, I comforted her. And then we set up a date. During this time, i started to feel like we had a chance, a real one, and that it would be different. I, admittedly, got very excited seeing her in my world once again.

Well, during our date she said she wasn't trying to insinuate us getting back together, and that she really only wishes to seek comfort from me. On top of that, she had gone on a date and been intimate with someone new, only a week after our breakup. 

Needless to say, I'm feeling twice as heartbroken as before, much more than the initiate breakup. I feel used, jerked around, only to find out she's been moving on intimately, while I haven't even considered a date because I think it's respectful to an ex to give time after a long relationship. I understand we were broken up and it's not my business what she does with her body. I suppose I just wish she had similar love for me and values. Hearing her be intimate with another feels almost like being cheated on, though I know it's not.

I feel stupid, heartbroken and just wish I had never picked up the phone the other night. I've blocked her on all mediums and I intend to never speak to her again. I didn't want this. Love is a hard game.

We both have pretty bad mental health issues as well as trauma and abuse from past relationships. We don‚Äôt always argue well, but we‚Äôve put a lot of work into it. 90% of our disagreements go well now, but the last ten percent still sucks pretty hard and can get verbally nasty.

I have a significant amount of credit card debt because when I was younger I thought I was going to kill myself before I had to pay it off.

"My mother in law who is staying with us for holidays came back today after having gone shopping with my boyfriend and told him to show me the video she saved on his Instagram to show me. 
The video basically had a girl weighing little bits of cake on a scale which weighs zero on the scale because the bits were so tiny. And then eating it and saying ‚Äúzero‚Äù meaning it was zero weight and zero calories.
I have been struggling this year with my weight and have been using food as a coping mechanism. My body looked great before this year and I was happy. I had finally felt great about myself and had been working so hard to get rid of emotional eating and to try to lose weight using meditation, running, breathing, and even having a psychologist. 
Recently I have been successful to change my eating habits and have been feeling a bit better about myself and loosing weight. I had been weighing everything I eat to stay within the calorie limit and protein limit as well. 
When she showed me the video, all my horrible feelings regarding food and about myself came to the surface and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the joke. I am not sure it is even funny. 
She knows I‚Äôve been struggling to lose weight. She knows I‚Äôve been stress eating. 
Not sure if me being upset is overreacting but I know this has added up on top of her making fun of the things I‚Äôm buying or how much food we have at home.

I am all about making fun of things and laughing together but not on the expense of a family member.
I think both of you know, and especially you Andre, that I have been struggling lately, under a lot of stress and not feeling very good. 
So while I just expect the conversation to end here and I am merely voicing it because I love you both and I don‚Äôt want this to just pass without letting you know how I felt, I do hope that joke in the future would not be about one of us. 
Just wanted to let you both know.‚Äù

",My Mother in Law saved a video on Instagram making fun of my diet and couldn‚Äôt wait to show it to me when she came back home. I am annoyed and hurt,18m51mk,1703001062.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m51mk/my_mother_in_law_saved_a_video_on_instagram/,
"I (25f) have been with my (25m) husband for over six years and we‚Äôve been married since September. Since the beginning of our relationship he has always been sort of a speed demon, example going 90-110 in a 70 or 80-90 in a 55 etc. The very first time we even hung out he went over 60mph on a curvy back road that most of the curves have yellow signs and a warning to go 25, just to put it into perspective. Back then I deemed it because we were so young but now it‚Äôs just terrifying. 

Over the years there has been constant instances where he‚Äôs talked himself out of speeding tickets or almost got into accidents because of said driving. I always complain when I ride with him to the point where he‚Äôs scared me so bad that I‚Äôve cried and even had several nightmares about dying in a car accident because of him. 

 It‚Äôs not just that he drives fast though, he also swerves between cars that are much too close, breaks to late almost every time he stops and even when he was younger he and his friends would even make it appoint to out run, you know, on the curvy back roads where we live. Hell supposedly their was even an instance before I was around that he and his friends went so fast on those roads that when he would break, he literally ate through his breaks to the point he didn‚Äôt even have pads anymore and had to get them changed. 

Because of all this I‚Äôve developed a habit of grabbing the dash, the oh shit handle, and breaking my foot every time I‚Äôm in the car with him. It‚Äôs even bled over into me doing it in the car when other people are driving. My mom is one of the safest drivers I know and I drove her crazy the last time the three of us went to Florida because I was even doing it in the car with her. 

And it isn‚Äôt just that either. There have been instances of road rage; riding bumpers to close because people are driving too slow by his standards, riding up beside people at red lights and even someone getting out of the car and him lifting his pistol at a guy who got out of his car. He didn‚Äôt point it though, just raised it to scare the guy. There‚Äôs even been times when we were arguing about it in the car and he‚Äôd start driving even faster just to scare me.

I‚Äôve begged repeatedly for him to stop, at least twice a week, and even told him I wouldn‚Äôt have kids with him because of it, because I know he‚Äôd do that regardless of them being in the car. He drives like that with me in the car, my mom, his family, and even with some of his friends. Everyone says he‚Äôs a terrible driver and he says he will try to stop, try to get better, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. He says I‚Äôm overreacting most of the time though and again that he‚Äôs better than he once was. But even then it isn‚Äôt good enough especially if we ever want to have kids. He says he‚Äôs just having fun and when he‚Äôs mad it goes from he‚Äôll do better to if he hasn‚Äôt stopped now, why would he? 

My dad says to leave him alone and let him learn his lesson, but what of that lesson is getting me killed, himself killed, or even someone else killed? I don‚Äôt want that but maybe I should leave it alone, I don‚Äôt know. 

So what should I do?",I‚Äôm terrified of my husband‚Äôs driving.,18m4y9t,1703000818.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m4y9t/im_terrified_of_my_husbands_driving/,
"today in class a classmate showed a vid with a woman that was sucking yk, and I instantly recognised it because my boyfriend once showed me the disgusting video that a guy sent him with his boyfriend (the girlfriend didn't know she was being filmed nor that he would send that) and I texted my boyfriend what I saw and he said it was disgusting and that the guy is so dumb, I checked the posts comments and I saw that my boyfriend commented something like ""nasty... with teeth... would go towards the crypt"" (sorry, we aren't from a English speaking country and I do not know how to translate it very well, it was practically making fun of the girl) and I literally got sick to my stomach, I even threw up. I texted him and if any of you are interested in what we talked I'll say it in the comments, and basically at the start he didn't see anything bad with what he did, it hurt me so much I threw up, I felt like the values I thought we shared were just an ilusion. I felt like I didn't know the man I was with for the last year, I was shattered and when I saw him in the hallways I avoided him and he was chasing after me and I left quickly saying I had class, then texted me how much I disrespected him in front of everyone and stuff like that. in the end we talked about it and he apologised saying he sees how funked up it was, but i still can't stop thinking about it and he doesn't want us to keep talking about it.

"My ex friend lets call Josh was my friend from my freshman year. Him and his boyfriend were seniors but hung out with me. By the end of my freshman year Josh and his boyfriend ill call dan had broken up and josh and me were no longer on speaking terms. Josh had abused dan the entire time they were together and he abused me too. He would emotionally manipulate you into doing whatever he wanted. You weren‚Äôt agreeing with his political views? You were the scum of the earth and he wouldnt speak untill you changed your mind. he did alot of stuff like that. And I was obsessed with trying to be like him (the good parts about him) and when he stopped being my friend i was happy at the time because i hated how he treated dan but fast forward over the summer, me and dan are dating and josh has me blocked on everything. Josh found out me and dan were dating and got really really really upset and called dans mom talking about how he was a groomer and a pedofile. I understand that 15 and 18 isnt the best age gap but we were friends for about a year first, his entire family and my entire family knows about him ans i genuinely trust him but thats not what im worried or really talking about.

I was mad at what he was doing but i dont know something was werid inside me i guess.

To the point where we don‚Äôt even talk because they just spent all day sleeping because they don‚Äôt feel well mentally. 

I‚Äôve tried a lot of things like trying to talk to them, trying to get them to go outside for a walk, I‚Äôm okay with them taking their time to rest and encourage them to have alone time. But the thing is they don‚Äôt have the energy to do anything besides just sleep, sleep for 12 hours a day then wake up and do some mindless scrolling and then cook one meal then go back to sleep. I can‚Äôt wake them up because we live separately, I can‚Äôt come over either because they live with their grandparents (we‚Äôre Asians living in Asia so this is pretty common) and their grandparents don‚Äôt really want guests.

"For context I am M22 and my girlfriend is F20, I had never lost it despite having many opportunities (girls in bed ready to go) due to a number of drug addictions and mental health issues giving me problems with keeping aroused in the moment. 
I have done everything else in that respect, given and got head and hand stuff and so on but when it came to actual sex, I always faltered away. I thought this was my life forever.

I met my girlfriend a few months ago and we clicked straight away, I was worried she was going to leave me when I couldn't do the deed, but this time was different, I truly love her deeply and this time I was not only able to go the distance, but oh my god she loved it. We did a few different positions and I lasted almost an hour. Since then we have been at it constantly and I have never felt happier in my whole life. 

When we met I embelished my previous experience because being a virgin at my age is embarrassing and I thought she might not want to be with me if she knew, she hasn't had many previous partners but was in a long term relationship and I didn't want to lose her if I disappointed her, it seems it has all worked out for me because she loves having sex with me and our relationship is truly beautiful so far.

"I was moving back to my hometown and my best friend was also looking to move out her parents house after recently breaking up with her boyfriend. They were serious and talking about marriage before breaking up. We decided to start looking together but I told her I want to live somewhere for a couple years while I finish my studies and look for a job. She led me to believe we were on the same page.

We sign the lease and before we even moved in she said she was thinking about getting married to him in a year. Previously before we signed the lease she told me she blocked him on everything and was ready to move on. I talked to her and she once again led me to believe that this would be a long term agreement. 

We move in and she starts sneaking out to meet up with him. I confront her again and she said she can‚Äôt live her life for me and that she didn‚Äôt take me seriously when I said I wanted something long term. Now, they are getting married. She said she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know they would end up this way.‚Äù I don‚Äôt believe her because this is what she‚Äôs been actively working towards. She also said that it‚Äôs not about me and her and she won‚Äôt put her life on pause for me. She was also upset that she couldn‚Äôt be happy because I was giving her anxiety. But I almost threw up from anxiety that she‚Äôs causing because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do or where I‚Äôm going to go.

On top of this she has been telling mutual friends that I‚Äôm jealous or mad about her relationship. Which is not the case, I‚Äôm mad that she put me in such a serious situation because she didn‚Äôt take me seriously.

She has a big support system and I don‚Äôt, which she knows very well. I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to go and I don‚Äôt have enough money to move again. On top on that she wanted a ‚Äúhome‚Äù when we first moved in so now I have a bunch of furniture that idk what to do with when the lease ends.

"Sorry for the long post.

tl;dr 
My ex(22M) ended things with me(26F) after 9 months, saying fundamentally we are two different people.  I'm a sensitive person, he's a tough one. 

First few months of the relationship, he was amazing, he's a funny guy, empathetic towards my feelings, communicates really well, does all the little things for me to make me happy, he used to cook for me, drop me off to work everyday, pick me up from work everyday, get me flowers, you name it, he did it. He said 'I love you' on top of the Ferris wheel. It was all magical. We moved in way early in the relationship. Even though my gut kept telling me it's tooo fast, I just told myself, it just feels right because he kept saying I know it's too quick but it just feels right(I know I'm easily influenced). He even told his friends that he wants to marry me. 


He had trouble sleeping for years before he met me, so we used to sleep almost every night together because he was able to sleep when I'm around, he said I made him feel safe and secure. I care a lot about people, if they are going through something, I feel like it's my responsibility to make them feel better. He had so many things going on when we met, I made sure I was there for him in his tough times. I did sacrifice things to make time ( he never asked me to but I did because I care about the person). 

Eventually everything got better, he's doing fine, but I started noticing he's getting bit distant. It triggered my anxiety and I kept thinking, may be I did something wrong? Am I not doing enough now? I always communicate, I talked to him multiple times that I'm feeling certain way blah blah blah, is everything okay? He said yes it's nothing. He was holding back and it stopped me from feeling secure and safe. I told myself maybe it's just that the honeymoon phase has ended. My ex is a really funny person, has to joke about everything. He even makes fun of himself when he's having a breakdown. Sometimes his jokes are bit extreme. I did get upset few times and it put him off because he doesn't like to see me upset and he tried to tone it down a little bit. 
(Just the no of jokes has decreased). I got used to them anyway, now I just bruh it off( I will tell myself it's just a joke)He also mentioned that my breakdown kinda put him off and pushed him away.  I did go to therapy and started working on my anxiety, it's still a work in progress.

Well, my therapist said I have anxious attachment style because of my past relationship. - my ex one before this one kept telling me eh, I will be just fine even if you leave, may be I will be sad for two days but I will get on with my life. He had mental health issues and he took his life three years ago. I just made me feel like he wouldn't have done that if he cares about me and what not. I have this weird need to feel secure.

My current ex eventually stopped communicating, me being very observant I can tell if there's any kind of shift in the person's behavior. Whenever I ask him ' you doing okay? Something's bothering you?' he just brushed it off. He stopped doing things we used to do in next month. No walks(apparently I'm too slow, I'm short and I walk really fast. my friends complain about it), no sweet talks, no open communication, it's just like when you flip a switch. No affection or anything of sort, no good morning/ proper bye when leaving to work/no sex/ no dates. I tried to be understanding but it just like I'm living with a roommate who hates me. I started putting in more efforts(nothing crazy, don't want to overwhelm him right? I started doing things instead of expecting him to do), I tried initiating multiple times, if I say good morning, response - whatever, or just some kind of rejection for everything I came up with. 

 I tried communicating with him multiple times how it made me feel, he just went like I'm tired not today, let's talk later. It just made feel more shitty because he's my partner, he supposed to give a shit about my feelings right? Does it not concern him that I'm suffering? Am I too much? Am I overwhelming him? But I'm asking for bare minimum. I'm just asking him to show me some affection which he used to? I asked him to console me when I'm having a bad day? Tough time? I cry easily? He kept saying, I'm too week I need to toughen up. He said he cannot console me, cannot say it's okay, it will be fine because 1. He doesn't know if it's going to be fine 2. He didn't grow with people like me so he doesn't know how to. 

So last week, I made him sit down and told him how everything's making me feel and my needs are not being met. he needs to step up. He agreed, he said he's been slacking off, he will put in efforts but let's talk tomorrow I'm tired now. Next day when I asked him he said I just need some time(week) to think, I need to see how much I have to lose myself inorder to do things you asked me to, if this relationship is even worth it.(I was asking for bare minimum, my heart sunk) but you know I trusted him, he said he will put in efforts right? Well a week later he said it's not gonna work we are just two different people. Even his needs are not being met ( he said that first time ever in 9 months) I'm not psychic. He saw me trying my best and never bothered to talk to me about it ?  Oh and also  he cannot be himself around me because I get upset because of his jokes. I'm too week and can never be with a person like me.

I think I took it okay, I asked me to sit down to have a proper talk listened to him, asked him to give it sometime and work with me this time but he said no so I let go. 

I understand and respect his decision we both were unhappy and miserable. But on the other hand no people are compatible, you need to put in work to make things work. I just feel like he didn't work with me here, he just slowly shut himself and checked out. Easy way out right? A part of me blames myself for being anxious. It's just hard to let go when you are too invested in something, even if you are unhappy.

"So on the 8th of December 2023 I hooked up with a girl (kinda) and gave her oral sex (nothing else happened I just fingered her). At the time she was a week off her period. I have very dry lips and pick them quite regularly so thinking about it now I wonder if I could have gotten HIV from her. We're both virgins btw and I doubt she has ever done a test for stds etc. neither have I.
On Tuesday (the 8th was Friday) I found a cyst in my armpit which I mistook for a swollen lymph node and stressed myself out beyond belief. I wasn't sleeping, eating. I then came down with other symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain however these could have been all stress related. The internet made everything worse so I'm here now at Reddit asking random people about it. It's now the 19th and all my previous symptoms are gone however now I have what I think to be a swollen tonsil and am producing a lot of mucus (with a kinda painful throat). Also I think it have a rash on my penis however I'm not certain yet. To add I've travelled to a tropical country from London so I don't know if these are related. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated to put my mind at ease. Also I've self diagnosed myself with health anxiety.

"WARNING: This is a long, strange vent. 

I know posting here isn't going to get me diagnosed or anything, but I (25M) am seeking out some guidance. 

As anyone can see through my posts here and on my other alt, u/LonelyAndLosing, I've got some *weird* issues and I have no idea what the hell they are. I don't expect anyone to read all of this as it is very long and probably comes off as a bit narcissistic, but I find great comfort in writing down my feelings. In my 25 years of life, this is the best I've ever done in expressing my feelings in writing. I can only hope that someone who is feeling as lost as I am will come across this and finally find someone they can relate to. 

As I write this, I'm feeling pretty calm and I can discuss how I feel, but at my psychiatric evaluation yesterday (the second out of three in total), my mind was in a real disarray, mainly due to being late to the evaluation. If I wake up anxious, it lasts all day long, but at least I have a bit more clarity now. 

But anyways, my neuropsychologist (who is VERY well qualified in her field and a professor of psychology) ruled out ADHD today after extensive testing and, until my third and final appointment in 9 days, I really don't know where I stand. I've been diagnosed with depression, but that's really it. I don't want to ramble on too much, so here's what I'm dealing with: 

As I mentioned, the neuropsych ultimately did not give me a diagnosis of ADHD, but she picked up on how I'd be doing well at a pattern game, but then completely lose track of what I'm doing. This is my real-life struggle, and I find that I take an ""all or nothing at all"" approach to things, with me preferring to give 100% effort in any assigned task. In fact, what I wrote here was the subject of much editing and re-editing. However, my mind just leaves me stranded sometimes, and I fail miserably. Remembering things as they happened used to be a huge struggle, but I've gotten a bit better with age. Still, because of all of this, I am a big procrastinator. 

I subject myself to constant self-sabotage and, in the past, I've felt very sad after achieving certain goals (like getting trade-related qualifications) or guilty (for doing well financially). I have angry impulses triggered by things that sometimes aren't all that serious. In the past, I've punched my car stereo after missing a highway exit, and I've purposely broken my possessions when I'm frustrated, as a way to punish myself. Worst of all, I lash out verbally when annoyed, and feel extreme guilt knowing that I've said something hurtful. These impulses, and my unstable mood, control me. I can have some very intrusive thoughts, and internal voices of self-doubt that often berate me. 

I've built a wall around myself socially as time has went on. As a young child, I was actually pretty outgoing and I'd happily play with other kids at playgrounds (by my parents observations) but I eventually built a wall around myself in a social sense. I wait for others to engage with me first, because I do not want to make the first move and potentially make someone uncomfortable. I've always had this sense that people only interact with me in a patronizing way, and I think back to an incident in middle school where someone tried to covertly tell his friends to laugh at this joke that I told them. He probably didn't think I'd notice, but I certainly did. Did they see something different about me, and decide to put on an act that they really liked me when that wasn't actually the case? Openness, honesty and accountability are all very important to me, and I'd much rather be ignored than looked at as that person who needs special attention, when I really don't do anything to warrant it (or do I)? 

From my experiences of being bullied in school, I developed defense mechanisms. I've always HATED conflict, but I also realize that only the strong survive. 

With this realization, back in elementary (and some of middle) school, I used to fight my bullies, but then it got to the point where I; 1. realized that violence is not the answer, 2. I was getting into too much trouble and on one or two occasions and 3. on rare occasions, thinking someone had done something to me when they most likely didn't. I once hit someone because I could sworn they hit my back as I was walking in the opposite direction. No one backed up what I said, and even though I never got along with this person, I might have hallucinated it happening. Who knows? All I know is that I carry the guilt to this very day. 

As far as friends go, I've had a few over the years but never too many at a time. Plenty of acquaintances, but only a few friends. A few years back, I began putting just a tiny bit more effort into putting myself out there, but then COVID hit... 

As for how I am sexually, well, you can already guess lol. I feel intense attraction but I never really act on it because I fear looking like a ""creep"". Other people's feelings are everything to me. Even when women express interest, I get excessively anxious and¬† and ignore it altogether. However, I enjoy helping people out and I've given people advice for their relationship problems (despite never having my own relationship) and I have provided emotional support for friends and family during tough times. 

In terms of hobbies, I wish I had more. Growing up, I was never allowed to play video games for fear of me ""becoming addicted"", but perhaps that was a good thing. As for sports, I was never an athletically-inclined child to begin with, nor was I signed up for any (Little League or soccer would've been fun though). I was, however, a Boy Scout (which I enjoyed being) and I went to an after school social club for kids, where I got into more fights. I was a very protected child, due to familial childhood trauma and ""the ways of the world"". 

I've always been a big bookworm, and I love to read up on whatever I encounter. Probably due to spending a lot of time with my grandparents growing up (every summer up to the age of 14), I've always had an interest in just about everything from the past (different decades, old music, old movies, etc). I'm also interested in graphic design/drawing, architecture, geography, collecting (radios, books related to my field of work and vinyl), reading about different cultures, politics, philosophy, religion, geneology, cooking, traveling to different places, hiking, cars and cycling. I've attempted to learn different instruments and new languages in the past, despite not really having much success. Interests can feel a bit stale after a while and I often desire to be ""into"" more. I'd probably follow sports more than I do now if I could focus on them (also, growing up, I always heard my parents say that ""watching sports is a waste of time"" so maybe that's why I don't). On a more positive note, I've actually been focused on self-improvement lately, and I actually find going to the gym (when I have time) to very gratifying. 

I do weird things. First off, I am a night owl and have issues waking up on time. Back in school, I used to get into trouble for talking too much (family used to call me ""jabber jaws"" and say that I had ""diarrhea of the mouth""), and I sometimes used to run in the school hallways. One time, I remember folding my homework into a paper airplane and throwing it to the teacher and on another occasion, when I got lost in a park as a child, I told the adults who tried to help me find my mom that I was an alien beamed down from space (like what?). I habitually talk/sing to myself when alone, and the words that come out of my mouth are random at times. Laughter can be hard to control. 

Ever since high school, I feel like I've spent my whole life working, albeit in a well-paying blue-collar field. After four and a half years of working second shift at my job, I switched to third shift and found that it is much better and I'm able to accomplish more when I wake up. However, I have no weekends or holidays off in my field of work, so it really can wear me out. I'm so tired of it all. 

Lastly, there are times in life when I feel genuinely happy, and I should be happy, as I've had a very advantaged life. Sometimes, though rarely, I'll just wake up and feel cheerful. As I mentioned earlier, I have a love of traveling, and visiting new places, especially with family or friends, is always therapeutic. My family and my two pet cats mean everything to me, and I don't know what I'd do without them. Also, sometimes just drinking alcohol can have a huge effect on my mood, and I can go from anxious and depressed to happy and blissful if I drink enough. This however, is a bad coping mechanism. 

Anyways, I've made this a bit too long to read (and I've given myself a headache in the process), but if you made it through this dumpster fire of internal observations, thank you! üôÇ","I've got a bizarre mental health issue, and I don't know what it is...",18m2i0j,1702994315.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m2i0j/ive_got_a_bizarre_mental_health_issue_and_i_dont/,
"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, living together for one. I love him very much and have a lot of admiration and respect for him. But I feel like recently he‚Äôs let all tasks fall to the wayside and lets me do it. If he has something on his to-do list, it also suddenly becomes a part of my to-do list too. I never really do this, I handle my shit, and very rarely ask for him to go out of his way to do something for me, unless I‚Äôm already doing something for the both of us and just need a bit of his help because it requires me being in two places at once, etc.

He‚Äôs a great cook and has cooked from the start of us being together. I never asked him to, he took this initiative upon himself. He also is great at cleaning, except for the trash and dishes, which he admitted he hates doing. I said it‚Äôs ok I have no problem dealing with the trash and dishes since he‚Äôs cooking.

We‚Äôre medical students and our schedules gotten very busy lately so he cooks about once a week and now I do‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶literally everything else. I clean the floors, make breakfast, take out the trash once a day, do the dishes, clean the bathroom, do the laundry, etc. he recently asked me why I don‚Äôt also iron the clothes‚Ä¶..to which i said..i think you can do literally one thing yourself‚Ä¶

Last night he had to study for anatomy and we were in the bed and he was too lazy to get up and get his notebook and books and asked me to get it. I feel like I‚Äôm always getting up and getting his shit and I said no, you‚Äôre literally closer to the door,get it yourself for once. I‚Äôm also the one basically teaching him anatomy because his class is online.

He didn‚Äôt get up. After 30 min I got up and got it. I bought a whiteboard to help me draw and study anatomy, and he started playing music and throwing around the eraser and markers.

I snapped at him and told him to please stop and he called me a nerd. The next morning, he went to the bank to run an errand before anatomy class and forgot his notebook. He called me and begged me to bring it. I was really pissed because it was 9 am and I went to bed at 3 and I was sick and really just wanted to sleep in. He apologized a lot and said it‚Äôs ok he can come back and get it he‚Äôll just be late and I said no it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll bring it.

When he‚Äôs cooking and needs an ingredient from the store, I always am the one who goes to get it. Which is fine because he‚Äôs the one cooking, but I am also picking up all his takeout containers and boxers and socks and water glasses every day. 

Edit: He just texted me saying he‚Äôs so sorry for making me do all this stuff lately and he just got me a present but i really would rather just have him also do stuff in the house lol. I‚Äôm going to tell him tonight when he gives it.

"My(22F) life I grew up being compared to my brother (20M).
I remember when we were at the park and I taught my brother how to play game. My brother ended up beating me and I was taking a break and siting on the bench with my mom when she said ‚Äúhow come you‚Äôre brother does everything better then you, you‚Äôre older then him too‚Äù. I remember how I really liked swimming because I was faster then my brother but my mom saw ONE race where he was faster and then suddenly saying that he swam better. I remember how every time he did something wrong or how I was punished for something he wasn‚Äôt, she would say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs younger then you, he doesnt understand, you need to lead by example‚Äù. I remember how at school when he got in trouble for fighting or had other difficulties, and the teachers would tell her to take my brother to see a therapist, she would smile and nod and when I asked her when is he going to see the doctor, she would say ‚Äúmy son isn‚Äôt crazy‚Äù and ignore it. 

I grew up resenting my brother and being desperate to get my mom‚Äôs approval. We didnt get along and my mom would always blame me when we faught even when it was his. Like how during my middle school graduation we got into a fight and he scratched my face and when I told my mom, she got angry at me for causing problems. I walked across the stage with a bleeding face. There weren‚Äôt any pictures taken that day.

When I became 18 I moved out. My relationship with my brother got better because I realized that my mom was the issue. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we still argue but it‚Äôs not like I HATED him for existing the way I did back then. My brother is on the spectrum and never got treated for it so he grew up without understanding people and lacking social etiquette which then lead to him as an adult not having any friends.

With me out of the house my brother had a ‚Äúrebellious phase‚Äù as in not listening to my mom, sleeping at 5am, not eating. I guess, when I was living there, I tended to follow the rules and he just followed me. My mom tends to nag which annoys my brother causing him to not want to listen, ignoring her, doing things the way he wanted. WHICH THEN, became my problem when my mom blows up my phone asking me to call him and tell him to sleep/eat/etc. when I say ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you tell him, I‚Äôm busy, he‚Äôs not my son, why can‚Äôt you control your son‚Äù. She would play the victim saying that he dosnt care about her he dosnt respect her, I‚Äôm more intimidating,etc.

My brother is seeing a psychiatrist for his issues and she is aware. I guess with me gone, she can see how bad his issues are when she sees how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I am in her eyes, I also have issues probably a lot worse then my brother but it‚Äôs not something visible to her. Not saying that I‚Äôm better then my brother but on paper, being that I have friends, I graduated school and landed a job that is ‚Äúbrag-worthy‚Äù to her, you would think that the golden child is now me but it‚Äôs not the case.

You can only say ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs younger than you‚Äù for so long. It‚Äôs a bit harder to say that when a 2 year age gap isn‚Äôt that much to adults and there the ‚Äúwhen I was his age‚Äù argument.

So now it‚Äôs, ‚Äúhe has issues you know that, he‚Äôs taking his medication, he dosnt understand yet‚Äù but when I hit back with ‚Äúhe needs to learn how to understand, medication isn‚Äôt going magically teach you life skills.‚Äù She goes ‚Äúyou have to help your brother‚Äù.  I tell her that she isn‚Äôt helping him she‚Äôs enabling him like the way she has been his whole life. She can see the how the way she treated us different turned out, but now the excuse ‚Äúhe has issues so you can‚Äôt compare the two, I have higher standards for you since you are doing so well‚Äù. She knows that I also have issues but since it‚Äôs not as visible to her, it‚Äôs not as bad as his right?

Recently my brother and my cousin were helping me move. The thing about my brother is that he just dosnt know how to read the room and just has no social skills. For example, while we were moving, I had to give him very clear instructions like, first move those boxes, then those then those , when it‚Äôs pretty clear what you need to do like when my cousin came and immediately knew to move the items closest to the door and make to path to move things. When my cousin was struggling to carry something my brother would stand and watch him, while I rushed over to help or tell my brother to help him.

My brother accidentally dropped a shelf on my cousins toe and stood there awkwardly instead of apologizing. The next day my cousin went to the doctor to get it bandaged, I asked my brother why didn‚Äôt you go take him to see the doctor, he said ‚Äúhe never asked me to‚Äù. I had to tell him to call my cousin to apologize. 

I told my mom about this and her response is ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do about it, he dosnt understand, he won‚Äôt listen to me, he only listens to you because he‚Äôs only scared of you, you need to teach him‚Äù

The thing is I do want him to learn these things, I want him to be able to find friends on his own, socialize with classmates/coworkers, find relationships, but I‚Äôm the only person that keeps him accountable and I have to be, even though I‚Äôm not his mother, because no one else is and look at how that turned out",Stop making excuses for your son,18m255e,1702993256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m255e/stop_making_excuses_for_your_son/,
"I don't even know how to say this without sounding absolutely pathetic, I surely was not expecting this but it just happened i guess. I think I fell in love with someone i met here online.

"Hello, start this off, I plan to get help after the holidays. Now, this isn‚Äôt a problem I will let persist considering it‚Äôs obvious how much a toll it‚Äôs taking on my mental and others. It‚Äôs started off all as a harmless joke here and there about Hitler, nazism, without me actually believing in that crap. But then I feel into a rabbit hole, all in less than a month.

That wasn‚Äôt even the only thing, no.

I couldn‚Äôt go one day without talking about him, I even keep a photo of him in my gallery I stare at and talk to. It‚Äôs gotten so bad.

"My teacher in grade school had her 60th bday today. I saw it thru an Fb story from my cousin (we‚Äôre not close), with a msg of appreciation of how kind my former teacher was. My former teacher posted a nice smile in the picture, like she had a really good life behind them‚Ä¶ and while i‚Äôm scanning it flashbacks of her memories rushed in a grayscale. All the shameful insults, embarassment gestures and cold glares are still clear as HD to me. I can even hear her mocking voice and the way her lips pursed and smirked as she sees the shame in my classmates‚Äô reaction. She was satisfied. 

Those were terrible memories. Traumatic even. I was only grade three. I remember myself as an honest child, confident, active, and cheerful. I was like a ray of sunshine. There were times where I may be loud because of my energy as a child, but i can listen if you talk to me.

She did not. She scolded me infront of my classmates, embarrased me with my low grades by showing them my records and encouraging them to read my three 60s out loud embarrasing me while I sit crying in my chair.

She told them how slow I was, how bad I was with studying, how I will definitely not be successful in the future because of my behavior and incompetency. She uttered all those words loud with contempt‚Ä¶ to an 8 yr old small child.

Back then, my young self have accepted what she did and took all the blame and understood her ways. She was my role model. As a child, I consider all my teacher as great beings because they‚Äôre smart and kind. They are teaching us with everything they knew. So I accepted her scolding, thinking it was normal. I blamed my self for days. Even as a child, I felt the humiliation.

Unknowingly, it killed the sunshine in me. The playful, confident and cheerful kid died in me after that. I grew up feeling unsure of myself, aloof and easily embarrassed. It affected me whole, academically and even in my family.

I was able to overcome it in college. Now I‚Äôm a registered nurse. I got my license last Nov. 

A part of me wanted to thank her because she was one of the reason why I am who I am today. All the discouragement, public humiliation and insults took me this far. But a part of me also still want to hold on to the little resentment my young self felt. I just couldn‚Äôt forgive her for what she did. I was young, innocent and so little. Does a child deserve to be treated that way?

Ma‚Äôam, I know you can still remember me. You will never forget the child you humiliated. You were proud and satisfied with what you did back then. I hope you can now see how far I‚Äôve become. I hope you still think of me every now and then. I hope your conscience will sometimes wake you up at night and make you regret what you did. 

You broke the child in me. You stole her shine. You gave her memories she could never forget.

"I and my best friend used to be inseparable for sometime. We used to tell each other our past and problems and she supported me the way I wanted to and I believe I had also done the same. I never met her with the intention of falling for her, but at some point I did and I do not regret it. She is a wonderful person and I pray for her after what she told me she has been through. She deserves all happiness in this world. I‚Äôve made mistakes when emotions clouded my judgment and I‚Äôve put my best efforts to make them right because I believe it is worth it.

I think it was obvious to her that I love her and ever since, she‚Äôs been keeping a distance from me. However, considering that I‚Äôve made mistakes before, I always thought I had done something wrong and used to stress myself to sleep thinking what it was this time. It was through a mutual friend I got to know she was actually avoiding me not to lead me on. In fact, the friend even told me she was actually seeing someone and was very much in love with him. I was sad because I wanted to be hers but somewhere I‚Äôm happy that she has found someone for her. But I just wished she respected me enough to be upfront that she was avoiding me, to save me from all those tough nights. Now I might have made another mistake, but I wanted to let her know that I love her before I move on (hopefully.) Today was the last day I could see her before this year ends and told her we need to talk. However we both got busy and didn‚Äôt have enough time to do so. I ended up giving her a letter in which I confessed how I always felt about her and everything I would have told in person. I told her I knew she was avoiding me. I also admitted that I‚Äôm happy as long as she‚Äôs happy but I started missing her.

She hasn‚Äôt messaged me yet. I think I might have actually lost someone dear to me but at least I‚Äôll be at peace with myself for letting her know that I love her.","I finally admitted my feelings to my bestfriend (or she used to be), so that I could get some closure and move on.",18m1gcn,1702991174.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m1gcn/i_finally_admitted_my_feelings_to_my_bestfriend/,
"Well that's it. Long story short, I had finally managed to buy a TV after about 5 years without one, but my mother started undergoing treatment. She is not yet retired due to her age, and lives at a small ranch that she takes care of for the landlord, and although I live in a one-bedroom house and my earnings as a teacher are not much, every time I have invited her to live with me, she refused. She likes to be independent, you know... She doesn't even know that I sold my TV, and I prefer not to publicize the treatment here, but the $150 I got for it will help in the first 3 months of medication. I'll miss hearing a noise (even if it's electronic), being able to relax while watching something... But there's zero regret in me, and I'd do it again without thinking twice.

"For over two years, I've been dedicated to self-improvement, but I'm still struggling with my self-image and confidence. Despite having sought therapy from various therapists, engaging in physical fitness through weightlifting, following different diets, and even joining the military, I find it hard to feel good about myself. To make the most of my time, I've been actively involved in various organizations aimed at helping those in need, a pursuit born from the fact that I have limited social connections. Although I've accomplished many things that should make me proud, it feels like it's overshadowed by my feelings about my appearance, which I believe affects how others perceive and interact with me. Growing up, I faced challenges with socializing, partly due to my self-perceived unattractiveness, and also because I lacked parental guidance during my formative years. This has impacted my ability to form male friendships, as I often felt awkward in social situations. Additionally, I've struggled to establish friendships with women, believing that my appearance is off-putting to them. This perception has extended to my interactions with men, as I've been told they avoid my company to appease women. Consequently, I've devoted much of my time to work, volunteering, and staying fit. I take pride in excelling at my job, where I find joy in brightening people's days and solving their problems. Despite this, I sometimes long for the same kind of support and positive impact in my own life. I continue to strive for making a positive difference, yet I often reflect on the reasons behind my dedication to doing good things for people. I honestly just feel like crying. I always thought if i kept doing good things, eventually, people would see that i mean well and like me.",I'm just too ugly.,18m0uvh,1702989300.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m0uvh/im_just_too_ugly/,
"I had a conversation with my boyfriends brother once about how he thought all women are the same and only want him for his money. I asked him what women he‚Äôs been with. His answer: only s*x workers and sugar babies. 

I tell him: Well, it sounds the only women you go for are the ones that want your money. He says yes, which further proves his point that women want him for his money. I asked if he‚Äôs ever tried to peruse any other women, and he says their standards are too high, so he‚Äôd rather just pay for someone to be with.

I‚Äôve had multiple discussions with guys who are fully convinced that they are only worthy of receiving love if they can offer some type of support, usually financial or physical, and will therefore only go after women who DO want only those things to prove that they are correct about their theory and continuously self-sabotage themselves. 

Let me make this clear: I am not denying that there‚Äôs lots of woman who are only after money. However, if you are a man who thinks that EVERY woman in your world is only after you for your money; please consider that is because those are the only women you are willing to look at. There are so many women who don‚Äôt give a damn what money you are making; in fact, chances are they are also intentionally avoiding you because a man who is purely focused on financial gain can be off-putting to those who would rather seek a relationship with someone who is more emotionally rich then they are financially rich.",Its stupid that men think women only want their money,18m0qom,1702988919.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18m0qom/its_stupid_that_men_think_women_only_want_their/,

"My significant other has stretches of days where they‚Äôre good and happy and then days where they just ‚Äúrot‚Äù in bed (refuses to work, doesn‚Äôt care for our animal, doesn‚Äôt answer the phone or eat. They just sleep.) 

When asked if struggling with any form of depression or mental health issues they say no and become defensive and start calling me names (will comment on my physical appearance, intelligence, my family, etc.). They usually snap out of it after a few days or a week but it takes a full blown consolidated effort on my part to get them out of their funk. 

They‚Äôve gone through a number of major life changes over the course of the past two years (blowout with their family, new job). So I‚Äôve witnessed that and have tried to be as patient and as supportive as possible but I don‚Äôt always agree with choices made. I‚Äôm pretty adverse to conflict and they are not. However, I feel like I have to fight with my partner to push them to get up and get going and address the thing that‚Äôs keeping them down. That‚Äôs usually when they will start name calling. I‚Äôve given them so many opportunities to leave our relationship if I‚Äôm not what makes them happy but they always snap out of it and apologize after.

"Most of my (19F) experiences with love or intimacy were to say the least unpleasant, and the moment I started getting interested in dating I discovered having crushes or love interests made me extremely depressed.

"My friend for over two decades is an irresponsible pet owner and it is destroying our friendship. She has been getting worse over the years

The first instance was when she bred her first dog and kept one of the puppies, fast forward 4 months, the dogs broke through her neighbors fence, through the dog flap and into the neighbors home and they mauled the neighbors dog whilst the neighbor was out. The council (animal control) were involved and came to seize the dogs but before they could she had given them to a friend and told the rangers that the dogs ran away. 

About six months after that; one of her cats was poisoned by a paralysis tick and extremely unwell, she couldn‚Äôt afford to take the cat to the vets so she pretended that she found the cat as a stray and surrendered it to the animal shelter. 

Fast forward a couple of years later, she buys a male and a female dog that are both working breeds. The poor female has had THREE litters of puppies in its two short years, which she ends up struggling to sell. The two dogs are collie mixes and are offered no enrichment or much of a life outside of sitting in her backyard being used as money makers. 

I have now found out that she has bought a third puppy which she said to be that she bought so she could breed it with her mums new puppy. I told her that she needs to go look at her animal shelter at all the dogs that need a home and her response was the obviously no one wants those dogs in the shelter for a reason and life goes on. 

I feel absolutely sick to my stomach about this and I have tried to move past her attitude towards animals for a long time but she just keeps doing more and more things. I have no other friends and I don‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend but her behavior and attitude really gets under my skin and goes against my morals. 

I just wish I could make her understand that animals aren‚Äôt just for breeding, they are living creatures. Not to mention she now has three cats (which are kept in bird aviaries the majority of the time); three guinea pigs (she got rid of six guinea pigs about a year ago after breeding them); three dogs and countless birds. 

I have reported her to our local animal authorities and welfare groups (anonymously) but they‚Äôve never come out aside from when the neighbors dog was mauled.

"My partner of 7 years let me know years ago that he is bisexual, although he explained it as more of a bi-curious thing. There was one time when a feminine man gave him a blow job and nothing since. I asked him, years ago, whether he has had sex with a man. He said no. 

Yesterday, he started talking about anal sex and how he doesn‚Äôt like it. I asked about the times he‚Äôs tried it, and he reveals that one of the times was when he had sex with the man mentioned above. 

I‚Äôm really hurt that he lied to me. I get that he wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sharing but I do feel that I was entitled to that information earlier, especially after realising he didn‚Äôt get tested for HIV after that encounter until very recently. I have a few gay male friends who take HIV prevention very seriously, and although the chances he contracted something are very small, I feel like he should have either tested before we had sex or at least disclosed.

If I‚Äôm being honest with myself, I am a bit weirded out. If he was honest sooner, it would not have been a big deal. But the fact he‚Äôs hidden this from me has caused intrusive thoughts like ‚Äúam I a cover while he is battling with his sexuality‚Äù. He‚Äôs hyper masculine and quite frankly I think he has some internalised homophobia - he gets a bit angry if gay guys try to hit on him, but thrives when women do. He doesn‚Äôt like making eye contact during sex, so ‚Äúis he imagining someone else‚Äù or is it just because he‚Äôs slightly on the spectrum? I feel stupid and ignorant for these thoughts. Bisexuality is valid and I hate the narrative of ‚Äòoh they just aren‚Äôt comfortable with being gay so they‚Äôre not committing either way‚Äô‚Ä¶ but coupled with other factors, am I wildly over the line? 

I really appreciate that he‚Äôs shared with me and I want him to be an open book, so at first I decided not to react to encourage him to share more in future.

She went to the hospital in April not feeling too hot and we were rocked with the news that she had leukemia, due to complications she didn‚Äôt make it. During the month she was in the hospital with her husband. My fianc√© (now wife) and I  moved a town over into my moms house to care for my two youngest brothers and make sure they got to school through the end of the school year, although it was a longer drive to work our family motto has always been protect them babies and I honestly didn‚Äôt want to be alone either. We wrote out a chore list on the fridge and all started sharing the workload of the house (age appropriately) and set up a routine to help form some type of stability in the uncertain times we found ourselves in, we started getting things cleaned up around the house to have it nice and ready for mom‚Äôs return. Sadly we returned home alone and I started my journey as a guardian. 11m went to his biological father‚Äôs house but comes over on weekends and every other week during the summer. 15m is officially under my care full time and 19m and 22m are around often and help with what they can.
I got married this year and we had the wedding at home, my wife has been my rock through everything. I am forever grateful she got to build the bond she did with my mom I can‚Äôt speak for her but it feels like she misses mom as much as I do.
We don‚Äôt have any kids ourselves so all of this is new to us but we do the best we can with what we have, my mom did all of this alone for years with multiple kids. She endured multiple abusive relationships but always put us kids first, she would go without to make sure us boys didn‚Äôt have to, and my god was she strong I actually watched her frisbee a woman off our porch once but that‚Äôs a story for another time. Anywho her real strength was in her character, she never once let anyone speak badly about my father in my presence, she taught me to smile at every person I pass because it could be the small nudge they need to have a better day, she taught me to stand up for myself and my family, to work hard, and to always enjoy the little things.

"I (18f) have a friend that I‚Äôve known for almost 7 years (Gonna call her M). M‚Äôs mother is bipolar and her father is addicted to alcohol. She is introverted, for a while I basically was her only friend and I tried bringing her into my group of friends. My family liked her so she was always welcome in our house. When her parents got worse and eventually got a divorce, we tried to help her. At some point we even planned that she would move in with us, until she was 18. M never had a lot of time outside of school because she fled to her hobby (horses). That was fine, we were close, even though we didn‚Äôt meet that often. At least it was then.

Within the last months, the amount of times she reached out to me went from little to none. M doesn‚Äôt talk to me, when I ask her to meet up, she never has time and never offers another day. I spoke to her about it and she explained that her father was sick in the hospital now and probably wont live to the end of the school year. Her mother moved out so she is basically alone with the house and the dog. I took that apology and immediately forgave her. 

And the reason for that is that is because I feel responsible for her. In this friendship I feel like I keep giving time and energy and I get nothing in return. I‚Äòm there for her whenever she might need me, when ever she asks for me, whenever she needs my help. I am so tired of this shit, because I get nothing in return. She meets up with other people but doesn‚Äôt have time for me except if it‚Äôs convenient for her. I have been doing this for years and I am just drained. I can‚Äôt even think fondly of her anymore, whenever I think about M I get frustrated. When I invite her with my other friends or take her somewhere I feel like her caretaker.

I am using a throwaway account. I had a very traumatizing relationship and breakup with a long time partner. My mental health issues have come back to light for a while now and I am just confused as to what‚Äôs happening because now I don‚Äôt know exactly what i‚Äôm experiencing and what it could be classified as. My brain feels so disconnected from reality and im beginning to create my own reality and set up what is really important considering our time here is fake and not permanent of course but our brains and souls are infinite. I just want to reach and feel what is truly real. Our time here isn‚Äôt real and my brain connections feel severed. It feels like something dark is waiting around the corner. I feel like i‚Äôm experiencing reality more raw than everyone else. I feel like I can see what everyone is missing. Am I just experiencing reality or is it something more? Because maybe i‚Äôve just never felt reality before that‚Äôs why it feels so off. My brain feels so weird. I can go on for much longer to give more context.

"It probably isn‚Äôt what you are thinking based on the title. 
We dated for a year and a half, and for the first year, we both were really happy, and I thought she would be the last person I needed. I‚Äôm pretty sure she is bipolar, but she never had any sort of diagnosis or anything. in the last 6 months, she got stressed out by school, waterpolo, and all the other things she did in school. She took on way too much. I guess she felt obligated to spend time with me and would invite me to her place, even when she didn‚Äôt want me there.
That led to our relationship becoming toxic, she got annoyed with me very easily, a lot of times would flat out ignore me as she used my laptop to play sims, and it felt like she didn‚Äôt care about the sweet gestures I did for her anymore. 
I ignored it all putting it all up to ‚Äúshe is just stressed‚Äù and ‚Äúshe has had these episodes before‚Äù, which she has, but never as bad as this and as long. I just made excuses to myself and ignored it. 
Eventually I did something to piss her off, i made a bad joke, i recognize now that i shouldn‚Äôt have made it and it was a inappropriate place that I made it, but it wasn‚Äôt bad enough for her not talk to me for a day, for the first time ever in our relationship. 
She then broke up with me after a couple days of silence over a phone call, but said that she still wanted to be friends.
At the time I was in shock, because to me it came out of nowhere, and I didn‚Äôt understand why.
 I just asked her questions about why and just trying to understand. But she kept getting upset with me saying things ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you over this already‚Äù which it had been maybe 5 days by then. And when I didn‚Äôt understand something she said and asked a follow up question, she would say things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that hard to understand‚Äù.
It felt like she was trying to push me away.

After that we didn‚Äôt talk for maybe a month, and I went to a local event and it reminded me of her, so I texted her asking how she was doing. No response.
So I checked instagram, which I only had because of her. And I saw that she blocked me. 
So I figured she blocked me over text too. So I went to discord, which she didn‚Äôt use pretty much at all, but I knew she had. And I asked her if she still wanted to be friends, and that if she didn‚Äôt she could just say so and I‚Äôll leave her alone for good. I saw her open the app, and accidentally type something, so I know she read it. But have no response.
I followed up a week later saying basically the same thing, expectedly saying that she just had to say so, and I won‚Äôt text her again, and that I knew she read the message before. And she did the same thing, opened the app, accidentally type something, then no response. 
I tried again a week after that but then she blocked me. Then a month after that she deleted her discord account. 
I contacted her grandmother, who I had become pretty close with, and I knew she would try what she could to help me, or at least tell me something. Which ended up not working, but her grandmother said that she thinks my ex is in some sort of episode and hopefully will contact me one day. 
That was almost 3 months ago. Over those months I‚Äôve been writing a letter, that has what I believe lead to our break up, how I feel, and asking her just to tell me what she wants from me. I‚Äôm not trying to get back together at all. I don‚Äôt even know if I have romantic feelings for her anymore. I just want to be each others best friend again. Or at least try to be some sort of friends. And if not, I just want to say that she doesn‚Äôt want that, so I can move on.

"UPDATE: I sat down with my fianc√©, showed him this post, and we read/discussed all the comments, good and bad. I am also planning on talking about a lot of this feedback with my therapist. Thank you all for taking the time to read and reply. My fianc√© believes in me and I will not let him down! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I (F28) am engaged to my fianc√© (M36) and he is a wonderful, smart, funny, kind, handsome person. I am lucky to be with him and I want to be the partner he deserves. 

I grew up in an emotionally unhealthy environment. My father had a job where he screamed and cursed at people all day, and whenever he was home he would scream at us, too. Nothing was off-limits and he would fly off the handle over minor things. My mom was generally calmer, but she could become scary too‚Äîone time she yelled at me so hard that her headband flew off. When I was little, I would just hide. But as I got older, I started to yell back at them and so I learned that this was an acceptable way to handle conflict. That it was okay to get really angry over minor things, scream at people and intimidate them, and tell them things just to hurt them. I‚Äôve been in therapy to deal with the resulting depression, anxiety, and eating disorders for the past 15 years. 

In my regular life, I am doing really well and I have had long, stable friendships. But in romantic relationships where we fight more intensely, I find it difficult not to slip back into those old patterns during conflict. Sometimes it feels like there are two versions of me: normal me and conflict me. 

When I get really angry, I will tell my fianc√© horrible things. Like most recently I told him that he is a burden and I hate him. I also curse at him (like telling him to shut the fuck up). I genuinely don‚Äôt mean these things‚ÄîI just say them to hurt him in the moment and I deeply regret it later. I have made a lot of progress in individual therapy and we are seeing a therapist together for premarital counseling, too. It takes a lot longer for me to get to that level of anger now, and I have learned better ways to communicate. Outside of conflict, I am a normal, loving partner‚ÄîI give him lots of affirmation and affection, listen attentively to his feelings, and do things to make him happy (like bringing him little gifts and doing the chores he hates). But sometimes I still do this behavior during conflict and it‚Äôs devastating.

I see how much I hurt my fianc√© when I get angry and I feel like a toxic, abusive, irredeemable monster. I am so scared that I will never be able to completely stop doing this behavior and that I will eventually ruin my relationship and traumatize my fianc√©. He grew up in a loving, non-confrontational environment and I know it‚Äôs shocking for him, even though he understands why I do it and believes in me. I love him more than I ever thought I could love a person, and I desperately want to change. It‚Äôs very hard for me to talk about this outside of therapy but I am terrified and needed to get it off my chest.

"I'm up alone again taking care of the baby after taking care of her all day. 1. I love my daughter. 2. She's always been wanted by both of us. 3. I'd never even think of giving her up or what life would be like without her, she's my rainbow baby(a birth after a miscarriage) after all. 

I've heard so many excuses from him and I just feel like he's always trying to escape doing stuff for her. He works 8-9hrs a day stocking shelves. I stay home at the moment while healing, but I clean the house, pump breast milk for her, our laundry, her laundry, feedings, play, everything. I get it, stay at home moms do these things. But I want a break when he comes home. But I instead get him complaining that he's tired, he doesn't feel good, he needs to eat right as she needs to eat. He claims he can't put her to sleep and pawns her off on me to get her to go to sleep. 

I wish he would just understand that I went through 9 months of carrying her. The morning sickness. The pains in my body. The feet swelling. The weird delusional spells I'd have from stress. Then birthing her and going through contractions and a 2nd degree tear. The healing after, barely being able to walk. Even in this time, I was doing the cleaning. He just can't clean or keep things clean for his life. Even right now, he's left his soda can and tea glass on the table next to me and didn't bother taking her empty bottles to the sink. Even if he did, he wouldn't have washed them out anyway. 

I stay up from when he goes to work, til he gets home, and all the way into early morning hours until my grandparents get up to let me go to bed. Every day I tell him I'm tired and need to sleep. But I end up staying up because, ""I can't do anything with her."" And when he's sitting here with me, he is on his phone the entire time ignoring me. He goes to work, comes home, eats, plays on his phone, reluctantly helps with the baby, then goes to bed. 

It's wild to me how I've never been around babies and he has. Yet he can't do anything with his own daughter. 

All this is teaching me is that I can be a single mother, because I basically am one already. I like working, I could provide for us. I just can't yet. And now I'm used to being up all the time, so I'm not worried about not having sleep for work. Plus, I'd save money since he spends 800 dollars in 4 days on his hobbies anyway. I never spend money unless it's on her. And I never get to indulge in my hobbies. I'd be surprised if he got me a gift for Christmas that wasn't something for him disguised as a gift for me.

"I turned 33 today. Doing some reflecting.

It's incredible how much of a struggle even basic things are for me. Showering, doing dishes, cleaning, laundry, vacuuming. I manage to do it all (not always in a ""timely"" manner) but the amount of psyching myself up that it requires is crazy. These things that most people do without even a second thought are a major accomplishment for me. I live alone in a small house, for context. 

I really, really struggle with employment. I actually did hold a job from ages 17-25 (8 years!) But no job since has come close. That job was a friend's dad's company though, and very flexible for me through high school and college. Most of the time I worked there I worked like maybe 20 hours a week. More over the summer. Since that job I've had probably sheesh idk...10+ jobs? Multiple warehouses, greenhouses, I did Amazon delivery (def do not recommend that one). Every one of them lasted between 3-10 months. I either get fired or quit because I'm indescribably burnt out. It's always the same, I start and feel like I could really turn over a new leaf. Then it gets progressively harder, I get depressed as shit and inevitably get fired or quit. 

I have a ""useless"" bachelor's degree. I'll probably never use it. I have so many interests and hobbies, I really wish I could parlay them into some kind of money making. I've had ideas, I just always get too bogged down in the details and can never make it happen. Or it's such an extreme struggle to get business. For example I've done landscaping for people. I've had years where I had one or two people I did regular work for. It wasn't enough to pay the bills but at least I had something. I've tried to advertise online, put up flyers. One year I really made an effort and ended up getting only 2 jobs. Both of which were 2 day projects. So obviously not even close to enough. One person that hired me was an old highschool classmate and I truly think they went with me out of pity. One big issue is I have minimal equipment. I don't have a truck, so I can't get a mower/ bring one places. I would literally kill to have a truck/trailer/mower but I don't think I'll ever be able to afford it. I LOVE to cut grass. It would be a dream. That's just one business example though. This would get stupidly long if I mentioned my other ideas and why they haven't panned out either. 

Basically I feel like its impossible for me to ever have a career/keep a job/make enough money to be self sufficient. It feels like a genuinely impossible hill to climb. I have serious mental health issues. Depressed, ADHD and bipolar. I'm currently working on getting medicated, haven't been in a long time. It's a process though. I think these things really hold me back and it sucks, because the world isn't built for people with brains like mine. 

What I've always said is, I need a job where I can work as much as I want if I feel great, and if I feel awful I can take time off with no reprocussions. What screws me at every job is the fact that I can't keep going day in and day out because of my mental health issues. I need a break every now and then, and the working world just doesn't work that way. Feels like it'll always be inevitable firing/quitting because of this. That's the main reason why I want to be self employed. So before anyone suggests yea go work for a landscaping company, they're just going to fire me when I feel like shit and can't come in. There's no way I could last a whole summer and all those hours without having a down period. I feel like there's nothing I can do.

Lastly, I'm super lucky to have the parents I have. The only thing I'm doing for work is an online gig job. I can't talk about it since I signed an NDA (non disclosure agreement) but it's probably like 50 hours per month, work anytime which is fantastic for me. The only thing is the pay GREATLY varies. Some months I only make a few hundred bucks. Some months I've made $2000. So it's not enough to be relied on. However, my parents cover my remaining expenses without question and insist it's no problem. Again, I'm very lucky, but I hate that they have to help me like this. I just want to take care of myself. One pipe dream is that I have a few investments that are mid-long term investments that I truly feel will pay off massively at some point. I know nothing is certain but I usually feel this will be my only way to be financially self sufficient. I can only hope.

"I (22M) never feel like anything i take part in is fun anymore. This problem stems from the fact that for the last 3 years i‚Äôve been getting headaches, eye pain, and dryness in my eyes anytime i use screens (phone, computer, tv, anything). I use blue light glasses and they seem to work about half the time. But because i‚Äôm more likely than not to get a headache from using screens, I try to avoid them as much as possible. i‚Äôve felt like this has seriously cut into what i can do socially, as I can‚Äôt really hang out and watch tv/a movie with friends anymore because it physically hurts. 

The biggest action of the problem in my title comes from the fact that since my sophomore year of high school I‚Äôve always just felt like being alone. My whole life except for maybe my 8th and 9th grade years, I‚Äôve always kept to myself on weekends and been more likely to hang out by myself while simultaneously having a good amount of friends at school and from sports especially.i was a ton more social in 8th and 9th grade then something shifted and ever since i‚Äôve wanted to keep to myself. 

covid was the worst. from about march 20 to august 21 i was totally on my own. I went to college and worked quite a bit but never hung out with anyone. i was on my phone 24/7 on twitter/ig /tiktok and i feel like this has severely impacted my mind and how i function and even back to my sophomore year. then, in fall 21, i started being more social with friends from high school and drinking and partying, eventually transferring and joining a frat. My first semester at the new school and in the frat was awesome and 2022 was undoubtedly the best year of my life in a long time. 

Ever since October 22 i‚Äôve felt like I reverting back to my old self. i don‚Äôt wanna be around people anymore. social settings have gotten more uncomfortable and more like a chore. honestly it feels like everything in life is a chore. every single thing in life is just something i‚Äôm doing to make sure i‚Äôm good in society‚Äôs eyes. i work out, hang out with people, go to college because it‚Äôs what i‚Äôm supposed to do. all i really wanna do is sit in my room and hang out by myself but i know that‚Äôs not good for me. when i‚Äôm in social settings that i should be enjoying , i can‚Äôt. i used to love drinking and dancing/partying/being social but even now that feels like i‚Äôm faking it. 

I really have no idea what i‚Äôm doing or who i am anymore. i used to be a good person but my mental state has gotten worse over time and i‚Äôve done some horrible things this year. every single social interaction is awful because i‚Äôm very irritable and easily find ways to gate people. i‚Äôve also been a heavy porn user since i was 12, so this probably has something to do with it. 

i feel like i have some hope but i need to get off my phone and be around people more. but again that feels like something i don‚Äôt actually want to do but feel like i have to.

"I could really use some insight/advise from a Married person.   
  
My girlfriend is amazing, smart, kind and beautiful. She has done a lot for me. She's made me a better person today then who I was 2 and half years ago before we met. She would make a great mother to our future children. She has a great personality! Most times when she or I mess up and can we recognize it upset one another and we communicate about how we both feel. once we resolve our issues, we embrace one another, apologize and hold each other in bed. Sometimes though, I feel myself angry and frustrated with her. She will argue with me about things that make no sense to argue about, and then proceeds to apologize after I explain how I feel or why I did whatever it was that angered her. I'm not saying I don't mess up either, I always try and put myself in her shoes and think ""why would this make me upset?"". Lately though, I feel her arguments are not valid or fair to me.  
  
Yesterday was a weird one. She wanted me to get groceries, unload dishes, fold laundry, clean up a bit, take out the trash. Simple and easy stuff. She leaves these note's for me before she leaves for work about what I have to get done. when I wake up around 8:30AM to get ready for the gym I read the note. The note is followed up by a bunch of cute inside jokes and ""I love you, have a great day"" stuff, never does it feel demanding. She does this almost everyday. I work a Job that is at 2Pm - 8Pm and I always go to the gym around 9:00am and have the rest of the time to help out at home and run errands while she's working. These simple tasks are totally fine and I don't mind doing them for her since she makes me dinner, cleans and does simple house chores as well. I Texted her saying I would ""get er done"" and continued on with my days original plan, but with some extra tasks. (she was already aware of my current plans for today) The day goes as is; Workout, Eat, Landry, dishes, trash, Christmas shopping, help grandma with TV, groceries. Well after finishing up with helping my grandmother around 4:30pm (Girlfriend Off work by 4:00) , she texted me and started calling me terrible at time Management. She said it was stupid that I drove all the way to a mall 25 minutes away then going to the one that we live close too. I like the other mall better, its less busy, has more stores and I enjoy listening to my music while I drive on the highway. She's texting me getting mad saying ""You Had All Day To Get Groceries And Waited Till The Last Minute"". I blew up over text. I got angry and explained why I chose THAT mall and Why I chose It would be smarter to get frozen food last then get it first to avoid making two trips. What Pissed me off the most was that me coming home a bit later doesn't effect her. She goes to the gym after work most times so why would it matter if I wasn't home after she came home? I'm not sure if maybe she just wants to see me after work and that's why she was mad. Well after receiving some more msg like ""just stay at your parents place"" and ""don't bother with getting groceries"" I stopped replying. It made me so frustrated. I came home (after getting food because we needed it), went on my Laptop and started watching hockey. Today was a day off btw  
  
After about 2 hours or so of ignoring one another she comes up to me and says ""Stop being mean and rude"" which sparked a conversation. I told her how I feel about being sworn at over text and that I'm not okay with her blowing up at me over something that didn't effect her. It angered me that she said I'm not good at time management when I am! It pissed me off that she felt the need to make me feel stupid for going to a further away mall when it did not matter or effect her. She eventually realized she was being unfair and replied with an apology and hug, I know she understood me, but this time I find myself still angry. I'm frustrated about how much stress she caused me while getting those groceries before she was home. It didn't effect her at all so why was she so upset? I asked her why she got upset about it and her reply was ""I Don't Know, I'm Sorry"" to which I responded with ""That's not a good enough reason to treat me the way you did"". She kept saying sorry and that she doesn't know why she was so mad. I hugged her, kissed her and then hung out with her before she fell asleep.  
  
These arguments have added up and now I find myself feeling resentment towards her. It hurts me because I want so badly to only feel love for her, but now I'm finding myself angry too. I know I love her. There is ZERO question about that. What terrifies me is these little arguments makes me doubtful and resentful towards her. I love &amp; feel resentment towards her.  
Is this a normal feeling to have with someone you can see yourself marring?

"The title implies being in a relationship with her would even be ab option, well it's not. She doesn't like me like that, and is currently with someone. Although she has a relationship cycle where she gets into relationships very quickly, they get super serious, very quickly, and then they end, very quickly. She love bombs and shit. I've seen her go through it a few times now. 

As for why I don't want to be in a relationship with her, because logically, she has so many red flags. She's a mess. She makes very poor, irresponsible decisions, especially considering she has a child. I've seen the way she is in relationships, and she doesn't build them to last. She's love bomby, and at times slightly manipulative (not like horribly manipulative, but just... Sometimes uses manipulation because she doesn't know how else to just ask for things) and that's not just in relationships that's with friends too. 

She came from a very broken family, has a terrible relationship with her mum (her mum is actually horrible) and her father and her stepfathers (her mum's had a few marriages) aren't around. And she hasn't done any healing etc, she's learnt so many unhealthy ways of surviving and she hasn't even thought about trying to unlearn them. A couple of times I've tried to steer her in that direction but she's not ready. Sadly she's one who will have to learn those lessons in a very hard way. 

She also, as I briefly mentioned, has a child. She takes great care of the child in terms of in person care etc. but beyond that, the decisions she makes with herself, the amount of guys she's been in serious relationships with that the child's met (after a week of her dating the guy for example) and at times putting herself in dangerous situations, very irresponsible. I feel for the kid. She doesn't realise it but she's creating a lot of the same problems her mum created for her when she was a child (they were both mums at quite a young age)

Despite all of these things, despite that logically I can see she's a mess... I care so much for her. Not just how I feel about her, but I am literally at her house most weekends helping her cope with the mess of a life she has. Her current man should hate me tbh, coz we cuddle up and watch netflix together, and for some silly reason she sends him pictures of us cuddled up. Like if I was dating someone and they were doing shit like that with someone, I wouldn't be happy. At times I do say like 'yo this is a bit much' but it's also just become a part of our friendship dynamic. We are that close. Hell I've probably seen her naked more times than anyone she's been in a relationship with recently. She sees me as something along the lines of a gay best friend (I'm bi) 
Again, I see the issues there. But... I can't not care about her the way I do. 

She's more than a friend to me. I wouldn't put her as high as my best friends, but at the same time the dynamic of our relationship is something different to a friendship or a best friendship.

I still remember the day you told me.

I remember how every time I saw your message, my day would become better. I remember how you‚Äôd hug me, how you‚Äôd cuddle me, how you‚Äôd comfort me.  I remember your touch, your voice, your smile, your smell. I remember when I struggled to sleep, you‚Äôd read to me. I remember how much I miss you. 

There was once a time where you felt the same. When you missed me as much as I missed you. I wonder if you still do?

Are you still capable of loving me? I‚Äôve changed. You‚Äôve changed. I wish we could‚Äôve changed together.

"Last year was my 30th birthday. There was an open to the public event at the restaurant I work at the night before. As an employee, I got free entry, a plus one , and I could have a couple guests for half entry. So I decided I'd use that as my social gathering and then I had a yurt reserved for my boyfriend and I stay at for 2 nights after.

I reached out to some friends to go to this event as my birthday celebration. No one really seemed interested so I went alone, hoping there would be a last minute change or maybe some coworkers to hang out with. It was kind of a bust and I didn't have a great time, but at least I had my camping trip.

When I got home from the party, my boyfriend told me he was feeling too much anxiety about his chronic illness and couldn't deal with going out of town. Since I don't know how to drive, I canceled the reservation and spent my birthday at home feeling sorry for myself.

This year was a similar story. The night before my birthday was bingo night at the restaurant. I reached out to my friends and coworkers inviting them to join me at bingo to celebrate my birthday.  No one really responded and I was crushed when I showed up at the restaurant and no one was there. My coworker asked me how many people were coming since she had some tables opening up soon and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die when I told her I was alone. I played bingo and it was entertaining, but ultimately lonely.

The next day, my actual birthday, the only plans I had were to go to a movie with my boyfriend. He had a really bad symptom flare 2 nights before and when I was talking to him about what theater/showing we should go to, he told me he was feeling too anxious about his health to be able to go.

So, for the second year in a row I spent my birthday sitting at home feeling lonely and depressed. The only people who reached out to me to say anything about my birthday was my grandma, my boyfriend's mom, and my manager.

"My GF and I (19 and 21) are basically just incompatible. Yes, we are very much in love, but we keep hurting each other everyday. It just doesn‚Äôt work and I hate myself for thinking this way. I decided that it would be best if we just broke up since it just doesn‚Äôt seem to work. She told me we could stay as friends but this isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve done this, we‚Äôve been on and off and kept staying ‚Äúas friends‚Äù for like 10 times already within the past few months. 

From the second time, I knew deep down that being ‚Äújust friends‚Äù isn‚Äôt really going to work and it isn‚Äôt really a very good idea. However, I just kept pushing these feelings down because I felt so bad and guilty for leaving her. We‚Äôve built so many dreams and memories together that it just hurts to move on. And it hurts more knowing that we must move on since all it‚Äôs doing is causing constant pain for both of us.

When I tried to break up once and for good with her and going complete no contact, she said she‚Äôd never love anyone again in her life and will stay waiting for me even if I take 10 or 20 years to come around. I feel so bad for her and guilty for having to do this but I must be stern and hold my ground, because I know that being her friend without all the affection would probably hurt her more in the long run than if I just left for good. She also hinted about harming herself if I left and I really don‚Äôt want that to happen. I contacted some of her close friends (we do not have the same social-circles) and asked them to try and keep her extra busy the next few weeks/months until she gets better at least.

"For context, I was raised in extreme willful poverty. I was 100% abused. Neglect and emotional abuse were most prevalent, fortunately. 

Christmas and the holiday season were always difficult. My parents often took their holiday stress out on us, so December-January always felt like walking on eggshells.

I had two particularly rough Christmas‚Äô that I‚Äôm really having trouble letting go of.

My maternal Grandparents were somewhat estranged. Every year they would send us a huge box filled with wrapped presents for us to open. I‚Äôm the oldest of 3, so it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to get less gifts because the gifts I got were normally nicer but I had always gotten a good amount.
I sat and watched my younger siblings open like around a dozen gifts each, and about halfway through the box I realized the gifts were running low and I hadn‚Äôt gotten a single one. My heart sank as I pulled gift after gift for my siblings out of the box, I tried to hide it because I didn‚Äôt know how to express my emotions.
I got to the bottom of the box, and there was one small wrapped package for me. Of course it was the last gift opened, so my siblings and parents have all their attention on me. 
It‚Äôs two mechanical pencils with a 99 cent clearance sticker on them. 
I was between 11-14, and I was really upset. My Mom was not on my side at all, my Dad was angry but he was a doormat so he didn‚Äôt say anything about it. She told me they gathered presents over several months and probably just overlooked it, she really tried to convince me it wasn‚Äôt a slight but an unfortunate accident. It didn‚Äôt help, and definitely wasn‚Äôt true.
 Looking back on that now as an adult, it‚Äôs so gross she argued with me and didn‚Äôt back me up at all in that situation. Over a decade later, I am still no contact with my maternal family and my Mom is low contact herself. I think that‚Äôs says everything about that situation.


The second story really fucking set the tone for my young adulthood.
I was 15, and I knew this was going to be the last Christmas my family had together because my Mom was planning to leave my Dad.
I didn‚Äôt know when, it had already been 6+ months since I had seen messages on my Mom‚Äôs phone about her planning to leave my Dad, but I knew it was coming. 
On Christmas morning, I immediately noticed I had way less gifts than my siblings. It made me nervous, but it wasn‚Äôt unusual for one of us to get less gifts if we were getting something big. 
As always, my Dad practically slept through us opening gifts while my Mom yelled at him to try to get him to keep his eyes open. 
I finished opening my gifts first, because I had the least. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what it was but it was like socks and hair ties. 
I watched my younger siblings open the rest of their gifts and tried not to cry because my Mom was watching me and I didn‚Äôt want to get yelled at too.
When my siblings finished opening all their gifts, my Mom started looking around for something. She hit my Dad‚Äôs knee to wake him up and ask him where something was. She left the room, and came back with a bubble mailer. 
She handed it to me, and it was an old DSLR camera. They‚Äôd bought it used, so it didn‚Äôt have a charger or a memory card (it only took memory sticks or something like that) but I was so excited.
My parents told me they had a charger somewhere, but they wanted to nap after breakfast. I waited 3 hours, asked for the charger, and got yelled at because we were late to go to my Uncle‚Äôs.
2 hours later when we shambled out the door, I was in tears and my Dad was telling me to stop being dramatic and that my uncle would have a charger.
At my Uncle‚Äôs, there was zero food I could eat (all of it was seafood and I‚Äôm allergic to shellfish) and every time I asked about the charger I was basically told to fuck right off.
It was 9 PM by the time my uncle caught wind of what was going on and handed me a micro USB cable. If you know anything about cameras you probably know where this is going. 
It was an output only port! Which means the camera could not be charged via a charging cable, you had to charge the battery itself. After 12 hours of waiting, and being incredibly hungry I broke down.
My Mom was upset I embarrassed her by breaking down, she took me into a side bedroom and told me to get my shit together and that we‚Äôd order a charger.
To make a long story a little shorter, I had to wait  till February to get the memory card adapter and charger I needed (my parents couldn‚Äôt afford it till then + the parts were really hard to find due to how old the camera was.) 
The camera was broken the entire time, it would turn on but that was about it. It was broken in a way we could not have fixed and it certainly wasn‚Äôt a camera that was worth having repaired. 
4 months later my Mom left my Dad. That was our last family Christmas. 


I‚Äôm 22 now. I‚Äôm doing well for myself, I have a decent job, a car. But the holidays instill me with all the dread of my childhood. Everytime I think about Christmas I feel like I‚Äôm about to have a panic attack. It feels like the last nasty remainders of a really bad time in my life. 

I guess it‚Äôs hard to appreciate the magic of the holidays when they were such a stressful time for us.

"Hi everyone, I wanted to come on here and clarify some details, since my post blew up on here and people are asking the same questions on DM‚Äôs, I thought I‚Äôd make another post just to put things into perspective.

Yes, some of you guessed it, I am Pakistani, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something in common that my community faces, but if it is, then I‚Äôm more screwed then ever.

First, I want to begin by saying I do not, in any way shape or form, support the new law that might happen next year in April, I think it‚Äôs barbaric and F*ing idiotic what the UK government is doing.

I didn‚Äôt say I was agreeing with the new law, I said I was just glad that I was not making the amount that is required to earn to bring a spouse back here.

No offence to anyone that lives back in my home country, but I would rather marry a frog then be with someone from there.

Second, people wanted some clarification on a few details more personal, so I thought I‚Äôd put it in here just so that I don‚Äôt have to keep retyping everything again and again to different people.

From a young age, I was abused throughout my life, I was bullied, beaten, suffocated, slapped around and molested, not mainly by my parents, but my aunt.

My aunt (F53) has lived with me and my family throughout our lives, she thinks herself as our second mother, but she is more like our abuser, mainly mine.

One of my key memories of her was when I did something small, I don‚Äôt know what it was, but I remember her dangling me outside of the attic (loft) window for five minutes straight until I apologised to her.

Even when I‚Äôd say it the first time, she still kept me there until I said it repeatedly and only brought me back up when my parents arrived home from shopping and she‚Äôd threaten that if I told them, she‚Äôd do it again, but let go of my legs, so I kept quiet.

She‚Äôd slap and beat me up every chance she got and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.

I‚Äôd have bruises, scratches and pain, some scars I still have to date, but I had to endure it.

When I was in year 10 through to 11, she was the cause of my anxiety, my nightmares and me waking up shaking and not being able to breathe - this caused me to fail all my subjects and she was there to belittle me even more.

I don‚Äôt know what made her stop tormenting me, but when she did, I got some quiet, I got to focus on my business studies in college, by the end of my 3 years, I got my diploma in business with a D*,D,D with an A* I got for an extended project I did on top of my Business with Law and Accounting degree.

Then I moved onto getting my English, I got it after 4 months of revision and passed.

My Business and English was the first thing I passed without so much stress and it made me happy, so much so, I shared it with my parents.

They never really took notice since my aunt would be there to take their attention away and focus it either on her or my other siblings, which she succeeded in because my sister (F22 &amp; F21) got their GCSE‚Äôs and my parents + aunt would always bode over them and I was just left in the shadows, acting as the black sheep so I kept to the title.

I didn‚Äôt share it, I didn‚Äôt share my accomplishments and I kept it all to myself.

When I moved onto going to university, I wanted to continue with my business studies, it was something I was good at, I already had my diploma in it, so I wanted to continue it into uni.

I told my parents my decision about uni, but my aunt convinced them otherwise, she told them I wouldn‚Äôt get a job by the end of it, that business was a dead end career etc etc.

She then proceeded to get my other aunt involved (F51), who was an ex teacher, to convince them that business was a dead subject and I wouldn‚Äôt get anything from it, so they forced me into doing tourism and travelling, then boasted about how it was a subject where it‚Äôll get me into the best jobs possible after uni.

It was not only boring and something I didn‚Äôt enjoy, but I never enjoyed it, plus Covid hit during the second half of my first year, the uni plus teachers waisted my time in the second year.

First they told me to come onto campus, then when I‚Äôd go, they‚Äôd change it to online and I‚Äôd miss my whole lesson.

It got frustrating so I dropped out and my parents freaked out with my aunt making it much worse then it was.

This is already getting a little to long, so I‚Äôll move on.

My aunts is always the one that manipulated them, my mum especially, whatever decision she makes, my aunt makes sure it benefit her and when my mum agrees with her, she then makes her believe that it is her idea.

For example, I told my mum I didn‚Äôt want to marry anyone from our hometown, she gave me an options which was, she‚Äôd take me to our hometown, aka, her village and let me meet perspective guys that I can choose to marry and then we go from there, if I declined, then she‚Äôd respect that.

My aunt told my mum that I don‚Äôt deserve to have a say in this and that I need to get married to someone back at the village or else I‚Äôll grow to old and no one will want me then.

She then proceeded to tell her that I‚Äôm a worthless piece of trash that no one will want because I‚Äôm nothing.

"for context, I (f20) went to highschool with my friend(F19) and her boyfriend(M19) graduated the year after us. they have been together for 2 ¬Ω years now, but the compared to the train wrecks of relationships my friend had before this this man was essentially a christmas movie love interest. I sucked at love in high school, and while I have improved in my life since starting college, its not like i found my own good relationship and am now judging. My senior year of high school i watched them fall in love and build a stable relationship, and when i moved(they both stayed in my hometown), i just heard most of the relationship through text, and I was fine being the vent, when I'd go home i'd watch them interact and still be very stable and lovey, occasionally having problems but they'd work through it.

  
now im back in my hometown again and ive been 3rd wheeling a lot recently (which I don't mind), and i'm starting to see a bunch of toxic things in their relationship that i've seen other couples crumble in during college. they both still live in their parents homes and their maturity seems to have regresses(or at least his has) and sometimes i feel like im with two 14 year olds. she is very controlling of him and when i get screenshots of their texts from her for an outside opinion of a friend, she is using very manipulative language, and when he screws up, he'll get in his own head and try to take a day or two to think about it, and then she'll freak out and lovebomb him into making up without adressing the problem, and then whine again 3 weeks later something slightly related happens

  
i also know that all of us are very young, and i tell my friends that sometimes and that they'll grow as people as they age, but damn if they get married(which they do talk about a lot and are planning on getting engaged in 2 years), they are not going to have a happy marriage and happy life, i think they'll hate living together but they won't live together till they're married so they can't figure that out first, and they won't ever get divorced(they don't believe in that). its breaking my heart to watch them keep dating and i can't say anything because i don't have the heart to tell my friend my concerns( its also not my place). I didn't even realize i was thinking this until a few days ago when i just watched something and had that holy shit moment where i knew they wouldn't last.

  
tldr: my friend's relationship has regressed slowly but i don't think they're gonna break up and rather still try to get married in a few years and live a depressing life. i want to say something but i know i cant",i no longer believe in the couple that made me believe in love,18lwz7a,1702974058.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lwz7a/i_no_longer_believe_in_the_couple_that_made_me/,

"I mean you do get the product and the price you paid for. But here's where the scam comes in. I use Lint rollers everyday, and you can't just roll once and call it a day.

I sleep with my shirt on and boxers. Who the fuck sleeps naked? I don't change my shirt everyday because I'm not dealing with Laundry room assholes, or laundry in general.

First you have 6 rolls, then you have 5 and a half rolls, then you have 4. All within a 14 day period. Then 3, then 2 and by month 1 day 4, you're down to just half a roll left.

This is EXTRA sticky pet hair rollers for $36.79 + $2.89 Cal tax. so lets just almost round it out to about 40 even. Which is a tremendous scam for 1 month of usage.

"Honestly‚Ä¶

What you did to me was kind of fucked up. I‚Äôm not really sure how you could be so callous and careless with the feelings of someone you know. I understand that you‚Äôre not interested in me and while that wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping for, that‚Äôs fine, but you always knew I cared for you more than you cared for me (if you cared at all) and I don‚Äôt understand that even though you knew that, you would play with my emotions so cruelly by inviting me to a sex club the same night you asked me to walk you home, told me you were looking for someone that would hold the table for you to dance on (I so foolishly thought you were referring to me as I can‚Äôt think of anyone else who supported you and enabled you as much as I did) and then proceeded to hug me goodbye for an unusually long time.

Why would you so overtly give me signals that you wanted to reignite something when you had no intention to do so. Even worse, why would you do this while you were just in the beginning of a relationship with someone new. It‚Äôs so disrespectful to what we had (again I am now thinking maybe we had nothing) and so disrespectful to your new relationship. And why did I have to be the one to bring up the fact that it would be inappropriate to hang out one-on-one given the revelation that you had started seeing someone. A revelation only made because I brought it up otherwise who knows how else I would have figured out I was being strung along. When I drew that boundary, your response was ‚ÄúOh. Okay‚Äù.

I‚Äôve now allowed my heart to be broken on three separate occasions in one year by the same person, and each time it‚Äôs destroyed my usually unflappable confidence. I don‚Äôt recognize myself each time I get off the \[Redacted\] Merry-Go Round.

I refuse to hurt someone else, the cycle must be broken.

I hope you figure your shit out ‚Äî truly, because I can‚Äôt imagine any future partnership you have will be able to withstand that kind of behaviour long term.

But then that same night I tell my stepmom about it, he bursts into my room and tells me ‚ÄúTake the TV‚Äù (his words exactly). So then I did. 

I also have a PS5 that he had gotten me and my brother (who mostly lives in a different state with my mom) last Christmas. My dad doesn‚Äôt use it and my brother only uses it when he comes to visit over the breaks. So I decided that since he doesn‚Äôt have a TV, I‚Äôll just put the PS5 in my room and take it out when my brother comes here.

What I ate, how dressed and looked, he even took away my permit so I could not drive (or learn how to) and I lost my job but couldn't get a new one because I had no way of transportation, no money I had access to for Uber, and he simply did everything he could to sabotage or ruin any chance I had. 

The relationship truly ended when I found out he was having a affair for the last 4+ months, he didn't care how hurt I was. He was actually smiling because of the pain I was in. That messed up sociopathic like grin is forever etched into my mind.


Fast forward 3 months, I am now home with My parents and officially starting my own life, with my own control over it. I have a job at a truck stop not to far away from me, and I work with a family member (simply because I need familiarity, and someone there just in case things get to bad for me mentally... I can talk to them).

I know this will sound stupid but I currently like my job. I mean it's cleaning toilets and showers and mopping etc.. but it's so much better then that relationship and life I was in. I have my own money so I can **fianlly** buy things I want. My ex would get me things I never wanted, never asked for, simply because **he liked them** and he was trying to turn me into the girl of his dreams. 

Now to the current question... I have a crush on someone at my work. We talk a little but there's something about him that has my brain like... *fixated* on him. Just small things but they add up and my brain just gets all happy. The way he talks, smiles, his gestures to me when I first met him, etc.

Idk what to do with these feelings, or how to handle them properly. I don't know what love is (at least love for me anymore) and due to my ex pretty much locking me up in a house for the last 3 years of our relationship.. I have 0 social skills now. I don't know how to talk or say or feel or anything. I type just fine... but talking person to person ^ more than half of this shit won't come up because I can't/ don't think of it at the time. It's like being shoved into a flight or fight situation all the time. 

I know my past relationship was bad and I should be taking more time then this before I develop feelings for someone or get into a romantic relationship with someone. But I haven't had a crush on someone this badly. Even my ex didn't stir these feelings in me when I first met him. 

Idk what to do. If I do somehow get lucky to be with this guy... I don't wanna fuck it all up. 
I'm scared of saying the wrong thing to him... 

I'm so scared to socialize too that while at work when talks to me, I kinda shutdown. Like I will smile and stuff, do some small talk... but then I eventually walk off to do more work.

Idk how to even talk to him outside of work because I'm so scared of even being outside. 
I know his one friend/co worker likes me but tbh I don't care for that person... the few times they talk to me it comes off as arrogance, rude, and just reminds me of my ex in certain cases. Like I don't like (C) I like (J).. (used there first initial cause privacy) 

What.. what do I do... I'm asking here because I'm not ready yet to tell my family or therapist.  I'm still feeling it out myself and wanna make sure do I truly like... have a crush or is this my brain doing something else. (But fuck even typing/thinking about him is making me smile and blush)

"DISCLAIMER
I am NOT looking for handouts, as per the rules I am NOT that person. I just. Need. To. Vent.

I desperately need to talk about this. I'm so guilt ridden, heartbroken, feeling helpless.

I work hard to give my kid a roof over his head and food in his belly. Things have gotten so out of hand with the cost of rent, power, groceries etc.  We all feel it, I know that.
My kid and I lost his father. I'm not making ends meet. I can barely afford food and power after rent. We do not live beyond our means, I budget well. But rent takes over 60% of my income and there is nothing cheaper out there.

I had to tell my kid, after losing his father, that Santa will not be coming this year. I said there are many families with children who don't even have a home, Santa needs to take care of them. And he was so sweet. So understanding, but I could see the sadness in his face. I can't afford to buy him anything. And the thing is, I've been so caught up in everything else that I was kind of fine with it... until now. Everyone asks him if he's excited for Santa to come and he says Santa isn't coming, and he gets that sad look on his face, and I have to look away and hold back embarrassed tears.

# The bad part first :

First of all about money, money is always the problem,

i dont have a debt or anything but living paycheck to paycheck is sucks because my daily income is about 8$ per day

(I live in southeast asia, eat is about 1$ but pizza is 10$, so i can't buy fancy food like pizza everyday)

I want to go to disneyland with my son and have a trip together (for now is just a dream but i want to turn it around and make that dream come true)

# The Good Part :

For me i always think positive about my situation, i can speak english so i can read valuable information in here and i know i can turn it my situation around.

I know youtube a little bit And i know youtube change a lot of people life all over the world

"No matter what I do, or how hard I try, everyone makes me out to be the villain, the aggressor. I have a $25 full time job and all my money goes straight into my mom‚Äôs account. I have to ask her for my own money. I take care of my mentally disabled brothers, via taking them everywhere they need/want to go, give them their medicines, always buy them everything they need and extra too. I make every holiday and birthday special for my whole family. My entire life is planned out for me because I have three mentally disabled brothers who will never be able to live on their own or take care of themselves. I‚Äôm going to college to make enough money to take care of them. I even moved to a different city to make sure one of them wasn‚Äôt homeless. They are all going to live with me so I can never have a spouse (who wants to marry a woman who has three grown men in the house: one who spent 12 years in jail for murder and the other who‚Äôs on the sex offender registry?) or a family. I‚Äôm giving up everything for them and my mom still sides against me every time I get into a disagreement with them. They make fun of my weight by calling me a pig, they constantly fight with each other and when I try to break it up, my mom tells me I go  too far. I‚Äôm trying so hard and nobody cares. My mom thinks it‚Äôs my obligation to take care of them forever because I‚Äôm one of the only siblings who is not mentally delayed or have schizophrenia. I‚Äôm so alone. I not good at anything but empathy.

I was even saving up money to bring my family to Disney world and they fucking hate me. I just want them to like me. To be proud of me. 

I got into a physical fight with my schizophrenic brother because he punched me because I told him to apologize to the other brother he threatened. I just told him that he won‚Äôt get any of the cheesecake I bought if he doesn‚Äôt apologize. he responded by punching me. I‚Äôm 5 foot and he‚Äôs six foot. And then my mom got mad at me! Because I should ‚Äúknow how he is.‚Äù She‚Äôs spoiling them rotten and I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs going to have to deal with them after. I worked from 6:30am to 4:30pm and I just didn‚Äôt want them to fight with each other. How can I possibly be the bad guy? I‚Äôm so tired. All I want is for someone to tell me I‚Äôm doing a good job. That they want me around. That I matter. It seems like everyone only have words for me when I fuck up. That‚Äôs it. 

Before you ask, I am qualified to take care of my brothers. I‚Äôm a social worker. Please don‚Äôt reach out to services on my behalf. I‚Äôm not going to hurt anyone. I‚Äôm not going to kill myself. I just needed to get this off my chest.

"Well, I (M25) met this one girl (F25) about three years ago. Last year we tried being a couple after some serious hints about the idea, but soon after (2 months) we broke up because ""she needed to be alone"". She wanted to (and did) sleep with her coworker. I didn't know that detail until this year, when I tried to reach out and she told me about how was her life while we didn't talk. I don't know if it's because I have low self-esteem or that I want people who I care about around me, but I just accepted it in some kind of way.

The problem is, even though I'm good with her living her life, her behaviour towards me makes me feel uncomfortable. She's not a bad person, she's caring and loving in her own way, but she has some traits that bothers me a lot. One of them that makes me sick is that I feel like she took me for granted and is only there when she wants some attention.

The next week she invited me, some friends of her and a friend we have in common to dinner. I'm not into the mood for her and the only thing stopping me from being a jerk is that I prefer to avoid unnecessary or stupid conflict, but I want to see our friend because is a really good guy that I've always cared about and he's a little shy, so I'd rather be there to not let him down .

I don't know what to do. I will go because of my friend, so that's something that will happen, but I don't know how to behave because I want that night to make a decision about her. Another friend of mine tried to make me laugh and say that I should wear my best clothes and be indifferent towards her. A part of me says that I should talk about all this, but the other part says that is pointless because she never really gave a fuck about my feelings. Maybe trying to stay friends with her wasn't such a good idea, because now I'm in this position where I have to choose between just letting things go and continue my life or arguing with someone.",I tried to stay friends with my ex-gf,18lupyc,1702965199.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lupyc/i_tried_to_stay_friends_with_my_exgf/,

I (F22) met this guy (m22) last December, we became friends and then later on it evolved into something more.

At the time i wasn‚Äôt ready for anything because i was afraid of relationships but since my feelings grew deeper i was considering getting over my fear of being in a relationship and actually being with him. We care about each other a lot and the relationship has evolved into something sexual.

We both are musicians, he was in a band which he left over the summer because he felt like it was going nowhere. The music he made didnt get a lot of views and shit, whereas i get thousands and even millions on mine. To me these numbers dont matter, but to him they do and i always felt like he felt bad whenever i talked about it so i eventually stopped.
I care about him a lot and sometimes feel guilty about my achievements. 

He would often say stuff like ‚Äúgirls get a lot of views on their videos simply because theyre girls‚Äù which made me think that maybe my music is only getting attention because im a female and not because im talented. But when i asked him if he thinks that way about me he said he meant that for other girls on instagram/youtube. But im an overthinker so sometimes it does fuck w me and makes me doubt myself.

He eventually told me that he envies me and talking about anything music related makes him feel bad about himself. We care about eachother a lot. I never bring up this topic in front of him but sometimes i wish he was supportive of it and felt happy for me. my feelings for him have grown deep but he says he cant be with me because it wouldnt be fair to me.

"Grandma is coming home for the holidays tonight. In less than three hours, actually.

We like to at least pretend that we're keeping afloat when grandma comes home. So, I wanted to go to the store to get her favorite cake mix, as well as some things for Christmas dinner and some general groceries to make it look like we aren't consistently starving out of a desire to avoid each other in the kitchen. I'll be paying for and cooking everything, as I always do. I'll definitely be cleaning after, too. If anyone helps, they'll act like they're being *so* generous, and they'll feel offended at the notion that it's the bare minimum.

I reminded my mother about the need to go to the store several days in a row. I'm unlicensed due to disability, and we have one functioning car. Grandma is sleeping in my mother's room with her, so my mother kept mentioning her need to clean it over the past few days (she's a hoarder). Well, my mother waited until the very last minute to clean her room after work tonight. She told me when she got off work today we'd go to the store after putting it off for a week. I reminded her in text about this earlier today, and she replied with a thumbs up. Now, it's just a few hours until grandma gets here, and my mother is tidying at a leisurely pace. If my mother had just told me when I texted her that she still wasn't done cleaning, I could've had time to order the groceries. It would've costed more, but it would've been here. Grandma will come home to an empty fridge.

My uncle put the tree up tonight, threw a garland around it, then told me to put the ornaments and the rest of the decorations up on my own before rushing off. Don't real families do things like that together? We're not a real family, not even close. We're just playing house because we happened to be born together.

The family left a pile of dishes dirty in the kitchen after I just cleaned it for grandma's arrival, so I cleaned it again. They leave their deodorant, medication, lotion, and toothpaste in the kitchen, but my uncle gets mad when I leave my scones in there. He says I should keep them in my room because they're ""in the way"" of the wall.

And before any genius says it, of course we have all tried to move out. We've all tried to break away from this family house to no avail, at the cost of one another. Economy just doesn't permit it. Not a single one of us in the entire extended family are above the poverty line.

I hate this. I hate them. I'm surrounded by people and all alone. Any little tiny bit of holiday joy I feel exists outside of them. I'm in school trying my hardest to get a degree and escape with no debt so I can never look back at them, but the meantime sucks so bad.

These people are useless. They're leeches. I've bailed us out of so many late mortgage and utility payments into the thousands, and yet I'm sure they'll be mad when they don't get Christmas gifts. Here's a fucking roof over your head. How's that for a loving gift from the newest adult in the household? I'm literally still a teenager. Is it so hard for them to be better?

None of my friends understand. Their families aren't perfect of course, but they're at least close to each other. They're responsible. Not like these emotionally immature idiots.

I want to be on my own so bad. Better yet, I want a found family. A real one.

It has gotten to the point where I try to talk it through with him and he will get really angry with me and, for example, hang up the phone if it is not in person. If it is in person he usually just becomes distant. 
I asked him if he just doesn‚Äôt like girls that way and that upset him too, which I don‚Äôt entirely think is true either because he likes other sexual aspects of me. 
Just knowing that doing that to me feels like a chore to him makes me feel so gross about myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I understand cutting out sexual activity is an option but it feels like it goes further than that because it is going to sit in the back of my mind with that invasive thought that he doesn‚Äôt like my body.

"i‚Äôve been fat as long as i can remember and i still am. i don‚Äôt even think i particularly eat that much. i drink coffee in the morning as my breakfast, i usually skip out on lunch, i eat dinner and a couple snacks throughout the day. but i‚Äôve never been able to lose the weight. i know i‚Äôm obese and i know its out of control but i just don‚Äôt have the dedication to exercise. these last couple years i‚Äôve come to accept it but sometimes its really hits me hard. whenever i try to buy pants i can never get them around my ass and it just reminds that im huge so i pretend it was some other issue like ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt like the material.‚Äù if someone asks. or sometimes i catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and i realize just how big i am. usually when these things happen i think about it for hours and i tell myself i‚Äôm not gonna eat tomorrow and ill only eat dinner for the rest of the week. i never go through with it and it just makes me feel worse. i have a doctors appointment coming up and i also had a dentist appointment at the same time so i begged my mom to reschedule my doctors appointment instead of my dentist appointment because i know that my weights gonna be brought up. she yelled at me and told me of course they‚Äôre gonna bring it up and she then started screaming at me about how by the time im 20 i‚Äôll barely be able to do anything physical. i really dont get why she would say that to me the way she did. that‚Äôs such an awful thing to say, especially to your own kid. it made me feel terrible and disgusted with myself. if no one in the world was there to remind me to be disgusted with myself i knew my mom would always make sure i knew how gross my body is. because of her i‚Äôve always been so conscious of how fat i looked to other people since second grade. she made me feel different that everyone else. she ruined my relationship with food and sometimes i wonder if maybe she was kinder about it i wouldn‚Äôt have lost so many childhood experiences just because i was embarrassed of my size. maybe i wouldn‚Äôt still be fat.

"I (25F) still live at home with my mother and siblings while I work my way through school.There are so many things I want to do with my life but my family's debts and burdens and issues are always in the way. I get backed into a corner and guilted into sacrificing my wants for the wants/needs of the household. As the oldest, this has always been the case. I'm the second breadwinner in the house while my 20F sister doesn't hold down a job but shops and travels all the time and comes home to be nasty to everyone, sleep all day and complain and insult me.

My mom rarely says anything. My teenage brother and I have a good relationship and he's just generally an annoying little brother at times. My mom and I get along well for the most part but we're very codependent. I feel like I try to move forward in life but she always guilts me into doing what she wants or fear mongers and berates me out of taking leaps in ways that aren't her way. 

Even if she doesn't, somehow, whenever I have plans for myself, she has an emergency that she NEEDS me to sacrifice my money or time for. I know a lot of time she's just struggling to make ends meet and I am very grateful for her but it's almost like her burdens weigh me down too. I can't just have a fresh clean slate like any other 20 something bc my mom has put me in the position of parent jr. I'm exhausted and I just want my own life. I fear that if I don't get out from under her that I will become her. I feel horrible even saying it bc I love my mom and I adore her, she's one of the best people I know. 

But she's had a hard life and she's lived for others her whole life bc when she was 12, her parents forced her to raise her niece and nephews bc my aunt wasn't fit. She never broke out from under my grandmom and her guilt trips and manipulation and now she does the same thing to me. I've pushed back against it somewhat, but when the choice is, ""cancel your plans and help pay this bill or the utilities will be cut off"" it's not a choice really. I'm paying for not just my choices but her poor choices as well and my grandmother's before her. It makes a little part of me resentful even though I understand.

We‚Äôre halfway through the process of the year. She can‚Äôt go to school because her immune system is weak. Even catching the smallest thing as a common cold will sent her back to the hospital. So she stays home with me while I do college online.

My sister acts so sassy and privilege because of her condition. People think she‚Äôs on her death bed giving her gifts and stuff but in reality she‚Äôs fine.

"Hi all, I (25 F) have been holding this secret since i was about 9 years old.  


For context, my dad is a gangmember and was always around a bunch of rough and rowdy guys.but he had a small circle of close friends, his best friends were named uncle robert and he had a friend i will call MIKE  
when my mom and dad had their first child, they named him after Mike, and four years later they had me.  


When i was 9 years old, and for about a year i was SA by mike senior while my parents did not know, when my dad found out, he beat mike senior until he was unrecognisable and my dad was sent to prison for excessive use of force and aggravated assault for many years (he was not a good prisoner and would get time added on his sentence) so my brother and i grew up without a father for most of our lives.  


For years my brother mike blamed me because he was never told about the details, only that our dad had beat someone up because of me.  


I never heard it against him since he didn't know any better and i didn't want to tell him the truth.  


two years ago mike senior died and i felt so happy, which made me feel horrible, he had children and grandchildren, and here i was cheering that my personal monster was deleted.  


I have never explained what had happened to me to my brother but it has taken a toll on me to have to say my grapists name almost daily my whole life. i am very close to my brother, but i have often called him a variety of nicknames to get around it.  


while i was drinking with my brother tonight, he asked me why i always called him goofy nicknames and it was like all the trauma i had boxed up came rushing out.  


how could i tell my big brother that i refused to say his name because he was named after an abuser.  


I would rather take this info to the grave but it has taken a toll on me to keep this to myself.

"TW: potential domestic violence.

For context my home life has never exactly been simple. ive had a stepdad for about 8/9 years now and honestly i dont like him.my mom and dad fought like hell when i was younger, so i have a fear response to fights because of trauma. mom finally kicked dad out when i was 11 and my sister was 2. she married my step dad when i was 17 and my sister was 8. At first everything was fine and we got along okay. but then he started saying i had to call him dad. If i didnt anything i asked for was an automatic no untill i asked by calling him dad. i pushed back but they wouldnt budge so i gave in for a bit, i also couldnt mention my real father because sd would get upset.now 

about a year later my mom and sd would get into yelling matches. one night i over heard the fighting and i opened my door to see what was wrong, seeing the fight gve me flashbacks to my parents and i started crying before i knew it . my mom yelled at him to shut up doesnt he hear some one crying. they both stopped to turn and look at me. i slammed the door and sat against it, just sobbing and having a panic attack. my sd came and tried to enter my room but i stayed against the door so he couldnt i told him to go away.

after this he would start picking fights with me over tiny stuff. for example he threw my backpack with new ipad in it across the room because he tripped on it. i told him he cant do that, what if it broke he wouldnt pay to fix it. he got in my face and cornered me yelling im attacking him cause his dad died. ( his dad had passed about 3 months prior) telling me to go ahead and hit him while tapping his cheek egging me on while my mom stayed on the couch and did nothing. i asked my mom to come get her man and she did nothing. i managed to get away and run out of the apartment. he retaliated by cutting off my phone for 3 days because i ran away. he loves blaming all the fights and arguements on me constantly saying its always my fault even when its not.

now heres the reason for why im writing this post. so on saturday night i came home straight after work. originaly i was gonna go shopping but i felt i had to go home. when i get home i sit in the living room talking to my mom. about school and life etc. then she says shes gonna go for a smoke. ( she doesnt smoke inside because of me and my sister) so she goes to get ready to go out, i head to my room. once i put my stuff down i head to my sisters room to ask her what she wants for Christmas. while me and my sister are talking i faintly hear raised voices coming from the living room. I figure its minor. but then i hear my sd yell "" Hit me go ahead and hit me do it "" and my mom yells back "" you want a fucking brawl is that what you want?"" at this point i tell my sister to stay in her room and im gonna go see whats going on. I open the door carefully once im in the hall i hear a thud like someone or something just fell. i run to the living room and see my mom on her back on the floor. hands behind her head and my sd standing near her feet facing her just standing there. looking at her. i immediately run back to close my sisters door then head back and call for my mom. she doesnt answer. my sd sees me and sayd "" of course this happens the day you come home early."" i rush to my mom kneeling by her head. shes crying but atleast shes awake. i tell her im right here its okay.i try to check the back of her head to see if there are any injuries theres no blood thank god. after i start helping then sd tried to help her up and she yells at him to not touch her and smacks him away. while im helping i hear my stepdad say "" i was only defending myself and she slipped"" but im not even paying any attention to him. i help my mom up and ask if shes sure shes okay. she says shes fine and just needs space so she goes for a smoke. i go back to my room to grab a hoodie to go check on her. and my sd yells

sd: dont go escalating things

op: im going to check on my mother which im allowed to do

sd: if you go im cutting your phone, your breaking our deal

op: no your not i pay for it with my money so you cant nd what deal i never made one

sd: its in my name, ya the sea where you wont escalte things between me and mom

op: and its my money i have recipts to prove i gave you money to pay it on my behalf. i tell the cops my self, ( we are on a family plan ) i never made that deal wtf are you talking about.

sd then says a whole bunch more bs ending with "" suck on that buttercup"" and accuses me of stealing from him but wont say what i stole and on and on, honestly he's become quite th professional victim tbh.  i say im afraid of him ( i mean at this point idk what this man is capable of ) he says hes scared of me. he manages to watse time and my mom comes back i tell her what he said about the plan and i leave the apartment. once im outside i breakdown sobbing. I was so scared for my mom and that whole situation was a lot.on sunday i met a friend for lunch and they drove me to my house so i could pack a few things. im currently crashing at my friends house for the time being. i need space to process everything that just happened. im really blessed to have a network of friends that can help me get away.

"I'm a middle aged woman, married with a family, not the best upbringing (narcissistic, emotionally immature parents, have some trauma from that) but overall pretty happy, successful, functioning well. But I get these weird crushes/hyperfixations on public figures sometimes and it just feels really dumb and in my head I just want to shame myself constantly about it so I can't even really enjoy the associated dopamine.

Case in point, a few months ago I developed one of these crushes on a politician (also middle aged) who happened to be in the news. Not just a politician (a profession I have a lot of loathing for), but one whose views I don't particularly share (to put it nicely). I don't think he'd be considered handsome in any sort of mainstream way (especially because he's short) but he does fall into my weird kind of type, which I guess is why that happened. 

So here I am, an adult professional sitting here reading any interview with this guy I can find, listening to every dumb podcast he's appeared on (multiple times, let's be honest). Just having great affection for someone who is doing a job whose existence I think makes the country worse, supporting policies that I definitely feel have made the country worse. But he seems like a really good dad! And he's funny! And he actually has a record of going across the aisle to get things done! And he's speaking out against the actions of people in his party who are particularly bad! 

But I'm just rationalizing this crap and my brain will have none of it. It tells me I'm a weirdo for having a crush like this at my age when I should be focusing on my family, and on someone most people wouldn't take a second look at. It tells me I'm a freak because I'm attracted to people others aren't. It makes me question my morals because I'm spending so much time thinking about someone whose values are so different from mine, etc etc. 

I'm sure some of this comes from how I was raised. My parents ridiculed me any time I did anything that could be remotely considered wrong. When I was a teenager my mom in particular would mock my taste when I'd bring up being attracted to a classmate or some sort of celebrity. My brain takes every opportunity to tell me I've failed in some way or that my innocent thoughts somehow mean I'm not good enough. I'm working on that and a bunch of other stuff in therapy but y'all know that can be slow going. 

So I'm just here ranting to you random folks on reddit in hopes that it'll help me enjoy that weird crush dopamine a little more with a little less of the guilt and self loathing.

We recently bought a house together in 2019 than this news hit me and lockdown happened due to COVID.
 So for 2 months I continued our routine not saying a work to any of our friends or family and just getting scolded by her and demanding I sleep in the garage so nobody would know of this and I just numbingly agreed not knowing what was gonna happen and didn‚Äôt wanna pin our daughter between us. One day I decided to just leave and lived in my car for 2 months and luckily my boss was pretty cool and comped me a hotel to live in for a month as a benefit to healthcare workers as to not infect their household. Later my dad got diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and i spiraled even more. I later moved in with my parents and only told my dad about the break as to not worry my mother who also was a dialysis patient due to kidney failure from her diabetes from years ago. So I used this as my alibi to my daughter that I was watching over them. 

By the end of 2020 I got hit with a strain of COVID that nearly killed me and I stayed in my room for a whole month not knowing if I‚Äôd make it and missed Christmas and new years. 2021 I got a new boss who harassed me during pandemic and almost fired me over false accusations until I got HR involved and dissolved the case. 2022 started to feel a lil bit better I got used to my new routine as I lived with my parents I watched over my daughter every chance I got and dropped a lot of friends to maintain my fatherhood. Than halfway through the year some of my ex‚Äôs best friends reached out to me and they have kids so I agreed to hang as it gave my daughter other kids to play with, as some time passed they opened up to me saying that my ex painted a picture of me as a monster and they said they didn‚Äôt see it and told me the truth of her affairs and my suspicions were valid. Again I spiraled. 
At the end of 2022 I began picking myself together again.

Than the worse thing I imagined happened, on my parent anniversary of early 2023 my mom passed away from an accident at home while I was at work. I came home to my brother and dad crying and I kept telling them and myself ‚ÄúMom is strong she‚Äôll pull through.‚Äù As I heard she fell in the shower I went to the bathroom and stared at the bathroom covered in blood and I just kept saying she‚Äôs gonna make it. I began to spiral again and continued my routine again as to stay strong for my dad and my brother and my daughter. I never cried until her funeral and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say a word. Months later I kept at it again for my family that a lot of people thought I wasn‚Äôt that affected.

More and more I‚Äôve become numb and I find myself screaming inside, while on the outside I‚Äôm laughing and joking around and doing all that is needed of me.

"I feel so conflicted about my dad's ex wife coming over to take care of my dad while I'm away for the holidays. I just wanna rant a bit about it. 

I'm going to Indiana to meet my boyfriend's family on new years! In the beginning, I refused to go because I have to take care of my ill dad. He has pulmonary fibrosis, so his mobility and ability to do every day chores is extremely limited. I have a hip injury myself that gives me pain 24/7, but I still try my best to keep the house clean and keep up with cooking the meals. 

I told my brother about the opportunity, and he insisted I went, that I deserve a break and to let him look for someone willing to take care of our dad. At first, we found this really kind church lady, who happened to be one of my dad's old coworkers, so I was more than fine with it, until she cancelled last minute. I was informed 20 min or so ago that my dad's ex is in town, and had offered to stay both Christmas and New Years to take care of my dad and help with chores.

Now, I would've been ok with it if I hadn't heard so many stories about how horrible this woman is. She'd leave her 3 kids with my mom while she went out partying. My half sister told me all the awful stories about her mom while growing up. Everyone I know who knows this woman only had bad things to say about her. 

My dad and brother are ok with this lady staying over, but I can't leave to Indiana knowing she'll be the one taking care of my dad. What if she decides to bring up the past? What if she treats my dad wrong while I'm away :( I'm really worried. Before I leave I'm going to keep a close eye on her and see how she behaves.

"Please bare with me. This will be a little long and im still not able to find words to express how I feel and Im writing this feeling broken. Ill try to include as much info as possible for clarity. Im also not from the US. Sorry if its not written properly.

My BF(M32) is the father of my child. We were together for 9 years before breaking up as we were growing apart. No cheating on either of us part, and we were fairly peaceful after the break up. 4 years after we split, I met my Ex. We dated for two years before breaking up. And a few months ago I got back with my BF.

Some back story for clarity:

When I (F31), met my Ex(M20) he was 17 years old( a few months away from being a legal adult in my country, age 18). To note, he told me he was 19, I found out his real age a few weeks later. Also, dating younger men is not a thing I do, but there was something special about him. Our 11 year age difference caused a huge issue with everyone, from my family, to friends, to neighbors, which also contributed to us breaking up after two years together. A decision I will forever regret.

Along with the pressure from everyone about age, he got involved into something illegal (something that would be considered a white collar crime in the USA, with a fine as penalty), and I broke it off telling him he needs to grow up. He moved to another area after I cut contact with him. This was over a year ago and a few days ago I was told he was killed. 

His death is the most painful thing I have ever experienced. I can't function. I can't eat, I can't breathe and I don't think I can survive. He is all I think about. And the worst part is that If we were still together he would still be alive right now. If we were still together he would not have moved town, he would not have been in that car, and he would not have been killed. 

I knew I loved him. But I just never realized how much until now. And I will never get the opportunity to tell him. I was so angry at him for what he did and I never told him I forgave him. Everyone keeps telling me that there is no way to know for sure and that I can't blame myself. But I know, I know deep down that he would still be here today if I had just sent one, just one text. He would have rushed back to me and he would still be alive. I gave up on him. He begged me for another chance and I gave up on him. And I will never forgive myself. 

His death made me realize how not great my current relationship is. How unhappy I am. My bestfriend says its just grief and that its because my mind is not in a good place right now. But I don't know how to feel. 

Im angry that I made so many outside persons influenced me. And Im so angry that all they saw was this huge age difference and nothing more. They never saw how I had to beg the guy I was with for 9 years to do stuff over and over again, when at times I didn't even have to ask my Ex even once. They never saw how much my Ex made me laugh, and how much he went over and beyond to make me happy. All they saw was that he wasn't taking care of me financially and how childish he was to them. And right now I would give anything to see his childish antics just one more time. 

Every time I look at my BF, all i can do is compare him to my EX and Im mad at myself for feeling this way.","My Ex Died, And Not Only Do I Blame Myself, It Made Me Realize How Much I Not Happy With My Current BF.",18lru3x,1702955990.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lru3x/my_ex_died_and_not_only_do_i_blame_myself_it_made/,
"Hi everyone. First time posting here.

My cousin is getting married in a few days. I decided last month, and I‚Äôve told my parents, that I won‚Äôt be attending. I‚Äôm very close to that cousin. She said she‚Äôll be really sad if I didn‚Äôt go.

For context, I decided against going as I tried to take my own life last month. Im in a pretty bad place both mentally and financially, And knowing I‚Äôll be witnessing my cousins happiest day in her life would just be a big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to my current predicament. I don‚Äôt think I can handle being around my family. The other reason is that I don‚Äôt really want to see my family at a big gathering because‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt like them that much.
I don‚Äôt mind being around them, in fact I like it, if I don‚Äôt stick around. But in my current mental state I feel like my head would explode.

My family doesn‚Äôt know but sometimes when I can‚Äôt handle something I‚Äôd go find somewhere to be alone (where they can‚Äôt find me) and cry, even though I look perfectly normal during a family gathering. I‚Äôm still processing everything that happened last month. I dont want to revisit that dark place again.

I think in my current state of mind, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to be in that situation. I know this is asshole behaviour. But, I don‚Äôt want to go back to that dark place again. Maybe I‚Äôll come off as a self-centered asshole in the future, but at least I‚Äôll be alive. And hopefully, doing better.

If anyone has any advice to share regarding dealing with these situations, please give me some. I don‚Äôt take advice from my family because they usually turn into comments about my appearance (I‚Äôm a guy btw)


P.s. I‚Äôm formerly obese, lost a bit of weight, started going to the gym, so I gained that weight back (in muscle). I also dyed my hair red (although I‚Äôm in the process of dying it back to my natural hair color to look for jobs. Besides, I‚Äôm done with edgy looks. It hurts to hear these things over and over again because I‚Äôm not doing what they said because I got too busy at school).
Before going to the gym, they didn‚Äôt like my hair. which wasn‚Äôt ok, but reasonable. But now they comment on my size!! They said I‚Äôm too big! Even though I‚Äôm feeling stronger, friends say I‚Äôm looking better, they said ‚Äúguys should be skinny‚Äù

Like seriously. I don‚Äôt mind shedding the fat off to reveal more muscles but the chopstick look they want guys to have is simply not my thing! Also, potential employers won‚Äôt be turned off by this. Which makes this even more strange. This hurts to hear because getting to my current size isn‚Äôt as easy as paying someone.

"I don't even know where to begin. I'm tired of shattering into thousands of pieces. You would think I'd have hardened by now. Put up several walls to protect myself. Perfected a face made of stone. But no... there's no hardness here. Rather than building a wall brick by brick, it feels like my wall keeps getting chipped away. From life, from others, from circumstance. It just keeps getting chipped and chipped, and I crumble and crumble. I increasingly feel as though there's not much left of me other than pure, overwhelming emotion. I cry nearly every single day now.

I know that there are others out there who have it much worse than me. Please don't think that I'm ignorant to the evils of life. My step-cousin was &gt;!gang-raped and murdered!&lt; at the age of 10 a few years ago. (And no, I do not want to write more about it. It's too painful.) My Uncle died from pancreatic cancer during the height of covid. My Mom has lost both of her parents, and she's also had cancer twice. My Dad was horrifically abused as a child to the point where the paternal side of my family pretends that my biological grandmother never existed. I thought that my step-grandma was biologically related to me until the age of 13.

I know that I seem like some spoiled upper middle class sheltered girl who was simply too stupid or lazy to achieve the same type of success as her mother. My Mom, globally renowned in her field. I, on the other hand, never graduated university.

I will not go into all the dirty details about my childhood, but most therapists I've talked to about it have described it as abusive. The abuse my Dad went through carried over into his relationship with my mother. When they divorced, I think she resented the half of me that came from him. She took it out on me. She often pretended to abandon me, too.

I learned to hate myself. To see myself as a demon. That I was the primary instigator of all my family's problems. I wonder, sometimes, if this is why I grew up hating my physical appearance so much. It was something more tangible to hate rather than the psychic dread I felt over my mere existence ‚Äî the knowledge that both of my parents would've been happier without me.

I have never, ever, ever once admitted this to a single soul until now: but I grew up hating myself so much that I've never even kissed anyone. I have never, ever allowed myself to become intimate with a single soul. (I'm a 34 year old female.)

No one was exactly beating down my doors, but I think a few boys had crushes on me in high school... eventually, though, I mistreated myself so much that I became genuinely repulsive to most people, largely due to depression-induced hygiene issues. It's only been in recent years that I've polished myself off and started to lose weight, although I would still like to lose some more. I've lost 50 lbs and would like to lose an additional 20-30.

Like I mentioned before, I never graduated university. I did quite well in my courses until I was a) hit by a car as a pedestrian, and b) my grandfather died a month later. It was too much. Anytime I tried to walk to class, I would panic and run back home. I failed my courses and was kicked out.

And I've just been an aimless blob ever since, rarely able to make enough money to survive, much less thrive. My Mom has had to help me quite a bit... ... for what it's worth, our relationship is much better these days, although I'm still coming to terms with my childhood.

I thought I had finally found a way to make it all work recently. I got a job with a midsized law firm, and people there actually liked me. I have always struggled to fit into most places, but for some reason, I just clicked in that environment. They called me sunshine.

One of my coworkers raved about me to a different, much smaller firm. The new firm was hiring a legal assistant. My coworker said that I deserved better than the menial job I had at the midsized firm. I got the new job and felt so excited about the future.

But it's been a disaster, and my mental health is currently hanging on by a thread. I am one of three people here: it's just me and the two lawyers I work for. I struggle to make myself understood by them. The ""big boss"" interrogates me constantly, sighs dramatically if I ask a question, swears out of frustration with me... I feel so much anxiety there every single day. But the worst part about all of it is feeling like I'm not being taken in good faith. It's obviously fine if someone tells me I'm wrong, but it upsets me if they think it's out of carelessness or laziness or any other bad character trait. I care about my job and I care about making people's lives easier. I don't want people to think that I'm being... bad. Just like how I grew up feeling all the time.

I just want to find something that I love and am good at.

I also just want to *be* loved. I just want to feel beautiful. I want someone to see me and want to be close to me. I want to love them too and caress their fingers with desire; kiss their shoulders when they feel small.

But I barely feel like a person anymore with this chipped away wall. I feel like the ocean. Just a mass of liquid with no solid form.

"i mean, it's just what the title says.

i had a friend, f16, and we were friends since 2nd grade. that's probably why i'm taking this so hard. this past summer, she got a boyfriend. at first, i was excited for her because you know--that's what friends do. we support each other. it *was* exciting, she was entering a new part of her life. i wanted to know all about it, that's not the unfortunate part.

really quickly, she started to drift away from me. i understood that because she needed to spend time with this new person in her life. it just sucked when we would hang out and she would literally be texting him as if i wasn't right there. then there was the my-boyfriend-is-the-only-thing-i-talk-about part which is so much fun...

now she just doesn't talk to me at all and i don't know if i should break off our friendship. she told me (when we did talk) about how she can't ever ignore her boyfriend and hasn't gone more than two hours without talking to him but then ignores my messages for days which quickly turn into weeks. she doesn't even tell me about her boyfriend anymore, which rubs salt in the wound. even though it got annoying sometimes, at least she'd talk to me. whenever i have something that's important to me to share she just doesn't care at all. i don't know, it's really dismissing because she's saying without saying that nothing that happens to me equates to what happens to her.

"We are both accountants working in the same company but different locations. We met 4 years ago at a company conference in Chicago when we first started our first full-time jobs. The conference was a week long and we would hang out every night with a group of coworkers from various cities. Since then, we would text here and there but never saw each other in person. Last week, our company had a 4 day conference with over 1,000 personnel. Everyone we hung out with from that group 4 years ago has since left the company except for the 2 of us.

On the last night of the conference, I asked if he wanted to hang out at the hotel bar and catch up on life since we didn‚Äôt get to see each other at all. We hung out at the bar for about 20 minutes before deciding it was too loud and it was better to talk in one of our rooms. After an hour of talking and catching up in his room, we slowly started getting closer and one thing lead to another. 

We are both single and want long-term relationships but haven‚Äôt had much luck.

"Hes had a sense of disconnection from others; like being alone in a room full of people; since elementary school. Middle school he found some nice folks and rode with them for a while. The feeling came back around the last year of middle to the first year of high school. In high school he still had his friends, but the connection was different, it was starting to fade. There were times where it was reignited, and for a while he was ok. As he grew into adulthood, through college and into the workforce, he learned how to establish very shallow relationships with other people. He really needs people he can click with, but he couldn't find his tribe. Alas, a middle ground was struck where he kept people at a distance. Well, COVID came around and he got it. He had a heavy depressive rut and a new feeling came about that resulting in the fantasy of ill intention on the self. This has been an issue into the present, however he knows better and doesn't lose. He moved and caught sick again. This time it caused issues with catching his breath and having any drive or motivation. He started dropping weight from 170-190 range down to a stable 150-155. Recently he started getting into accepting his emotions and learning how to handle them responsibly and with love, rather than ignoring them or sacrificing them for another. He's taken a new interest and perspective on religion and beliefs because of this, more accepting and loving rather than questioning and judging. In the past two years he's met several people that seemed to make him feel something different on the inside. It's like a flower trying to open up but is stuck. Like the sun is stuck in the sky holding back the moon, he loves the night, though the day is beautiful too. However he always feels too ill when these opportunities cross him, and he works so hard to get his shit together, not caring who thinks what, because that's who he is. The downside is other people feel that too, and don't want anything to do with it. He doesn't hold it against them, butnhe can't help but think if he makes others uncomfortable or fearful because he wants to go home so bad, but refuses to give up. 

This is why I feel ill, I want to go home, but I don't. I've made up my mind to stay, but it's like I doubt the weight of my own choice and withdraw later. This manifests as heavy emotions and mental distraction. I'm ready to let this I'll fate pass over and through me. 

If you feel down, go ahead and start learning how to help yourself up, it's not intuitive to everybody, and will take some time. Even if you're not and you feel happy most of the time, it would be a great idea to learn, when making habits is easier. If you're young, you may be trying to bottle things up because you're tough. It will pop out later in life. Like a vine that grows through you before sprouting it's thorns at once. 

If you feel anxious, and for some reason people make you nervous, anxious, whatever: address it with truth and compassion. In my humble experience it can turn to fear before you know it. I used to be anxious, however that anxious feeling has turned up into a heigtned state that makes it very difficult to let my guard down around others, and a shell shock experience when caught off guard. Think of someone who's peaceful being stuck in fight or flight, for no good reason. And no I didn't get beaten as a kid. 

It's getting put up here for several reasons. 
1. Typing things out is a nice and efficient means of putting how I feel down on ""paper"". 
2. I know someone will see this, maybe even read through that monster of....feelings and thoughts. 
3. To hopefully show someone or teach another something that enables them to be a better version of themselves, as they may be hitting brick walls where it seems life is telling you to figure it the f*** out yourself. 
4. In person is difficult to open up, I don't stay on topic and will usually exhaust myself before getting anywhere of real value. This enables me to articulate much better and feel seen / heard at the very least. It's therapeutic.

He was in therapy for a year and half and it seemed like he was really trying at times, but two years in I recognized it was the same unhealthy cycle repeating itself. I had strict boundaries that he continued to ignore. It was painful, but in one of his rage moments, he broke up with me, and I decided to not go back this time to end the cycle. I tried so hard to stay in his life and be friends because I knew he struggled immensely with his mental health, but the manipulation and verbal abuse became too much and I had to go no contact. I had to change my number and block him on everything. He did continue reaching out through new emails he would create, begging for me back and saying he was really trying, but in reality it turns out he was drinking heavily and ultimately masking to everyone how much he was struggling. The night it happened, he emailed me a long story of our love, how much he loved me and he knew I loved him. This was at 1:37 am. Ten minutes later he sent another email stating, ‚ÄúI am probably going to die soon. I hope you come to my funeral.‚Äù I did not read these until around 12pm the next day. I messaged his mom and therapist to check on him. 
His parents found him; he had hung himself while high on fentanyl :(
A week before this, he showed up at my house, begging for a conversation, but I told him no and shut the door. I regret this soo much even though I know at the time I was following my boundaries. I never expected that to be the last time I saw him. 
I am beyond devastated and keep wondering if I hadn‚Äôt gone no contact, would he still be here? The grief is so heavy. I am in therapy and I keep telling myself it was his choice, but the what if‚Äôs and why‚Äôs and memories of the good times haunt me. I can‚Äôt stop thinking of the last words he told me.

Whenever women and teenage girls stand or sit next to me, I push them away and tell them off. If you animals really want to be perverts or are looking for a boyfriend, go up to shorter men instead, women and girls look much better with them anyways. Shorter men were most likely mistreated for their height, which makes them deserve women more than guys my size. I'm not in the dating pool, **I don't want a girlfriend**. Leave us tall men alone!

"There was a stray kitten (2-3 months old) in the park that was thin and weak. Over three weeks I would go and feed it, but the park was half an hour away. I never saw its parents and it seemed to be getting weaker. 

Then last week I decided to take it to my place to properly feed it and also give it medicine and affection. He loved to come on my lap or in my arms and knead. I put him into our yard (I couldn't take him inside because of my roomates). There are a lot of stray cats here (Turkey), I didn't think it would be unsafe.  But my neighbor complained that he would climb into her balcony and sleep there. She wanted him away. I found someone who wanted to adopt him and was going to bring him there, but on that day (last Thursday) she took him away and I haven't seen him since then. 

It was only 2 days since I brought him here. He was starting to get better and more active after I had dewormed him. I searched for him everywhere, many people in my neighborhood helped me too. They all love cats here, but I had to have that one heartless neighbor for whom not having the cat in the balcony was more important... I had a gut feeling about her. She even lied to me on the first day when she brought him away. 

I feel sad whenever I see a stray cat here well taken care of and healthy because it reminds me of this kitten and I don't know if he is safe. I acted too late. I hope that he has a warm and safe place to sleep and knead in and that he can be comfortable and relaxed and that he is not hungry and without love.","My neighbor brought away a weak stray kitten I was taking care of, now he is lost",18lqjjf,1702952170.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lqjjf/my_neighbor_brought_away_a_weak_stray_kitten_i/,
"(Mobile) I‚Äôm 22F. In my teen years, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and also struggled a lot with a compulsive disorder called trichotillomania. My depression is mostly ok now although it has its moments. But in its place I think anxiety took root and not it‚Äôs taking over my life. But it‚Äôs hard for me to tell if the thoughts I have are normal or should be inspected.

I can‚Äôt go a day without thinking something bad is going to happen to me. I am almost convinced that I am going to become terminally ill or pass in an accident. I look at social media and see how many people my age or younger unexpectedly pass and all I can think about is, ‚ÄòThat could be me, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do to prevent that‚Äô. On a similar note, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my own mortality and the mortality of my parents, partner and loved ones. Knowing that our lives could be snuffed out at any moment and will eventually be, is terrifying. 

I think my thoughts are beginning to affect my health. I‚Äôm finding it hard to eat and finish my meals.

"Earlier this year I (21M at the time, 22 now) experienced a break up &amp; because of it I decided it was time to turn a new leaf &amp; pursue a career in the music industry. We broke up in January &amp; I moved to Nashville in February. 

When I first got here, I had a job in sales &amp; quickly discovered I was no salesman. During that time, my ex (who lived in Memphis) &amp; I decided we would try to rekindle our relationship. Then a few weeks later I was ousted from my sales job, understandably for being bad at sales; but I didn‚Äôt like the job anyways so I didn‚Äôt consider it much of an L.

"I moved to a new city (and a whole new state) last year and started working at a job coaching a sport that is one of my main hobbies in life. It was my first time moving anywhere, and, already being a huge extrovert and social butterfly by nature, I went into major extrovert 3000 mode to make new friends and build my social circles in this new place.

Of course, most of these friends were at my new workplace, because that was also the place where I went to practice my hobby at least three days a week, not even including time spent working my shifts there. I made friends with my coworkers, and stupidly felt close to them because they were the only people in my social life at that time. I told them details about my personal life (mainly complaints about the crazy roommate I had moved in with) in efforts to connect and make close friends. However, this would be my downfall.

At the first staff party we had, only six days after I started working at this place, a random guy who didn't work there but was friends with some employees came up to me (and I was drunk) and got really inappropriate, in plain view of everyone. This made me feel so uncomfortable, especially in front of all these brand new coworkers/potential new friends. I was also drunk, which didn't help. I believe I roasted this guy's instagram that he was showing me (lol), as that unfortunately was how my discomfort manifested, and it wasn't in a harsh way at all, then walked away to talk to others and avoided this guy for the rest of the party. (This detail will be very important later).

Fast forward a month and a bit after this party, and I'm very happy. I have lots of friends in this community and am having a nice time working there. One day, I meet a guy who turns out to also work at this place, but only for a few hours a week and never when I'm working there. He asks me out on a date. I go for it, even though he is a coworker, because I just figure it could be fun to go on a date and it probably won't lead to anything... Well, the date goes *horribly*. Like, this guy was absolutely unhinged on this date. It was the most insane, weird, crazy, awful date of my entire life.

I then proceed to make the stupidest decision I could make. At work the next day, I tell my two coworkers (who I naively felt were my genuine friends, and that I was genuinely close with) about this date. Even though it is about this poor guy who also works there. My thought process at this time was that I was never ever going to see this guy again, and that he is legitimately crazy. I tell them not to tell anyone else, but of course they do. Or of course someone overhears us, or something like that. Because unbeknownst to me, rumours spread around the community like wildfire. They reach Date Guy's best friends, **who hear** **rumours that I said Date Guy was a ""r\*pist""**! Even though the details of the date I shared with coworkers of course mention NOTHING of that kind, and nothing remotely sexual in any way shape or form. (I only found this detail out a couple of weeks ago, even though it's been over a year since the date took place).

Date Guy asks me to give him a second chance. I don't really give a response, but then I have a bunch of accidental meet-cutes with him around the workplace over the next few weeks and get very positive vibes from him. After several of these, I decided to give him a second chance. We went on a second date and had a lovely time, and we went to grab a drink. After some alcohol was in his system, I told him to please explain his insane behaviour and actions on our first date. What was going on with him that night?? He only seemed completely different outside of it. He explained himself (it mainly chopped up to nerves and not having dated anyone for a very, very long time). I was satisfied with his explanation, and cautiously proceeded to date him for the next few months. Little did I know that my reputation in this community was already completely tarnished. *Girl cries r\*pe on coworker but then keeps dating him.* I can only guess it was something like that.

Coworkers who I thought were my friends stopped talking to me at work. Some outright ostracised me. At the time I did not understand why. I felt increasingly more alone and isolated. Then, after working there for many months, **I got fired out of the blue**. I was shocked. I had been doing a fantastic job there - in fact, the first shift I would have had after getting fired, all of my athletes I'd been coaching went as a group to the front desk and majorly protested about my termination and made a huge scene. Management had to provide them with big compensation. They all sent me personal, heartfelt emails about how disappointed they were and about how much of a wonderful coach I had been. How I had instilled in them a lifelong love for this sport. Not a single one of my coworkers reached out to me to see what happened or ask if I was okay after I got fired, not even the small few that were still kind and friendly to me at work and I thought might still be my friends.

I didn't understand any of what happened, but it felt awful and painful. Date Guy was now my boyfriend at this point. A few months later, I start working at a new workplace in the same city. Random Guy from that staff party many many months ago was working at this place. It turns out he was actually very close friends with Date Guy, and I had known this for a while before starting to work at this new place. On my first shift, I try being friendly and talking to him, but he seems very cold towards me. I go home to Date Guy after this and tell him about the interaction, and **Date Guy spills a huge story to me**.

Apparently Random Guy from the party, a few months prior (about five months after the party), was spending time with Date Guy and their group of best friends, and absolutely went off about me. Saying horrible, horrible things about me (even though I hadn't seen him or interacted with him at all since that party). I can only conclude that he felt very rejected by me at that party and harboured so many emotions about it all of that time, maybe coupled with some jealousy or an ego hit or something when I started going out with his friend. This hugely upset Date Guy of course, and Random Guy wouldn't apologise. Their whole friend group imploded. My boyfriend essentially lost all of his best friends all at once. Also, it turns out that they all thought that I forbid Date Guy from seeing his friends anymore, because they for some reason didn't understand why Date Guy was angry about what Random Guy did. So more and more and more drama had ensued, all surrounding me just trying my best to be myself in this new community amidst a difficult time (being alone and moving to a brand new place for the first time in my life).

The community that is such a major part of my life has just been nothing but tension, pain, discomfort, sadness, and awkwardness ever since that terrible first date with Date Guy. Now finally knowing all the details that were happening behind the scenes, I can only conclude that everything is karma from me harmfully gossiping to my coworkers after that date. I got my just desserts I guess. All people think/believe about me in this community now is that I'm someone that causes drama, or cries r\*pe about people, or god knows what else. No one knows the real me that my actual friends know. I have never felt so misunderstood and isolated, but I have to deal with the consequences.

There are so many more aspects to this story but it would be far too long to vent about here. I'm just going to move far away from here as soon as I can and leave everything behind. I will make sure to learn this lesson and not speak about my personal life in a workplace ever again. I will make sure to remember the harms of gossip. But it still really sucks that there is nothing I can do about this, and that the whole two years I'll have lived here will, for probably a very long time, feel like a painful memory and wasted time.","Everyone in my community thinks I'm an awful person and the opposite of who I truly am, and it's my own fault",18lq936,1702951298.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lq936/everyone_in_my_community_thinks_im_an_awful/,

Finding My Strength Through Adversity  
In the darkest moments of my life, I discovered an inner strength I never knew I had. It's been a journey filled with pain, loss, and heartache, but it's also been a path to self-discovery and resilience.  
Two years ago, I faced the most challenging period of my life. I lost my job, my long-term relationship ended, and I received a devastating health diagnosis. It felt like my world was crumbling around me, and I was overwhelmed by fear and despair.  
But as I navigated through these trials, I began to realize that adversity can be a powerful teacher. It forced me to confront my own vulnerability and question my priorities. It made me reevaluate what truly matters in life.  
During countless sleepless nights, I started to find solace in writing. I poured my thoughts and emotions onto paper, creating a diary of my struggles and triumphs. It became my therapy, my confidant, and my source of clarity.  
I also sought support from friends and family, who proved to be pillars of strength when I needed them the most. Their unwavering love and encouragement reminded me that I was not alone in this journey.  
Through therapy and self-reflection, I learned to manage my anxiety and cope with my health condition. I embraced mindfulness practices that helped me stay grounded in the present moment, no matter how uncertain the future appeared.  
Today, I can proudly say that I am in a much better place. I found a new job that aligns with my passions, I've forged deeper connections with the people I love, and my health is improving. But the most significant change has been within myself.  
I am stronger, more resilient, and more grateful for the simple joys in life. Adversity tested me, but it also transformed me into a person who values resilience, empathy, and self-acceptance.  
I share my story here not for sympathy or attention, but as a testament to the human spirit's capacity to endure and thrive. Life can be filled with challenges, but it's also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.  
Thank you for providing this space for me to share my deeply personal release. I hope that my journey can inspire others to find their inner strength and embrace the challenges that come their way.

"This is so dumb, but I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone about it because I‚Äôm too afraid they‚Äôll confirm it more. 

I (20F) have an ex (25M) who me and some friends like to joke around about, just because the entire situation left me uncomfortable and it‚Äôs easier to laugh about it. I‚Äôve had this friend for the better half of a decade, but we weren‚Äôt close during the time I‚Äôd dated my ex, so wasn‚Äôt aware of anything that happened. 

I told them what had happened, mainly to give context to the jabs and comments we made about him. In a nutshell, this guy had hit on me while I was in a prior relationship, and once that relationship was over I slept with him as some strange way to feel better about some things. We continued sleeping together for two months before he told me that he wasnt mentally ready for anything serious and didn‚Äôt want to lead me on if I was expecting a relationship. When I told him that I was alright with it, he immediately invited me over for sex, and it broke me out of whatever I was in and I ghosted him. 

This was last year, before I met my current partner and before this friend and I became close again. When I told the story to them in more detail, they laughed and joked ‚ÄúI say this with so much love, but you‚Äôre kinda a bad person,‚Äù and it shook me to my core. 

They couldn‚Äôt know, but my relationship with my father is a rocky one, and that was something he‚Äôd use constantly against me and it took years for me to convince myself that it was manipulation and not true. And my friend since we were kids just said it like a fact. I told my partner about it, because it deeply hurt me, and they told me how good I am and how they loved me, but then they said ‚ÄúI do see where they‚Äôre coming from‚Äù

I know it shouldn‚Äôt have, but that completely killed any comfort that they had given me. I ran away from the conversation and haven‚Äôt returned their texts since (a few hours ago) and I‚Äôm terrified because that‚Äôs exactly what I did to my ex that started this.

"I (26) was reading about Jonathan Majors while on the phone while on the phone with my now ex-boyfriend (28).I made a comment along the lines of hoping Majors never recovers from this and loses all of his money and brand deals.

know the full side of the story and I shouldn‚Äôt just support the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù side of things so quickly.

My ex then started to go on tirade about how women support each other no matter what they do. I wasn‚Äôt really listening. But when I heard ‚Äúthere should be time limitations on sexual assault accusations‚Äù is when I checked back in.

"Does anyone know that feeling, when someone has done something that really hurt and offended you, and then you (rightfully) get pissed off, but somehow instead of the perpetrator being criticized, somehow you're the bad guy for not tolerating it?

At best you get told to 'let it go' and 'forgive and forget' and at worst, you get called all sorts of unsavory things for holding a grudge? 

As though how you feel isn't important and that you don't matter, and you're wrong for wanting an apology, that it's okay for you to be mistreated?

It has happened quite a number of times, and TBH, it is just downright infuriating... you just keep quiet over time because nobody's listening anyway, but it does not mean the repressed anger goes away just like that.

Not justifying their actions of course, but I highly suspect this sort of thing is why school shooters are a thing, like 'If nobody cares and I'm the bad guy no matter what, then y'all should just burn'

And they're all almost exclusively male... when I think about it, this is most definitely a gender thing; women get more sympathy by default; I'm pretty sure if I were a woman, people would have heard me out and not just immediately dismiss me like that.

There are always complaints about women having a 'glass ceiling' and while I can acknowledge that's true even as a man, what people (and not just women even) don't seem to realize is that women have a 'floor' too; I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have these experiences if I were a woman. Like that's bad enough, but it's not even acknowledged; like at least it's acknowledged that women have a ceiling and how it's not okay; this isn't okay either but people don't seem to realize it.

I have of course done people wrong in the past and when called out, I do try to make amends and apologize (within reasonable parameters) because that's the right thing to do... of course I get that you can't expect the world to be decent just because you are, but at the very least you'd expect people to be more empathetic and acknowledge you have every right to feel wronged, but apparently not.

"I'm dated this guy for 9 months. Everything was great and ""perfect"". We broke up in May because he didn't want to let me meet his family because they wanted him to be with someone of his own culture (for reference im Dominican, he's Uzbek). But love is blind, so I stayed ""bestfriends"" with him while we continued having sex. Eventually I had sex with another dude and he found out and said he didn't want to get back together with me because of it. He stood talking to me though and we remained ""best friends"" all of summer. He was still lovebombing me and saying that we'll be together eventually he just ""isn't ready to commit"" but he was still taking me out on dates and doing relationship stuff with no problem.

Eventually we got to November and I got genital pimples/ burn ups and went to the doctor to get checked. They told me I had HSV1 and that i got it from my partner. Outright he denied it and said that I got it from the guy I was with. However, we used protection so I couldn't see how I would've got it from the guy. My sister and I made a plan to go to his house and confront him. Going to his house was a little crazy l'll admit but I wanted to see what he was hiding so bad because he was also so secretive and I knew limited info about his family life. 

Anyways, he refused to let me in and was kind of nervous the whole time so I told him that he either lets me in or I'II block him and never talk to him again. He thought about it and then just said no and closed the door in my face. I started crying and just blocked him and deleted all of our photos.


Fast forward a month later. He calls me on private and tells me to unblock him because he has to tell me something. He tells me that he's been going on dates with girls and that he had raw sex with a girl a couple of days ago. He even told me that he ejaculated in her and that she didn't take a plan b. 

I know I had sex with another person too so I can‚Äôt be mad and he‚Äôs single anyway. However, he doesn‚Äôt seem to care that he likely has a STD and is just having sex with no problem. Also I‚Äôm sure it was him because he clearly doesn‚Äôt have a problem having sex with people raw so that‚Äôs how he gave it to me. I‚Äôm honestly speechless and so sad that the person i thought was the sweetest/nicest guy turned out to be the complete opposite. He also said that he asked out his coworker which means he was eyeing her since we were together.

He is still denying that it was him (even though the only other guy I was with tested negative) who gave me the Herpes and he refuses to get tested. Also my doctor told me that there was a two week incubation period for Herpes so it would've been unlikely I got it from the other guy anyway and by the time I had my first outbreak it had been more than 20 weeks since I slept with someone other than him.

Anyway, I haven't told my parents I don't really know how to or if it's even worth telling them. I guess it's my fault for being dumb and continuing to see him. I got through my first outbreak luckily it came when I was on thanksgiving break for school so I didn't have to get up and go to class it was SOOO painful.

I felt very lonely, especially when my sister chose to be with our cousins, even if they treated her badly, while my mother, if she wasn't working hard, spent her time with her boyfriend at the time, a man with a lot of money, but controlling and who thought he was superior to everyone, even believing he had the power to correct me.I hardly ever saw my mother, and if I did, her boyfriend was always there.

I seem to remember telling her why I feel that way, but I don't know whether to tell her again that the reason I still drag that pain is because I fear that she is unhappy for choosing me over that man, that she has decided not to fall in love again because of me, or that I will never be enough to deserve her love compared to that man I still drag my teeth about when I hear him mentioned, and that I fear I will never be enough to deserve the love of anyone in the world.",I don't know why I still don't forgive my mother.,18lotfy,1702947213.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lotfy/i_dont_know_why_i_still_dont_forgive_my_mother/,

I find myself in Japan with A and F. A and I share a unique connection, somewhere between best friends and something more. F is more like a buddy, a reliable friend.

My feelings for A complicate things. She identifies as straight but often behaves in ways that suggest otherwise. F, knowing about my feelings, is playing detective to figure out if A might reciprocate. This 20-day trip is the longest we've spent together.

A's behavior has been perplexing for the past six months, and it's intensified on this trip. She's been playing a hot-and-cold game, showing signs of interest one moment and acting distant the next. F, being protective, is trying to decipher A's intentions.

The recent events have left me even more confused:

F's role in the game: During a drinking game, F seemed to showcase herself as a selfless person, subtly presenting herself as a better catch. It shifted the dynamic and made me feel less valued.
Cuddling dynamics: A didn't cuddle last night, and it felt strange given our previous interactions. F was in the same room, but the change in A's behavior left me sleep-deprived and emotionally drained.
Feeling overshadowed: Despite understanding that F is naturally a good person, it's hard not to feel jealous when she subtly presents herself as a better catch. I want my friends to connect, but it's challenging when I'm feeling so conflicted.
Navigating emotions: I'm unsure how to act now. Should I pretend not to be affected by A's presence, or should I act indifferently? I'm torn between showing my internal struggle and keeping it hidden. It's impacting my enjoyment of the trip, and I'm left feeling cranky and sleep-deprived.
The confusion and emotional rollercoaster are taking a toll on me, and I'm struggling to find a balance between preserving my friendship with A, managing my jealousy, and maintaining a healthy dynamic with F.",Off my chest - hope someone can provide useful advice cos I‚Äôm losing my mind,18lonyn,1702946768.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lonyn/off_my_chest_hope_someone_can_provide_useful/,
"I (19F) have been training kickboxing for almost 5 years on a Dojo. I mostly trained with older people than me (as the age range went from 14 to about 60), and about 70% of them men, due to the sport it is. None of us compete, it's all amateur, and the vibe has alwalys been really cool.

About March this year I started talking more to a new guy there (20M), who we will call Chris. We haven't really hung out but we have fun while training and he takes me home sometimes after training and we make out often. It's been a few weeks that I haven't been so comfortable with it anymore, not because anything that has happened, but I don't see it going anywhere and I don't want to keep it going, but I haven't said anything nor acted differently (which I know sounds pretty bad but I don't really know how to face it).

Last training, Chris and I messed with one another a bit with some fight when we were finishing, and later, my current coach (27M, we will call him Caleb), who was formerly a mate (we trained together with an older coach) with whom I have a great relationship with, asked me about Chris, saying that he saw that we get along well. I told him we do. He insisted a bit and I said no comments while laughing a bit uncomfortably because it isn't something I was planning to share. Caleb laughed and said that i was okay, that he had secrets as well.

That same week we had a Christmas dinner some of us. We hadn't had one since before COVID, so the people were mostly different and I hadn't gone out with them before. After dinner, most of us went out at a music bar. I messed with Caleb asking if he had ""anyone special"" as comeback for him messing with me and he insisted he didn't. Later, him, Laura (27F), Brandon (25M) and I ended up going to a club. I hadn't been to a techno party before and they were all watching out for me at first, asking if I was having fun. We went all out to smoke for a minute and Caleb asked me if I had cash. I supposed it was for drugs (topic we talked about previously at dinner) and lent him 10‚Ç¨, which he quickly returnt. I asked, out of curiosity, what he was going to buy. Turns out it was molly, which I had used a couple times before but no more. The 4 of us ended up having half a pill each. We went back to dance and the experience was getting better over time.

Laura and Caleb went for a drink and disappeared for more than an hour, so I shared all the trip with Brandon. We both were very close for all the molly trip.We were constantly telling each other everything we were physically feeling. I was also really touchy due to the sharpened senses and he said he was comfortable with it. There was definitely chemistry and I do find him attractive. But he didn't try anything more than getting close and nor did I. I already felt it was a bad idea to had made out with Chris because, if anything happened, training would be uncomfortable. Same thing would happen with Brandon, though I did want him strongly that night and still kinda do. But I also feel bad for Chris for having intentions with Brandon.

Anyway, after a while, Laura and Caleb appeared. Caleb told me he wanted to talk to me later about what he told me about Chris the other day. When the party was about to finish, we went to get water and he asked me if I was uncomfortable talking about Chris with him because of himself or if I would feel that way with anyone of the Dojo. I told him it was the second.

Caleb then changed the subject and surprised me one time after another and I did not know quite how to react: he confessed to me that a few days earlier he had hooked up with Laura and they had made out again that night. He told me that he hadn't done anything like that with a pupil and felt bad about it because she had just told him that she wanted to get to know him, and Caleb said he just intended for it to be a one time thing. But he said he mostly felt bad for her because he had been with her but would want to get involved with me and didn't want to make it uncomfortable. I was shocked. I told him I saw him as an older figure, a friend but kind of like an older cousin. He didn't look thrilled. We had to go so I told him to continue our conversation later or another day.

We were on our way home and Caleb was the first one to break away to his home. Laura then asked me if Caleb had talked to me about that, and my transparent expression said the answer. Apparently, he had told her that he thought I was shy when talking about Chris (who, btw, nobody really knows what is up with us) with him because he thought I might like him (Caleb), which I find delulu. Also, telling her he had intentions with me when he didn't know if he had a chance does also seem pretty unnecessary to me, but that's me. I was still in shock so when she asked me how I felt I couldn't really articulate. Only thing I told her was that I didn't want to get involved with him.
I was really uncomfortable as well because my autistic mind could not figure out if she was being mean or just really serious to me. I also was uncomfortable because she started talking about this in front of Brandon who, I suppose was clueless about the situation before, and if he's not stupid he at least must have caught that Caleb wants something with me, and for some reason I don't find too fun that he knows.

To add up even more, the day after, Leo (21M) texted me. He's also a martial arts coach on other gyms and dojos, but he was previously trained on my dojo, although I had not met him before. I just met him that same week the last day I trained because he just started teaching karate to the younger kids and will be joining us now on kickboxing afterwards. He asked about the dojo dinner, which he wasn't able to attend. We've been talking and wants to meet one of these days.

Maybe I'm delulu, but I think that means there's ANOTHER guy there interested in me. I feel all of this is crazy. Before this year I hadn't been involved with anyone I trained with. And now in a few days this is really crazy. The dojo always felt like a safe space and I'm worried I don't get that back now.

How do I deal with all of this? 
How do I end things with Chris? Should I justificate myself about it? 
How do I end thd conversation with Caleb and remain friends? He's the one that has jeopardized the relationship but I really want thinks in the dojo to be like before.
Also, should I talk to Laura again about the topic? And, should I continue to talk to Brandon? He texted me the next day and we've been talking ever since. That night we also said we should do that again, some time after though, not to abuse. And I do want to meet him further. If so, should it be a secret?
Should I turn Leo down? He's really nice and I feel I could be interested in him if it weren't for the context. And I also think I've been overly nice for the moment, which is just my personality, but maybe is not the best idea.","Involved with some guys at my Dojo: A night I go out, a night when I make my love life a mess (although not totally my fault)",18lomx2,1702946691.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lomx2/involved_with_some_guys_at_my_dojo_a_night_i_go/,
"TLDR: I was raised in a very traditional/conservative household and separated from my first partner after I found out that she was being unfaithful to me.    


I (23M) was raised in a pretty strict, traditional home. Sex and relationships weren't even a thing until I was at least in College. Both of my parents are immigrants so they only focused on working and ensuring that I would get an education. So, I spent most of my teen years focusing on schooling and my career. About my sophomore year of college, I met this girl on Tinder. I wasn't interested in dating at all, but a friend convinced me to get it just so he didn't feel left out. I was pretty naive and innocent as I spent most of my time working and going to school just to make ends meet and to help out my struggling family. Anyway, we both drink a bit too much and we have sex. There really wasn't consent and it just kind of happened. She made the first move on me. Eventually, we both decided to get into a relationship. We got pretty intimate and got really close to each other. Just like any other relationship, we also had a lot of fighting. She lost her virginity at 16 while I lost it at 21. It was a huge conflict for our relationship since I was raised in this culture and tradition where virginity is very important. Regardless, that was a personal problem of mine that I actually managed to fix and work on. I accepted her for the person she was and her past and decided that it shouldn't get into the middle of our relationship (which I feel takes a lot of work).  


Anyway, we got into a huge argument and split. We talked to each other for a bit after she decided to end the relationship, and she basically toyed with me for a couple of months. She acts all lovey-dovey and then cuts off communication the next day. On our final day when we ""talked,"" she made me a home-cooked meal and I thought things were going to be okay. I pick it up and suddenly she switches up on me. It was like a switch flipped. She started crying and saying she was done and I needed to leave her alone (FYI I didn't do anything besides pick up the food she made for me). I then see a guy Snapchat her.  Just for context, it was 3:00 AM on a Saturday. The guy was the same race as I was and she wouldn't show me the messages. Apparently, her story was he ""randomly"" added her on Snapchat. Regardless, I felt so cheated and disrespected. To add someone and talk to them at 3:00 AM while you make me a loved-filled meal was just the last straw that broke the camel's back. At worst she was cheating on me, At best she was being unfaithful. It also hurt a bit because I did end up finding the guy's social media account and saw him in town. Just knowing he is in the same place just rubbed me in the wrong way.   


I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do. I'm looking into therapy, but she was definitely my first love and the first person I've had intimacy with. I've never felt closer to anyone else and it hurts knowing that she is a stranger who knows my body inside and out. The worst part is I don't think she even knows she was being unfaithful. I dropped her off and went home and cried. I don't even know what to do.

I do better inperson but I need few weeks in-between before hang out with people because I like to be alone and hangout with bf, when we don‚Äôt have anything plan I make time to visit my family. However, they live outside my town and few time they made arrangements me they bailed. which is fine, shit happens.

But when they do reach out I give them undivided attention and listen to them, and tell them struggles in my life. I am open with my struggles but I don‚Äôt look for comfort because my issue are old and messy and I am working through it.

However, I feel blinded sided because I don‚Äôt talk much to them or my other closer friends we r need-to-knows biases like dropping random nuggets about my life, send meme, make plans 2 weeks out to hang out. 

the people that broke up with me pop into my life 3-5 months later to chat and I am happy to. but I don‚Äôt do it myself because I thought when we need each other we need eachother.

"I (f)  turned 22 a few days ago and although I have never been quite fond of birthdays, this one has particularly dragged me down. A year and a bit ago I went no contact with my dad. I was sick of being his emotional punching bag and I just snapped after an argument over buying a piece of school equipment for my brother and packed up and left. It was kind of surreal to be honest like on a random Saturday night I packed my bags and just said I was done. At first I felt justified in my anger especially since a little bit after I moved out he sent me a disgusting text calling me all sorts and saying I was dead to him so I took it ad a sign that we‚Äôre not meant to be in eachothers lives. I was sick of the abuse and living in constant stress, he was what you call a functioning alcoholic? I guess he thought no one noticed although that was dumb considering he drank himself into a blackout state weekly and I could always hear the distinct sound of a bottle opening anywhere in the house and not to mention the countless bottles I found lying in random hidden places. I cooked, cleaned, contributed and was a good daughter. I am by no means perfect but I did try and butI always got the least amount of respect. Everyone initially took my side but over time they keep trying to convince me to reach out and speak to him and I won‚Äôt budge. Even those who were originally on my side are now not showing that same support. My argument is that I always turn into a doormat and go back  and have never in my 22 years of living received an apology for anything he has done to me and that list is EXTREMELY long ( honestly considering writing out the top 10 worst moments and posting them ). Am I a dog? Why must I be loyal and be mistreated ? I‚Äôm human I deserve some basic respect. He even apologised to my brother IN FULL TEARS and it bothered me because not once has he ever even given me a half arsed apology let alone a heartfelt one. Everyone coddles him and allows him to behave in this narcissistic manner it‚Äôs always what he wants and we should all bow down to him like he is God‚Äôs gift when he is more like a curse. I am refusing and now people are trying to guilt me by saying that he is depressed and drinking even more and he is sick and has to go to hospital ( around the same time he was going to the hospital, so was I for such severe panic attacks that I couldn‚Äôt move nor breathe). No one cares to ask how I‚Äôm doing but they‚Äôre all quick to call to tell me how family is family and I should look past his shortcomings. The man doesn‚Äôt even know my birthday‚Ä¶.

"I (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for almost 8 months now. Our relationship has been a little rocky in the beginning, but it is going very well now. Which is why I am struggling with this moral dilemma, because I am scared it will ruin his trust in me. 

For context, my boyfriend hates lying, and I am hiding a huge huge secret from him that I impulsively turned into a huge lie. 

Before we started dating, we were in the talking stage. He kept pushing me to be ""exclusive"" but not dating with him, which he didn't define to me. After our very first date, like a week or so later, I hung out with one of my male friends at his house and he unexpectedly kissed me. Admittedly, I kissed him back for a minute max before his older brother came home. I realized that I didn't like my friend in this romantic context, and I just up and left the awkward situation.

This happened around a week after my now boyfriend and I started talking, so it wasn't serious yet. I know my boyfriend still snapped other options on his phone and I told him in the beginning I had no intentions for a relationship because I felt like I wasn't ready (he is my first boyfriend, I have had very very bad experiences with men in the past so I was unwilling to trust him when he was a stranger to me)

Here's the thing. We started dating around a month later, and for some reason he became OBSESSED with my past. He asked me multiple times when the last time I had gotten with anyone was, and I had ever given head before him, etc. He is practically my first everything besides kissing, by the way. He made my past a really really big deal, and it made me feel an immense amount of guilt. So, I fessed up and told him I did kiss someone a month before we started dating. This was in July. As soon as he heard that, he absolutely lost it and freaked out and started being really mean to me. I freaked out and told him a different version of what happened, that it didn't happen at his house and it was a couple days before our first date.  In any normal situation, this wouldn't be a big deal at all because this happened before we were dating when we were talking for around 2 weeks and since the very day he asked me to be his official gf I had been 100% loyal since. 

I don't know why I feel so guilty about this. I didn't cheat, and the people close to me that I've told about my dilemma told me that my boyfriend isn't entitled to know anything about my past and that I shouldn't have even told him so many details in the first place. They also told me that me freaking out and coming up with a half version of the truth is already a huge red flag in our relationship, because it showed that I don't feel comfortable being open with him in hard situations. 

I just don't know what to feel. Am I making a huge deal out of something that is minuscule?

I‚Äôve always been on the brink of depression. But I‚Äôve held myself together and relied on my stress relievers to cope. I loved to exercise and cook.

"I (18F) have been going through a really tough time lately and I have gone back to self-harming, and it's taken a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend (18M). He's always known about it and used to be supportive, but things took a turn recently. He asked me to promise him to never hurt myself again, and when I said that I didn‚Äôt know if I could promise anything - he made me promise anyway. I understand that  I hurt him so bad when I hurt myself, and trust me, I am not proud of it.

A few days ago I had a breakdown and confided in him about how I felt worthless and disgusting, that I didn‚Äôt feel like I was enough for him because I keep hurting him and being mean. He got frustrated and dismissed my feelings as lies and accused me of not caring about him. This escalated into a fight where he became aggressive, leading me to feel even more worthless.

The next day things spiraled further as we continued to fight through text. I hate fighting through text so I messaged him that I wasn‚Äôt going to respond anymore and he could call if he wanted to talk. He replied ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre saying goodbye now, you might as well say goodbye forever‚Äù. It seemed to me as he was trying to break up. I got super upset so I resorted to self-harm again. I truly didn‚Äôt know what to do at that point because I was already having thoughts of hurting myself before he sent that message. I called him multiple times with no answer. But when he finally picked up, he asked if I had hurt myself. I couldn‚Äôt lie and he got mad. He said that if I could break that promise so easily, what other promises could I break. As if I would cheat on him. He came to my home that night and I apologized over and over again. But he just said that I was being rude to him, that I didn‚Äôt care about him. I was still panicking and crying, I wanted to hug him, but he wouldn‚Äôt let me. He just stood there with a blank expression on his face and stared at me. There was no love there. I felt like nothing.

Now, I'm torn between feeling like a bad person for not being able to stop for him and feeling unlovable because of his reaction. It's been days, and he continues to claim that I don't care about him.

"I am visiting my parents for the holiday and the past weekend I invited them out to a family dinner. My parents are chinese immigrants and for a long time they struggled financially until I was like 10 so it makes sense that they are sometimes pretty frugal or even selfish. But now they're pretty well off and have cozy jobs. I'd say they are like on the 'lower' end of upper middle class if that makes any sense. Despite this, whenever they go out to eat they're tipping like barely 5% no matter how big or small the bill is. Whatever, if they're paying it doesnt make sense for me to tell them how much I think they should tip. 

Anyways, after getting the bill I thought, ""im making some decent money now I can afford to leave a nice tip today"". The bill was about $145, I put down two 100s. As we are packing up the leftovers we get the change (one 20, 3 10s, and some change) and immediately my mom reaches over, grabs $40 and hands it to me leaving less than $15 on the tab as the tip. I take the bills and say it's ok and put them back. We go back and forth for a bit before I just stopped talking and pulled the tab to edge of the table on my side. We got up to leave and leading the line out, my mom was at the back of the line. I get outside, look through the window to our table, and I see a single 10 and some change left on the tab..she fucking pocketed the money.

We moved in with my aunt and she kicked him out after he punched her 7 year old. We moved into a small trailer along with my best friend (42f). He refused to pay rent since he said he didn't live there as he was a truck driver. She kept telling me she couldn't find a job so I covered all expenses for 3 months and moved out. We moved into a trailer park but got scammed with my boyfriend pushing me to pay just one more month. I finally rented a small trailer where we lived together. Everything I asked him to pay the bills he refused saying I was an independent woman and could pay for everything. I cooked, cleaned, worked 50+ hours to make ends meet. He would still ask me for money and when I refused my family would scold me. Once when I visited his dad's house the dad said if I was working then it wasy responsibility to help hom as a good girlfriend. I asked him about our future: marriage, saving money, buying a house, kids etc. He said he wasnt going to get married as he did believe in that. He didn't have to save cause I could pay for everything, and about buying a house well he could just apply for government housing. He wanted me to have kids (I have PCOS). I decided that is not the life I wanted and asked him to leave. He started drama and said he would only leave if he was escorted by the cops. I packed my bags and left. I was homeless and was couch hoping and living in my car. My mom refused to rent me a room and said I wasn't welcome but my ex was. I met my husband a month after that breakup.

I moved in with her and a few others (we didn't know each other beforehand but almost everyone is sweet) and me and her became friends kinda quick. She's a lot more active on social media than me and it affects her behavior but I never minded it.
Last Thursday however she started lashing out at me, saying mean stuff and making mean jokes about me (she even cussed at me for having my dentist appointment in the afternoon because she always has her dentist appointments in the morning so I'm ""f*cking weird""). Almost everytime she apologized right after she said something mean, just to do it again 10 minutes later. She said that she was just tired and not really feeling well so I brushed it off every time and told her that it's okay.
I went to my mom's house this weekend to relax a bit and to make sure I wasn't gonna lash out at her after the weekend. That didn't work as well as I had hoped... I didn't lash out but she was just as mean as before I left.

I feel bad for 'dismissing' her feelings/thoughts (I didn't tell her anything about my thoughts on it and tried to be as supportive as possible).

At first 4 years ago i thought of the possibility i might have ADHD or ADD but my mom though that wouldn‚Äôt be possible since she had just seen my 3 all male very hyperactive cousins. But 3 years ago when i started this school im currently in my principal said ‚Äùhave you ever thought of the possibility you might have ADHD?‚Äù And that is where the chaos broke out. We went to BUP wich is basically like a psychiatry for children and teenagers. And i was so close to getting a diagnosis the first time we were there. But then a year later in november 2022 i was put on antidepressants, now these were also supposed to help with sleep but we weren‚Äôt told that. 

So basically the doctor told me to take them every morning. In conclusion i dont remember shit from november 2022. 
Now nothing really happened from there on. We got to wait for months inbetween visits and then finally we got a big letter in the mail finally saying that i was gonna be evaluated for possible ADHD. Now the results were completely different and honestly made me feel so lost. Because apparently I have nothing close to ADHD. But instead i have GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder), PTSD, and depression. I haven‚Äôt felt affected by trauma that i have from when i was 1-5 years old but apparently I‚Äôve been very affected and school itself has become traumatic for me. Since teachers used to force me into school when I was crying and I didn‚Äôt understand why i was panicking so much about going to school. Eventually I was sort of homeschooled but i felt so exhausted all the time. I‚Äôve failed most of my grades and I feel like my life has overall fallen apart. And now im going on my long awaited christmas break in a few days. I‚Äôm basically sitting in my room all day doing absolutely nothing but texting my online best friend and listening to music. But my mom does talk to me a lot and she supports me so much, I have no clue how she has gotten through all of these school meetings and fights with me. 
Right now I just kind of feel pretty helpless and hopeless. We‚Äôre considering a sick leave for next semester, I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. And because I feel so just overwhelmed and all other feelings that I can‚Äôt really explain, for some reason eating feels disgusting. Like I‚Äôve never been insecure about my body but right now I have no appetite and food makes me want to throw up.. I also find myself staying up into the early hours of the morning as an escape, like nobody will bother me at night, I have no responsibilities at night, I can just forget about everything. 

I just feel very tired and alone all the time.. I feel so different because like the doctors and the teachers they all go: oh yeah no we‚Äôve never seen anything like this before
It just makes me feel like crap. But i‚Äôm just mindlessly ranting at this point. Sorry if this post is confusing to read, it sort of came out of nowhere, and excuse my grammar but I‚Äôm very tired

"I  have been through a lot of things. Mostly during my teenage years. I was suicidally depressed for many years, but I made it out. I discovered how to be happy and my outlook is so different and so much better now. Other than the alphabet soup of diagnoses that I've received, one of the things that has plagued me the most from my years of depression is that my social skills did not develop like everyone else's seemed to. I believe that this is part of the root cause of a lot of my feelings of isolation from my friends.  
We've got a pretty big friend group that gets together often and does different things for fun. What seems blaringly obvious to me is how little my friends want to talk to or include me in things. Idk how easy it is for people to feel the intentional distance that others keep you at, but I feel it.  
I have literally spent years working on myself, trying to always improve, trying to find out how I can do things better..how to just be normal. I found this current friend group and felt genuine connection with genuinely good people. And it was awesome at first. Over a few months of everyone getting to know each other, it has started to feel like I'm at the edge of the group. We have a big group chat that I'm a part of, but that's the only place that I every hear from anyone. No one ever messages me directly, no one invites me to anything directly that isn't in the group chat, and no one seems to want to be close to me, despite how close and intimate literally everyone is with everyone else in the group. It would be one thing if this were the result of me being distant with everyone and not allowing those connections to form, but that simply isn't the case. I've been just as loving and open as everyone else. But most of the people in the group have stopped showing the same affection towards me that they show to everyone else. No one makes a point to talk to me when we are all hanging out. So, getting to the point of this post, I feel like they've seen something in me that they don't like, and no longer desire that same closeness that they do with everyone else.  
I'm dating this girl and we are very, very interested in each other. We met some months ago through a different friend group and only recently started dating.  
A couple hours ago, I found out about another hangout that some of the friends are doing later today. They are doing something that I have expressed much interest in doing when we have all been together, yet, no one invited me.  
After feeling the associated feelings, I began to think that there MUST be something about me that they don't like. Whatever it is, it must have taken a little while to really see it, otherwise I wouldn't have been included in the beginning. From this, I began to worry about the newly sprouting romance. If this is what's happened with friends, then what if this happens with her too?  
What I needed off my chest is that I am afraid that she will see what others seem to see, and will no longer be interested in me. I feel such a deep sadness when I think of this. Not only because I am so interested in her, but because I know that I am the best version of me that I have ever been, and somehow I can't manage to keep friendships like normal people seem to be able to... So how realistic is it for me to think that I can keep a romantic interest?  
  
Sorry for the wall of text, but my heart is sad and I needed to release this.

"I'm using this as a space to freely share my woes.  
\- I've had many successes this year. I secured a 69.5% in my first year of an MsT in Creative Writing from Cambridge University, which is practically first class. I travelled, made a lot of friends, worked on many creative projects, networked, grew as a person and as an artist.  
\- This year has also been extremely difficult for me. I've gone from barely talking to to completely estranged from my mother who I believe suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This estrangement is in part due to the fact that she spent the majority of my life raising me with my godfather and her partner of 26 years. They broke up 2 years ago, and he killed himself this summer. Since then I have been suffering from suicidal ideation, as every time I get overwhelmed I remember his suicide letter and realise how easy it was for my role model to take his life. Me and my mom are estranged because after he killed himself I lost all trust in her as she began emotionally and verbally abusing me. when I recorded this instance on my phone she abandoned me and now my mother's side of the family is either not talking to me or telling me it's my fault for the estrangement.  
\- I broke up with a guy called S in January. I jumped on a dating app and started dating another guy called A the same month, we had a whirlwind romance which ended with him practically ghosting me and then showing up to our preferred date spot with hickies. In the summer S started chasing me, I rejected him then chased him back, he then rejected me and we ended it altogether. I fell for another man called SB in January in Pakistan. We've been seeing each other since and I think I'm in love with him. I've recently found out his marriage is pre-arranged to his cousin outside of his control and I feel hopeless and helpless.  
\- I have kicked a 5-year long hashish and marijuana addiction. I've been smoking every night to fall asleep but recently got the courage to stop as of the last month. However, this is bringing up repressed depression I've been avoiding for years and means I struggle to sleep at night.  
\- I am constantly anxious and waiting for the next bad news to drop, the next person to kill themselves or the next person to abandon me or leave my life.  
\- I got a job this summer as a teacher and social director. While I did my best, I was bullied by my boss and co-workers behind my back, leading to a toxic environment and meaning that I needed to quit. this made me have a loss in confidence.  
\- I used to be more comfortable being happy-go-lucky all the time but I no longer have the energy or ability for it. I don't socialise with people as much as I used to. I'm more reclusive and depressed. now that I'm not smoking anymore my life feelings meaningless and pointless. I don't know what to do with myself. please don't tell me to see a counsellor or seek support of my friends cause I would if I could. I'm working on developing a relationship with two counsellors - one through my university, one through my psychiatric mother mother's network. I struggle to open up to both of them. While I love my friends and I know they're there for me, talking with friends is often reciprocal and right now I guess I need one-sided advice and relief. I'm coming here because I have nowhere else to go. If anyone could offer guidance? support? reassurance? validation? I would be infinitely grateful. I've been typing all of this to AI platforms like ChatGPT and Claude.AI but I still feel like death.

"I (22f) met my ex fianc√© (24m) when I was 20. I was in the worst place mentally and emotionally I had ever been. And he was very kind to me. We immediately started dating. He took my virginity. And he made me feel beautiful for the first time ever. 

A few months in I started to notice he would be aggressive towards me when I would wear something he thought was too revealing. (I‚Äôm goth, it‚Äôs my self expression) and he would yell at me if I talked to a guy. (I worked in customer service)
I thought it would change. 
I blamed it on his BPDD

We moved to his home town and I met his friends. And he would talk shit to his girly friends behind my back. About how I‚Äôm not good in bed. Or saying I cheated (we lived in a car together, that wasn‚Äôt possible) 
I passed this off because I was emotionally dependent on him now, and I ignored these things.

Well I‚Äôm around the summer of 2022 I got a job in a city we moved to, and found a group of nice friends. He did as well at his job. He started leaving me behind in parks after work so he could go smoke with his new girly friends. (I lived in the car with him I had nowhere to go)
And he would be manipulative, when I questioned why he would be so touchy with them. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me who he was with. He‚Äôd lie about what he was doing. And he would trash talk me to these girls so he would get sympathy from them. 

One girl he knew since she was 15, he called her his little sister. He would buy her weed and alcohol. And I never liked her cause she would always touch him and say things that made me uncomfortable. 
When we ended up having a miscarriage, he left me in a park at night, and drove an hour away to meet up with her (she had just turned 18 I guess)
He said it was cause she was sad.
I didn‚Äôt dare question him cause he was already yelling at me over every little thing. And fighting over nothing.

So at the end of 2022 we got engaged. 
It lasted 3 months, we broke up, and it wasn‚Äôt pretty, but we ended up trying again because I was pregnant (I didn‚Äôt know when we had broken up)
During this time he told me he loved me and wanted to be with me forever. Than he‚Äôd switch up and call me a w h 0 re  and a sl*t. 
And he ended up telling me he slept with that teenage girl he called his ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù when she turned 18 (so he groomed her) the night he left me in the park after I miscarried my first baby.
And that it was MY FAULT!?!!! He blamed me for his infidelity!! 
And he tells me no one will ever love me like he did. That I am a horrible person. 
And he hates me and blasts me on social media, and is still making friends with teenage girls. 

I really was just a trophy for him‚Ä¶ 
Because he wanted a ‚Äúgoth girlfriend‚Äù


No I wasn‚Äôt perfect! I have flaws! I was very immature and it was my first relationship. 
There is so much more that happened, I just need to get this out there‚Ä¶. 

I still love the mask he wore when he said he loved me, despite all the abuse and manipulation and pain‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why.

"My ex fiance left me 3 years ago. He took everything I had. During the relationshop he sexually assaulted me, and psychologically abused me. I never prosecuted because I was naive and believed it was my fault.

He proposed to me after 11 years of being in a relationship.

The year after the engagement he started a new job at a hospital where he met a girl in one of the training classes. At the time he was 27, and she was 16.

He hounded this girl until she would see him socially. The relationship always made me uncomfortable. This girl would come over, bringing plush toys to hug while she watched movies.

When we would go to the movies he would sit her between us. They would go for coffee after work most days. She would turn up at the house when I was out and id see her leave.

If I ever said I was uncomfortable, I was told ""How could you think that of me? She's like a sister to me! You are crazy!""

Days when I needed to talk to him, he would tell me he had already had to listen to the girl cry and had no time for me too.

This girl soon went to med school. My ex went to nursing school. When he went to nursing school we moved house 400 miles. On a day i went back to visit my family, he changed the locks and said it was over. He controlled my reaction by saying we would meet up in 4 months and see how we felt.
He also said for there to be a chance I had to lose weight, get a career and stop being jealous of his female friend.

I was heartbroken and naive. I went to live with family and did what he asked. I lost weight, got a job at my local hospital and wrote to the girl apologising for any jelous behaviour.
And of course after 4 months it was all lies. He had been cheating on me with girl for years and just waited until he could do his plan.

They went public with their relationship a few days later.


They are both now qualified.

I had to put my career on hold for his. To start with he had a business I built with him. The plan was we got him up and running, then it was my turn. The business eventually failed, then he decided to retrain. Again my career was on hold so he could get into school. I helped him financially and did most of his essays for his qualifications to gain entry.

I've tried to hear as little about him as possible. And built my new life at the hospital. But we still have mutual friends. One warned me that he had applied for a job at the hospital I worked at. As soon as that was confirmed I moved jobs. He sends texts to them saying he hopes I'm no longer working in the medical field as its ""too hard and not for her.""

My friend mentioned the engagement. And I just feel terrible.
Its hard to put my finger on why. I have zero feelings for him. I now have an amazing boyfriend who has shown me what love actaully is. There is no fear, I feel cared for and loved. We can talk about worries and hes not defensive. He discusses things and wants to know and values my opinion. He holds my hand. Hugs me at night, and if I'm sick he has sympathy and compassion. Everything i never experienced with my ex. Things I thought were just in books and films.

I think the bad feeling is because, everything seems to have worked out for 2 people who were so awful to me. 

They both got their careers and are now engaged. No comeuppance. It all worked out. Just have this feeling of humiliation. Especially after he moved into my place of work. 
I could have stayed. But for my mental health it was better to be free of his presence.

Ok so this is going to be a long one but make sure to read this in detail. 


My  ‚Äòfriend‚Äô (who‚Äôs now 5 months pregnant) who I didn‚Äôt talk to for 5 years reached out to me in July and apologised to me for ruining my life 5 years ago which consisted of leaking my nude and consistently talking shit behind my back and spreading rumours about me. It really hurt a lot. 



Anyways In July of this year she apologised to me about everything. And she started telling me how she had met this guy (We‚Äôll call him Shane) when she was 15 and he was 27 and she met him at a party she was invited to and told to lie about her age so he raped her and he raped her for two years even when he found out her actual age (cause legal age of consent in her state is 17) he‚Äôs abused her his friends raped her too tried to throw her off a balcony, a pedo and manipulated her with religion. He also talks to her 13 year old brother and claims to be friends with him but I know for a fact he‚Äôs groomed and manipulated her brother. As of right now, my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô is 19 and ‚ÄòShane‚Äô is 31. I Helped her get out of the marriage she was in with him, and anyways, everything has been generally okay until about 2 months ago now she told me she had a dream where me and her did sexual things with each other in the dream. And I made a joke out of it which still confuses me as to why she felt uncomfortable by it because the people I used to be at a school with which were horrible to me and used to spread rumours and treat me terribly at school whenever they make sexual related jokes about her she‚Äôs completely fine? But no she felt uncomfortable. So then due to this she shit talked me a lot in a groupchat with them, lying to me in the process about why she was acting cold. Found out and got annoyed with her and then we spoke about it for a few hours on a call and she said she was going to go back to building a relationship with god and Christianity because back when she was religious, she claims to have been the time where she made the most progress. 



Everything seemed okay for a few days after that, and then she started acting cold to me until two days ago her ex husband ‚ÄòShane‚Äô had messaged me and the only way he found my account is through her. We had a bit of an argument. Anyways, I told her something to try to rebuild some trust with her,  and then she said she had something to tell me to try to rebuild some more trust between us. She told me she was going back to her ex husband ‚ÄòShane‚Äô to try to make things work with him because she thinks he‚Äôs changed, she wants to make things work with him and raise her kid with him who‚Äôs due in April. She says she‚Äôs seen how much progress he‚Äôs made for the better and said he‚Äôs willing to go to therapy with her. She said it will help rebuild trust me knowing this because her real life best friend who we‚Äôll call ‚ÄòKiana‚Äô can‚Äôt find out or she‚Äôll cut off my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô.



Anyways, the following morning, I messaged her to try to talk her out of going back to him and that I‚Äôm worried about her going back to him because she‚Äôs just putting herself at risk and her kid at risk. In the process, I also threatened her by saying if you fuck up again, I will bring out what you told me to your best friend.
Why did I threaten her you ask? She‚Äôs destroyed my life already and even just in the time we‚Äôve spoken since July of this year, she‚Äôs already tried ruining my life again.
Even now though, I am still contemplating as to wether or not I should share this Reddit post with her Kiana so she at least knows what our ‚Äòfriend‚Äô is planning on doing which is running back to her ex husband ‚ÄòShane‚Äô.
I‚Äôm not sure as to whether to tell ‚ÄòKiana‚Äô as to what our ‚Äòfriend‚Äô is doing. 


For those wondering, The people I used to be at school with that are horrible and spread things about rumours are people that she only knows online, they have hurt her a lot yet she still continues to talk to them.","I threatened my 19F pregnant friend, now I‚Äôm not sure what to do.",18lmamu,1702940436.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lmamu/i_threatened_my_19f_pregnant_friend_now_im_not/,
"Please read the story and offer your opinions I‚Äôm going insane 

The event in question happened in January of this year, at the time I had a bit of a breakdown for a few days after but have repressed it since. Due to some recent events these feelings have resurfaced and I have shared them with a trusted coworker. I would like to know what you guys think about this and can help me with my feelings of shame and guilt. 

For context I had been working at this shop for around 2 months at this point, I only work 8 hours a week. I had previously been for an after work drink with said manager once before, he is very persistent and wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer so I agreed to go for 1/2 pints with him, the whole night he bought rounds of shots for us (without asking me) to the point that I got so drunk he put me in an Uber and sent me home. 

The second time was the day he made me employee of the month. He insisted we go out for a drink after work to celebrate. I had only eaten a small breakfast that day so told him I‚Äôd come for one drink then go home as I needed to eat dinner. 

Again, as soon as we got to the bar he began buying loads of rounds of shots for us. I remember having the first drink and a couple shots in the bar around 8:30, then my memory totally blacks out until around midnight. In the meantime, it transpired we had gone to other bars that evening and continued drinking - I remember none of this. 

My next memory after 8:30 is around midnight - I am in his bedroom, we are naked, I am performing oral sex on him. I have only a short blip of memory of being in his flat, of the memory I have I do not remember protesting to what we were doing, but it is absolutely not something I would have consented to sober. 

My next memory is of him telling me his husband was coming home and that I had to leave. From getting out of his flat I remember more. At this point I was still incredibly intoxicated and couldn‚Äôt walk straight at all. My phone was dead and I had to walk home 90mins with no directions in the dark. 

The next day I was a wreck, I felt violated and upset but also could not consider it assault in my mind because of my short memory of doing the act with him and actively participating and ever since it has felt like my fault and the guilt and shame has been carried with me. 

The reason these feelings have come about again is because on a work Xmas night out, he alluded to me in a private conversation that it was his intention to get me really drunk, and that I was in a sense manipulated.

Nonce* üëÜüèª. This is going to be a bit long. I (28) had trouble dating for 4 years after ended my situationship of 4 years. My confidence was crushed and I thought there is no one out there for me. I‚Äôm more like an spiritual person, idk if that‚Äôs the word. English isn‚Äôt my first language. What I mean is, I always prioritized connecting to someone emotionally, like being understood, comfortable, being intimate, talking about everything without being ashamed. I kinda isolated myself from the world. Then I moved to another country to study. Covid happened and all that lockdown situation. I spent more time on gaming and I had a few decent online friends who actually helped me survive being locked down in a tiny dorm room. Around last spring I started playing a new game and joined a group of people. There was a guy who was really weird with the way he typed. It was unique and hilarious. I didn‚Äôt talk to him much cause honestly he was using fancy English words. But at some point we talked more and more in the public game chat and ended up having a convo with him on discord. He was 33 or sth and he was from poland. I found out he was an English teacher hence he was so good at making complex sentences. We talked more and more and we started liking each other. But non of us really wanted a long distance relationship. We made plans to meet each other in turkey in February. But that didn‚Äôt happen and he suggested to push it to april due to his financial problems. Before January he told me needs time and his life is a mess rn. I was upset that he wanted a break from me. At that time i was already back to my home country btw. I wasn‚Äôt happy with his decision. Like okay people need time and space but saying u need a break from this for a month or more without giving a proper reason sounded a bit unfair to me. He didn‚Äôt come back around the time that I was expecting. I swallowed the hard pill and ended things through a text and said I won‚Äôt be waiting for you anymore. I was devastated and was feeling so stupid and naive to think thwre was a chance that I actually found someone who effortlessly matches my personality. He showed up after some time with no explanation. Sent me random yt links, songs, Spotify playlists. I ignored him and at some point I told him he can‚Äôt just show up and do this and think that actually can work. 

Eventually he told me about his situation, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and was living with his mom for the time being. He said he is on meds and seeing a therapist and ofc I was trying to be supportive and understanding. We didn‚Äôt talk everyday but would check up on each other time to time. He said I‚Äôm probably not good for his mental health cause I make him want to do impossible things. Around june I got a package. The delivery guy said it was from abroad. Yes, it was from him ( I had given my address to him back then when we were ok and ik it was dumb). There were letters, handmade stuff. Ngl, some might find it creepy but I was impressed. Ig I‚Äôm just a hopeless romantic or just simply dumb. It was like a goodbye letter or lets say closure. We talked about it and everything was all good. One night I just had a feeling. I msged him and asked if he was alright. He was being weird as usual and told me things about making big mistakes in life. Eventually he was like if you want to stop talking to me, I will tell you my story. And he did. He told me when he was in the UK for work, the police came to his house and took his laptop claiming he has some illegal files in it. Files that were ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù. He was like I told them it was a mistake, and I got them unintentionally while I was downloading movies from darkweb. I was like excuse me??? I‚Äôm from the middle east and here I can‚Äôt find movies to watch LEGALLY so I download them ILLEGALLY but not from the freaking darkweb!!! Whom are u trying to fool? I was scared ngl. I was like may I know what 
 those files were? And he said he didn‚Äôt even wanna type it. He said it was illegal porn‚Ä¶ I asked was it violent stuff or‚Ä¶ age related stuff? He goes: age. My whole body froze and it was in the middle of the night. I was absolutely terrified and grossed out. He kept saying it wasn‚Äôt sth that he was into and all of it was an accident. He was mad that the judge didn‚Äôt let him speak or have a lawyer. He got deported from the uk back to poland with security guards around him on the plane!!! Like an actual criminal and he also said they wrote about him in newspapers! 
So people, when u talk to someone online u google their name right? I did the same last year! Nth came up. This time, I typed his name and added uk. There it was. According to those news websites, the judge didnt believe him cause he had explicit search history! He had thousands of indecent pictures in total from category a, b and c! Even pictures of kids under the age 12‚Ä¶ . And he was working in a slaughterhouse. He was labeled as a sex offender. This is why he can‚Äôt be an instructor anymore. He even mentioned the fact that in Poland they are not that strict about tracking your online activity. So THIS GUY HAD EXPERIENCE! He didn‚Äôt know he would get caught in the uk. 

Omg I‚Äôm still not over it. I blocked him from everywhere after saying gn for the night. I was scared to be too harsh but I made him understand that I don‚Äôt believe him. Ig he knew anyway that I‚Äôm gonna run away. He even said: ‚Äú Don‚Äôt risk it. Disappear run away. I might be lying. you never know.‚Äù",The person I talked to online and planned to see him turned to be a nonse,18lm0ao,1702939705.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lm0ao/the_person_i_talked_to_online_and_planned_to_see/,

"After several failed relationships and serious dating experiences, I'm going through another broken one. Thinking a lot these days, going over what happened, how it started/evolved/ended.  
I've been complaining why I keep ending up with men who are not emotionally available, who are avoidants, who don't want the relationship and closeness I want. Today I realised all of those might have been me (too)!

I read something on Instagram that made me think about this. It was something like ""if you're constantly attracting emotionally unavailable people look at how you yourself might be emotionally unavailable"", and that made me think and think and think... In my latest dating attempt, things started amazingly, not like any other start. I went with the flow, but a part of me was constantly worried, scared, hesitant, doubtful, cautious. Mainly because of his past, for a while I had to fight the thought that he was a player. We spent long wonderful hours together, I was there, but not entirely. I wanted all in, but I wasn't really being all in. I wanted more, but it was me who was holding back! It was my fears. Fear of uncertainty, losing control, becoming emotionally attached, and the biggest fear which was ending up heartbroken.

As an anxiously attached person with fear of abandonment and not the best self esteem, knowing how hard and deep I would love and care once I'm there and how broken I would be if it doesn't work out, I was constantly scared of things ending. Being in a committed long-term (hopefully life-long) relationship is what I want. But every time he mentioned ""becoming a couple"", my brain went directly to what I saw as ""blockers"" between us: the things which were not as I wanted them to be. Creating scenarios in my head and overthinking and feeling even more scared of all the things that might happen in the future. What if I'm not enough for him? What if he doesn't make me feel safe and secure over time? What if I cannot trust him as I wish to? What if he thinks I'm too much? What if he doesn't want the same closeness I want? What if the excitement wears off after sometime and he cannot cope with the real me, the boring me, the sick me, the depressed me (life is not always happy days afterall)? What if he falls back into his old habits of casually dating and meeting random people and hooking up and cheats on me? What if he generally never wants to get married while I do? What if he wants to have a third person in the relationship or have an open relationship because he said he's not entirely ruling it out now for the rest of his life? What if he's still after his ex because he said he never loses hope and he would still like to sleep with her and maybe someday the existing issues won't be there anymore? What if he's just looking for something temporary to not be alone and I'm the closest easiest one? What if ... What if ... What if ...

I did mention some of them to him briefly, naively hoping for some clarity or answers. He was not the most secure available man either, holding back, raising questions in my head, vaguely saying things about the future that would show incompatibility from now on. Maybe he was also partially to blame for not giving me clear answers and communicating clearly what his intentions were and what his chain of thoughts were when I asked or for not being patient enough when we had discussions or for not being open to repairing after conflicts. All of which left me more scared and hesitant. Every time he said ""why do you make it so complicated? why do you think so much? it's just a relationship, it's not getting married right away!"", I had more fear and insecurity. Now I'm thinking maybe he was right and I shouldn't have put so much thought into it, maybe I should have just jumped in when he said ""relationship"" instead of having a hundred thoughts on my mind... But is that really how it's supposed to start?

I thought I was protecting myself from getting hurt again and having to start all over again in my mid 30s. But now I'm thinking of all the times I could have just jumped in blindly, risking it and seeing what time brings. Is that how it should be done? Is that how people start relationships? Was I looking for too much safety and security and assurance too early? I have been questioning myself so much these days. I don't know what he's doing, maybe he's already seeing other people although we said we'll talk again in a couple of weeks, but he didn't sound like he was going to stay exclusive, which is another fear of mine now: how could he move on so quickly? Was he really only looking for not being alone and have company for the holiday time? He did ask me to join him on a trip after splitting up...

I don't know what to think or do anymore. I've been thinking a lot, I've been trying to talk with a therapist but it seems impossible to find a spot. I've been talking with a couple of friends but they cannot help much either. I'm blaming myself a lot, thinking I was the avoidant one here, I was the emotionally unavailable one, I was the one holding back when he wanted us to take a step forward despite the uncertain unknown future.

I don't even know if all these thoughts and feelings of mine are true or if it's just the grief and low self-esteem talking blaming me for the failure. Can anyone relate to this? I'm so lost and disappointed...",I always wondered how/why I keep ending up with emotionally unavailable men every time. Now I'm thinking I have been emotionally unavailable myself (too)!

"I (20M) grew up in the Middle East and moved to the United States in August 2021 when I was 17 years old. I grew up in a very patriarchal Middle Eastern household where my father (72M) provided us with food, shelter, education, and occasional family activities but nothing more while my mother (56F) became my best friend and the parent who became my role model and hero. My parents had a stable relationship yet one devoid of the type of love my mother wanted from my father. My mother eventually became a licensed relational needs therapist and then became a licensed IFS (Internal Family Systems) Practitioner which led to me being taught about relational needs, emotional intelligence, healthy conflict resolution, Parts Work Theory and so much more about what it takes to build a relationship that will last for life. 
The prior context brings me to today, where my Girlfriend (21F) has shown me just how desolate it has become finding love here. She‚Äôs from an East Asian background and grew up in a very conservative Muslim household with no autonomy over herself. She started sneaking out and messing around once she started college and her experience with men in this country has left me speechless. Here is a summary of what I learned from our conversations and my experience listening to my friends and strangers discussing their relationships and experiences:

1. So many partners are emotionally unavailable and incapable of realizing that the things we label as ‚Äúpetty‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù mean the world to our partners. If your partner keeps pressing you on a behavior you do and asking you to change then it is always out of a place of care for you and wanting to see you act more diligently/responsibly. 

2. People here antagonize their partners and start to villainize them leading to so many avoidable arguments and problems. Your partner is the one person who will be there whether you win everything or lose everything. Remember that they are on your team. 

3. Hookup culture and the idea of empowerment through sleeping around has made it nearly impossible for people to commit. There are so many options and the worship of self that Western societies struggle with has made everyone think that the grass is always greener on the other side. 

4. So much unhealed and unaddressed trauma. I have been with my GF for almost a year and at the start I had to reassure her that I will be with her every step of her healing journey. It feels like any talking stage is on bought time nowadays meaning there is no space to have difficult conversations at the start of the relationship. 

5. Realizing that perfect doesn‚Äôt exist. The society in America today has advertised the idea of finding ‚ÄúThe Perfect Match‚Äù and finding someone who will tick every box. 

6. People don‚Äôt separate their partner from their mistakes. If you made a mistake then you‚Äôre all bad not just the behavior. 

7. Sex has become transactional and lost depth. I was taught that sex is a love language and a sacred way to show your partner just how much you love them. I think that being so vulnerable around someone requires a lot trust building and safe-space building as well. 

8. A lack of patience and understanding that a long lasting lifetime relationship is one that will take a lot of effort and patience to build. Things that come up fast always fall even faster. 

9. Fear of abandonment. The amount of times my GF has thought I would leave her if she told me about her trauma or made a mistake is truly heartbreaking.

10. A lack of doing the small things. Showing up for the massive crises of life is required of you as a partner but what about going the extra mile without being asked to. Do the small things and take initiative. 

12. Sacrifice rather than compromise. The individualistic nature of American society has made it so that finding a middle ground with your partner is now considered self-loathing and wrong when in reality, you will not see eye-to-eye with your partner everyday but it‚Äôs on you to find a way. 

13. Finally, Self-love is the most important ingredient to a happy relationship. I wish more people realized that you can‚Äôt give water from an empty well and that you have to love yourself before ever loving someone else.","Why healthy, long-life, and committed love is dying in America",18lktr6,1702936712.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lktr6/why_healthy_longlife_and_committed_love_is_dying/,

"I want to start this off with just saying I've cheated on someone before. 4 years ago I cheated on my long distance boyfriend so this is just probably the last bit of karma I'm getting for doing it. I've always been open with people that I've been unfaithful and realized it's something I can never put someone through again and I was a terrible person for doing it. And when I got with my ex boyfriend that was the first thing I told him. He understood and things were fine until earlier this year. He began to use it against me. I got a lead roll in the musical I was doing and he said everyone was going to see how beautiful and amazing I was and I was going to cheat on him. Then again whenever I went out to the mall. And then again whenever I got sexually harrased. And then on my vacation where it was the worse of my sexual harassment shit. I stayed up comforting him that I only wanted him and those guys were just creeps and I could never want anyone else but him. Then for the last time, he used it against me when I said I didn't like how close he was getting to one of his girl friends. At that point I was so mentally exhausted and I left him in August. Fast forward to November I had gotten a new boyfriend and honestly he's so sweet and he's been protecting me from the harassment from my ex boyfriend. People who knew us began to tell me about the girl friend I was worried about. Turns out, she wasn't only his girl friend, she was also his girlfriend. My world paused and all I could think was ""Why doesn't he feel bad?"". And honestly every time I see her all I can think of is how they don't feel any remorse for what they did. They don't stay up late at night thinking they're terrible people for it like I did. Why don't they feel bad? Maybe I just want closure. Maybe I just want to think they're good people again, but all I know is that this is probably another kick in the ass for cheating and I feel like such shit.

"It's quite self-explanatory. But I think it's important to add some details so I guess I could get a more accurate help.

It's a bit of a difficult situation, I live in Spain while she lives in Germany, we met through a relative of mine who is at the same time best friend of this person. I know her for 2 years now, more or less, and I started developing a crush for her a month ago, even if we are pretty far away we are talking daily, as well as doing calls and videocalls often.

Anyway, and why I say is kind of a weird situation, es because we started developing an internal joke where we are calling us honey, darling, and acting as if we were engaged, it is as childish as it sounds but it is how it is.

My crush on her doesn't develop from this tho, I have clear that this is just a joke and nothing more.

Well, today I decided to confess, it was pretty straightforward and chilled than I thought, as at the beginning she was just not believing me,she told me if I would be living there it would be a yes, but as it is not like that, she has to ""think about it"", now I guess this is just a polite no, I let her know that I would leave her time but of course not a lot.

recently Im having thoughts to get into a relationship cause I feel a little lonely. 
And I feel like I‚Äôm starting to get addicted to audios of males saying nice things or sometimes even sexual things (they are all over YouTube and tik tok) and that is not the best thing to do if you‚Äôre trying to be religious. 

Before graduation I would refuse the idea of arranged marriages, but now that I spend most of my time alone it doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea.. as I would get to know the guy before I marry him + marriage is the only way to get your sexual desires and that seems like a good idea to me as i want to stop sinning.

Then i saw the massage that my mom sent to her, she described me as fat, unemployed, and other things about me. 
i asked my mom why did you say that Im fat and she said: well thats how i see you, i dont think that you are so fat i just think that you are a little fat. (As if that will make me feel so much better) 

My mind immediately shut down, my emotions were shut down at that moment as well and i told my mom to tell them that i decline the offer. 

I went to my room feeling like shit, cried for hours because I felt like Im not beautiful, because I felt like that‚Äôs all what they are going to see( that im fat) and because i felt bad for declining without even seeing or meeting the guy and see what i would think about him and his personality.

"I (26F) was never anywhere near overweight - I would say at my heaviest, 145 lbs (5‚Äô5‚Äù), I was on the curvy end of average, but always healthy. Raised by an aggressive almond mom and an even more aggressive almond grandma, I still always thought I was fat and hated my body, but I fought through that and kept eating what I wanted and living my life happily, challenging my insecurity rather than yielding to it. 

Then I started developing stomach problems and was advised to follow the FODMAP diet. After two years of that, I lost about 20 lbs, and even though I was still healthy (120-125), I had gotten addicted to restriction. I got addicted to hearing people tell me how much weight I‚Äôd lost. I got addicted to my body always being just a little bit smaller than it had ever been before. I still thought I was fat, but I got so much validation from ‚Äúat least not being as fat as I used to be‚Äù. It was so gradual that I didn‚Äôt notice it was even anorexia. 

It got worse. I stopped attending social events because they all involved food. I stopped allowing myself meals with more than 200 calories. My hour-long daily walk that used to be healthy turned into spending 3 hours a day on the treadmill. I eventually levelled out and stopped losing weight, so I started purging. 

After a year of that, I got down to 90 lbs. My hair was falling out, I had regular heart palpitations, I was passing out constantly. I lost all of my friends because I hadn‚Äôt left my home in a year. I didn‚Äôt have the strength to stand, but I still walked three hours a day on the treadmill even though my joints were in agony. I was torturing myself to have a body that I couldn‚Äôt even show off and STILL found fat and disgusting. It was at this point that my partner and roommate confronted me and begged me to try to recover, because it was clear that this was going to kill me.

I‚Äôve been working on small steps since then. I‚Äôm still restricting meals to 200 calories and walking 3 hours a day, but I‚Äôve stopped purging and allowed myself fruits and vegetables as snacks. I‚Äôm back to 105-110, and am taking supplements to try to give my body more of what it needs. 

And it‚Äôs hell. It‚Äôs the first time since this all started that I am not at the lowest weight I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm constantly comparing my body to how it looked and felt at 90 lbs, and at least before, yes, I still thought I was fat, but I had the reassurance that at least I (to me) wasn‚Äôt as fat as I used to be. Now, in my eyes, I‚Äôm fatter. Every waking moment, I‚Äôm thinking about how fat I look and feel. I punch my stomach until it bruises because I can‚Äôt stand that it sticks out an inch now and you can only see my hipbones when I‚Äôm laying flat now. All I do is compare my body to the ones I see on TV. Every thought is about how disgusting I am now. I cried for half an hour because I let myself have a bite of my wife‚Äôs mashed potatoes and her leftover salad (a few bites). Letting myself get to 90 lbs was the worst mistake I ever made, because now I‚Äôll always be fat in comparison. Therapy isn‚Äôt helping, and I wish I could‚Äôve just starved myself to death. I was happier when I was. 

I physically cannot see my body as it is. I‚Äôm still 5-10 lbs underweight, and I perceive myself as chubby at best. My brain is too far gone to be fixed, and I can‚Äôt come back from this in a weight-obsessed society that surrounds me with triggers. My ED ruined my entire life.

He feels about the same with mental health ie people with severe trauma (even if diagnosed and not just ‚Äúi feel xyz‚Äùall the time) are ‚Äúweak individuals‚Äù and thus expects of them what is expected of a normal person who is without trauma. 

I.. don‚Äôt know how to feel or think about this. I only wish that he doubles down on depression/anxiety asap and maybe get into a scenario close to being r@ped, but not actually being r@ped.

These beliefs are certainly because he hasn‚Äôt encountered it at all before, or because he couldn‚Äôt fathom it because again he‚Äôs close minded to this for now.

For context, he‚Äôs 24 and I‚Äôm 27.

"So I am an ally and someone who is an outspoken ally of my community. It‚Äôs a very artsy and performative community, so naturally there‚Äôs a big LGBTQA representation. But over the last year, I‚Äôve noticed a growing trend becoming more forward about this idea of someone who is gay trying to ‚Äúturn‚Äù or ‚Äúflip‚Äù someone who is outwardly heterosexual. And it‚Äôs been triggering both because of my own experiences with it, and because as a cis-het man, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel great about my prospects at finding love and security with someone. 

I grew up in southern Baptist south. I was raised with the rhetoric of ‚Äúlove the sinner, not the sin‚Äù when it came to LGBTQA. This passive aggressive and demeaning to the point of dehumanizing perspective that gay people are choosing sin just by living how they are, infuriates me today. But growing up it‚Äôs what I held to be true. It took me getting kicked out of the church and then joining my high school theatre, and truly listening to my new friends who were LGBTQA to truly understand them, and learn what it meant to have and feel unconditional love. I haven‚Äôt looked back since. 

But almost immediately I was subjected to this constant push to ‚Äútry gay‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow can you know if you haven‚Äôt tried it?‚Äù I‚Äôve kissed three men in my life, and now confidently have an opinion against kissing men. And still, all through college, my boundaries were pushed, both with verbal pressure and physical boundaries. I was sexually assaulted multiple times in college, and only once was a girl. Luckily, growing up in the church with handsy adults and church leaders had prepared me for people trying to push boundaries. But it made it very hard to unwork this Christian homophobia as I‚Äôm being bombarded with people who refuse to respect my space and boundaries. 

Every women I‚Äôve dated has been bisexual. I promise, it‚Äôs not something I seek out, it ironically just happens that way. But with my last long term girlfriend it was initially a problem because she had never really explored that side of her sexuality. It had given me insecurity because this wasn‚Äôt long after Me Too and the rhetoric of ‚Äúmen are trash‚Äù which ‚Äúhaha, you‚Äôre right, I am trash, even if this isn‚Äôt specifically about me, but men have for hundreds of year disenfranchised women, so whatever you say, it‚Äôs your turn with the microphone, I‚Äôm here in support‚Äù. And my ex to her credit never cheated and was incredibly gracious with my ignorance on the issue. But there was always a fear that some hot masc lesbian would see her as a target and say the things she just needed to hear that night when I wasn‚Äôt around. It‚Äôs what had happened with my previous two serious relationships. 

Cut to today and why this is coming up now. It‚Äôs been a year since my ex and I broke up, and I‚Äôve reentered the dating pool. I believe that I am an attractive person with a good job, a healthy amount of charisma and charm, and an eagerness paired with emotional intelligence to be part of a healthy, loving relationship. Or rather, I *KNOW* the first half of that run on sentence is true bc yet again, a lot of gay men are being pushy in my life. Regardless, it‚Äôs not the attention I‚Äôm looking for, and from what I know, dating in 2023 is a shit show for any man, so I‚Äôm feeling the dejection and issues of self worth there. On top of that, I keep seeing LGBTQA comedians make jokes about the ‚Äúflipping‚Äù game. It‚Äôs come up a few times on my social feeds, I was watching a tv show and it was the topic of one episode, and it just seems even if I do find someone, at any moment that security and trust could be jeopardized. And if it does come that, ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm a man. I had it coming.‚Äù

It‚Äôs bringing up a lot of just basic homophobia, literally! A base fear of the homosexual community. And here‚Äôs the fucking Cherry on top, *I AM BI-CURIOUS!!!* Despite prior experiences, I would be open to exploring something that‚Äôs not heteronormative with someone who is feminine, so long as they shave and brush their damn teeth! But, the second I publicize that, I‚Äôll get descended upon by gay men being extra pushy bc ‚Äúyou said‚Ä¶‚Äù. So my options feel like I either accept I‚Äôm not deserving of a women‚Äôs love, or lean into something I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm totally comfortable with because that‚Äôs what others have decided I‚Äôm good for. 

I want to continue being an ally. I want to be open about who am. I want to find someone I love and not feel like I‚Äôm the least deserving demographic in the world. But it‚Äôs so hard when I have to be so hyper vigilant.",This concept of someone who is gay ‚Äúflipping‚Äù others to be gay is really triggering my homophobic feelings.,18lk1pe,1702934760.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lk1pe/this_concept_of_someone_who_is_gay_flipping/,

This broke me, I am already not in the best position in my life and on top of that, her saying that hurt me, i genuinely cant function properly with the thought of her not being sure about me. I cant go a day without talking to her and she wants space, i got severe anxiety and my heart started racing when she said that.

im currently limiting talking to her but being honest i think she will say we need to break up soon, and i dont know how i will deal with that, i already had abandoned issues and this is going to be a major trigger, i have never felt this disconnected with myself before.

We did some stuff early on but I realized I really wasn't ready for it, so we put that on pause and have had a couple arguments over it since, because he thinks it's just that I don't find him attractive anymore (which isn't true).

Nowadays he has this habit of touching me down there randomly, even if there are people around if he thinks no one will notice. When I move his hand away he puts it right back, and this keeps going on for a couple more times until he finally stops and then pouts at me, which makes me feel bad about not wanting to be touched like that constantly, especially when there are people around. Same thing happens if I tell him not to, it becomes a back and forth until he pouts and stops. He asks why and ""there's people around"" and 'I don't want you to""' don't seem to be reason enough. 

I have some negative experiences with sexual stuff from past relationships, which is why this feels even worse. He knows all of it, more than anyone. 

I will talk to him about that, but I hate this. It's making me feel violated, like I'm just something to play with to him, even if I know that's not his intention.

I really just needed to take a moment to talk about this with SOMEONE if not just type it out! And I know I'm not the only one in this position, which should hopefully make me feel.... not as alone.  


So I recently turned 28 almost 2 weeks ago, still live with my parents, travel 1-2 hours for a part-time job that pays only a quarter above that state's minimum wage, and I'm single due to a combination of living in the suburbs mainly occupied by Gen Xers/Boomers and/or my being fat.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like I don't try to fix these things, I'm not just doing nothing! I do job search when I can, I do look into social events and meeting people online (though struggle to get myself to irl events that don't cost $100), and I do have a system for not always snacking or eating better. It can just feel like a sumo wrestler is sitting on my while I'm trying to stand up from laying down. I'm not getting any new jobs, I'm pretty much stuck for now living with my parents, and again I don't have a girlfriend. And all the while, I'm just expected to keep trying as if I'm not just grabbing to air!  


What do my parents say about this? ""You seem sad, maybe you should see a therapist."" .... like really? you think if I appear happier, then I'll just magically be in a better position career-wise and socially? Earlier my dad even comes up, sees me watching YouTube, calls me lazy, I DO go to do some work, but it doesn't matter. It won't be enough, I still will feel defeated, and just be excepted as if I'm OK when I'm not nor will ever pretend to be. Even if I go to therapy, all my parents hope it'll do is stop me from complaing or somehow make me happier, when at the end of the day, what I need is to.... not be living with mommy and daddy working a part time job and feel like an outcast from society. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to think anymore. I can't say they haven't helped because my mom has sent me SOME jobs, but I'm either uninterested or not qualified, they do cook for me but it's always what THEY want, (never tried to help me get a girlfriend but I wouldn't expect them to), and at times I can't help but feel like they care about being right more than they do being correct.

"I know how the title sounds. I know I sound like a monster. At this point, I don't care. I'm a 17-year-old girl and currently in my senior year of high school. This time in my life is already super stressful with college applications, financial aid forms, scholarships, exams, keeping my grades up while taking honors and AP classes, etc. I have to juggle so much right now and I feel stressed all the time. And I genuinely think this fucking canine is going to make me implode.

For context, I grew up with my parents separated basically since I was a baby. During the school year, I'm with my mom during the week and my dad on the weekend. My mom was never really in the dating scene, so while I was at her house it was always just me, her, and our two cats. Last year, everything got turned upside-down when my mom started dating a man she met online, who I'll call Mark. Three months later, Mark came to meet us in person. We went to a restaurant and honestly he seemed cool-- he's from Canada and I'm half Moroccan from my dad's side, so we had in common that we both speak French. That night he asked me for permission to propose to my mom.

 I was more than a little thrown off, because it all seemed so fast. I told him as such and expressed that I thought they should see each other for a little while more before even considering marriage. He said that was okay. Or so I thought. That weekend him and my mom went on a trip to New York, and I learned that he proposed to her anyway and she said yes. I found out because they posted about it on Facebook, so I was shortly bombarded by texts from all my aunts and uncles asking if I was okay with the news.

Obviously I was pissed at first. I think I honestly would have felt better if Mark hadn't asked me before, because at least then he wouldn't be showing a blatant disregard for my opinion. I get that they're both adults and it wasn't my place as a 16-year-old girl to cockblock them, but come on? Why ask me for permission if you're just going to do it anyway? What's the point of that?

Long story short he moved in that summer, and gradually I got used to him. It was hard at first, because I'm autistic and I really hate major changes. But I warmed up to him after a bit. All things considered, he's a nice enough guy. He lets me use his PS5 to play video games and he takes me out for coffee after school sometimes, and most importantly he treats my mom right. So by the time the wedding came this November, I felt fine with the fact they were getting married. I was just happy that my mom was happy.

Now you might be wondering, what does this have to do with a dog? Well, shortly after they got married, they started talking about getting a puppy. I thought that was a little weird, since we already had two senior cats and our house isn't exactly big. They asked me what I thought and I said it was a bad idea, for the two reasons I just mentioned, but also because neither of them were working at the time. My mom is on medical leave while looking for another job and Mark was still getting all the proper paperwork done to be able to work in America. Training and taking care of a puppy would be extra stress to their already loaded schedules, and I was worried it wouldn't be the best environment to incorporate another living thing into.

If the previous anecdote didn't already make you suspect as much, they got a dog anyway. He was a few weeks old when we got him. My first thought when they showed him to me was ""well, this was a bad idea."" And it was.

This is the part where I'm going to sound like a compassionless brat, and you can judge me if you want. I already wasn't a dog person before, and a part of me thought having a puppy might change that. No. I think I just straight-up hate dogs now. 

That little terror is the most irritating, loud, smelly, hysterical creature I have ever come across. I swear to God he's an invasive species, because he's taken over the whole house. My stepdad had the brilliant idea of putting his pee pad in the laundry room, which just so happens to be where I GET DRESSED FOR SCHOOL EVERYDAY because that's where my uniform is hung up. Now the whole room smells like shit, there's dog shit on the pee pad, in the corner, next to the washing machine, everywhere. The dog shit isn't even limited to the designated laundry room-- if he feels like shitting, he'll shit anywhere in the house. The whole living room is his play pen. There's like 50 dog toys all over the floor that I constantly trip on. I can't watch TV, relax on the couch, or even eat at the table anymore. He's constantly biting my ankles when I'm eating meals, he jumps on me whenever I sit down and tries to bite my face and hands, he barks at me whenever I try to ignore him like my mom says. I can't do anything downstairs without him biting me or clawing at me, or just barking for no reason. He's routinely knocked food and drinks out of my hands by jumping on me and almost broke my laptop once.  I feel like I should mention he doesn't do this to my mom or Mark-- just me.

 He also doesn't get along well with the cats, which I told my mom and stepdad would happen. I have to constantly deal with them getting into hissing-and-barking matches, and the dog is always the instigator. The cats have literally started hanging out exclusively in my room because that's the only place where the dog isn't allowed in. 

I get that this is normal puppy behavior. I'm not that ignorant. I don't think he's ever being malicious when he does these things. I get that he's still learning, and his aggressive behaviors are probably just him being playful. But knowing that doesn't make him any less of a tumor. The mere knowledge that he's acting this way because he's a puppy doesn't magically make the annoying behavior go away. I never wanted a dog. I never even wanted a stepdad. My life is already stressful enough because I'm supposed to do my little worksheets and write my little essays and keep my little grade numbers above a 95 to keep my financial aid while my entire future is being decided for me by admissions committees, and this dog is constantly pushing me over the edge into a mental breakdown. When I'm in a good mood he ruins it. When I'm tense (which is often), he'll always be that one little nudge I need to want to jump off the nearest building. 

The worst part is, my mom and stepdad will try to pretend like this thing is my responsibility now that he's living in the house. Like, respectfully, no he isn't. It's not like I begged my parents for a dog and now I've decided he's too much work. I never wanted a fucking dog. I told them that explicitly, and they got a dog anyway. AGAIN, they're both adults and they are well within their rights to do whatever they want. It's not like I pay for this house. But don't just get a dog and expect me to shape my whole life around it. They say they're training him out of his more harmful behaviors, but if so they're doing a piss-poor job, because I still get marks on my wrists and hands from him biting me, and I've started eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner at my desk because I can't stand be in the same room with that dog anymore.

I'm not heartless-- I'll put food in his bowl when it's empty, I give him treats when he exhibits good behavior, and I'll let him out of his cage when if he's crying because I don't want him to be sad even though I hate him. He doesn't deserve mistreatment just because I don't like him. I don't think anyone, human or dog, should be punished for things that aren't their fault, which is why I've resorted to just distancing myself from him. I don't even think it's the dog I hate. I just hate the situation. I hate that so much of my life is being decided for me and I have no choice in it. I hate that I was given the illusion of choice multiple times, and routinely shown that no one in this household actually cares what I think or how I feel. I hate that they decided to get that little hellion and now it's my problem. I know my anger should be directed at my mom and stepdad, but every time I've tried to talk to them about they'll point out that they can't just return the dog (which I agree with, I don't think any dog should be put through that), so it's just fucking useless. 

That was my rant. You can think of me as an entitled dog hater if you want. I just needed to get this off my chest, because there's no real way I can talk about it without sounding like an unreasonable brat. To anyone who actually read this whole thing, I commend you. Happy holidays (if you observe any holidays around this time), and I hope your New Year is filled with joy. Toodles.

TL;DR: My mom and stepdad got a profoundly irritating dog while I'm going through the most stressful time of my life thus far, and I feel like I'm about to rip my hair out.

"I (25F) have dreamed of having a family for as long as I can remember, it‚Äôs probably one of the only things that really got me through my toughest moments in life, knowing that one day I‚Äôd get to be someone‚Äôs Mum.

I met my boyfriend (25M) when we were 22(him) and 23(me), we had a bumpy start to our relationship because he was in the military and away a lot so had to do long distance. I made it clear from the very beginning that I wanted kids and he was never quite as keen but agreed and I just assumed this was most young men‚Äôs way of thinking and that he would become more sure with age and our relationship improving.

The longer we‚Äôve known each other the more we‚Äôve talked about kids (him always being more reserved about the idea but still agreeing). We‚Äôve picked out names, agreed on having 3, spoke about living arrangements and just in general started to create this proper idea of having a family together. I‚Äôve always said I wanted to have my first baby by the time I was 27 and this was something he seemed to be happy with. We even had a conversation where he said that he‚Äôd want a baby girl and want to be able to spoil her so I felt sure that this was something he now wanted too.

Last year I had a miscarriage, I hadn‚Äôt even known I was pregnant at the time as it had only been a couple of weeks but I bled a lot and had a lot of pain and after going to the doctor it was confirmed it was a miscarriage. I told my boyfriend this and although he comforted me he said he was relieved as he wouldn‚Äôt have been ready. I would‚Äôve kept the baby whether we were ready or not however I did understand where he was coming from as we were not in the best financial situation nor were we living together as he was still living away with the military.
My sister also suffered early menopause at 30 and had a lot of trouble conceiving my youngest niece when she was in her late 20s so I feel like my time is starting to run out.

I have to add I am absolutely head over heels in love with this man, I am sure he is the love of my life and I can‚Äôt even look at any other man and find them the slightest bit attractive now.

We‚Äôve recently had a conversation and he‚Äôs told me that he‚Äôs now sure he DOESN‚ÄôT want kids. I told him I felt lied to and that he‚Äôs just strung me along as I‚Äôve always made it clear that a family is really all I want out of life. He said he‚Äôs sorry but it‚Äôs the way he feels and he can‚Äôt just have a baby to make me happy knowing it would make him miserable. I don‚Äôt understand how he‚Äôd be miserable, he would make the best dad ever, he has a niece who he absolutely adores and I‚Äôve tried to explain to him that having his own child would be a whole new level of love compared to that. He said he just told me all of the things about having children and agreed with me to keep me happy as he didn‚Äôt want an argument.

I‚Äôm now in a predicament where I love him more than I ever thought I could love anyone, I cannot imagine my life without him and like I said I don‚Äôt even look at anyone else and find them attractive anymore, but I can also not imagine my life not having a child.
He said he obviously wants to stay with me as he‚Äôs happy with me but also wants me to be happy. The problem is I know I can‚Äôt be happy either way, it‚Äôs a lose lose situation for me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. If I leave him, I‚Äôll be devastated that I had to give him up and I feel like I‚Äôd never find anyone who would be able to replace him as I‚Äôd just always think of him. If I stay with him I‚Äôd become unhappy with our situation as I can‚Äôt imagine growing old and not having children around. I even suggested him getting me pregnant and then me just leaving because I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else‚Äôs baby but he said that wouldn‚Äôt be right.

"My life was amazing before. I was accepted into college, living at home, had an amazing boyfriend and friends, working a job I love.

Now all of that is gone. My boyfriend broke up with me and started dating my bully. All of my friends went with him and don't talk to me anymore. I'm being kicked out soon and I don't have a lot of savings. I have nothing and basically no one. My family hates me and threw me in a mental hospital a couple years ago because of it.

On top of all this, same night I found out I was getting kicked out, I found out the guy I've been going out with is apparently a Dad. He has a 2 year old son that he just didn't mention. And the kicker? The reason he isn't with his ex and kid is because of a bipolar psychosis he went into: babbling, violent, almost killed them flying down the highway.

"Tl;dr: I ruined the relationship by lying, he keeps starting fights about everything, im upset over him saying horrible things to me while i was addicted to drugs 


I should start by saying it‚Äôs my fault our relationship is the way it is now, or at least thats what he‚Äôs told me and what I feel. I lied to him for months with seemingly no remorse. But now he‚Äôs making every day a hell for me. He constantly gets mad at me, after saying he would try not to. He‚Äôs not trying at all. It‚Äôs small things, too, like how messy I am or how I don‚Äôt pay attention. Every time we argue he accuses me of not loving him or hating him or some shit like that. The last time I confronted him about the way he was acting all he said was that we need a break and he didn‚Äôt even apologize. Sometimes, things are fine, we laugh with each other, we‚Äôre intimate with each other, we talk, but then he decides to withdraw or start an argument again. It‚Äôs so draining, I have no idea anymore if he actually wants to get better, he just keeps starting fights when all I‚Äôm fucking trying to do is heal. I can‚Äôt heal in this environment.

Also, he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand Im justified in feeling upset for the way he reacted to me lying to him. I was lying because I was addicted to drugs and I didn‚Äôt want to stop.

"Married to my ex for over twenty years, we had one child. Divorced for over five years due to abuse, poor parenting and other issues, including his inability to function without someone else doing everything for him. They were also very involved in our daily lives because he was so codependent. My ex FIL passed away and ex MIL got even more in our faces. When we divorced, I honestly felt I‚Äôd divorced her too lol. My ex was never a good father but it was even worse after the divorce as he basically abandoned our teenager. Ex has borderline personality disorder (diagnosed about a month before divorce) and had a terribly mentally abusive childhood.

Some backstory here‚Ä¶ ex‚Äôs parents were wealthy and basically never let him fail, always provided a safety net, were always using the help and money to manipulate, he hated them for it, and he was ‚Äúwaiting for them to die so [he] could get [his] share‚Äù (his words). I swore I would do better by my child so he wouldn‚Äôt grow up like my ex and completely unable to function as an adult. I‚Äôm a present parent, have always been supportive and a constant for him even when his father ditched him, and he says frequently I‚Äôm the only parent he ever really had. I still support my son financially though I did require he get a job and work over summers and breaks to have spending money and to help with car insurance.

So, when my child went to college this fall there were things he had to manage on his own, such as obtaining and filling  his own ADHD meds. They are a controlled substance, he needs the name brand, it‚Äôs tricky at times to get the scripts (esp with shortages), and since he‚Äôs an adult, it‚Äôs not like I could request them and pick them up - and even if I could I wanted him to be able to do it without me doing everything. I helped him request and order them his last year of high school to help him understand the process but made it clear he had to manage this when he went off to school four hrs away. 

This last semester was my child‚Äôs  first semester away and there was a six week gap where he didn‚Äôt have his meds. He didn‚Äôt tell me until he‚Äôd been off them for over two weeks and at that point I did give him advice on calling the Dr and pharmacy. He just didn‚Äôt follow through. Six weeks went by while he was off meds and I did check in frequently to see if he‚Äôd done what he needed to but he he hadn‚Äôt. He  finally got them and figured the process out so I think he gets it now, but he struggled those six weeks grade-wise. 

He is now home for break and visited his grandmother last night (even though he won‚Äôt see his father I did try to encourage my child to keep his relationships with his father‚Äôs family as they didn‚Äôt do anything to hurt him). Apparently she spent half the visit complaining about my poor parenting and insulting me because I didn‚Äôt make sure my child had his meds immediately, she called me names and insulted my current husband, basically insinuated I abandoned him when I got married a few years ago, that I don‚Äôt provide adequately for him, that I let him dress poorly (sweatpants and a tee shirt and how do I control what a 19 year old man wears?), and it went on. My son told me about it and said it was upsetting, and that he tried defending me but that made her go off even more. I‚Äôm just mad and very hurt that she would say such things to my child. I won‚Äôt say anything to her because I don‚Äôt want her to get mad at him for telling me, and I know it won‚Äôt make a bit of difference. I also don‚Äôt really want to care about what she says but it‚Äôs still infuriating. I just needed to get it off my chest that I can‚Äôt stand my ex-MIL and I think it‚Äôs rich that she‚Äôs sitting there criticizing my parenting when her own son is a deadbeat father who rarely lifted a finger to help raise his child.","Ex-MIL trashes me to my child and I loathe her, lengthy rant",18lj25e,1702932327.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lj25e/exmil_trashes_me_to_my_child_and_i_loathe_her/,
"29 Married from an year

I didn‚Äôt reveal any of my fantasies before marriage and she is also in an assumption that I like Vanilla.

Finally, when we had our last session, she asked if I would like to wear a bra and she praised me that it even looked good on me. She did everything what I do during our sessions, like pulling the bra down and suck the nipples, hold the hooks part and act as if she is riding me, anal fingering.

"F20, he‚Äôs M25. 
I met my old friend because he was one of my tattoo artists. I went for a walk-in tattoo on Friday the 13th with a couple of friends, who has had tattoos done by him before. 
He‚Äôs an attractive guy and we got along well, as much as tattoo artists and clients do really. I did find him really attractive, and my friends noticed and thought it was funny. 
Me and him spoke on Instagram a bit afterward, all tattoo-related things. He eventually starts talking about the gym and things like that too. 
One night, I‚Äôm out with one of the friends he tattooed that day. We get way too drunk and message him, with her telling him I ‚Äòfancy him‚Äô and me being too drunk to protest. 
He asks me on a date the next day- we go on a couple dates that go well but there‚Äôs no romantic spark. It was also the wrong time for me in hindsight- I had a traumatic breakup just 3 months prior from a serious relationship. I did however enjoy his company and said I‚Äôd be willing to hangout as friends. I thought he was lovely and interesting. He said that would be nice and asks a couple days later to be FWB. I (drunkenly) agree. No regrets there. I stayed round his and had a genuinely nice time with him. I open up to him about some things and he was kind and supportive. He was a real friend to me. 
Last weekend, me and my best friend decide to get matching tattoos- obviously done by him. I‚Äôm running late so my friend gets hers first. I get there when the tattoos are close to being finished and she unfortunately had to go due to family commitments. One of my other friends was with me. I get my tattoos done and everything is fine. My other friend then decided to get a tattoo done too-quite a big design. I unfortunately have to leave about an hour after my tattoos are done as I was looking after a friends dog. My friend tears me saying he‚Äôs talking about me, and how lovely I am. 
She then says he went on a bit of a weird rant about how he thinks I have serious feelings for him (I don‚Äôt) and how he should distance himself from me. My friend informed him I don‚Äôt. He carried on talking about it. I then texted him saying I don‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm hurt that he doesn‚Äôt want I talk to me again over this.

"hello people of reddit. I am a 20 year old girl from a southeast asian household. I am making this post in hopes of someone can give me an advice on what to do or someone could possibly help me in any way.
I would start this story way back 2020, that year was my last year in senior highschool or in my country we call it Grade 12. It was pandemic and only online classes were conducted. I was depressed and faling my classes because I can't find the will to attend any. My depression and my behavior of neglecting my studies persisted til my first year in university, I flunked out on 2 minor subjects which angered my parents. Take note that I'm not really close with my mom and dad due to them being busy with work and rarely finds time to even have a serious conversation with me. I felt like the city life is suffocating me so I begged them to let me stay to my dad's hometown. It is an Island 14hr drive from the capital city.
They did agreed but with the condition that I'll be staying with my Aunt. I reluctantly agreed to their condition because that same aunt took care of me for awhile when I was like 8 year old and she was nice to me back then. Oh boy, I wish I fought for independence back then. The first year of my stay with my aunt wasn't really bad but I often bear snarky comments on how I dress, or how I am being influenced by my friends into making bad decisions or on how I always came home late (I do have classes that ends by 7pm and it take 30 mins to travel from home to school and vice versa) There is also an instance where I received malicious comments and was bodyshamed when she saw my post wearin a two piece swimsuit, I didn't see anything wrong with it since it wasn't a suggestive pose it was just a literal me standing and smiling while wearing that. I have always tried to explain things to her but she never listen and dismisses everything I say as a lie. She often report this behaviors to my parents secretly which leaves me baffled on how outrageous some of things she said about me. She also likes to gossip to the neighbors about me. My friend's mom was always the one relaying those gossip to me. At first I never really cared about those gossips because it's only about me being useless and lazy girl that doesn't do any housework (she spread this gossip just because I left the dishes in the sink ONE TIME because I was about to be late) or how I never really study hard. However, 2 weeks ago she just suddenly turns into a sweet lady asking if I already had dinner or whatnot, this is very unusual because we never really cared if the other is dying due to starvation. Then last week when I got home from school, she just started to accuse me of stealing money from her which I have never done even when I am struggling to pay for my own basic necessities. I tried telling her that I never done it but she keeps saying things that I am a  sl‚Äît and a thief. She called my parents saying those horrible things. I was hoping that they would send me a message or give me a call to let me explain but I received nothing. I tried contacting them but they never answered. That's when I knew that they believed her and never gave me the benefit of the doubt. Few hours before I make this post, my friend informed me that this aunt is spreading the gossip to the neighbors that I am a thief that stole money, jewelries and even my cousin's clothes. My friend told me that she heard from the rumor that my parents are coming over to this small town just to pick me up and never let me continue with me studies.

" Long story short I ,was, talking to this guy (25m) for a bit over 6 months. We had a lot of mutual friends and the day I met him I has spent 2 hours talking to him, we met at a vape shop while he was working I had just intended on picking up a couple drinks and ended up staying until they closed.

 I started frequently going in the evenings to talk to him. This went on for a couple months, we're both pretty into cars so one night I invited him out for a night drive/stargazing. It was so fun and so sweet and we didn't spend a single moment silent. So then the drives became consistent. 

Before this point I hadn't had interest in anyone in 4 years, I had gotten out of a really bad relationship, I had been raped very roughly and very consistantly and it took my body those 4 years to fully heal from the damage, theres still a large build up of scarred tissue in my vagina from this. He was honorably discharged from the navy and had started getting more personal and open with me about some of his experiences there and about his childhood which was really rough. I felt safe and opened up to him about some of the details of my previous relationship. He listened and was so gentile with me. 

 Eventually after a few months of talking with him he had made me felt really safe and cared for and I made the decision to try and sleep with him and he was down so we did. The situation vert quickly escalated, I was staying with him all the time and we were planning on hopefully developing this into a relationship. Due to previous issues both of us were really intimidated to get into a relationship and we were both very content just spending some of our free time together. 

Now I work about 80 hours a week and have 1 off day. I take my career very seriously and revolve most of my life around it so im often very exhausted. He started getting upset that I was spending free time sleeping or taking care of my needs one particular incident I was just dropping something off to him and he had gotten agressive about me not staying, I was obviously not okay with this and so we sat down and had a conversation which lead to he had a really shitty day and just wanted to be around me, he was angry with other people and taken it out towards me which he recognized and apologized for. I should have walked away from the entire situation that day. 

It was better for a few days and then the possessive behavior continued. Out of nowhere he has started acting really timid towards me and shut me out rather abruptly. I had tried SO MANY TIMES to talk and ask him what was wrong and he always turned it into how me didn't want to make me upset but the only thing upsetting me was him acting like I was mad and being selfish when I wanted my time to myself. 

At this point I had already been sharing private photos with him as he was sharing some with me. I got to the point where I couldn't really handle the constant need to codle him in order to keep him from freaking out and I couldnt deal with him shutting down when I was trying to problem solve. 

We'll ive known his best friend for a long time so I called him to have him help plan out how I was going to get out, and thats when I learned that he was sharing my private photos with him and saying just really nasty and private things about me. I was planning to meet up with this friend the following week and he was going to tell me about it then as it was fairly recent, but he knows that im not fond of having serious conversations over the phone and I wouldn't have been able to see him before out planned day. 

I got all of my stuff back and made him show me him deleting my nudes I just feel so dirty and taken advantage of. It's like I finally heal and feel comfortable and all I get is exposed and embarrassed and I know its my fault for sleeping with him I just thought we were on a more intimate level and that he actually cared about me.

"Long one so I apologize. Just gotta rant.

My (26M) gf (26F) and I have been dating for 3 years. During that time period, holidays have never been easy, but Christmas is a whole other level.

Her mom is an absolute control freak. Everything is an expectation. I EXPECT you to be there for morning presents. I EXPECT you to be there for morning brunch. I EXPECT to see you for dinner. Etc etc.

My gf has extremely intense OCD and anxiety. Her mom uses this to maintain control over her and guilt her into doing what she wants. Despite both of us being adults, it was a year long battle just to get her to move in with me. She has grown over the past 3 years in ways I could‚Äôve never imagined and I am unbelievably proud of her. We have worked together and she has done plenty on her own to build herself up as a more confident, self-reliant woman. I love her more than anything and plan to marry her.

However, our one weak spot continues to be mom. Again, we have made A LOT of progress getting away from mom‚Äôs influence, but when it comes to holidays and traditions, there‚Äôs almost no pushback. We always fold to mom‚Äôs wishes during these moments. This has caused immense stress in our relationship, specifically regarding holidays and especially Christmas.

Our first Christmas, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. I was the ‚Äúnew boyfriend‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt as familiar with how their family operated. Being a newer relationship, I was also not invited to their family traditions, only being welcomed over after they opened presents for dinner. I didn‚Äôt mind as again, we were fresh, so I assumed we‚Äôd spend the dinner there and then head to my house for the other half of the day. We ended up staying there for the next 6hrs due to all the ‚Äútraditions‚Äù and ways they do things. We got to my house when it was dark and my little brother was getting ready for bed, and exchanged gifts with my parents in the dark. I was bummed, and just asked if we could make more of an effort to see my family for Christmas next year. She agreed.

Year 2 was no different. After now 2yrs of dating, I was still not welcomed to their present opening tradition, despite her older sister‚Äôs boyfriend being welcomed. Her mom claimed this was because he had planned to propose to her, so they were more of a ‚Äúunit.‚Äù This honestly really hurt me, but whatever, at least this year I can share some of my family‚Äôs traditions right? Wrong. Her mom was again holding all these expectations against her, guilting her, to the point where my gf wasn‚Äôt even giving me solid answers on if she‚Äôd even be able to see my family in time. But more importantly, it didn‚Äôt seem like she was putting much effort or fighting to go see me or my family. It seemed she was just folding to whatever mom wanted again. Going into Christmas, I was not even sure if my family would get to see her. I cried on Christmas Eve. The morning of Christmas, she texted me around 9 saying she could come over for a bit. We stayed for about an hour and a half, and then we were at her parents‚Äô place the rest of the night.

After such negative experiences, this year I didn‚Äôt even want to bring up Christmas. Not a great communication strategy, but I am very familiar with how her mom is and how she responds to her that I already considered it a losing battle. But eventually we did have to talk about it, and it‚Äôs the same as before. This year I‚Äôm actually invited to their traditions because I have expressed my intent to marry her. But there‚Äôs still no consideration from her mother to me or my family. The hilarious thing is that our parents live 5mins away from each other, just across the street. It should be EASIER for us to split time amongst our family, but no.

My girlfriend and I have been arguing for the past week about this Christmas that I have just given up on the holiday. I don‚Äôt care anymore. My family is more chill so I‚Äôve just resolved to do whatever she and her mom want every Christmas and I will just handle the woes and annoyances of my family. They‚Äôll eventually get over it. I just can‚Äôt be assed to get this stressed over a single day anymore. Obviously this isn‚Äôt exactly what she wants either, and tries telling me that we can do x, y, or z plan to split the time better and that ‚Äúher mom will just have to be okay with that‚Äù to which I essentially called her bluff. I told her I have never seen her stand against her mom when it comes to holidays and traditions, so as a partner, I feel 0 confidence in her actually standing with me against her mom and fighting this battle together. Especially this year, it feels too late to rock the boat like this, so she‚Äôs trying to promise next year will be different, especially since we‚Äôll be engaged and be traveling as a single unit. I said I‚Äôd believe it when it happens, which I admit was super douchey of me and apologized for the snarkiness. But my feelings on the whole issue still remain.

I still want to marry her, a lifetime of happiness with her still sounds worth just one month every year of just being miserable. So I don‚Äôt plan to leave before anyone suggests it. I just wanted to lament the fact that I hate Christmas now and it‚Äôs solely my gf‚Äôs mom‚Äôs fault.",My gf‚Äôs mom has made me hate Christmas.,18li46i,1702929966.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18li46i/my_gfs_mom_has_made_me_hate_christmas/,
"I (24f) just need to let off steam and vent about this. I'm so angry. It's highly unlikely the person this is about will see this, but some things will be changed. The situation genuinely boggles my mind as I know no one who has gone through something like this. My son's (19m, m) grandfather(?m) has been watching a child of a friend of his almost daily for several years now. They're elementary school aged and live right across the street, but is almost always with him. I can COMPLETELY appreciate the bond they have. I have no issue with that and never have. They're a lovely child and my son actually loves playing with them. Here's where I have my issue. 

I can count on my hands the amount of time's he's taken my son. In the beginning when he was a little baby, he wanted him all the time. At this time, he's unemployed with no car, but would ask to take him for the night (with the other child in tow) for us and would come by and take him for me if I needed a break (which I rarely asked for, I hate asking for help). I have two people I can ask, him and the other being a family member of mine, but they work a 9-5 and have their weekends preplaned most of the time. These days, I feel he's been using the child as an excuse not to take my son. He's still unemployed but now has a car, so every so often will visit on his own time, so he does see him. As I mentioned, I hate asking for help from anyone, but as a new mom, there are times where a one or two hour break; even an hour and a half break is desperately needed. I think I may have asked once or twice a month, the length between days being long before we were told to give him a few days notice before asking him to take our boy. Okay, that kind of defeats the 'I'll be there when needed' purpose, but it's reasonable if we ever wanted a date or a night for ourselves. Every time afterward, we would give him the few days notice. We either never got an answer back or were told he had to watch the other child coincidentally the night we asked. Today hit a point where I'm 90% convinced he's lost interest with his grandson and my heart is breaking over it. It sounds dramatic, but combined with the last several times we asked and have gotten the same answer, what other conclusion do I have to come to? 

We have a get-together planned with a couple of friends coming up within the next few days and asked well in advance (Saturday) if he'd be willing to take him for the night, and we'd be there in the morning to grab him. We didn't get an answer, so we waited a bit before my husband (27m) went to his house today to grab something before work. He asked him in person and was told he already has a commitment to the other kid that day from after school to like 9:00. Excuse me? Let me get this straight, we can't ask you the day of, you won't respond to us if we ask DAYS in advance and when asked in person, we get the same answer? ""He won't sleep woth them around,"" sir. My father took him a few weekends before with my little siblings there as well, my kid didn't sleep until 10:00 and slept the whole fucking night. Just say you don't want to take him. It burns me up inside. I don't even know if the feeling is reasonable, but it weighs heavy on me.",My son's grandfather refuses to take him (and I'm livid for it),18li32d,1702929888.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18li32d/my_sons_grandfather_refuses_to_take_him_and_im/,

  I got married at 19 had a daughter at 20 became a widow via suicide at 23. Had a son with someone I didn‚Äôt like cuz I thought I deserved it at 25. Gave my dad my daughter after leaving my son behind because the gun convinced me and didn‚Äôt see my son at 18 months until he was 3. Had another son at 27 and when he was 4 I married his dad.

"I almost don't care if no one sees this post because I don't have anything deep and dire to retell, but I ended up barely sleeping last night and I'm full of regret that I hope to channel into this post. I'd write this in my diary, but right now my typing hands are steadier than my pen hands.

So some background. I've been experimenting with different ADHD medications in order to see which is the right one for me. I took two weeks of Vyvanse which was some of the most productive days I've had in years, but it came with the downside of heightened anxiety and chest pain. Now I'm trying Welbutrin, which isn't a proper ADHD med but it reportedly has the off-label effect of a mellower stimulant - it also helps that I've got some sort of depression, which should be targeted by Wellbutrin. However, aside from a steadier mood, it hasn't done much at all for me. I feel more restless in the evenings, but I'm a chronic WoW player so I'd discounted that concern as just too much gamer energy at the end of my nights. However, I started taking an increased dose of Wellbutrin and I couldn't fall asleep until 8 in the morning, waking up at 10 in a sweat. Again, I have doubts still that this is directly a cause of the meds, partially because of what else kept me up.

As mentioned, I play a lot of WoW, specifically WoW Classic and its current Season of Discovery. It's been great fun playing an old favorite with new twists, and I've particularly enjoyed the experience because I decided to make a character on an RP realm (RP is short for roleplay, so in these servers people act out in chats what they were doing). I figured I would soon run out of things to do in the game and I've always been interested in TTRPGs, so I figured I might as well drop the TT and the G and see what pure RP is like in a game. Turns out, it's actually pretty cool! I've met several memorable characters out in the world and joined a dedicated RP guild, but there was one particular person that stood out to me: we'll call them Cody. 

Cody reached out to me after a raid a few days ago and asked what I was up to. I told them that I was going on a bit of a long adventure to craft an epic piece of gear. Cody asked if they could join me and I was delighted to have them along. My first real RP adventure! I'd asked what kind of RP they had been up to, and they told me it had been mostly ERP - erotic roleplay. I mentioned that I was curious about it, but internally I was worried because the WoW ERP community is something of a punching bag for those outside the community. Outwardly, I said that I wouldn't mind ERP but only if it comes up naturally. Cody was amenable to that, and so we went off on our quest. As soon as we began, though, I quickly realized that their character was a bit of floozy while mine was something of an elderly knight. Very strange character interactions with Cody's character being outwardly flirtatious with mine, but it kind of worked in a sort of balance between airhead and grounded. Once the quest was done, we parted ways in game but later continued our RP in Discord. Nothing of note, just sharing backstories around a campfire.

Now, here's how all of the above comes together. Last night, I was especially restless and couldn't fall asleep for about 40 minutes, so I resolved to log back into WoW and do stuff until I get exhausted. Not 30 seconds after I log in, Cody sends me a message of what I'm up to. I told them I was just trying to kill time before my brain shuts off, and they were in the same boat. We chatted for a bit, sending each other our character images - Cody was a sultry human rogue and I was a grandma knight who just turned 60 - and then did our own things. It's now 2 AM and I'm not more tired than I was before, but I didn't want to keep playing WoW. And also... I *was* curious about that ERP Cody mentioned. So I hit them up and asked if they were to do ERP, what did kinks they would like to explore.

Breeding, impregnation, incest, free use, girlcock.

...so most of these are my own kinks (free use can get weird), so I was already very excited. It also helped that as we started our back and forth, Cody would send me out-of-character messages encouraging me to go further and further with pushing the kinks. I'll spare you the finer details, but essentially Cody's rogue reminded my knight of her daughter, which spurred the rogue to tease the night about imagining fucking her own daughter, afterwards the knight ruthlessly impregnated the other woman. There was some follow-up that happened later in the morning, but we took a break around 7 to rest a bit.

At the end of all this, I was dazed. Folks, sex is good and all and I've done my fair share of sexting, but I've never felt so exhilarated before in my life before. I got to act out all my sexual fantasies with someone who was eager to share them with me. On the other hand, I completely fucked up my sleep last night and feel miserable on a physical level. Mentally and emotionally, I also felt... dirty. Cody was a very accommodating RP partner and they were interested in having a long-term RP partner themselves, but they were firm on making sure I don't form any attachments to them out of character. That's all well and good and healthy for this kind of interaction, I kind of felt like I just came away with having mind-blowing sex with a hooker; for Cody, this was simply a very productive roleplay session, but I felt more than that. Some people are very good at having casual sex for the fun of it and them moving on, but I've always been bad about it; I can tell that the more I go down this rabbit hole, the more likely I am to feel that attachment and that will ruin whatever RP relations we might have.

Maybe I'm just horny and lonely (that's not a maybe, I AM both those things) and just need to put myself out there more, or maybe I need to stop taking this medication and try something else. I dunno.

Early on I had a disagreement with a colleague that happened to be one of my bosses best friends- and it seems to me that it put me on her black list.

The interesting job opportunities are few and far between- and every time I apply for a new job, I just ALMOST get it.

"What a line to pull the rug right out from under my feet. There are some truths you just can‚Äôt run from anymore. I feel like life keeps crashing down around me and I can never keep up.

"I started to have feelings for him at 16. He was the first boy that I ever liked. I think he liked me before, but he was shy and I didn't notice because he didn't say it directly. I was obsessed with him: I was always thinking about him, always waiting for his texts or sending him texts, always excited when we would have the same activities in high school, and I enjoyed spending time with him in general. He then told me he had a crush on a girl I hated because of a fight. I was very heartbroken, but I was too afraid to tell him my feelings, so I tried helping him. After a year of his pursuit, they got together. It hurt me a lot seeing them.  
We both went to the same university after, but I still had feelings for him, even though he had a girlfriend. We would occasionally hang out: I was always enjoying his company and I was hoping that they would break up. But every time he was complaining about her, I did not want to be the reason for their break up, so I just tried to help him and understand her perspective. He did break up with her once, but then got back together because he was worried that no other girl would like him (even though I did). We started drifting away in the last year of university, and he did not want to hang out with me before leaving the city. I asked him 3 times to hang out (in 3 months, so not last minute). Now he moved from this city to another one, where she is studying. 

Now, there are some things I remember that made me question if he liked me. He saw me once getting ready to go out, someone asked if I had a date, and he said ""I don't want to know..."" in a very low voice. We stayed at the same dorms, so occasionally when I had to give him something, he would open the door and always look at my body. When he was with his girlfriend and saw me in my prom dress, he said ""Wow, you look beautiful"" (and he was next to his girlfriend). We were at a pizza place and a waiter was his old friend, and he introduced me as his girlfriend, and I got really quiet because it came from nowhere, but then he said he was joking. In high school, he said something about friends with benefits with me, but that never happened.

Unfortunately, this is not enough, so I do not know if he ever wanted to be in a relationship with me while he was together with her. We were such a good match, we had the same goals, and the same vibe, and some people thought we were together because of our chemistry. Now I feel like I lost my soulmate and it is all my fault because I did not dare to say anything. I also did not want to be the second option, I hated the thought of him trying with her first, then with me, instead of choosing me the first time.   
The worst part is, I don't know if something will ever help me. If I get the confirmation that he liked me this whole time, then why didn't he say anything? Why didn't he try to flirt with me and kiss me and be direct just like he was with her? If he never liked me, why did he say all that stuff from above? If he still likes me, why is he with her, why did he move? Even if he breaks up with her, I am the second option, and she will always be his first love.

Now every time a boy shows interest in me, I can't reciprocate at all, because it is not him. I do not know what to do. I am going to the gym and the psychologist (to help me with this), I have a job, I volunteer and I am getting my superior studies...but I still cry every night, thinking of the one that got away.

"I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this (many on Tik Tok when I‚Äôve seek videos about it) but my reason as to why I miss it is because I thrived being away from my family. 

When lockdown started and the only thing I had to care about was to stay healthy and keep my job. That did something to my brain. I lived alone in the city and about an hour away from family. Within the first few months, I started losing weight, cooking more, walking everyday, reading more, and finding things I liked doing. I had no family obligations or the sense that I was ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù if I wasn‚Äôt going out or doing something that wasn‚Äôt just me being home. 

The biggest effect was my lack of time with my family. This is going to sound so damn privileged and I truly hate myself for saying this but being away from my family was the greatest thing that happened to me. I am lucky none of them got very sick during that time as we all made it out fine but lordy, being away from family drama, family obligations, and just being with them was eye opening. 

All my insecurities washed away. I felt no rush to crash diet anymore and then hate myself when it came to a family event/vacation and I couldn‚Äôt lose the weight I wanted. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about being left out or ignored during family engagements because there were none.  Didn‚Äôt have to find topics they wanted to talk about because if I wanted to talk about any of my interests (or anything outside their interests) they would never talk to me.

I was happy, healthy, and thriving. But, almost like clockwork, the lockdown was lifted and we went right back to our normal lives (almost). Since mid 2022, I‚Äôve gone into a deep depression, I have severe social anxiety, and I went back to my old ways. Gained weight, going sick multiple times, barely go outside, and I always feel so angry or sad. 

I am trying so fucking hard to get back to my lockdown self but it‚Äôs been so, so hard. I‚Äôve been going to therapy but it‚Äôs barely been doing anything for me.

It could be a lot of other reasons why I feel this way, not just about my family, but my God, I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. I think I need to move very far away, away enough where I can‚Äôt just go home for a weekend, but not too far where I can‚Äôt go home for the holidays. Just‚Ä¶ I need to get away.

Our dad is living on his own in the middle of nowhere, and in recent years he has taken to coming over for extended visits and overstays his welcome. My sister has a six bedroom house and I have a studio apartment. So realistically I can‚Äôt have him at my place for more than a couple of nights. He doesn‚Äôt contribute anything financially, and he has a gambling problem.

This year, I was planning it out with him to go down south to Mexico and have his dental work done there and he was interested in the idea of exploring someplace there for a couple of months. This way it would give him something to do in the winter months and somewhere to stay, and somewhere to stay that is not so expensive. my sister intervened and told him that he could stay at her place and she did not like the idea of him going to Mexico. So she took him in and now she is saying that I let her down and she is overwhelmed and doesn‚Äôt have any space to herself. Now her and her husband are angry with me because I cannot share my studio apartment with my partner and my father and apparently I haven‚Äôt been supporting them enough.

Since day one after my graduation we were concerned about my situation, I graduate after four years of studying abroad, far away from home, family and friends, lived good and bad days there away and when I say bad days I really mean BAD: the most down moments of my life, loneliness, Covid lockdown, plus the idea that my family can pass through difficult times and try to hide it from me is so disturbing (They do this to keep me focused on my studies and not make me worried).

For the past four months me and both my paren have a one mission: Finding a way to get my medical license ( I graduated from medical school abroad and I need two years of training before being qualified for licensing exam), my situation is further complicated because most people went back to their home countries to get their portfolios ready like getting training internships exams etc‚Ä¶. But in my case I live here as a foreigner and Ihold a passport for a country that recognizes me as a second class citizen.

We‚Äôve been looking during the past four months for a place that can offer me a training program, or a job with no license which can be possible is few cases, but we found nothing.
Stress is growing up between us, my father is nervous person and this situation push him to be much much more anxious and nervous.
I spend every single day looking online, calling people, visiting healthcare clinics way far away from our home just to find a vacancy for a trainee, Nothing.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Today, My father was mad (as usual), he start ranting, talking sh*t about me and how im lazy ass grown man sitting in his home for four months after sucking money from his pocket four years (nothing new here) and all my effort in less than minimum to be enough, and yeah he gave me a warn that I must leave home and find a country where I can work and study at the same time (yes I need to leave the country as well) maybe he was not 100% serious but I left with no emotions except ONE THING: I MUST LEAVE ASAP.

I close the door of my room, but I can hear his screams about how im that rude to the level, I start texting my friends abroad, each one of them in a different country, asking about jobs and a possible life out there, tears in my eyes, suddenly I start crying loudly but surprised at the same time why this is happening, I start paniking, crying hysterically for the first time with ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY ITS HAPPENING .

I was out of control, like im someone else, I was unstable psychologically, this is the first time I been through something like this, trust me it was nothing about today‚Äôs event but about all what I been through and the pressure from all around me.

All my family enter the room seeing me in this miserable way, my dad immediately start blaming me about why I took everything so seriously, he also start talking trashy again about how our real emotions appear without our control and he now know the truth about how we look at him with no love or respect.

All I remember from my words during these moments was that I promise him to leave home asap cuz I cause real headaches and pain for them since day one of my graduation.

I don‚Äôt know why, it doesn‚Äôt really exclusively happen to my friends, but anybody who engages in things I consider ‚Äúbad‚Äù.

I‚Äôll try to describe it, but it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a heavy weight on my chest and my throat feels tight, I get a really heavy feeling of fatigue. I think it‚Äôs something like disgust but really gutteral and to the core, it really unsettles me because it affects my thoughts as well. I feel more inclined towards behaviors I don‚Äôt really ever do, such as walking away without knowing where I‚Äôm going. 

It‚Äôs not like the people are doing anything wrong either, but it usually surrounds even mentioning sex or drugs of some sort. Fight videos also make me feel the same way. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a natural aversion to these things, I‚Äôve never been sa‚Äôd before, I‚Äôve been around people on drugs but I never thought about it when I was a kid.

It‚Äôs only beginning to bother me because it‚Äôs happening more frequently, and everything I do feels affected by it. I can‚Äôt enjoy hobbies without having that lethargic feeling, usually if I distract myself enough by talking to my mom or someone it goes away, but it keeps coming back. It‚Äôs also making me not really like my friends that much anymore, they‚Äôre nice people otherwise, but once they get on the topic of talking about how hot someone is I can‚Äôt help but want to cry and rip my esophagus out. If this is in any relation, I‚Äôve always been disinterested in relationships and never had a crush before.

 I hope it goes away soon, I feel sad when it‚Äôs around. I tried to look up my problem to see if anyone else could relate but I haven‚Äôt found anything exact, I just wanted to know if anyone feels this really heavy guilt-disgust too.

side note: I‚Äôm also concerned about it because these things really bother me more than other people, and I obsess on them as well even if it makes me feel like vomiting, and sometimes I cry. After that fact though I‚Äôve recently began to feel more dull and distant, and when I‚Äôm driving I can‚Äôt really pay attention without my mind immediately wandering away. I don‚Äôt mean to sound narcissistic if I come off that way, and I wish I didn‚Äôt feel so bad about something harmless.",disgusted with a lot of things and it makes me feel suicidal,18lg73i,1702925293.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18lg73i/disgusted_with_a_lot_of_things_and_it_makes_me/,
"i dont use reddit much and i figure no one will see this but this is eating at me.

i (21f) liked this guy (23m) when i was 16. no one knew and nothing happened between us. during the pandemic almost 2 years later, we reconnected on instagram. we got really close and i started liking him again. i thought he liked me back. we started flirting a little after months, and to make a long story short we hung out when i went to visit the college i currently attend, he lived in the area. we were friendly and had fun all day, and at the end of the night he was dropping me off at my hotel where my parents were and he wanted to hug me goodbye. while he hugged me he lifted my chin and kissed me. this happened about 2 years ago but i remember it so clearly. i thought this meant he liked me. he ended up taking my virginity when i was 19, i thought this meant he liked me. the next week he stood me up and ended whatever it was we were doing.

fast forward months later he contacted me again, trying to reconnect. i eventually caved and it became a cycle. we talk, go out, hook up, and then later he tells me he's not ""ready"" for a relationship with me. over and over again. before you say it, i know he's been using me. i've always kinda figured deep down. he was an attractive guy and a player, and i've never been much of a looker.

anyway, this cycle goes on for a year to a point where i finally end things with him, the day after his birthday. i couldnt take the hot and cold, the lies, stringing me along for sex. i block him on everything. i thought i was free, i was happy. it was a great year without him. i was so happy. and then he came back.

this year back in june he adds me on snap again, under a different account. (how he remembered my username idk) i finally caved bc i was so curious about what this man could possibly even want from me at this point. we talked and he gets flirty again. after a while i unblock him on ig, we follow each other and i see one pic where it looks like he has a gf. he tries to invite himself over for sex. i ask him about the pic, he claims they're not together/on a break. im skeptical, but i believe him (i know people who still have their exes posted even tho its been a while). we end up seeing each other after over a year of no contact. he makes a move to kiss me, i cave. we ended up hooking up. i realize that my judgment was clouded and told him i won't see him in person if he has someone, serious or not or on a break or together. it's not what he wants to hear but he accepts. a month later he says they've broken up, and that the picture is still up bc he still hasnt gotten his stuff back. i was stupid and believed him. we see each other and hook up again.

i tried multiple times to block him, to tell him to stop contacting me. but he kept on finding new ways to contact me (new snap, diff insta). why i responded idk. we talk. a few weeks later i told myself to stop being delusional, and i told his gf. i've never felt worse in my life. i never wanted to hurt someone like that. it is my greatest shame. i send her screenshots and tell her everything. i blocked him immediately. i didn't want him to yell at me. he contacts me again weeks later, saying they broke up fr and sent screenshots of their break up. we talk some more.

we hook up in his car one night, and while we were taking a break i was drinking water and he was on his phone. he was texting his ex. i wanted to run out of the car, but i didn't want to be left alone in an unfamiliar area in the dark. he could tell i closed up, put my clothes back on and sat as far away as i could. he tried talking to me about it, saying they were just friends. then he said he likes me, and he scared he likes me more than he's admitting to himself. i don't believe him. he paused, i didn't respond, then he kept talking.

we kept talking and seeing each other for a few months until now (december), i ended things (again). i wasn't mean, i tried to be as nice as possible. i told him not to contact me. i took him off everything as we were saying our goodbyes. he told me to reach out whenever, but i was never the one to come back and contact him. it was always him finding me. in a moment of weakness, i told him in the farrrrrr future if he can get it together and wants something serious i might listen. and then it was over. i deleted everything. upon reflection a day later, i realized i never want to hear from him again and im scared if he does contact me again.

i can never forgive myself for what ive done. it kills me everyday. i've never been pretty enough, skinny enough, or smart enough for him. he'd date every girl in the world before settling for me. i was always just something to fuck for him, never a person. he would tell me that i am too intense and too much. i always knew i would be alone, never going to love someone nor someone love me. and now i know i don't deserved to be loved. not after this. not after what i've done. i never wanted go through this. to never hurt a stranger so deeply.

i wish i never met him.

"Tbh I don‚Äôt really know anymore.

I‚Äôve been in 2 long relationships and now I‚Äôm casually dating with intentions of getting into a relationship.. the first relationship was super toxic and the second was a healthy one but I cut it off after 3 years bc I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him and not all my emotional needs were being met either. I wouldn‚Äôt say either of those relationships portrayed REAL love. 

Now the problem with the casual dating is I‚Äôm not sure if I feel anything with these dates..

Yeah sure he‚Äôs attractive, the sex is great, and if I list out the qualities I‚Äôd like to find in someone, he has them.

I‚Äôm not crazy right, shouldn‚Äôt love feel powerful? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve found my person

There‚Äôs nothing that feels special about these people I‚Äôm casually dating, like a crush.. isn‚Äôt that what love is supposed to feel like? or do the feelings develop with time?

Guess I‚Äôm just asking for those who have actually been in love.. is it really a feeling of ‚Äúno doubt.. if you know you know?‚Äù &amp; was that feeling immediate?

"I‚Äôve been friends with John (fake names) for six years, going on seven years.

It‚Äôs been manageable but it‚Äôs escalated within the past year. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm not longer welcome at their house by name, and if exceptions are made, she‚Äôll make endless comments and interruptions to remind me that I‚Äôm not welcome in *her* home, that there are other things coming up, that ‚Äúsorry, I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to be here this long‚Äù, all of which is unprompted because I don‚Äôt even talk to her other than a polite hello to try and avoid pissing her off.

"he always has something so say about something i‚Äôm excited about, like if I‚Äôm excited for a plan with my friends he will often say ‚Äúi dont like socialising‚Äù‚Äúthis activity you‚Äôre doing is stupid‚Äù. LIKE GOD CAN YOU JUST LISTEN AND LET ME BE EXCITED. 

Also sometimes he‚Äôll talk about other women and say shit like ‚Äúoh shes a baddie‚Äù and then repeat ‚Äúare you angry?‚Äù ‚Äúoh you are so angry‚Äù. It‚Äôs like he wants me to angry and gets a kick out of it, but then can act like i‚Äôm being irrational and make fun of me later for it. Like what kind of girl wants to hear their boyfriend talk about how much of a baddie a video game character or another woman is - besides he was the one who told me to be possessive and jealous bcus he thinks its attractive??? 

Doesn‚Äôt help when he barely seems interested in me? He doesn‚Äôt seem to care enough to ask how my day was, doesn‚Äôt ask to see me despite us being long distance, doesn‚Äôt want to sext or have esex with me cus he‚Äôd rather get off to other women on twitter. 

Also says he wouldnt have sex with me or kiss me or hug me when we meet - which is crazy considering i met him on a nsfw community and i‚Äôm now sexually frustrated because i see his dck once in a bluemoon. It‚Äôs actually crazy cus it‚Äôs unbelievably so easy to get attention from other men, but then when its actually someone I want? its the most difficult task in the world. At this point he could totally degrade me and treat me like shit and i‚Äôd be grateful he‚Äôs even acknowledging me

Also sometimes he‚Äôll just disappear for the whole day because hes gaming, and then when we are on call he continues gaming. Like ur girlfriend is literally here and you can‚Äôt spare a few minutes of the day to have a proper conversation with her???  I basically have to remind him to check and to text me or else I just won‚Äôt hear from him.

"Ever since I was little I can remember I‚Äôve been a daddy‚Äôs girl. But my dad was never in the picture, he was in and out of jail and was a substance abuser, he was also schizophrenic and never took medication. I was born in The Netherlands. when I was around 6/7 I remembered I loved and adored him because I didn‚Äôt know anything about those negative things. Ever since I can remember my mom has come to me for advice and everything. Anything that she doesn‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt do she asks me. I do everything for her, everything. Clean, look after my 5 year old brother, read her mail, (she‚Äôs an immigrant so she does know the language but not as good as me and my older brother do). I do everything, when I was 16 we fought everyday, so many times did I want to run away from home and never come back because of how they treated me. I hated my life and myself, I was so terribly depressed but still did very well in school. I still do. Keep in mind this has been happening for over 10 years. Constant verbal abuse. Constant yelling, constant remarks, constantly telling me I should be happy with a mom like her, constantly telling me I‚Äôm good for nothing, and how I am so ungrateful.

 My brother is 26, I am 20F. My brother doesn‚Äôt do anything. He goes to work, comes home, showers and goes outside. This is all he does. Nobody complains to him nothing. She talks behind his back about how much of a dead weight he is and how he doesn‚Äôt do anything, but in his face she loves him to death and still even changes his sheets. This man is 25.
She adores him above me at all times but she doesn‚Äôt want to admit it. She babies him. But never talks nicely to me. Whenever she hugs me or gives me a kiss I just get so frozen because I‚Äôm not used to her being so kind to me all of a sudden. I hear my friends talk on the phone with their moms and I‚Äôm just so extremely jealous. Theyre always zo nice to each other, I know that it could be fake because I am there but even if I‚Äôm not there they don‚Äôt lash out extremely. 
Again today, she just started lashing out on me because I didn‚Äôt wear a jacket to go to the car and drop her off somewhere. The car is warm, it was just 5 minutes I didn‚Äôt see the need. I was coughing a little true but it was only for 15 min total. She started yelling and telling me that (I pray to god that you become ill and then we will see what I do with you. I will definitely not be taking care of you.) and just constantly making Snarty comments. 

She began yelling about something else again and I was just silent. After a while I just asked her like why can‚Äôt she ever just talk to me normally, why must she always just start yelling. Of course she then lashed out and began the narcissist route and started playing the victim because ‚Äúwhen I am talking so calmly it just pisses her off more‚Äù. I‚Äôm just crying thinking about it, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay calm and talk normally and not yell back at you, what do you mean it just angers you more? I then told her I help her the most with everything I do everything in the house I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs been helping her, so why is she always being so hard on me? Why can‚Äôt she ever just talk to me normally? She then proceeded to say I‚Äôm sounding like my two friends because I am not yelling back? I asked her ‚Äú do I not have my own personality?‚Äù She then didn‚Äôt know what to say. I told her that I‚Äôd move and never talk to her again so she doesn‚Äôt have to be so mean to me all the time.

I yelled back at her. She then laughed and repeated the same thing I said to her. ‚ÄúWhy are you yelling why can‚Äôt you talk normally?‚Äù This upset me so much.

"My ex dumped me a few months ago on our one-year anniversary. I knew it was time, but I was so busy and stressed that I didn't want to bring it up until he did. He was pretty mean, and while I felt bad about myself after, I didn't feel bad about the breakup. I got back on bumble and rebounded hard, looking for guys who were actually interested in me. I went on lots of dates with cool guys but wasn't feeling it. I could feel myself rebounding more and more and almost deleted the app.

Then, I met this one guy. The rebound feeling immediately stopped. I knew when we met that I wanted to date him. I even wanted to kiss him on the first date, which I'd never felt before. I was so attracted to him in ways I've never been attracted to someone before. He was very attracted to me too, and the first month was great with lots of dates and long phone calls.

But, he's really struggling with his mental health. When I met him, he was beginning a downward spiral. He became more open about it, and I noticed him getting more and more distant and down. Still, I didn't know the extent of what he was going through. The last 2 weeks, I felt like a hassle for him. I couldn't tell if he was actually enjoying being around me, and I wasn't going to fight for it. I told him this one night. I can really struggle putting my thoughts into words, so I don't know exactly how I came across. We talked for a little, but he had to run and said we'd talk more the next day.

Two days later, I hadn't heard from him and was worried our talk had pushed him further down. I texted asking if he was okay, and he said he just needed more time to process it and think. By three days, I told him I needed to know or I needed to move on. This didn't get him going at all, and he said he *might* have some time to talk.

I was pissed. I'm so used to giving guys the benefit of the doubt and it's always come back to bite me in the butt. I'll assume they have good intentions and that I can trust them and they walk all over me. I couldn't let it happen again. I figured this guy was trying to ghost me and/or seeing another girl, even after long chats about how shitty it feels to be ghosted and the fact we'd become exclusive. I left him a blunt, albeit harsh, message. I said I wouldn't wait for him to get around to talking to me, how he spoke of monogamy and dating one girl at a time when he was putting me so far on the back burner. I said he needed to get his stuff sorted before we kept dating.

Well, in trying to keep myself from getting hurt, I ended up doing some hurting. Turns out, he is way deeper in the trenches than I knew. He wasn't trying to ghost me, he wasn't dating anyone else, he was just incredibly burnt out and depressed. Honestly, I don't really believe in the ""right person wrong time"" concept EXCEPT when mental health is involved. I've struggled with mine for 10 years and know where he's coming from. We talked about maybe keeping going while he gets through this, but he said he couldn't stop thinking that he can't give me right now what I deserve. So, I told him to call me when he's in a better place, but that I would also miss his company. He said we can still chat and hang out, that he'd welcome that, but I've yet to talk to him again (1 week) or see him  (2.5 weeks). 

There was so much I wanted to say to him but didn't because I couldn't formulate the sentences in the moment. I don't think I even explicitly mentioned why I was so harsh, that I thought he was ghosting/seeing someone else, and that I'd never stood up for myself before now.

I got back on bumble. I noticed he's deleted his account. But, I have no energy to go on more dates. I just miss being around him. I don't know if or when I'll contact him and vice versa. I don't know if he needs his space right now or if he's waiting for me to text him a meme or something. He mentioned having to will himself to talk to people but that he really needs the socialization. I just don't know if he wants it from me.

" I have depression and OCD and have been treating it with therapy and medication for 7 years. Recently, I started dating a man who also has OCD and is very intolerant to stress. We have been together for half a year, and just now our relationship has been exhibiting some ups and downs. I must confess I haven't been taking my medications properly. 

My gynecologist said I should take my OCD and depression medications at night, to prevent from intervening in the oral contraception I take in the afternoon. The problem is that I usually get home late, at 11 pm or so, and go straight to bed and fall asleep before taking my meds.

Our relationship has been following this pattern for a few months now, ever since I stopped taking my medications properly. Today, my mother picked an argument with me due to personal reasons, and I ended up getting super stressed and called my boyfriend. I was having an anxiety crisis, and was hoping he'd help me calm down. But all he ever says when this happens is ""try to find someone else to talk to"" or ""go do something to calm down"". 

After the fight with my mother, when I had already calmed down, I texted my boyfriend apologising for causing stress, and he said my problems wear him out.

 The owners didn‚Äôt even come to stop the dog or anything and I had to pull it off my pup and then they didn‚Äôt even check on my dog, they just kept walking. They didn‚Äôt even say sorry.

So I nicely said, ‚Äúif your dog is reactive you should definitely keep him on a leash‚Äú And then the girl turns and instantly gets defensive saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs an off leash dog trail you‚Äôre not gonna tell me what I can do with my dog, she sometimes doesn‚Äôt like other dogs.‚Äù So I said ‚ÄúOK but it‚Äôs a safety thing my dog could‚Äôve gotten hurt and that‚Äôs exactly why it should stay on a leash then.‚Äù Then her boyfriend turns and says ‚Äúget a real dog‚Äù


I was so dumbfounded that they thought they were in the right after witnessing their own dog grab a small puppy by the neck and smack it to the ground. Why are some people so irresponsible and incapable of empathy? :(

"I have no one to talk about this bc no one in my environment can relate but today my half sister called me after years of no contact. She told me that my biological father had died, he fell and landed on his head. At the end of his life he had no one, both of his brothers passed away two years ago and his sister lives in the US. My sister paid his funeral out of pity, otherwise he would have landed in a mass grave.

Idk much about my father. But I know that he liked to keep my mom as a captive if she misbehaved. He beat the hell out of her even in public and even raped her. My mom endured years of torture but always tried to keep me save. She would try to leave but he always came back and tried to reconcile. One time she found him laying on the floor in his office and, high on drugs. At that moment she knew she had to leave to protect me.

She packed her stuff and left with me, relying on the generosity of friends. My mom was alone and left home when she was 19. she comes from a poor, religious family and never intended to stay at the place she was born. But she didn‚Äôt get an adequate education either so she took every job she could get to keep me safe and well.

My father abducted me once for a month, she got so scarred that she gave me away to my grandparents and slept on a couch at friends house, trying to get enough money to get me back. I didn‚Äôt own my own bed until I was 8. I lived in a slum with my mom in South America, that was 1998/9.

My father was exiled out of the country also due to drug possession. I don‚Äôt remember him. I have one photo of him. I don‚Äôt hate him. I guess this whole situation gave me a good life lesson before I had the chance to come in contact with drugs and abusive men. I think my half sister endured the worst situation in comparison bc she had to deal with him when she was fully capable of comprehending her circumstances. 

He stayed an addict for decades. Tried to get clean but never made it. He lost his family and his life in the worst way one can imagine, alone and probably full of regrets. 

Gladly, I was adopted at 7 years by my dad and left the country for Europe. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm exactly a happy person. I carry a lot of trauma due to my past and was never able to form a healthy  relationship to a man or even have a real and healthy relationship. 

But I made the most of what I‚Äôve been handed in life. My mom is doing great, living a healthy life while raising a future doctor (me) and an engineer (my sister) all by herself.

 So I‚Äôd say, shout out to all the strong mothers out there who manage the unbearable purely out of love for their children.

When I first met this man off a dating app, he would take 2-3 days to reply to messages and when he did reply it was a long email style formally written message.

2 months in, he has recently lost his job and has more time, but now he‚Äôs texting me like all the time. Memes, recipes etc. I don‚Äôt know whether to take this as a good Sign that he‚Äôs now more interested in me or does it mean he‚Äôs just bored?

He also has to find a job quickly or his visa expires and he may even have to move away. We haven‚Äôt had any exclusivity conversation yet but I have waited for him to bring it up as I don‚Äôt want to put pressure on things but I am starting to worry. I don‚Äôt even know if we can label things at this time 

Also it was my birthday 2 weeks ago and he didn‚Äôt get me a card or gift so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a bad sign or if it‚Äôs ok as we‚Äôre not exclusive yet. Btw I don‚Äôt care about gifts, just more the intentions or if he actually cares

"Almost two months ago now, my ex-boyfriend, who I had been broken up with for months but was still living with due to financial reasons, tried to smother me with a pillow. Tensions had been high at home, and I had spent a good portion of the day at a friend's house and had plans to spend the night out at a bar with another friend.

When I got home, my ex was waiting by the door and wanted to talk. I wanted to nap. I left my room door open, as I always did so my cats could go in and out as they pleased. He followed me into my room and sat on the edge of the bed while I repeatedly asked him to leave until I finally just stopped talking.

And then he grabbed my shoulder and turned me onto my back. He held a pillow over my head for what felt like forever while I thrashed and clawed and screamed for help whenever I could get it loose enough. At one point I stopped moving altogether, but I felt myself about to pass out and all I could think was that if I was gone my cats would have nowhere to go. After a long struggle, I was able to somewhat escape. He choked me briefly, which was less memorable, but I eventually got away and after a brief altercation in the bathroom I was able to get my phone and called the cops.

My ex was in jail for several days. In the time following the attempted smothering, I learned some things. First, he had been going through my conversations and diary on my phone for months, unmatching people I was getting along with on dating apps, unfollowing people on social media, even changing a number in my phone to an out of service one. Second, smothering was his second choice. He told me he had been trying to work up the nerve to kill me for weeks. Post calling the cops, I found a baseball bat sitting by the chair he'd been waiting for me in. I also found a text to his boss that was sent that morning. He had told me that his shift for that day had been removed at the last minute and seemed genuinely stressed about it, but he had texted his boss that morning saying that he would have to miss work because ""something bad happened to (his) roommate.""

Despite all this, I let him come home a few days later. I didn't know what else to do. He came home, and a week after the first incident, he choked me again. I can't even say I was surprised. He was arrested again, and has been in jail since. He'll stay in jail for the next two months, then from what I hear, he'll be released.

My dad has helped me with part of my rent, thank goodness, and I got a raise at work. Things are settling down. I've gotten more comfortable being alone and have adjusted to a new routine. My cats are more demanding since they only have one person to cuddle them now, but for the most part they seem happy. Even though it seems like it's always kind of on my mind, for the most part I don't have any emotions attached to those events. It should be noted that there were instances over about two years of assault and threats, both before and after the breakup, so it all sort of seemed like the natural conclusion to things. It happened. Now it's not happening anymore. That's just the way life is.

But sometimes it really hits me. Sometimes I hear a sound that I think is the door opening and for a moment I can't move, even though I know he's in jail and I have his keys anyway. Sometimes I find myself staring at my pillow, the one in the laundry hamper because I only want one on the bed now. I woke up sick and laying on my back last month, tonsils swollen really badly, and my breath got caught when I tried to breathe. That sent me into a panic. I'll get flashes of his face, of the absolute hatred in his eyes. Or have the occasional nightmare that he's back and he's coming into my room. And sometimes, for absolutely no reason at all, I just feel everything. I remember exactly what it was like. I remember how desperate I was. I remember feeling like no matter what I did, I couldn't budge him. I remember getting my head in a position where I could breathe, and taking a moment to catch my breath before trying to beg him not to kill me. He repositioned the pillow. I remember going for his eyes with my nails. I remember being so scared for my cats. I remember thinking, all of it has lead to this moment. Everything I've ever done, all the hard work, all the pain I've lived through, everything has lead to this. I'm going to die. My cats are going to die. I'm going to become part of a domestic violence statistic and then I'm going to become nothing. And there's nothing I can do about it.

I'm terrified of feeling that. I don't know how to move on. If you've made it this far, please don't suggest therapy. I'm in therapy and have had trouble getting appointments with my therapist lately, but have no interest in seeing another as I tried other therapists for years and have only had any type of relief with this one. I just needed to vent I guess.

"So long story short I had one physically abusive ex... He would start hitting me, kicking me, slapping me and dragging me on the floor, violently choking me etc. if I did something that in his view was not ok... Once it was because I interrupted him, another time was because I laughed because we both fell together out of clumsiness... It didn't start immediately we were dating for 7-8 months and one day he slapped my face... I didn't believe what happened and it just never ended... It was completely unpredictable too... I escaped this relationship and never looked back.... A year ago I got a message on social media from a girl...I checked her profile because I didn't know her and apparently they have been together for the past 7-8 years... I didn't respond and I blocked her... But i saw his supportive comments on her posts and they have been together for years... He seems like a completely different person with her... I was feeling guilty for years that it was my fault he was acting like a psychopath with me, after that I realized he would take his rage on me in situations that another person wouldn't even get mad... I am now in a new relationship for the past three years and we haven't violently argued... We have raised our voics but never shouted at each other... He hasn't hit me or verbally abused me either...
So I'm confused... Why did my ex acted like a complete demon from hell with me but seemingly good with his new partner...
I am happy I'm not with him but why was I the one who had to go through this abuse...

"I've struggled all my life with a brain that won't cooperate. I find it hard to work, maintain relationships, have stable hobbies, and I have done my entire life. This, unfortunately, was part of the reason my last relationship fell apart, which was one I thought I'd be in for the rest of my life. I was recently finally diagnosed with ADHD, and in many ways my life has come to make a lot of sense. It doesn't make up for the losses in relationships or opportunities I've felt due to my condition and my behavior, but finally I've felt as though I have a path forward to cope in light of my diagnosis.

Last week I started on new medication for my condition and it's honestly been amazing. Work has been easy, my routine has improved and I was truly looking forward to life in the new year. 

That was until yesterday when I had a strange reaction to elevated stress and my heart rate, which had been higher than normal due to my medication, just wouldn't go down. I started to get a tight chest, and after an hour a little bit of discomfort too. At first I just put it down to work stress and went for a bit of a walk, that was until my breathing got shallow. I tried not to be too concerned but my symptoms didn't stop, and so I went to my friend for advice. Then the panic set in. I was feeling sick, stressed, short of breath, having cold sweats, and and a lingering pain in my chest. All classic symptoms of cardiac arrest.

I tried not to panic and got my friend to dial a non emergency number just in case it was a panicked reaction to my medication, and thankfully after talking to them and taking a bit of time to calm down my symptoms died down too. But to be honest I was terrified, although I didn't tell my friend that. I thought I could legitimately die given how I was feeling in that moment. I'm only 25 and I thought my life could be over. 

Even after things have settled down today I'm devistated. Not only do I now have to stop the medication that has been life changing for me so far, but now I just feel a deep sense of regret. The last year of my life has been hard emotionally, although I try not to show it, and all I can think about is how I'm so lonely. I almost died and besides a few friends, there was no one there to support me. I want to be loved, to love, to have children, buy a house. All my goals were nearly pointless and I'm left feeling empty.

I know this is just a bad day, and I'll surely have many more days ahead of me, but feeling like your life is over is a lot to process and I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore. I imagine this will have a profound impact on me moving forward for better or worse. 

Anyway, I just needed to get this out into the world without burdening my friends with the knowledge that I'm having a crisis, so thank you for reading. Please love those around you.",I thought I was going to die yesterday.,18nyffc,1703195678.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nyffc/i_thought_i_was_going_to_die_yesterday/,
"So hey reddit, i just want to get this off of my chest because why not? 

This is a long post, everything is messed up in it, thank you, if you read it.

I fell in love with a guy in 2016 and we are from different religions and it is a big deal in India so I avoided him with everything I had in me, fast forward to 2017-18 when I find out he has feelings for me too, but we didn‚Äôt act on it. We just stayed friends, he focused on his studies while I on the other hand, while focusing on my studies and job, went out with a couple other guys from 2017-2021 (what can I say, I‚Äôm just an attention seeker:)), he just had one casual thing during this whole time. Now in 2022 we were not in touch due to something he did but this year he reached out to me again on my birthday, apologised and because i will be leaving the country soon, I accepted it. We went on a date as friends and one thing led to another and we started dating, it became official and we were fine. 

He would call and text and flirt everyday at first, he was living in another city at that time while I was working from home, still in our hometown, slowly everyday became once in two days, then once in three days then straight to once a week. Okay I get it, he was busy, he hasn‚Äôt really been with anyone before so he doesn‚Äôt know how relationships are different from friendships, he used to send me a daily reminder of little things like ‚Äúyou are important‚Äù or ‚Äúi miss you‚Äù and write it as a daily reminder. I am head over heels in love with this guy because after years of just endless hours of not being able to tell someone how you really feel to simply being able to be your realest self in front of them, it was a blessing for me. I thanked God everyday. Even on the days he didn‚Äôt call or text or simply ignored the memes i sent. 

I went to see him where he lived, in September, we spent 3 days together and for the first time I slept with someone. He says it was his first time too, but idk I don‚Äôt think so. Anyway, i have never been physically involved with anyone atp, I just always thought it should be with someone I actually loved and he was this guy. Previously we had this conversation and I told him I was an emotional mess and for me being this close to someone is not easy and if i ever slept with someone, it would be because i see a future with them. He is 23 and i am 22f.

Anyway so I come back to our hometown and he is there, be mid September we have completely stopped talking. I got so mad, i burst out at him, send him angry texts and his reply was ‚Äúknowing all my things, you have said so much, I don‚Äôt want to say anything now‚Äù 

At this point him staying ‚Äúbusy‚Äù felt like excuses to me and i agree i said things which were out of line but i justified it to myself saying ‚Äúthis is just a delayed reaction to his actions‚Äù

But never in 7 years this guy, who is the closest friend to me, had gotten mad at me, so i thought i did something so wrong which cannot be fixed like this, i went to his place again in October, i called him he didn‚Äôt answer. I wanted to surprise him but he was working (he was a student in a Film school and shoots had odd timings and at this point we had been no contact for a week or two) so i just sent a video of the place he lived in and wrote ‚Äúsurprise, I guess‚Äù

I also sent the link to the hotel i was staying at. It was 1 in the night so i went to sleep, next morning he had still not seen the messages. Around 2pm I text him ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, i understand you are busy and your finals are going on but the least you could do is see the messages, anyway no need to come meet me or anything, I will just explore the city a little and leave‚Äù 

He started calling after this but I didn‚Äôt answer, so he called my best friend, started yelling at her, she called me told me to talk to him, I did, he didn‚Äôt yell at me but i could make it from his tone that he is mad and maybe cried a little?

He told me he was going to do some work and will come meet me the same day, he came to meet me around 9 at night, started to talk about how badly this is going and how it cannot be fixed but after sometime he just was not mad anymore? Maybe happy to see me? I got him flowers too lol! 

Anyway he left around 12 because he had to go for another project early the next morning and didn‚Äôt even come for 5-10 minutes while the rest of my stay, i was there for 4 days, I don‚Äôt blame him but it would have been nice if he could‚Äôve just showed up for 10 minutes at least once in the last 2 days, i was staying 3-4 minutes from his hostel.

Anyway I come back to my hometown, he is still not talking to me. I text him everyday, he just replies, and if I don‚Äôt text then i do not get a reply. 

Of course i got mad again and by this time i had called him multiple times, he told me he will call me but never did so we just stopped talking. From October till now, his course has ended and he is back in our hometown, he hasn‚Äôt called. We were no contact for a while until i called him an asshole in a random text, i have never used any ‚Äúbad‚Äù words with him since we know each other. He calls when I was asleep (i work nights so i sleep during the day with my phone on silent)

I text him, he tells me he wanted to meet but never followed up on that. Now again, I am the one reaching out and he is still ignoring me. 

From day 1 I told him to let me know when he‚Äôs done but well I guess it is too much to ask, just like when he asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I said a handwritten letter for which he wrote me a 5 line note and only sent it to me when i begged for a couple of months. Or just like when I asked him to just text me once a day? 

We were already on weekly calls before i went there for the first time, I just don‚Äôt know what I did wrong.

I told him I loved him, he never did. I literally wait and stare at my phone screen to see if he texts or calls. (Edit: I can‚Äôt stop being whatever i am being here)

I am sitting here bawling my eyes out for a guy who maybe never cared and i have been in love with him for years.

Thank you again for reading how pathetic I am.

"I barely have the motivation to do anything. All I ever do really is just lay in bed. Not sleeping though, because I'm even bad at that. Sometimes however, I do have the motivation to do something, and it seems no matter what it is, I suck at it. 
Like take videogames. I've always loved them, since I was a little kid. But recently I find no enjoyment in them. And I don't feel enjoyment because I'm just so bad. For example, I used to play rocket league every day for years (since it came out - 2020~) and i was pretty good, got to the 2nd highest rank and was winning most games, until i took a break to focus on studying. Fast forward 3, nearly 4 gears and I decided to play again, but I've played like 50 games and lost every single one. And it's like this for everything I do now. (I dropped everything and turned my schedule into: wake up, revise, school, eat, revise, sleep, repeat). 
I dropped everything to study and get good grades, but I'm scoring really low on tests and getting everything wrong, even though I'm trying my hardest. My parents and teachers tell me I need to put more effort in to my work and ""You're gifted, this should be easy for you."" But (not including writing this), all I've done for the past I don't know how long is study, eat, sleep and go to school. 
And it seems like every hobby is like this. Like another example: writing. I used to consistently write, but now this is my 7th attempt at writing this up because I don't know how to word things, or if I like how it sounds / flows.
Or music: I played guitar for 5 years and was pretty good, but now I struggle to play the stuff that I could do as a beginner.

"This year has been a very rough year for me financially and it‚Äôs been taking a toll on me mentally. My music business didn‚Äôt do nearly as well as it has in recent years and I‚Äôve been struggling to keep a job. This year I learned that part of the reason for that is because I have ADHD and Cyclothymia (baby bipolar) and that news put me in a deep depression. I struggle to provide my basic needs and find myself relying on weed to manage my stress. I don‚Äôt have any close friends and in fact just saw my best friends from college all link up for Homecoming without even asking me. I feel trapped and hopeless, searching for hope and positivity anywhere I can. So I put myself out there in an attempt to build new business and friend relationships. But, I‚Äôve been distant from my partner these past two months and even I can feel it. I‚Äôm obviously not doing it on purpose and it pains me to feel the divide grow. I shut down when I‚Äôm upset and have a toxic relationship with work. I don‚Äôt go outside. I barely get good sleep. When things are going slow or we don‚Äôt have what we need, I tend to go even harder, always in my phone or on the computer, apply for jobs and trying to make the next quick dollar. But, I‚Äôve been consistently making an effort to talk to my new friend almost everyday in fear of losing the connection. This has been where most of my attention has been, my phone. Today my partner expressed that it‚Äôs been hurting her feelings and she feels betrayed by me seemingly giving someone/something else more attention than her. She expressed this in an angry, combative tone that put me on the defense. Im just so overwhelmed now I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt speak to anyone anymore or try to work longer than 4 hours. It‚Äôs just so annoying too because I understand how she feels but I‚Äôm not sure if she took my feelings into account, reasons why I‚Äôve been so closed off and to myself. And I‚Äôm just tired of acting like I‚Äôm interested in physical/social interaction too. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm annoyed. I don‚Äôt want to do anything, I just look to other things like my phone to stimulate me enough that I don‚Äôt go crazy. Maybe she‚Äôs taking it personally. As much as I try to reassure her with compliments, physical touch and small gestures it‚Äôs not enough to show her she‚Äôs not at all the reason why I‚Äôm distant and that I long for the connection we used to have.

At this point it‚Äôs basically just me asking how she is, or what she‚Äôs been up to, only to receive a vague response. I know she‚Äôs been battling with depression for a while, and I know how difficult that can be, but I‚Äôm still upset about it, and miss her so much.

Why is he texting me a lot now

Does this mean his interest has grown in me?

When I first met this man off a dating app, he would take 2-3 days to reply to messages and when he did reply it was a long email style formally written message.

2 months in, he has recently lost his job and has more time, but now he‚Äôs texting me like all the time. Memes, recipes etc. I don‚Äôt know whether to take this as a good Sign that he‚Äôs now more interested in me or does it mean he‚Äôs just bored?

He also has to find a job quickly or his visa expires and he may even have to move away. We haven‚Äôt had any exclusivity conversation yet but I have waited for him to bring it up as I don‚Äôt want to put pressure on things but I am starting to worry.

"For context, I (22NB) have been with my boyfriend (M24) for nearly 4 years. I had a traumatic incident two years ago which led me to have less and less sex with my boyfriend. A couple months ago we had been on a streak of about two-three months without sex. He was very understanding about my trauma and boundaries and he always has been.

I had gotten high one night during this period throughout a couple months back. We had sex and I said yes; although I am unsure if I was coherent enough to consent when he was sober. Despite saying yes to sex the entire time I was high, I felt disgusted afterwards when I was sober.

I told him I did not want to do that again and he agreed.

Fast forward to the present and for further context, I had already been having doubts about our relationship. I won't go into detail but I'm not happy and yet, I'm trying to make things work. Either way, still haven't had sex with him at all. 

Last night I was high and I went to go to bed with my boyfriend. In bed we had cuddled which isn't my favorite thing to do but I'm trying. Anyways, he groped my behind and it made me uncomfortable so I took his hand off my ass and had told him to put his sleep apnea mask on and to go to bed.

He said ""Oh, I don't need that if I'm going to jerk off,"" and VERY AGGRESSIVELY put his hand down the back of my underwear. I did panic and grabbed his hand and told him 'no,' and he withdrew his hand immediately but told me, ""I was just joking. I know you don't like to *do it* when you're like this.""

And as of today I'm so sick to my stomach thinking about it. He knows I'm traumatized and that was really, super scary. He has never done anything to assault me before like this but I don't feel safe being high around him anymore. 

It really triggered some trauma for me now that I'm sober that is really hurting me. Idk what to think or do. I really wanted to try to preserve our relationship of four years but now I really want to break it off.

TLDR: I got high and boyfriend that I've been considering breaking up with pushed some sexual boundaries that were set bc of my traumas and now I'm going through a crisis about it.",I think this is the last straw with my boyfriend..,18ny7ov,1703195104.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ny7ov/i_think_this_is_the_last_straw_with_my_boyfriend/,

"A customer was rude at work, then a girl was rude on the bus. I‚Äôm not sure why the bus girl in particular was the catalyst for this train of thought, but she made me realize that there is actually more bad in this world than good. I always thought it was the other way around.

Out of 100 experiences with bad drivers, entitled customers, and insufferable coworkers, I probably have 2 or 3 actually nice experiences with kind people. Or maybe they were normal people that were in a good mood. I‚Äôve tried to be one of those people. I bring treats in to work for everyone. I let people pass me on the road. I give customers freebies sometimes because I enjoy seeing them happy. Yet, the negativity persists, always. People will still be rude, coworkers will still talk behind your back, drivers will continue to cut you off. No matter how much of a good person you try to be, the bad will outnumber you.

I‚Äôve really just lost faith in everyone. I figured if I truly convince myself of this, my life will be easier. People won‚Äôt let me down because it‚Äôll be what I expect them to do. When people don‚Äôt let me down, it‚Äôll be a pleasant surprise. I‚Äôm starting to wonder why doesn‚Äôt everyone just think this way. Maybe we would all be less stressed if we believe no one will meet our standards. If I had believed this long ago about my family, my friends, my relationships and every stranger I encounter, maybe my life would be easier and I‚Äôd harbour less resentment. Maybe I‚Äôd actually have faith in the kind people.

Ending this to say, if you‚Äôre on social media and you want to say something negative to someone, maybe think through if it‚Äôs really worth it. In person, even more so.

"I‚Äôm writing this here because, well, I‚Äôve nobody else I can talk to. 

  
I have nothing planned in my life beyond August 2024. And I‚Äôve sort of done it on purpose ‚Äì as I am fairly sure I‚Äôm not going to be around to see Christmas 2024.

  
I am tired of being alive, truth be told, and I have nothing left to live for. My kids have grown up, I‚Äôm divorced as I left my wife and came out as gay, although I miss her desperately, our relationship was not built on great foundations. She was unhappy in the relationship and she deserved better, and she‚Äôs much happier with her new man. And to me her happiness was the most important thing.  
 As such, I gave her most of the equity we had in our property as I felt guilty for putting her through it for 25 years, and I have ended up living on my own with the dog in a little rented cottage. I have very little to my name, and whilst I have a good job that pays well, I have no friends, and the dog howls the place down when I leave her on her own, which means I can‚Äôt go out and do anything that I used to love any more (I used to scuba dive, cycle, run, open water swim &amp; freedive ‚Äì I rarely do any of these any more unless I can book the dog into kennels months and months in advance or get my ex to look after her which is also a challenge). 

  
I work from home and spend my days working or comfort eating and have put on huge amounts of weight. My motivation to continue going is absolutely non-existent. 

  
I see my kids occasionally but they now have their own lives to live ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt interested in their 49 year old boring Dad. However they have requested a Christmas together this year and I‚Äôve rented a lovely house by the seaside for Christmas, however, my parents have also decided they wanted to come, so I‚Äôm paying ¬£1200 to rent a house where I get the shitty single bed.   
I struggle to make friends as I‚Äôm nerodivergent and can be a bit overpowering and annoying, so I purposely keep away from people but this also means I‚Äôm exceptionally lonely. I‚Äôm OK being on my own, but I do wish I had people I could share stuff with (but I‚Äôm scared to make contact because I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll piss them off, so I‚Äôm in catch 22). I‚Äôve tried to look for a boyfriend but with not being able to leave the dog it means I‚Äôm unable to go out on dates, and I‚Äôm stuck. If truth be told the dog is the only reason I haven‚Äôt done anything terminal yet ‚Äì but I plan to tidy everything up and then the dog will go spend a weekend with my ex wife (and then I will vanish).

  
 I was abused at junior school at the age of 8 by a teacher, and when my brother was born (I was 9) my parents couldn‚Äôt cope with 2 kids so I was sent away to a boarding school where I was bullied because I was different ‚Äì I automatically assume everyone hates me - and that's also the reason why I felt being gay was wrong and bad. (I fell in love with my ex wife even though sexually we weren't compatible). 

  
Why is ending my life seen as a bad thing if I‚Äôm desperately unhappy?

One of my ex work colleagues took their own life earlier in the year. Similarly to me he was on his own, no real social life, and the only reason someone raised the alarm was because he failed to turn up to work. I sort of understood why he did it.

"Ok so I would love genuine answers, please. I'm not an attractive girl (and I know this by guys and girls calling me fat and ugly for my entire life). But this post isn't about me trying to get compliments either. But since I can remember I was ugly to those around me in middle and high school but my family would call me pretty (which I feel is fake). However, while trying to make friends or trying to get into a relationship I would be made fun of or completely ignored if they were having a good day. But on the night before my 20th birthday, I decided it simply wasn't worth it and gave up on it all. But according to my mom that's the problem ‚ö†Ô∏è. And I don't understand why though. If people don't like you what's the point of trying to be their friend or date them? At some point, I got tired of hearing that I'll never be loved because of the way I looked, or that sisters and brother are better and prettier than me, or that people will only hang out with me if I do something for them, or that my don't date tall girls, or girls saying I'm not tall enough, or being asked out as a joke, etc. I just don't understand why my mom gets angry if I bring all of this up. I get it you were considered pretty in school (which is ironic because I've been confused as her multiple times before). Is she ashamed and doesn't want to admit it? Is she embarrassed? Does she know I'll never marry but doesn't want to tell me that?   I just don't get it.

"That‚Äôs the title. It all started in the pandemic of 2020 - the two didn‚Äôt even talk before then despite the fact that we were dating even then. I moved abroad before the pandemic but once it started my friend (21F) and my BF (22M) became friends as they lived near each other. At first I was happy that they were finally getting along. I know my friend, let‚Äôs call her Blair, didn‚Äôt like him at first as her only impressions of her were the times when I would complain about him but over the pandemic, he changed and so did her views on him. I didn‚Äôt feel jealous or worried despite being in a LDR so I didn‚Äôt think much of their friendship. It‚Äôs only now, a couple years later that I‚Äôve seen how close they‚Äôve become.

I visited back home a year ago and got to see how they interact; it‚Äôs crazy but it‚Äôs not even romantic or sexual tension, they‚Äôre just really REALLY great friends. They have inside jokes, lots of shared interests (they play a lot of the same games) and what hits hardest is that they had the same pandemic experience which they bond on a lot. It‚Äôs not even like they flirt or make raunchy jokes or have excessive body language, they just get along so well. When I noticed this, I asked my BF‚Äôs friends about what they thought of their friendship and they all said they were like siblings or twins. And that was sort of the perfect way to put it, they felt like family. I know my friend and I know my BF is nowhere near her type and she has had multiple partners over the span of the past few years (including the years where she became friends with my BF) so I‚Äôm not worried about her, I‚Äôm more worried about my BF. 

Now I‚Äôm back home to the same place so we all hang out more often but whenever we hang out as a group, I just get so surprised to see how much my boyfriend cares for her. He sees things that reminds him of her and goes ‚ÄòOh, Blair would like this‚Äô. When we watch a movie as a group, he checks the trigger warnings beforehand to make sure there‚Äôs nothing that will trigger Blair - that‚Äôs not even something I bother doing. He talks to her about emotional parts of his life because she‚Äôs a good listener - some stuff he won‚Äôt even tell me. When we go places, he‚Äôll mention how he came here with Blair and thought of me (as if that‚Äôs supposed to make me feel better). When he and Blair fall out, he gets so upset it affects his mood for the day. Their interactions aren‚Äôt calling for suspicion but when I see my boyfriend care for her like this, I guess I do feel jealous. It‚Äôs crazy cause I know he loves me romantically and I‚Äôm the only woman he sees sexually so why is this friendship making me feel weird? I feel horrible because I know that if Blair was a guy, I wouldn‚Äôt care this much but in the back of my mind I‚Äôm worried that on my wedding day while he speak his vows, I‚Äôll see him looking at her.",I feel like I‚Äôm losing my boyfriend to my friend,18nxlk2,1703193480.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nxlk2/i_feel_like_im_losing_my_boyfriend_to_my_friend/,

"All of the people in this story are in their early twenties.

Before I begin the story I want to say a few things about myself. I have felt insecure about my appearance my whole life. I have been successful in many areas of life such as academic achievements and in hobbies like music, sports and community work etc. People get along with me very often, I am polite and can make them laugh and feel at ease and have always been well regarded in my social circles. Despite all of that I still often feel very unsure of myself and have confidence issues etc.

A couple of weeks ago I went to hang out with a female friend of mine. We've known eachother for years. I slept over and the next morning a friend of hers came over and the three of us ended up hanging out there until about 6 in the afternoon.

As soon as her friend came in, I had (in my head) had a cartoon jaw drop moment. She's gorgeous, well read, funny, interesting and has the prettiest smile. We even like the same TV shows and had a really nice time. The conversation was great, it was all going well. But I did a big stupid.

My ~2 year relationship ended recently. She was abusive and it was horrible more often then not but we kinda kept it going until we didn't. Outside of that relationship I don't have too much romantic experience. I've made out with girls and had a few sexual encounters but not very often. And even though I feel girls like me, especially once they get to know me, I've either made poor choices (ex. went for the ones that didn't like me and ignored ones that did) or just didn't have enough confidence. But one thing I never, ever was is inappropriate.

I don't know what came over me but I put my hand on top of her part of the sofa and wanting to hug her. I also lightly touched her with my hug hand once she laid back on my arm. I thought, ""okay this isn't crazy?"" We remained like that for a little while and she moved away later. A bit later I once again put my arm out and she again laid there on it and after a bit I lowered my hand and put it on her arm. She then moved from the sofa completely.

I felt horrible because I saw she didn't like that but didn't know how to apologize and felt super awkward. She actually gave me a goodbye hug when the two of us left the building. I thought ""okay, glad she didn't get too freaked out. That wasn't great, wtf was I thinking?""

Then my friend calls me yesterday and tells me her friend asked her if I'm weird and says she was creeped out by the hugs and that she's afraid I'll ask her out. I feel horrible. I was really excited to get to know her and usually never do something like that, especially with someone I just met. I never get really physical unless we're going to hook-up or kiss/make out after meeting. I just hope she didn't get too scared/upset.",I creeped out a girl I like and feel horrible,18nx1k1,1703192053.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nx1k1/i_creeped_out_a_girl_i_like_and_feel_horrible/,
"To my ex. I hope your happy

5 years. You took 5 years. But you took so much more 
You took my ability to relax or enjoy myself. 
Now if I'm enjoying myself or doing something I like, I have a panic attack and depressive episode that lasts a week. 
You took my ability to find good things about myself. 
You gaslight, belittled, manipulated and defeated me. 
The horrible things you said carved deep into the foundation of my life. Deep enough that I don't think I'll ever be able to pave over those words. They say I need to forgive myself, but that's not an option. I let you walk on me, force family out of my life, burn bridges between friends who wanted the best for me. 

I can't forgive myself because I'm full of guilt when I see my friends and family. Guilt because I choose to hurt them, rather then stick up for them and stand my ground. You used my insecurities to move me in ways you wanted. You made fun of my body infront of me to your friends for a laugh. You kept me humble by showing me the guys that were on your snap. The conversation where you told them how pathetic I was. 

After the first year you cut off sex. You humiliated my size and sex drive. You'd call me a disgusting for waking up with an erection. I'll never forget the time you found out I would Masterbate in the mornings. You made fun of me saying things like ""you're an animal for always doing that. How do you think Any woman would tolerate that."" 

The end of the tunnel was blissful. I remember the beginning of the end. It played out in the same way most people's worst night mares are, but mine was a miracle. You went out with friends one night. Stayed out passed 3am. First time you had went out In years.  Then the next night you went out again reassuring me I didn't need to go since I had work the next day, over the next Month you went out every chance you got. I never asked or wanted to go. I knew she was going out with friends and she had taking a liking to a guy. His name was constantly on her phone. Either text or snap. Then she started saying she drank to much and couldn't come home. I was fine with I knew this I'd how it had to play out. I knew I didn't have the strength to save myself. I knew it was getting close when you got an iud put in we hadn't had sex in 1.5 years. Then came the nipple piercings. Then finally it was over. We did it over text. She was at his house. I was eating olive garden alone. The weight that was lifted when you text me asking if we needed to take a beak. 


After living with him for a month. You came back to me. Begging for help. You told me he was hitting you. You showed pictures of your face. I'm a monster for saying this but I'm not surprised. The way you constantly gaslight and cut me down. Someone who can stick up for themselves will. I offered my apartment and a spare vehicle. But you didn't take it.

"Throwaway for reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 years ago i dated this girl i was friends with for about 6 years beforehand. It was instant love and we really did love eachother. We became extremely close to eachother, more closer than when we were friends. I loved her i really did and so did she. During that time it was euphoria 

However i wish it stayed that way. I would say a good while into the relationship, i felt it, that moment when you realize both of you are slowly drifting away from eachother. Little things like how she became somewhat distant, constant passive aggressiveness, etc. At the time i didn't know how to handle this, someone who has been my friend for so long treating me like this? i didn't think rationally and i didn't know hot to properly act. Then she started to ignore me and block me, this was most likely what caused it and i became really aggressive towards her. 

At times i would just yell at her and she would sit there, other times she would fight back and i would threaten her. I would like to say i never laid a finger on her, but at times i threatened to beat her. I would also try and blackmail her and threatened her with NSFW pictures she sent to me and share them with her sister and friends. this for a while made her ""submit"". I know this worked but at the same time i could tell what i have done, the point of no return. This continued for about 6 months, after that she convinced me to delete the pictures, and i did. beginning of 2018 we tried to fix ourselves. We both agreed we need to stop this, but it never happened we continued fighting, on my part i was the more aggressive one and would just yell at her. Finally around February 2018, she blocked me and left. I was deviated and didn't know what to do. I knew this was gonna happen but never fully grasped it. I drove away my only real friend over stupid shit. 

I was in a month long depression i tried many ways to reachout but no luck. I rightfully blamed myself, i wanted to change but i couldn't with her. i went to therapy and anger management classes. Since then to the start of covid. I would say i fixed myself up, i controlled my anger and with college starting i made a new start, making new friends, some really close friends, and getting to know people better. But while i could say i moved on, I still thought about her and the guilt.

November 2022, i was playing warcraft (dead game) and i got a message from her, she reached out to me asking what's up. I said nothing much and then we got to talking. She is much more successful socially (she always was) educationally and carrier wise then i am, she moved on and found a new partner who loves her. I was happy she moved on and i got the updates on our old friend group she still talks to. After some talking i finally said I am sorry for my actions, I had no real excuse other than sorry. To my honest surprise she said it's ok and she forgave me for everything that happened and still views me as a friend even after all this time, and then she unblocked my number and socials. And after that it we talked like normal.

But recently, most likely because of several factors going on in my personal life, I have been thinking about her more and more. The guilt has started to come up again and i want to spam her and say sorry but i don't want to block me (she blocked me on LinkedIn i don't want to push my luck anymore).

I write this down to get it off my chest, i don't really have anyone to talk to about this (a mixture of they will be disgusted and just no one to tell) and i just need to let it go. I am prepared for the comments below.

"I think there is no significant difference between luxury brand makeup and clothes and normal priced brand makeup and clothes. 

When it comes to makeup, people on TikTok Instagram etc compare luxury brand with drugstore brand. But they never choose the same colours. E.g. they choose a specific shade of red for luxury lipstick then choose different shade for drugstore even though they can find the same colour if they look other drugstore brand or even normal priced ones. When they compare the results, you only see difference because the colours aren‚Äôt the same. If it was, you‚Äôd not understand the difference

The same goes for the clothes too. Normal priced franchise clothing stores have similar designs to luxury brands. Some parts are unique which I can‚Äôt lie about but generally it‚Äôs the same. 

I feel like luxury brand users are gaslighting others to think luxury brand is way better. It just feels consumerism and a way to show off wealth 

Or I‚Äôm not rich enough to see the difference. Though, when I tried YSL mascara on one eye and maybelline mascara on the other, the pigmentation and eyelash shaping of maybelline was way better.

"I recently enrolled into an artschool. It‚Äôs been my dream school for a pretty long time and finally being able to attend it was one of the biggest steps in my entire life.

I had always been an average intelligent student, but kind of had my struggles with math. With a lot of dedication and work i was able to get an okay grade at my old school though. 

Art had been my passion ever since i can remember. I‚Äôve been drawing my entire life and it‚Äôs what keeps me going. 

I really expected this to be rough, i knew that i would be struggling with math again at my new school, but to think it would be that bad never came to my mind. Ever since school started i haven‚Äôt gotten one positive grade, which frustrates me so much even if i try to stay calm and keep trying.
It is so important to me to absolve this school and become a graphic designer, but regardless i just don‚Äôt have a chance if my math degrees are negative.

I have a tutor, take extra lessons and study at home, but nothing helps me.

Someone asked why I dont state the country asking me if i am ashamed or shy...neither? And why would my reasons for not disclosing information matter? I did not answer since I only saw it very late

What did I do to trigger people? I did not comment much else except for saying thanks to a different comment but that also got downvoted by 1 vote

"I'm (F, 30s) overweight. I am. My BMI says I'm obese even, though the way I look is honestly just... chubby. I have an hourglass figure that I genuinely like. The issue is that I'm short so 5 pounds on somebody half a foot taller than me may be nothing but on me it's a big deal.

I know I should lose weight. And don't get me wrong, I *want* some tone in my arms, my tummy even; I *want* to be stronger and have more endurance and generally have healthier things going into my body. I even enjoy exercise and healthy food and make a point of both being part of my day but I refuse to also give up the junk food I like or eat only the number of calories it would take me to lose weight. 

I don't want to lose the weight. I actually... like the way my body looks. I've got nice tits and a great ass that I get complimented on all the time and I love my hips and my figure and I don't *want* to lose weight and be thin or lose my shape. 

I feel like I'm *supposed* to want that but *I don't.* I've never had a lot of confidence and I've been surrounded by people my whole life who have made me feel like crap about the way I look-not just my weight but my hair, my skin, my lips, my nails, everything. I've been trying to slim up since I was 13 years old, to the point of starving myself even, because I knew I was ""supposed"" to. But I realized this year that I actually do like my body and I'm afraid that the more effort I put into being healthy, the thinner I'll get and I don't want to be thin. 

And I feel bad for not wanting that. What the fuck is that?? Am I brainwashed? Am I being too lenient with myself? I don't know. I don't know what to do with this feeling.

"I (38M) hate my life right now. 

I should be happy and content, with a great job, a wife (35F) and four kids (12, 11, 8, 5), all in decent health. I volunteer weekly at the church my wife works at, and the kids I work with think I‚Äôm cool.

I feel so alone despite all of these blessings. 

My marriage sucks. There‚Äôs so much to unpack here, but I‚Äôve made financial mistakes. The reasons why don‚Äôt really matter, but it‚Äôs definitely financial infidelity. We‚Äôve recovered from most of the damage, but I feel my wife will never recover no matter how hard I work at it.

This has resulted in a dying bedroom. Borderline celibate, nothing exciting. I‚Äôve never been surprised with hugs/kisses/affection. I don‚Äôt receive compliments, unless it‚Äôs a humble brag post on Facebook to her entire friend group.

I love our kids, but I‚Äôm the sole tutor when helping them with homework and projects. Their activities are wild, two of our daughters are in competitive dance, and they‚Äôre out of the house from ~4:30-9 twice a week. We have three different schools currently for pickup/dropoff‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm always the person dropping them off in the morning, and usually working their pickups into my schedule during my workday. 

I have been the one trying to keep the house maintained, but I can‚Äôt between laundry, dishes, making meals, facilitating homework, and doing the kids bedtime routines. Not to mention I have been the sole person to wake up in the middle of the night with our animals or kids. I‚Äôve been the one who has administered medications to our pets (we had a diabetic dog, and a cat that needed IV fluids), and this past week, was the sole person to manage the euthanization of our 14 year old miniature dachshund.

Last night, I stayed up until 3 am to make sure there was a fresh load of specific laundry for my wife and kids. I had to fix the error code on the washer, which led to most of my delay in getting sleep. But I did it out of love, but no one would ever do the same in return.

So why the title?

I‚Äôve been in therapy for nearly 7 years off and on. I‚Äôm also being treated for bipolar depression, ADHD, and anxiety. I‚Äôve dealt with two sudden job losses, albeit I have more than landed on my feet both times in better situations.

Therapy has been useless at best. I‚Äôve had three therapists, and it seems they hone in on my contributions.

‚ÄúPerhaps your wife is burnt out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you tried doing more for the relationship?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you lessen your wife‚Äôs mental load?‚Äù

There‚Äôs no discussion of why I‚Äôm hurting inside. I feel alone, and overworked to an extreme degree. My guilt and shame drags me down. The last thing I need to hear is how I need to do more to feel better in my marriage.

But where‚Äôs the focus on why my thoughts are the way they are? Are my struggles not valid? My wife refuses her own therapy, and is super hesitant to resume marriage counseling, as she thinks it‚Äôs a forum for me to excuse my wrong doings. 

I hate hearing how therapy is supposed to be the end all panacea to triage and identify what‚Äôs ailing you. At least from a medicinal perspective, I can trust that my spinal stenosis, sleep apnea, and the pain in my testicles (think there is a lump and getting it checked out) are real and treatable.

"(26M) It‚Äôs been a hard pill to swallow but I‚Äôve come to admit to myself that my relationship of 7 years is toxic, abusive, and absolutely unfair. My girlfriend hasn‚Äôt always been horrible to me. Once upon a time she was the sweetest person ever. But around 4 years ago things became unstable. I myself haven‚Äôt been a saint. I‚Äôve done and said some pretty horrible things to her as well. But I‚Äôve changed. At least I believe I have. 

Some of the things she‚Äôs done is take advantage of my willingness to do anything and everything for her. My difficulty saying no to her. And my absolutely atrocious spending habit on her. 

What‚Äôs really weighing me down is that recently we got our first apartment together. It‚Äôs been a struggle surviving off of my income only. And I don‚Äôt make the most amount of money. Less than 3k a month. And we have the whole nine yards of bills. Car, rent, credit cards, personal loans and other necessities to survive, food water etc. The reason why I‚Äôm so depressed and unhappy is that she‚Äôs the laziest, most unmotivated person ever. With recently starting her new job at the airport less than two weeks ago, she‚Äôs already called out 3 times. Yeah that may not seem bad to some people but prior to that she started working at Amazon less than a month ago and quit only a two weeks later. With a total of 4 call outs. Then just this week she‚Äôs started looking for other jobs and is talking about leaving her airport job. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do to make her happy anymore. She tells me everyday she‚Äôs depressed, which I can understand. The depression roots from not having money to have a good time, especially for the first time being on our own. You may see now where my frustration begins. 

I make her breakfast every morning, clean every chance I get, pick her up and drop her to work even though we have two cars (we live 30 minutes from her work). I take her out every weekend for adventures. I bring home flowers and snacks for her cravings about once or twice a week. Date nights 3 times a month, take out food and boba almost anytime she asks. Work 12 hour shifts to barely afford all of this, take our dog out all the time on walks and potty breaks. Which is not a down side but I have stuff to do too. 

I‚Äôm the exhausted and depressed one here. She‚Äôs mentally abusive and would not care if I‚Äôm tired. Directs all her frustration on me. And worst of all. My birthday recently passed and it was so horrible because of her, I‚Äôve contemplated un-al*ving myself.

We‚Äôve talked about getting her therapy but we don‚Äôt have the money for that. Things are only getting worse and we‚Äôre too broke to go our separate ways, with the closest family being 9 hours away with no room for an additional person in the home. 

I‚Äôm a good person dammit, and I want to be happy. But I also want her to get help and be her happy sweetest self once again.

When I was little my aunt had a boyfriend. They broke up and he stayed on our family property. He was the fun guy, younger than everyone‚Äôs parents, had a cool truck and would drive us to the movies, have sleepovers at his house, talk to us about our problems. 

When we were in 5th grade he kissed my friend and touched her. She told, and her parents moved away. He kept living there. When I was in middle school he kissed me and put his hands up my skirt, moving his fingers around inside me. I told my aunt, she made me tell my dad. They told me people would be hurt, it would be a big deal, and it just kind of ‚Äúwent away.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs so gross and predictable what happened. I became promiscuous, I had relationship after relationship where I allowed things to happen that shouldn‚Äôt. I actually thought my abuser loved me, so when he instigated a relationship as I got older I entered into a year long, very abusive relationship with him. It took me my entire adult life to realize the impact and start healing. 

My abuser still lives in the same house. My dad still has the same friends. Recently I realized that means he is friends with pedophiles. Literally has been friends for 40 years with people who openly touched kids. 

It‚Äôs all untangling in bits and pieces and it‚Äôs frustrating and infuriating and scary and makes me so angry and sad for little me and all the other kids. What a bunch of gross losers. And my dad. My DAD. 

The other day I collapsed inward. Like all the air was sucked out of my body. I actually hit the floor. My dad. He‚Äôs a pedo-apologist for sure. Is he a pedophile too? 

His best friend‚Äôs long time girlfriend used to sexually abuse and let other people abuse aka rape her kids. I know because her kid raped me and talked to me about what they did with other kids and adults. I didn‚Äôt realize until I was an adult that the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù they belonged to advocated sex between children and adults. There‚Äôs an article on the Family International by Grunge that‚Äôs pretty good, they won‚Äôt let me post the link here. 

So that‚Äôs who my dad‚Äôs friends are. And he left me the family property so now I own land with my abuser. I‚Äôm trying to sell. It wrenches me because that‚Äôs my family land and he gets to stay. Not me. And he will never face consequences that I can see. 

And the worst part is my abuser was better, more interested, more kind than my father. If I needed to I know I could depend on him. I actually got up the power to ask him about what happened with my 5th grade friend who moved away. He said he loved her. I said, she was a child, she was 10 and you were 30. He didn‚Äôt seem to understand. He said he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt do/count time.‚Äù I sincerely believe him that this is how he thinks. This man is broken inside somewhere. He‚Äôs done so much good and yet he does really harmful things. The inner workings of relationships are so difficult. This is so hard. I am so mad that figuring it out is on me as an adult, tiptoeing around the issues so I can get answers.

On the other hand my dad has done everything he can to show me he doesn‚Äôt have my back. I finally disentangled myself from everything that tied us together and now he wants to ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù our relationship. 

My therapist told me to tell him to ‚ÄúF-off, this is abusive behavior.‚Äù His new wife texts me that they love me. BS lady. You supported him in inviting a person you know f-ed kids and whose kids abused me, to your Covid wedding of 10 people. 

Thank you for listening. I‚Äôve told friends but writing it out makes it so clear. It‚Äôs so gross! And it messed me up so much to think my abuser was my friend and my dad had my best interests at heart and find out I was just a patsy for them. And see all the things I did while unwittingly playing out the old trope of ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù is so sad and maddening. 

And now what? Do I tell my dad I hate him? Because I do. Do I go entirely no contact? I have but it doesn‚Äôt feel finished. I‚Äôm just so angry! I feel like a smart person but I feel so stupid for letting these grown men have so much power over me. 

I want to book a therapist who will let me say all of this, but I don‚Äôt want to have to see my dad while I‚Äôm saying it. I don‚Äôt want to hear his I‚Äôm sorry because it is so fricking too late.

In all fairness, I was extremely mentally unwell in high school and am still trying to pick up the pieces with the help of medication and a new therapist.

"When I was really young, I started to like kpop, and I went down a rabbit-hole of wanting to look like these idols and joining communities that lead to me developing an eating disorder.   


Because of this, later on in life I refused to count calories because I was worried I would slip into the same habits, and in turn ate so much junk without realizing. It was also incredibly difficult to stick to, since my fitness pal would tell me to eat 1200 cals which was difficult in an unhealthy family and while going to school.  I also would binge due to stress which didn't help.  


 I recently started my weight loss journey again, since I'm overweight now, due to ignoring what I was eating before. I feel like this time something just clicked.   


My calorie goal is 1600 cals, which is definitely possible, and since i'm working, I have the money to buy my own low calorie food. One thing I needed to learn is to stop eating so much fast food, and to stop mindlessly eating. With 1600 cals I can eat all my meals with a couple snacks and I don't feel like it's a punishment. I think a HUGE factor was cutting out all the fast food I was eating. I'd get McDonalds about every other day and I didn't realize how many calories it was.  


Miraculously I've lost 5.5kg in the span of about 2 months, which I definitely can't complain about. I'm very happy with myself. I let myself eat regularly, I don't even think about cheat days, I just eat more calories some days than others, and that's okay. I don't feel down that i'm not super skinny. I'm happy I lost anything at all. I don't feel like food has control over me. In the grand scheme of things, I definitely need to lose more to get to a healthy weight, but I feel so overjoyed.","I've been struggling with ED and weight loss for years, and i'm finally overcoming it.",18nvig5,1703188038.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nvig5/ive_been_struggling_with_ed_and_weight_loss_for/,

"I don't know if this is the right r/ but I need to get this ''off my chest''.

I'm so tired of males... Like every connection I have is with males... All of my friends are males, I have 2 female co-workers, and they are not very interesting due to their age difference and one of them is my boss, the rest of them are males.

So I need to add that I have a girlfriend right, she's amazing and I love her, I'm not trying to say that she isn't enough for me. The point I'm trying to make is that it would be nice to have more female friends and females to talk to, females are a lot different to have a conversation with than men. Also, you can learn a lot from them as a male.

The problem I have with that is I find it rather difficult to meet women when having a girlfriend, even intending to just have a female friend, i think my girlfriend would never understand this, and and can't blame her for that. The other thing is, how do I meet women these days in a situation like this? The times when you go to a bar and see a girl and start talking to her are gone. Everything is online now, I have the feeling if I would like to meet another female I would have to make a dating profile but with the setting 'to meet new friends'. But then again the same story, what about my girlfriend?

"Background

I (M27) met my wife Lisa (F30) thru a mutual friends party 5 years ago and we instantly felt a connection but we decided to take slow because she had recently gotten a divorced and i just got out of an abusive relationship with my ex. We would text and call each other every day and went on dates every other weekend. And slowly we fell in love with each other. Soon i met her daughter lets call her Sara she was 7 at the time. After being together for about a year we deseeded to move in together and bought our own house.

Over the years Lisa and i got married had 2 more kids 1 boy and 1 girl. with work promotions came more responsibility's. I was able to earn so that we could life a comfortable life.

My mental health also began to decline do to untreated trauma evolving my ex gf who would abuse me physically, emotionally and sexually. And the reason she broke up with me was. In her own words ''You are no longer fun to play with'' after i gave up on trying to fight back the abuse and let it happen over time. I began to develop depression, stress at work, managing home life and work trying to be a good husband and a good father for the kids. Thoughts of ending it all and taking my own life became harder to fight back.

So about 3 weeks ago Lisa took the youngest kids to be with her parents over a weekend and i stayed home to take care of Sara who is now 12 who had a mild fewer. That Friday i made Sara's favorite pasta and we stayed up all night watching her favorite movies she fell asleep with her head on my lap while i stroked her hair. I picked her up and put her to bed she woke up before i could close the door and said ''I love you thank you for being the best dad ever'' and fell back asleep. It was so hard to fight back the tears at that moment. As soon i closed the door to my bedroom i collapsed on the floor and every emotion came poring out as i just lay on the floor crying. on Sunday evening when Lisa came back home i waited until the kids where in bed. I took Lisa to the living room and told her everything. About the abuse, depression, the stress at work, how many times i hid in the bathroom at nights and cried so no one could see or hear me. And what Sara said and how i just collapsed that night. Lisa just held me that night and stayed with me until we tell asleep, i never felt so save and secure in her arms that night and every time im with her the feeling is the same.

"I want to start off by stating that i'm currently 28. I have moved out at the age of 18. My life has been a rollercoaster when it comes to emotions as well as living situations. I was in a long term relationship for 11 years, however it came to an abrupt end earlier this year when I had discovered that she was cheating on me with a co-worker. (We both worked at the same place.) After this happened, I was looking for a new place to live. I had decided to stay with my girlfriend for the time being and was looking for a new job. I had found a new job and have been living with her for now. Due to recent circumstances, I have come to realization of how overbearing my mother is. I have set clear boundaries as to not reach out to my girlfriend or friends when I don't respond to my Facebook messages. (I hate social media). She has ignored this boundary. When I was moving out of the living situation with my ex, she was adamant on going over and seeing my apartment as I was moving out. I told her that I would let her after I had finished cleaning the apartment. She had then said, ""Do I need to go and have your dad go get some keys?"". The reason she stated this is because my dad was originally my guarantor as my credit wasn't meeting the requirements to get the apartment. I did pay all of my rent myself. My mother has now gotten herself in every aspect of my life. She always bugs me about getting a haircut when I tell her i'm growing out my hair and about small decisions I make in my life. It has gotten so annoying that I have refused to tell her where to live and oftentimes I refuse to message her back on social media. If I don't respond she will often send another message such as, ""I'm your mother, I deserve a message back"", or ""Are you getting my messages? Why are you ignoring me?"". The main reason I haven't been ignoring her is just her lack of respect for the clear boundaries I have set forth.",Letting go of my family relationship with mother,18nv5md,1703187113.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nv5md/letting_go_of_my_family_relationship_with_mother/,
"Well. Sucks to be me (m). 

Me and a colleague (f) from my student job at university were hanging around a lot at uni the last 2-3months. Studying in the bib, having lunch, chatting, poking each other, taking long walks on campus. 
She is super passive and shy so I actually interpreted those things as some kind of initiating non platonic relationship. 

There always was a thing bothering me: 
She really rarely asks for meet, but lately whenever I asked she was up for it. She also keeps on telling she rarely does that since she needs literally months to years to be cool at new people. That‚Äòs also the reason why I wanted to take it slow. 
So I wrote her regularly, asked often; like 95:5 me:her. I thought that‚Äòs her way, even tho I would usually (with other people) consider that a unhealthy balance. 

But today was rough. 

I made a suggestion that we could go to the christmas market at lunch time, but obviously it would take longer than usual. She wasn‚Äôt into it, saying she really needs to speed up for her thesis. Lil red flag as somebody that has interest in me would take the time nontheless. I surely would. 

We went to lunch with some friends of her. And yikes man. They were talking about reality tv for 30min, not even trying to involve me. Meh. Feels bad. 

Then, while playing chess at uni in the afternoon, I asked where her interest for it comes from: ‚ÄûHer boyfriend of 2months.‚Äú

Well fuck me right. 

So either I am super duper bad at interpreting signs (I think i am) or whatever but I really cannot understand why she would never ever drop a word about her bf when we were getting to know eachother while I literally would message her ever 2-3 days, asking to do stuff and surely were flirting with her. I mean isn‚Äòt my intention kinda clear here?

So now I am sitting on my couch, being sad, feeling unwanted, realizing I was falling into love with someone that has no feeling for me. I suck at taking a pushback. 

And I dont even know if I should, after the holidays, spend more time with her. I would just see the girl I like over and over, not getting past her (and I am bad at that - it takes months for me). On the other hand I would also loose a social on campus I enjoyed spending time with.

I am very conflicted and upset about this (unless it‚Äôs not a big deal please let me know)!

I want to understand how to process this. I‚Äôve dated my soon to be husband for 9 years and now we‚Äôre engaged. We were at a store and an employee I am familiar with as I see them often shared news that her son, who has autism, has found interest in band and is thriving. I was going to congratulate her until suddenly my fianc√© stated that he is also on the spectrum and has high-functioning autism.

So, I stood there shocked hearing this news for the first time and when we entered the car I asked him when did you get the diagnosis and I wasn‚Äôt angry or upset I just really wanted to know because to me that‚Äôs big and serious news. He said, ‚ÄúI told you about this before‚Äù and first of all, I would NEVER forget something this big. I told him that and he just responded ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù

What makes it more odd and confusing for me is that he said he was diagnosed as a newborn, but his parents haven‚Äôt shared this with him and it never gets talked about. Not even his siblings know and I just find that so strange. When I mentioned that we should talk about this more and even speak with your parents he says ‚Äú there‚Äôs no need and I don‚Äôt want to discuss this with my parents and I am a functioning adult so let‚Äôs drop it.‚Äù

Something just isn‚Äôt sitting right with me about this. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I am just now hearing about this, or that he‚Äôs lying on his parents and about this whole thing and why he would do that.


TL;DR

I just need to know how to approach this. I cannot stand lying and I feel like this is very serious especially if his family is oblivious to this and I‚Äôm not poking at him that I‚Äôm ashamed by him but because things aren‚Äôt adding up with his story.

Her and I makeout, fondle, etc, and my boyfriend knows about all of this. He is okay with it. (and finds it quite attractive.) However, she decided to invite our guy friend over in the midst of our ‚Äúsexy time.‚Äù I should have stopped her, but i didn‚Äôt know what to do. They both did c*ke, and were fired up and started making out with each other. And she suggests we should all makeout.

(he‚Äôs mostly her friend) But i will admit i‚Äôm a bit of a natural flirt and he is kind of cute.  So that was that. I made out with him, it wasn‚Äôt bad, but i immediatley felt gross after. How could I do such a thing? it‚Äôs kind of complex situation considering my bf let‚Äôs me make out with other girls, but when it‚Äôs a guy i felt weird.  My bf is my only body. Let alone i‚Äôve never kissed another guy apart from him. I‚Äôm not sure if this counts as a body. I feel terrible, like he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be with me. 
This will definitely never happen again, I‚Äôm going to refrain from seeing that ‚Äúguy friend‚Äù ever again. 

I think it was just the heat of the moment, her and I already having sex and stuff before hand, but i know i should‚Äôve been strong enough to say no.

This was more for my parents than for me. Sorry for the long post but it‚Äôs just something I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to about. also trigger warning for SA.


Growing up, my dad was one of 8 (or 9, I forget) children. When the civil war happened, the soldiers went to their town and gathered the teenagers old enough to hold a shovel and made them dig ditches to dump the dead bodies of the guerrilleros. If you refused, you would go into that pile of dead people. At least they paid them something right? His family was dirt poor. He stopped going to school after 6th grade to start working full time on the field with my grandfather and his siblings 

My mom‚Äôs family didn‚Äôt do much better. At least my grandma only had 4 kids, the oldest, my aunt, died as a teenager due to illness. My mom‚Äôs dresser was a cardboard box that went under her bed so her clothes would be folded somewhere. My mom was an entrepreneur before she knew what that word was. She would take cheese and bread and pastries and put them in a basket on her head and set out to sell them on the street when she could. She didn‚Äôt go past the 8th grade.

 My parents came to the US from El Salvador in the ‚Äò80s. Yes, they came here illegally. They were in a relationship in El Salvador, but my grandma found out and made my mom break up with my dad (lmao) and sent her to San Salvador to work for a rich family. They lost touch.

My dad had two daughter with two separate women in the same year before leaving to the US. He then started his journey to the US with family friends (2 adults and 1 baby). He crossed the border on a tiny motorcycle meant for one person but there were 4 adults and 1 child on it. One wrong move and they would have all fallen off the side of the hills. 

My mom was in El Salvador when the big earthquake hit. Right after, her employer gave her some money to come to the US. She trusted her half brother to bring her here. He SA‚Äôd her and gave her birth control pills telling her they were headache pills ( the women in my family get headaches all the time). She crossed the border in the trunk of a Honda Civic with 6 other people.

Neither knew the other was in Los Angeles. They took odd jobs like others did. My mom took care of a child with special needs. Not sure what my dad did, but somehow he ended up working at Jack in the Box. One day, my dad‚Äôs cousin saw my mom at the park with the kids she was babysitting. They exchanged contact information and he gave her number to my dad. That‚Äôs how they got back together. They moved in together into a 2 bedroom home that had like 5 other people in there. Eventually they had me and were able to get an apartment. Then my two brothers came along.

After witnessing someone get shot in front of our apartment, my parents decided to move to Michigan, which is where we are now.

I think it was Bill Clinton who signed some law or something that made it so my parents could work here with a work permit. They kept up with it. Eventually, they were able to hire a lawyer to help them through the process of getting their permanent residency. They are now US citizens.

My mom opened a restaurant here in Michigan. It‚Äôs doing well. We are approaching year 20 soon. My dad is a truck driver. All they wanted was for us to graduate high school and be good citizens of this country.

I graduated with my MBA last week. My little brother is a pharmacy tech for the largest hospital in town. My other little brother works for one of the larger companies in town. I‚Äôm an accountant at an F500 company. Yet, somehow I still feel like I failed them because I‚Äôm 34 and it took me so long to finish school. I owe them so much, even if they say we don‚Äôt.

I have a good job, have built own house and don't rely on parents money anymore since I started working. Unfortunately, I don't have the Greek-god like looks as I wasn't lucky with the genes.

I have been nice to everyone irrespective of their personalities and situations, not going out of control and managing situations calmly and helping out when required. I'm also open to suggestions and improvements and I believe communication is vital in a relationship. But in the end when the time comes to take the next step, all I get to hear is that ""You are a nice person, you will get/deserve someone better. I don't deserve you."" I don't annoy or bother them once they have decided to move on after making their decision final.

Now at this point I'm really confused and disheartened. It was fine initially but over time this pattern has repeated and it now makes me feel that I'm not enough. It has started to affect my mental health and make me depressed. I'm really tired of hearing this over the years and I really don't know from where this 'someone better' is going to come into my life.

"Even though I(19M) love my mom, I can't shake off the feeling from my being that I'm an embarrassment to my father. Maybe it has to do with something psychological. No joke when I say this, my dad is a man among men. He takes care of people who are being taken advantage of, he gives money to the poor, he goes out to take care of his older relatives instead of sleeping whenever they need him. He is works extremely hard for our family 6-7 days a week at an extremly stressful and difficult job. He is handsome, manly, and very athletic despite being short. He is very sociable, will stand up when someone is being wronged or bullied, and extremely confident and competent. If you give him something to do it will get done. If you teach him something once, he will remember it. Objectively, he's the type of person you want during an emergency or any altercation, and multiple times he has stepped up for his family and friends. He is so loving and caring and beautiful I can't even put it into words, he's the most beautiful man I've ever met. On the other hand, I am the exact opposite of him, to a point where it is actually funny. I am extremely sensitive to stress and a a terrible person to look to for help when things are going wrong, I am extremely dumb and cannot understand things that are explained to me three times over. My body does something where when I get stressed or feel sad or very anxious, I start losing control of my balance, my muscles and face contorts, and I make sounds like you would hear at a nursing home, and I lose the ability to walk, and once again all of that stems from psychological weakness, I've seen a neurologist about this. On top of that, I have never been successful at any sport or activity in my life. I've tried to force myself into scenarios to become stronger but I always come up short, whether it was wrestling, karate, BJJ, baseball, learning how to drive, talking to other people and being normal, singing, I've failed spectacularly at every one of these things to a comical extent, my dad being their to witness every failure. It's like he has a heart of gold but I've been given the heart of a coward from birth. I've literally tried hypnosis, going into my mind with lucid dreaming to change myself, follwoing strict monk reigmetns of praying working out coldn showers and studying, but I stil fail. Even when now that im in college all i have to do is study and im failing at that too and causing my parents stress at home because of the episodes I have. It's so fucking embarssing. I jsut had a philsophy final today and I had to walk to the fornt of the room like a hunchback to hadn in my paper because of how my body was tensing up and my legs could barely move. Just embarassing. I don't mind suffering at all though. I'm willing to take pain and constant failure and emabrrasment if thats my destiney, to try and always fail. I just don't want to be my fathers son. It's too much for me for a man as beautiful as him to have a cockroach and absolute embarssing coward of a son like me, who has no friends and cannot even talk to a single girl without stuttering. My only wish in this life is for me to be switched with a son that he can be proud of having. I've tried my best, and I won't stop because my wish will never come true, but I really wish he had another son as opposed to me. It's funny. When I was in highschool, there was a kid from the same part of India as me who was literally looked at as an Adonis. We both had the same last name, same religion, and we were both the same height. I can honestly say that I wish him nothing but the best because he is a great person. But I wish that he was my Father's son and not me. He was voted the best looking in my school, mind you it is filled with people of all races we are in America, he was a super-start athelte who was the captain of football team, basketball, and baseball, and goes to an IV leauge school. On the other hand, I'm 19 and still a sack of shit who has done nothing to make my father proud. I don't feel worthy of my last name, not in the slightest, not at all. I don't understand how I, a mentally-ill, weak, living coward and piece of shit, how I am even his blood, and I'm going to a lcoal unviefrsity trying my hardest but absoultey falling short. It seems like to me that this kid was the son I was supposed to be for my father that I was never capable of being. All of those moments people chanted his last name during a sports game, every point he got, all of those moments, with my dad in the stands hearing that, hearing that all of his blood, sweat, and tears was worth it, it kills me inside really. It makes me lose the will to live, but it also gives me the will to live, in that I am willing to subjugate myself to any amount of torture to somehow go about this which I am still trying to figure out.

"I had just came back from working a 9-5 quite far away from home, the place I stayed at had been cooking me alive and being back home didn't feel too much better. 

Either way, due to this, with an added bonus of poor dieting over the past week I became extremely exhausted. Trying to fall asleep was a challenge. My bed just wasn't as comfortable as I remembered, and my room felt super humid. At some point I was sucking on icecubes just to cool down. 

Soon after, I heard the loud clashing of cups coming from down stairs. I already knew what it was. My stupid cat. Probably got careless ND pushed over some cups. No big deal but I'll check up on her either way, both out of concern and boredom I suppose, mainly concern though, just in case anything shattered or if she got hurt. Coming downstairs I noticed she seemed to be swatting at something, clawing, meowing, reaching at it with her tiny little cat paws. 

I flick the lights on. A damned cockroach. Hated those things. I despise them, yucky gross and and gross again. My cat always had a habit of torturing and toying with her prey. Although it does look like she is making a genuine effort to play with them, to communicate and what not. She always seemed oddly gentle with how she approached insects and lizards, but I digress. Most the time, against spiders especially, I relocate them somwhere safe, I understand their value and place in this household. Or if it's a lizard, I'll try carry it outside so it may live another day, but this? This was a cockroach. It's mere presence made me want to burn this house down. It reminded me of how on two separate instances, a cockroach had VIOLATED my personal space. Crawling up my neck and arm respectively, fore er traumatizing me to this day. Hence why I no longer sleep downstairs in that room, but I digress.

I was not about to let their kind get off easy. The cat treatment was too good for them, I wanted more. As a reward for the capture of this pest, I had planned to trap it in a cup for my cat watch. It could swat at it all she wanted without risk of her eating it or it escaping. Too bad she didn't have interest in it after I took them both upstairs in my room. Guess she didn't like the fact that it didn't move around all that much anymore.

It was a plastic see through cup, so I began poking holes into it. Air holes, a key part of my plans to come. I used a thumbtack to make a few small holes at the top. Before later settling it down on my     tv stand. I looked at it. Gross, although ironically, they are quite obsessed with cleaning themselves. 

I suppose I should just get to the point. I made a gas chamber. I made a fucking gas chamber for the cockroach, and I fucking gassed it with perfume. Sending droplets down the holes I poked at the top. I want to say I wasn't thinking straight, I was tired, stressed, etc, and I wasn't thinking straight, but I know I was still conscious and fucked up enough to go through with it. 

I hated myself for it, and still do. I watched it squirm, shake, jump, and struggle to crawl. The fumes suffocating it, with the liquid of the perfume or whatever drowning it. Acting as a glue, tying it down. My morbid curiosity had peaked, I hated it. I hated the way it would look at me at times. Staring at me with those creepy eyes. Its legs pounding at the plastic cup, as if to scream, ""Let me out! Help me."" I often turned it away rotating both the cup and paper underneath it. I hated the way it looked at me. I hated the idea that it could possibly recognize my face. Yet I justified the continued tormet, reassuring myself that ""they can't feel or, they have no sentience"" stuff like that which I believe is true? At some point I contemplated wearing sunglasses or a mask to hide my identity. I feared that it may have called for it's bretherin against me. Or that it could recognize my face, and would curse me in the cockroach afterlife or something Similiar. I should've just smacked it, ended it right there, but I was afraid of setting it lose from my room when I lifted the cup, and I was too dumb at the time to just end it with a slam. 

I poked more holes, near the top, I needed to drown it now. End it's suffering in a fucked up kind of way. I needed to stop this bloodshed. I was their goddamn Hitler for crying out loud. The whole thing lasted about 30 minutes I think. It was finally over. I wiped everything down, cleaned up my mess, and washed the evidence, a long with my humanity and dignity down the toilet. 

I washed my hands, hoping to wash my sins away too, but the guilt was all too heavy a burdon on my shoulders. A self imposed curse. 

I lay in bed, a lone. Even my cat refuses to look at me, disgusted by my depravity. I always believed myself to be a 'good' person. My friends think so too, but I doubt myself now. How good any good sane person so such a thing. I prayed to God for forgiveness, I prayed to the cockroach for forgiveness. I don't know anymore man. I think I'm going to make a little tombstone and memorial for the little guy. Right on the TV stand in which he was gassed. I might light some candles for it, I don't know. Maybe make it a routine to pray for it's forgiveness, I don't know. All I know is that I can only make ammends. I honestly though I was pretty alright up until now. I think that my character is quite questionable at the moment. I don't quite know if I'll become a repeat offender through this, I hope not. All I know is that I messed up, and I feel some dark juju coming my way. I don't expect forgiveness from any of you, I don't quite forgive myself, but I hope God can, despise all of my shortcomings. From this day forth I will strive to become a better person, for others, myself, and for the poor roach I gassed. Although I'll not hesitate to (humanely) kill more of their kind despite this incident. They're still gross and I hate them.

"I loved my dad.  He lived with me for about 7 years.  He went into hospice in 2022 but still lived with me.  I had a live in caretaker that helped me stay sane and took great care of him.  My dad turned 90 and I really believe he had a moment of clarity about his age and condition even through his dementia.  He has a great day on his birthday and actually was kind of in the moment.  

The very next day he started a rapid decline and was dead in a week.  The last 4-5 days he was on constant morphine and was not awake.  He would get morphine every 3 hours and the caretaker would give it to him during the day and I would give throughout the night.  His room was downstairs so I slept in the living room.  I didn't sleep in his room.  I knew he could die at any moment, but I didn't stay in his room.  He died alone.  

I know he wasn't awake, I know he wasn't aware.  I had told him he could go whenever he was ready.  I told him I loved him.  But I let him die alone.  I don't let my pets die alone, but I let him.  I haven't told any of my family.  I am sure they know based on what I have said.  My dad died in September and writing this is the first time I have cried.  I didn't stay in the room with him for my mental health, but God, I feel like shit now.  I can't go back and undo it and don't know if I would.  

He was my dad.  I loved him so much and I let him die alone.  How do I accept that?

I am ok other than that. I had and have a great and supportive family.  I was extremely lucky that my siblings and I all agreed on how to handle my parents decline.  I was also extremely fortunate that my dad's finances allowed me to hire a live-in caretaker.  My dad had a really good and long life.  So I am in a good spot.  It is just that one thing I am having some trouble with.

"It just feels like the women I'm interested in aren't interested in me. Let me be clear, I don't hate them for it, it just really sucks and I hate having to start the process of getting to know someone else over again.

I've known this person for a few years but over the last year we've been talking more and grown closer. For a period of time ending a few months ago they would be sending me messages like ""come cuddle with me"" (they're 700km away), or ""come cuddle and watch this TV show with me"".  She'd send me messages like ""I genuinely like you"" or ""you're adorable"". 

A few times I would be sexts and she'd  send me messages like ""I want you to send me a video of you stroking your cock"" or ""I want to sit on your face"". Great, fantastic. 

And now it's become ""we're a friendship"", we met for the first time a few weeks ago. Her work had a conference and we agreed we'd share a hotel room but with our own beds.

It couldn't help but sense a feeling of embarrassment when I was introduced to her coworkers in the evaluator, like it was some sort of failure on my part that we're sharing a hotel room but not sleeping together which is probably what their coworkers assume. 

She spoke about visiting me where I live, which somehow has become me visiting them again in the summer when she was telling her coworker best friend about me at a bar, her coworker asked how we met and in retelling the story to me, she wanted her coworker to stop asking questions. We met online, I added her snapchat and but didn't really speak to one another much until I started replying to her stories.

She's still picking out other shows for us to watch, and I really enjoy watching these with her, but I wish she'd let me choose a show lol. It also just feels like a level of intimacy I'm not use to having with my other ""friends"".

"The idea of being married isn't what drives me up the wall. If I could just snap my fingers and be married to him, I would. It's just... Ugh. 

I dreamed of getting married my entire life. I imagined getting married in a beautiful synagogue in Chicago that my family used to attend. I'd wear a white dress with pink flowers embroidered on the veil, and my parents would be there, and my siblings would start a fight while we're all getting ready before the big day. I even fantasized about the wig I wanted to wear after I got married. 

And I'm not getting any of that. 

My mom and I don't talk because she's an awful person. My dad is dead. The rest of my family and I also don't talk (see: mom, awful person). My boyfriend isn't Jewish, isn't willing to convert (I don't want him to, conversion takes years), and doesn't want to get married in a synagogue because it's too expensive to rent one out for the three people that would be in attendance (me, boyfriend, Rabbi, witness - we're both pretty introverted people with small social circles, and all of my close friends live in a different country). And honestly, I would look like a literal blimp in a white dress. 

He's gonna propose soon, and I'm gonna accept. We'll probably get married in casual clothes, in a courthouse. And it'll be fine, because I'll be with him, and that's worth losing the rest of it.

"There, I said it. I hate showering, but not because of what you think. I love being clean. I shower twice a day with some amazing smelling body wash, I have my own skincare routine that I do once in the morning and at night, I wear perfume almost always (even at night before bed). I love showering because it‚Äôs relaxing, but I hate it  more than I love it because I have to perceive myself. I feel everything. I feel my skin, my fat, my insecurities. I look down and all I see is fat. I hate it. It makes me want to vomit. It makes me want to cut off all the fat off my body. It makes me want to kill myself.

I hate coming out of the shower and having to look at myself in the mirror. I hate my boobs, I hate my stomach, my thighs, my arms, my face. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm 170-175lbs. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and 20F. I lost weight by doing an extremely strict diet of only 400-800cals a day. I made it from 182lbs to 150lbs in a month. I was honestly very happy, but then I just lost control and began eating again. Not a lot, just once or twice a day but I guess in big amounts and I just slowly gained all that weight back.

Even though I was starving 24/7, I was happy. I was saving money since I never bought groceries or takeout. I went to the gym and worked out for hours. I got in 20k steps a day. I felt pretty for the first time in my life. I could wear crop tops and not feel like a pig. But now I can‚Äôt. I hide behind plus size clothing. I wear sweatpants and hoodies that are too big on me because it makes me feel comfortable. I go above and beyond to do my makeup and take care of my skin because it‚Äôs the only thing that makes me feel pretty. I have a disgusting pig-like body, but a decent face. 

I honestly wish I could go back to starving myself, but for some reason, I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs because I love food and I hate it. Food is so good but it makes me fat. It makes me ugly. Every time I eat, I regret it 10 minutes later and I throw it all up. Then I feel disgusting because I ate and I threw up. 

People say eating disorders are not it. That it‚Äôs not worth it, but to me? It is. Everyone was complimenting me on my weight loss when I was starving myself. Everyone said I looked so much better, that I looked smaller and more feminine. People say skinny isn‚Äôt everything, but it is. People care about your weight and it‚Äôs a hard pill that most people don‚Äôt want to swallow. When I was 182lbs, no one talked to me at parties. No one approached me. At 150lbs? I‚Äôd get approached all the time. I‚Äôd dance with men and women I didn‚Äôt know. People smiled at me. 

I wish I was anorexic. It‚Äôs terrible. It fucking sucks. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even believe I have an ED, but I honestly wish I did. I always hear recovered anorexics say that it was the worst time of their lives while they were struggling with their EDs, but to me it wasn‚Äôt. Yes, I went crazy over hunger. I cried whenever I craved something because I couldn‚Äôt eat it or else I‚Äôd gain 5 lbs. I cried over drinking a can of regular soda. I cried over eating two boiled eggs instead of one for dinner. But what made me feel better was seeing the numbers on the scale going down. What made me feel better was hearing people compliment me on losing weight and saying I looked smaller. 

I‚Äôve made amends with the fact that no one will ever love me if I‚Äôm fat like I am now. 

I wish I was anorexic. I don‚Äôt care if I die from it because at least I‚Äôll be skinny. At least people will see me and not think I‚Äôm a pig. At least I‚Äôd look pretty in my casket.

His reasoning: ""you complained for days about your stomach aching"" - that's not completely true. I was nauseous for about 2-3 days because I was missing my meds so I couldn't take them (mental health meds) and when that happens it makes me feel sick. I took them finally, and the next day I woke up feeling perfectly fine. I had a huge bowl of cereal and THAT made my stomach ache. There's a difference between nausea and aching.

All I did was ask him not to buy grocery related items for me without asking if I want it because I don't want it going to waste. I don‚Äôt mean the money part like he thinks, I mean the actual food and drinks that someone else could‚Äôve had. He said he doesn't care about wasting it, but it's not about him.

"So a couple of days back, i was in a gc where my groupmates and i were doing a music video, said groupmates set up a location to meet up, but it was far, i told my mom this (She's a teacher in school) and she argued that it'll be far and i don't know where i'm going, which is true, but my grades were dwindling and i had to try to go to the location, so my mom asked my teacher. (My teacher said that if we make the video in or out of school grounds, we weren't allowed to, since it's christmas break).

They already have a bad look on me, but i made myself look even worse.

"Ever since we got COVID a couple years ago,  my partner has changed. It's like neither of us fully recovered from it. He was freelance, and working on some gaming projects and aspiring to get published. He was new to living on his own, but he was figuring things out. We would go out and do stuff together, and things felt pretty evenly split in terms of chores and errands. 

Now... He hasn't had an income since COVID, he hasn't published anything, barely worked on anything, and gets irritated and depressed more easily. 

I work full time, recently purchased a house (with some help from his family), run errands, pick up groceries, set up appointments for things, pay the bills, maintain the car, cook, clean, check the mail, and essentially handle all household planning. 

He... Sometimes does the laundry, takes out the trash, sometimes cleans up the dishes and pots I leave. Otherwise he sleeps, is on his phone, reading, playing games, or eating. 

He will do more if I ask him to, but I think part of what is frustrating is that I have to ask, that I have to remind him. I already have the whole mental load of my day, and I feel like he expects me to carry his too. I can't count how many times I will come home and see what I've asked still not done and he will scramble then and there to do it. Then he gets upset that I am disappointed that he couldn't just DO IT when I asked him to. If it is left up to him to do something and I don't remind him or nag, it can take DAYS or WEEKS for him to get to it.
I buy him treats and gifts often, he used to make me things in return which I loved and have kept every single one, but he hasn't for a long time now. I am skeptical he will even have anything for me for Christmas. I feel like he doesn't realize how much I do for him, but maybe I don't realize how much he does? I don't know anymore. I told him if he doesn't have anything published by next year that he needs to get a job. I'm worried he won't follow through and I'll have to end things.

 I feel like I'm only enabling him to not grow up at this point, and if things go on like this, what happens when I am gone? Is he going to be able to even manage a house on his own? When we're both sick, too, guess who's taking care of who? Me. I take care of both of us. I have chronic health issues and clinical depression, and I think he has some too that need to be treated but he won't. And while I love him to bits and he's been such a wonderful emotional support and my best friend, he hasn't met me in the middle in any other way. Maybe I'm wrong and he's always been like this, and I'm blaming COVID for something that it didn't do, but I know for a fact it changed me.

"I was completely innocent about sex and grew up in a very loving and sheltered family. It was not a crazy cult or anything like that. We were kids and were allowed to be kids, not forced to grow up before our time. I was taught about sex of course, I knew the mechanics, but also knew it was something special I wanted to save for my future wife.

One fall, I got a role in a play at a community theater in another city. I was a minor character in the play and assistant stage director. This meant going to rehearsals and waiting long times for my parents to drive in and pick me up.

Right from the first day, the stage director started giving me unwanted attention and making inappropriate comments. She was older than me and I was intimidated. I tried to avoid her whenever possible. But we had to work together. At one point in the script, the scene change was very fast with the main actress not having time to go back to the dressing room to change. The stage director and I had to help her backstage strip from her dress and get into another inside a few seconds while the other crew rearranged the set. This meant me helping her taking off her bra and put on another. It was the first time I had seen an adult woman in nothing but underwear and I was uncomfortable about how it made me feel. The stage director saw this and accused me of being gay. I foolishly let slip that I was a virgin.

One night after rehearsal while I was backstage in the green room working on homework, the stage director came in and raped me. She was a very strong, very powerful farm woman who roped steers and rode bulls. Holding down a skinny city boy was nothing for her. She choked me to get me erect, then went down on me. I blanked out at that moment. I remember very little. Just the absolute shame and degradation, and the condom smell I could not get off, no matter how hard I scrubbed my crotch in the bathroom with soap and paper towels. I shook the whole way home. My mom could tell something had happened, but I could not tell her.

I was too ashamed and too scared to tell anyone. First, I felt guilt. I remembered how when she first fondled me, it felt good. Was I sinning for that? Did it make me evil to feel flattered in some sick, twisted way that an older woman found me hot? (I did not understand then that rape is about power, not lust.) Also she threatened me, telling me she would kill me or she would start screaming and accuse me of sexual assault if I said anything. The rest of those three months of the play rehearsals and performances, I had to endure her glares, her dirty cracks about my ""tiny peen hammer,"" and her veiled comments to her friends about my inexperience. ""It was like fucking a dead fish,"" I heard her say. What could I do?

Now I am in my mid-30's, happily married, with a successful business. But last night I woke up in a cold sweat, living out for the bajillionth time that rape.

I swear on my life that this is a true story and that I am not posting this for attention.

**EDIT:** I am astonished and humbled by all your supportive PM's. Yes, my wife knows this story. It was one of the things we discussed in premarital counseling. She was incredibly patient as I worked through my fear of sexual contact. We recently celebrated our 15th anniversary. I have been married more years than I was old when this happened. Take that, sexual assault.",I got raped when I was fourteen,18npm2j,1703172619.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18npm2j/i_got_raped_when_i_was_fourteen/,
"We had our work Christmas party recently. We're a pretty close knit bunch who frequently hangs out/throws parties with everyone involved. The gifts everyone got were very sentimental and well thought out. Very much catered to everyone's likes and hobbies. On top of that every gift was given out with a heartfelt message about how near and dear this person is both as a friend and in our workplace. 

I was the only person who got a completely non-specific gift and no nice things said about me. I absolutely know this is not the groups fault and they think of me as a good friend, but it does nothing to help that this one person didn't care to put forth any effort. They even said ""I don't know this person."" I talk to him everytime we work together and frequently help him with his tasks!

I feel so stupid and dumb to be getting upset over this. It's just hard when literally everyone else got a gift that screamed their personality and such lovely speeches.

For context: I am the eldest daughter in an asian family so if you have seen memes about us bearing the responsibility for the whole family, then that‚Äôs true most of the time.

I‚Äôm already 27, my husband and I both have stable job, and I am at that point in my life where I can see myself having kids in a year or two (I originally wanted it to be after 30s but then I remembered that my mom almost died giving birth to my youngest sister when she‚Äôs about 30 something and triggered a pre-eclampsia and we were told / was told by my healthcare provider that genetically we are more prone to having complications when we give birth around that age). 

So I asked my sisters jokingly if would it be okay for they‚Äôre okay with having a baby as a Christmas present this year. 

Before anything, my sisters are wonderful people. They are truly the best. But what kind of made me sad was one of my sister‚Äôs response telling me that I‚Äôm not thinking straight and that there are still a lot of things to do. My youngest sister is still in school and I‚Äôm the sole provider of the family which means I am responsible for paying her tuition, the bills at home, groceries, and other stuff. My parents have separated too so I‚Äôm also sending allowance to my mom every now and then while I provide at home. 

One reason before why I was a bit hesitant to marry my husband was because of this. I feel like instead of being an asset, I am more of a liability and I think it‚Äôs unfair for him to take on some of my responsibilities because it‚Äôs supposed to be mine. I never asked money from him though although he offered a lot of times because I feel ashamed of myself. 

I just feel like if I was born in a different family with different dynamics, maybe this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Sometimes I feel completely helpless and sad of my situation, telling myself that I should have not married my husband yet because I am not yet done with my responsibilities at home.

I‚Äôm not really looking for advice. I just want to vent about it because I don‚Äôt want to tell my husband about this and make him worry.

"I have a unique family system. My parents are divorced and my two older siblings are adopted by my dad and essentially have other families on their mom's side as well as mine. There's more to it, but to not ramble, essentially my older siblings mostly do their own thing. I don't really have a traditional family unit when it comes to my parents and siblings, not everyone has a relationship with each other. We don't all gather for holidays or celebrations. Sometimes they will come, but often times they won't. 

I was also raised very closely with 3 of my cousins, often living in the same house (my grandparents). They feel more like siblings to me than my siblings. We talk all the time, they're at all of my events and I'm at theirs. I've never been on a family vacation without them and they have never been without me, though my siblings often skip them. I'm also extremely close with my uncle and aunt. They are the only unit I have and whenever I'm reminded that I am more of an appendage to their unit, it hurts so badly.

Not to get too much into it, but I wore one of my mom's joggers to work yesterday, and I guess that was her final straw. After giving it back to her, I went back to my room to do something, and a minute later, I come back out to see her not in her room. I assumed she stormed off without me and on her way to the car. I make it downstairs and the car is gone. I gave myself a minute to remember where we parked, but after looking at my mom's location, she was indeed on the road. 

Currently, I'm just in a state of complete shock with numbness. I can't say I'm used to this, but I can't say I'm surprised either...I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. An hour later, she texted if I work today...

"This is extremely weird. I don't know how to continue with this but I (16 M) think I'm falling in love with my Biology teacher (27 F). She joined school quite recently, about 6 months ago. Before I had seen her, I had kept hearing that she is pretty, she's young and all that. When I had finally met her in one of her lectures, I thought she looked alright and I hadn't developed ANY feelings for her whatsoever. She was just a teacher to me, until 2 months ago. We were in the Biology lab and she was showing us some cells under microscope. It was an old microscope so we weren't able to examine the cells so well. As we sat on our respective seats, I could see a bigger microscope on the shelf. I thought it might have been a better one so I pointed it out to her and some of my friends. I was looking at the microscope on the shelf to figure out if it was a simple microscope or compound microscope, since I had never seen one physically. Then my Biology teacher came towards my seat to see what I was talking about and for some reason, she held my upper arm. I immediately turned around to see who it was and it was her. Her grip was quite tight and she didn't let go until we finished talking about the microscope for like 5 minutes. Since then, I have been feeling differently about her. I know she must have held my arm innocently, as a teacher, but I can't help think about her. She is married by the way and I have no plans of hitting on her by any means.  
  
Every time I hear some music or a poetry, my first thought is her. My eyes immediately rush towards the door of the classroom every time I hear her voice in the corridor and smile a little whenever I see her passing by my class. I feel like I convince myself to wake up 10 minutes early everyday so I can reach school early and see her before the classes start. I feel like she motivates me, by simply just existing, to study and get the best grades solely to impress her. I do like to visit her to resolve my doubts and questions even if those can be easily answered by a simple Google search. I don't have anything sexual for her, it's just that I feel like seeing her all day long or talking to her.

"A few months ago, I hooked up with a guy I didn't know. We matched on Bumble and he lived an hour away in the middle of nowhere (also without telling any close friends/family members where I was going.) He had just moved to NC and he invited me over. Yeah, in my defense, not the smartest idea. When you're feeling suicidal, you do a lot of things that you probably shouldn't. He ended up being very nice, and made me breakfast in the morning. He also let me stay until whatever time I needed to leave. During our short time together, he briefly mentioned that he had just broken up with his girlfriend. However, while I stayed the night there, I seen a huge makeup bag in the bathroom that looked like it had just been used. 

Being that I didn't personally know this guy, I didn't ask questions. I was obviously too scared to. The days following, we stopped talking to each other. I found his Instagram, and seen multiple pics of him and his ex girlfriend. I assumed the worst. I asked one of his mutual friends if he had a girlfriend, and if he did to tell her that he was cheating on her. I knew that if I were her, I would want to know. I didn't get a clear answer, so I just let it be. 

I reached out to him today to ask him about the makeup bag. I apologized to him for reaching out to his friends; asking about the makeup bag when I should have just gone to him.

"Not sure why I‚Äôm posting, I suppose to get it off my chest. My relationship depresses the hell out of me. I once cared very deeply for my fianc√©e, but now I‚Äôm not sure what I feel except sadness. For context : We (me, my four children, and my partner) moved from my home that I owned outright (sold it upon moving) to about an hour away so we could be closer to his son (m8) and have him more frequently (we now have 50/50). When we moved it was under the premise that I would finish school (MEd) and then start working again; I gave up a very decent career to be out here for the sake of love‚Ä¶ my children love him very much, as did I. But, I feel like now my life in so unstable. He‚Äôs refuses to ever put me on the deed, and says I will have to sign a prenuptial agreement entitling me to nothing should we part ways. I have poured so much love, time, and energy into this man and his child. I have sacrificed my career and my home for this. Due to the new schedule, once I am done school I won‚Äôt even be able to work a regular job as someone (me) has to transport the child we only have 50% of the time to and from school. We live in a very rural area and before/after school care isn‚Äôt an option. This is and of itself has bothered me immensely; it‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs about the fear of spending all of this time and putting all of this energy into them, only to have him decide in 10 years that he doesn‚Äôt want this anymore and I will be left with nothing when I once had everything and gave it up for him. It‚Äôs very hard to put into words how I feel. Almost like I am being used as a nanny, amongst other things, until his child graduates.

To add to it, I‚Äôve felt for awhile he still has feelings towards the mother of his child. He has kept love letters and emails (I‚Äôve never received either, by the way) under the premise that he wants to show his son some day. He calls her nicknames still and has even called me by her name a few times. He‚Äôs told me all the things he used to do for her, but I pretty much have to beg to be acknowledged. It hurts immensely, just typing it out is making me cry. 

If it were just me in this relationship, I would leave. But after my divorce my children‚Äôs father pretty much disappeared and my now fianc√©e is the closest thing they have. I don‚Äôt want to do that to them again. I‚Äôm trying to suck it up for them, but I‚Äôm so depressed. I wish we would have never moved out here.

"I have never posted on a sub like this before, but have been reading for a while. Recently I (M21) learned that my sister (F31) cheated on her husband a few years ago. I have so much anger in me which I just want to release. I remember meeting the man she cheated with before she started cheating and was still with her husband, I was 14/15 and I hated their relationship from the moment i first met him. Even at that time and age I understod that their relationship was inappropiate, I told my family and even her, I told them how much I hated that man for the relationship they where having, and that hate ramped up when my sister divorced her husband and started dating this man. All throughout this process I was berated, yelled at, punished relentlessly for hating this man, I was forced by my own parents to like a man I saw nothing good in, my parents screamed at me and demanded I act nicely and hide my true feelings, my own fucking parents. Those times where hell for me, everyone in my family hated me, and acted like I was a horrible person for hating this man. But now I recently learned that my family had covered up the fact that she cheated, and knew even when punishing me, yelling at me and activly hating me for the way I acted towards that man, even my own parents demanding I hide my true feelings, my own fucking parents. They cared more about me hating the man my sister cheated with, than me telling them about the time I got sexually assulted. I have so much anger and needed to tell somebody, so here we are.

"He was sixty-six when he passed, which feels way too young. We lived less than a mile apart, so my brain keeps thinking I see him on the street whenever I go out.

He was a funny, sharp-witted guy. He was great at making people laugh and instilled in me a love of classic rock. I hate that I‚Äôm getting used to describing him in the past tense.

The days before he passed, the actual passing, and the week after all feel like a strange dream I had, like something that exists outside time. Sometimes I forget he‚Äôs gone and have a good day, and then I feel guilty for ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù.

"I'm so frustrated. I have a team of 8 people who work under me. They have done a great job this quarter, and I wanted to show them my appreciation.

In addition to the company wide gift of some branded sweaters, I also gifted each of them a 25 dollar Starbucks gift card from my own pocket.

Apparently, that's not good enough, and I've heard through the grapevine that my team has been calling me cheap because they heard of my Christmas bonus. And they have all been making fun of the Starbucks gift card that I gave them.

I find this to be very rude and disrespectful that they would all gang up on me like this. My bonus is none of their business, and I think a gift of whatever size from someone who is not obligated to give you anything should be appreciated.

"I just need to get this out without my struggling loved ones feeling like they need to help. 

Long story short , I became disabled in 2016. My boys were 3 and 4. I spent 4 years bedbound. Then I decided to sell my house, buy a camper, and move nextdoor to my sister. For 3 years, she helped me with dinners and schooling, doctors appointments for myself and my neurospicy kid. she's amazing.

 Because of her, I am finally able to be an independent single mom again. I'm still very much struggling to take care of myself and kids in ways that they deserve but, they're loved, they're feed, they're happy and healthy. 

My sisters world crashed and burned this year with her spouse cheating (again) and the inevitable divorce. 

I thought my kids would love a camper and think of it as an awesome fort. We all grew extremely tired of the small space. Everything started to break, the heater, the fridge, the microwave, couldn't run a small heater with the breaker tripping. 

A lot of financial strains from the explosion of cheating and divorce. On a disability income, I've paid 2 rents and expenses for my sister and my nephew for the past year. I did what I could to help just as she does for me. 

Because of the divorce we had to move. Myself, my kids, and nephew. We bounced around campgrounds for 4 months. My body started to take a huge toll and it was getting harder and harder to keep up the pace. A house is what was needed. 

The financial crisis from the divorce left my credit in shambles. I've worked so hard to find a place. Constantly pushing myself into very risky levels with my symptoms. 

I haven't slept more than a few hours a night, in weeks. I have no money for medicine and my body is being tortured. I don't care other than it makes me have mood swings. 

I got us an apartment. We moved in 4 days ago. I just wanted to give them a nice room for their Christmas. They're 10 and 11 and I thought, I guess this is the year that Santa ends as they had been questioning his existence and i thought it may be the natural phase out time. I don't have the strength or money to make any Christmas magic. 

After paying for the deposits I only had $400 left. We had zero furniture, just some rv bunk mattresses and a zero gravity chair for me. So I spent my money at the thriftstore on some living room furniture. I only did so because I was expecting a check to come for Christmas. It's lost in the mail. 

My boys all of a sudden got super excited for Santa. They're not done being kids yet!!. I can't stop crying. They first only asked for 1 gift as my children are used to a broke Santa. They're also used to different kinds of holiday magic as I am always struggling with my disease around holidays. There's just too much to do any my body doesn't keep up. 

We hadn't written our Santa letters yet so my dumb self thought, let's email him. Still thinking I would have money to buy the Santa presents. My kids were already told that our Christmas would be late but of course, Santa would come on Christmas. 

The check isn't here. It's 5 days before Christmas and I have none of the small gifts they asked Santa for on that email. 

My special needs son tells me how excited he is for Santa about 10 times a day. 

I cannot believe that I allowed this to happen. I'm so mad at myself. I could potentially ruin Santa's magic. 

My kids have had to grow up so fast because of my illness. Now, my ignorance. 

I always have a deep sadness that MS took so much of their childhood from me. I have videos and pictures of my kids having an amazing childhood. All I remember is my body torturing itself. I have a few memories of their joy. But all I ever wanted was to be a mom. To bask in every moment I got to spend with my kids. They were the only thing I have ever wanted for myself. 

There are people who have no home. There are kids in war-torn countries who won't see Santa. People are starving and cold. 

I didn't reach out for community help because I thought I had it covered. I try to pick up free things online, but I'm having trouble finding the gas to do so, let alone my body being down. I was thinking about selling the very little I have, but all of it is located at the camper, 30 minutes away and again, gas money. And it won't be a lot of profit. Then I can't go into stores on a normal day without becoming blind and unable to walk and talk from the sensory and physical toll, if I were to scrounge up some money, how do I go into a store around the holidays. I still would try. But it's yet another giant obstacle that while I take away my body to give to my kids, it will have some negative effects on them. Whether it's that I can't move for a few days or that I have mood swings.

I'm going to turn this into a lesson. Of course, I've learned mine. But maybe I will leave a note from Santa saying he had to go help kids but will be back in a few days. 

We have a roof over our heads. A warm apartment. Couch and chairs and mattresses to sleep on. Some food in our kitchen. And I got a free tree and ornaments. 
We have loved ones who aren't nearly as blessed. 

We are fine. We are lucky. We've worked hard. 

I just am so extremely sad about it all. All I remember on Christmas as a kid is my mom being extremely upset. I can't let them see me like this. Also, I really don't have a good enough reason to have such sadness. It's just a part of life. 

Just ahhhhhh. I'm so sorry, boys. You are the most amazing people, I'm so proud of you. You deserve so much more than mom gives you. I love you so so much. They know it's not about presents. They've dealt with 1 Santa present their whole life while other kids brag about Playstation and VR sets.

"I know this sounds like teenage angst or perhaps a coning if age movie where I will find myself and all will be fine again... well that's atleast how it's playing in my head.

I am a 20F and well I feel like I have fucked a few things up... basically I feel that I have nothing of my own... in terms of opinions, likings, fears... like I am so used to adjusting for others that I am so confused of who I am since they aren't there anymore...and I am trying to know what I like now!

I do believe I am a rational being, I am definitely hard on myself amd see myself as a superwoman... that's why I just tend to believe I can do it all... however lol nobody else does...
So I am going to explain you why I feel like this...

1. My friends don't feel like my friends anymore...
Okay, so my friend and I did drift due to me getting g a boyfriend and majorly because our classes changed due to a different course... but at this point I prioritize them... spend time with them 3 times a week... meet them everyday atleast once (and I have a more demanding course, so like they go home by 11 while I have to stay back till 3). Like I am genuinely trying but now I just feel they don't like me anymore... I feel Jo emotions at all and after every meeting I am just sad! Like I intruded their time kinda sad!
I am scared I will become lonely or maybe something is wrong with me... 

2)My classmates... I have a bunch of friends in class as well and I am popular and liked by most. I have a solid friend who looks after me and I do the same for her. BUT I am kinda scared of her... and I keep walking on egg shells... because she loses her temper and shouts when she is annoyed and I am very sensitive as person.... so why not be on best behavior than experience a protection of someone's anger - my brain tells me

I don't know what to do... like I feel lonely but I don't connect with anyone... I would rather just work... the problem is lol the moment I can't do it... I don't know what to do? I am an overly stimulated person who likes people and likes to do the impossible!

"My mother is Irish and came over from Dublin when she was 18. She‚Äôs now 78.

She promptly got pregnant, tried to look after her daughter but in the end took her back to Dublin (and left her there) and this girl grew up with her aunts and uncles thinking they were her brothers and sisters.

Fast forward six years and she gets pregnant again. Only she keeps the kid (ie me) and we have a life of poverty, literally. Lived in a tenement with no hot water, no bathroom and no toilet. We shared a single toilet which was outside, with three other families.

She worked hard, holding down three jobs at one point which is admirable however, there was never any love or affection from her. Even when finances improved, absolutely no love coming from her which made me crave it all the more. I remember her saying to me ‚ÄúI put a roof over your head and food in your belly. What more do you want?‚ÄùThat question has lived with me for 49 years (I‚Äôm now 56).

This desire to be loved, by anyone, led to me making some very poor decisions, especially with men. 

My first husband was an alcoholic, but he loved me and I loved him. He was ok, but he had very many demons and in the end I left him because I had nothing else to give him. I tried so hard to support him and get him help, but he just sought solace with whisky straight from the bottle. 

My second husband already married when I met him. He pursued me saying that he thought his wife was having an affair etc, making himself out to be the victim and I‚Äôm ashamed to say I fell for it all. He got divorced and we moved in together and we had a baby boy a few years later. I had never heard the term ‚Äònarcissist‚Äô prior to meeting him however I soon got to learn about their ways. He‚Äôd accuse me of flirting or having affairs, try to restrict my movements, withholding money, but I absolutely adored him. The worse he was to me, the more I tried to make him happy because I wanted him to love me. Even when he made us do a DNA test, I went through it because I was desperate to show him that I hadn‚Äôt strayed, but apparently that wasn‚Äôt enough.

Years later, I suspected him of having affairs and one night found out that he was not with a work colleague but another woman. I confronted him about it, he came home and we had a massive row. I ended up tearing the pocket of the suit he married me in because to me, those vows meant absolutely nothing and all the years of his mental abuse came pouring out. With that he attacked me, punching me so hard that it left an outline of my body in the plaster in the wall. That was it then. No going back. I still loved him so much but I couldn‚Äôt take any more. Interestingly we both were arrested, him for assault and me for criminal damage and that to me was the worst thing to happen to me. I just felt so much shame for everything that had happened. I planned my suicide. I was going to jump in-front of a train and it would all be over. If it wasn‚Äôt for my 2 year old son, I would be dead now. In the end I decided he needed me and I needed my boy. 

There is so much more to this, but basically, as an adult we make decisions and we shouldn‚Äôt blame events from the past for those decisions we‚Äôve made. BUT the things that happen in our childhood do and can have an effect later in our lives.

I choose now not to have any contact with my mother, or anyone else on her side of the family because it‚Äôs better for me. No anxiety waiting for her to make a comment on my appearance, or tell me what I should and shouldn‚Äôt do.

"In Fall 2021, I had met a guy on tinder, let‚Äôs call him Rob (28M). One night Rob and I went out for drinks and he shared that he was in talks of a job offer with a company in California (we both lived in Boston at the time). 

Back story - Rob is from California. He moved to Boston for a job opportunity right after college in 2018, so he had been in Boston for 3 years by the time we met the first time. 

I appreciated him being up front about possibly needing to move back to California. We enjoyed our night out, he was respectful, kind, funny. We kept talking after that first night, and he did end up getting that job offer just 3-4 days later and he obviously accepted it. However, the company he was moving for agreed to pay all his moving expenses and provide assistance, so he ended up not moving for 7-8 weeks later. So in that 7-8 week window, we had our fun. We went out on dates, we‚Äôd hook up, texted all day everyday, knowing it was coming to an end when he moved back to California. Long distance of any kind was not on my mind at the time because I never had any interest in moving to Cali, he never wanted to leave Cali, and I was a 3rd year full-time PhD student in Boston. It just wasn‚Äôt happening despite there being a spark.

He moves back to Cali after our little 1-2 month fling. We kept texting daily for awhile, eventually it faded. However, we‚Äôve kept in touch over the last 2 years. Not daily or even weekly, but we keep in touch and will sometimes talk for hours. He is still the same funny smart and kind guy he was in Boston. 

Over the last couple months, I relocated to Colorado for the final year of my PhD + starting a postdoc. My best friend recently moved to California, only 20 mins from where Rob lives, she and I made plans for the week of Thanksgiving ‚Äî I was gong to visit her. Rob knew I was coming to California so we made plans for the week I was visiting. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in 2 years but again, we‚Äôve talked many times since. 

Ultimately, when we were both in Boston, it was a ‚Äúterminal‚Äù arrangement bc I wasn‚Äôt leaving Boston and he was never leaving California. But there was definitely a spark, and I thought so highly of him. When visiting California last month, I was under the impression we would just hangout and hook up. Instead, we went out to lunch, he was thoughtful, respectful, picked up the tab etc. It felt just like it did 2 years ago. It was only a couple hours but it was honestly so refreshing seeing him.

I feel like seeing him 2 years after our Boston fling just brought up a lot of old feelings. He‚Äôs different ‚Äî he‚Äôs kind, he‚Äôs respectful, and I feel like we really could be a power couple. We really got to know each other despite it being a relatively brief amount of time. Unrelated to him, I have been considering moving to California after Colorado in 2ish years after finishing my postdoc. 

He and I are very similar. We‚Äôre both only
children, we‚Äôre both dedicated to our careers, and he is just different. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it, but something about him sticks. I just feel like the timing has never worked out a, but I just feel like seeing him in person again woke up something inside me. 

Part of me feels like he isn‚Äôt interested in something serious and never will be, the other part of me thinks we really could work if we both wanted it, it‚Äôs just hard not being in the same place. I haven‚Äôt told him flat out that I have feelings for him because I am afraid how it‚Äôll be received. I‚Äôm afraid of losing the friendship and it‚Äôs not a normal situation. Most of my guy friends think he is interested since he chose to wine and dine me last month as opposed to sex, he really didn‚Äôt owe me anything at all. But he gave me his time. I just don‚Äôt know how he feels or if he‚Äôs ever thought about the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. I just feel like it could work, and he‚Äôs still to this day unlike any man I‚Äôve ever met.

It started with comparing myself to other girls in school and it‚Äôs only gotten worse over the years, calorie counting, exercising excessively, straight up starving myself in recent years because I found it easy to just not eat during work and acting to my parents like I‚Äôd already eaten so passing on dinner.

My (17f) boyfriend (20M) are in long distance from past 2 months. Before this he was my friend from past 2.5 years. Before this I was in a long distance too and that was my first serious relationship. He was the only person I used to talk to and that guy was manipulating and even got emotionally attached to someone while being in a relationship with me. By the end of this relation I had depression , anxiety and frequent panic attacks plus due to some childhood trauma I used to do self harm a lot and I was put on antidepressants that‚Äôs when i started to get closer with my now boyfriend. He is the sweetest guy and has always supported me. There were numerous nights where i would have a panic attack infront of him. And few weeks back i took 5 antidepressant pills together and started feeling dizzy. I didn‚Äôt even know what was going on around me i fell almost everytime i tried to get out of my bed but i did get rid of my anxious thoughts and my boyfriend called me as soon as he heard my voice he knew something was off when i told him about all the shit i had done he calmed himself and tried to handle me it was almost 1:00 am and i told him i am feeling sleepy and he told me to sleep on video call with him. He was afraid i will end up taking more pills and I slept as soon as i closed my eyes and next day i wake up feeling anxious again and i dont even remember the order i took in but at the end of the day i ended up taking 23 pills and he was so worried i have never seen someone caring about me this much. Later when i talked to his friends they told me he literally was crying infront of his friends wishing nothing happens to me and he called numerous people trying to ask what is best to do at this moment (he has never dealed with any of this stuff like panic attacks and all). Next day after taking pills i told my father while almost fainting that i took 23 pills and i was admitted for 2 days and few days back he sent me video of me snoring and sleeping whilst he is on the video call and it was the cutest thing! I wonder how a guy can listen to a girl snoring for straight up 2 hours just because i dont wake up in middle of the night feel anxious and end up taking more pills and after he was assured that i was in a deep slumber he went to sleep. I love this man so much he heals me more than anyone and anything (ps now i stopped taking anti depressants and dont have panic attacks every night its hardly once a month now that i get a panic attack).

"It honestly blows my mind how many people have come at me negatively when I admit that I don‚Äôt have children and I‚Äôve never wanted any. I‚Äôve known since I was about 12 years old that I never wanted to be responsible for a little person‚Äòs life. I‚Äôm also single. 

I saw how hard my mom had to struggle after my father died when I was about 6 years old. It was extremely difficult. And they were married for a while before they even decided to have me. She never planned to be a single mom and still ended up one.

The part that gets me is that while people (*mostly on social media because that‚Äôs where I sometimes discuss it*) will say that I‚Äôm being selfish these are the same people who complain about dating single people with children and many say they wouldn‚Äôt. **I just can‚Äôt stand the hypocrisy**. I‚Äôm irresponsible if I have a child by myself, but I‚Äôm selfish if I don‚Äôt? **WTH?!**

Then some will even say, once you have a child, you will fall in love with it. *Is that supposed to be motivation?* There‚Äôs no guarantee that will happen. I don‚Äôt even like other people‚Äôs kids most of the time and parenting is a thankless job. The world is also overcrowded, and I don‚Äôt need to add to that.

i finally was able to cry last night maybe for 30 minutes at the most and even though i guess it helped i still feel awful still terrible because no matter how much i cry i know it wont help anything i still feel the same regardless. the dog had to be killed to please the landlord and i couldnt even cry about that when it happened when i had to sign the papers since no one else would. the neighbor got to get a dog even though they werent supposed to be allowed and its the cruel irony of it all one gets to live while the other dies for no reason somewhere in a mass grave or landfill somewhere thrown away like trash all because of the landlord the landlord is more than just this single problem but i wont go too much details just incase he ever reads this. the holidays are coming up and i cant even pretend to be happy because im not how can i be happy? my parents obviously dont love me they just love to lie and say they do only to make themselves feel better. i feel powerless in my life and thats what really makes me want to give up on everything college the possibility of a job transitioning further it all seems so far away and impossible and nothing makes sense so whats the point? why should i even try anymore? i dont want to die or anything but im frustrated and tired of the way things are the way they have been for as long as i can remember. i can talk to my therapist all i want but even they cant solve my problems neither can these antidepressants that my parents treat like a dirty thing as if im a drug addict all because im trying to find something to keep me going its not like theyre helping in general but im still trying to hold onto some false hope that things will get better and that they wont stay like this but how am i supposed to dream of that day that wont ever come? how can i imagine having a better place to live where my parents dont think of me as being the reason why we could get evicted since im trans? how could i imagine having top surgery and bottom surgery and being able to live like a normal human being? im beyond exhausted with the way that things have been. i dont want to pretend to sleep anymore just to get away from it all its not helping and neither is seeing my parents faces hearing them tell my sibling that theyre proud of them and watching them as they hold them in their arms. im beyond jealous but jealous isnt the right way to describe how i really feel. theres a deep emptiness in my heart with a sense of loss that ill never be able to get over witnessing things like that seeing them all smile and laugh. im the abnormal one the monster as my dad likes to call me im whats wrong with this family the transgender one that nobody likes that everyone much rather cover up and hide just like how they wanted me to hide when the landlord comes around. you know its funny how i came out because i didnt want to hide anymore because i thought that things would be better if i told the truth instead of living a lie and even though i feel better about myself and have been happier than i ever have before i still have the same problems where i feel that i dont belong in this family. maybe i really should hide again if only it was that easy to put on a mask and come up with a believable show that everyone would believe that i could convince myself to stop all this nonsense and pretend to be normal again so everyone would be happy with me so maybe id actually be loved by my parents and could finally have some sort of friends again. but i dont want to give up on myself after all ive done after this happiness that ive felt why should i go back? i just need to convince myself to keep holding onto the false hope again. things will get better this all will pass and someday ill be able to leave this chapter of my life behind. can it come true? will it really happen? i dont know and thats where my fears lie - not knowing what will happen next. this isnt a life and im certainly not living but im still desperately trying to survive and endure it all for as long as i can but how long is too long? i guess ill have to wait and see. as much as i want to scream and cry again and really try to tell my parents how i feel i know it wont help i just need to shut up and lie back in my corner where im rotting at. at least on the internet i can play these games where i can create a perfect life..

"I started university in September, and this is the first time I've come back to my childhood house for more than a few days since moving in September. While I was at uni, my parents became more distanced, and the promises they made (that they would come down to visit, and bring me food/take me out for meals) just never really happened - my parents brought down food (including things I didn't ask for and didn't want, and was charged for them), and on my way back after coming home for a long weekend my parents told me they had no intention of seeing me until my Christmas break (which was 5 weeks time).

Stupidly, I thought that when I came home for Christmas, that their attitude toward me would change. It's not. Particularly my mother, who has always been very affectionate toward me, has just seemed to stop caring. When she sees me, she just sighs at me and mutters under her breath, and if I try to speak to her, she just ignores me. When I went shopping with her, she also separated anything out that I may have eaten when we got to checkout, meaning that I'm buying my own food while I'm here. My father seems to try and tell me off for anything he can - that I watched one episode of a TV show on Netflix, and that I left a pair of shoes and coat in our cloakroom downstairs. I've taken to basically continuing to live out of the bag I took with me, because that way I'm not impeding at all in the house.

I've been back for less than two weeks, and I already know that I can't stand being here for another two weeks. It just feels like my parents no longer view me as their child, but as an interference in the life they've made in my absence. I wish I never came back here at all, because at least the physical isolation at university would hurt less than the rejection here.",I'm not sure why I even bothered to come home for Christmas,18nn14z,1703165292.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nn14z/im_not_sure_why_i_even_bothered_to_come_home_for/,
"I‚Äôve always felt things very intensely. I had a tough childhood where I didn‚Äôt get a lot of direct validation from my parents, my mother was struggling with addiction, and later I was bullied quite a bit for having weird interests and being socially immature in comparison to the rest of my peers (?) as in I enjoyed childish things and wasn‚Äôt very keen on social hierarchies that seemed perpetuated in my school environments. when I was like 11 I think I entered my first depressive episode because there was a lot going on. I had to be the new kid or like re-enter situations unceremoniously due to situations with my parents and step parents. It was really hard for me because I had no self esteem and it seemed like although I‚Äôve always been more self aware, wise, and intelligent (not sure if that‚Äôs the right word) for my age I was behind in math due to my rural education in comparison to moving to the city, so I just felt ugly, and stupid. and kids are super rude so it wasn‚Äôt a fun time. I think this followed me even to this day, the sense of being inherently lesser than my peers regardless of the circumstances. I attempted to take my life maybe 3-4 times in my life, but in ways that weren‚Äôt immediate like some methods that people commonly think about, so I feel like they are not really valid since it didn‚Äôt work lmfao. the worst of my mental illness, as in having no drive for life and engaging in self destructive and risky behaviour, and the height of my episodes spanned from the ages of 14-18. I am much better now!

In the current day I‚Äôm in my early 20s and I still feel like I don‚Äôt relate to people a lot of the time. I know that I can‚Äôt know everything about someone from first glance but I‚Äôm often put off by people. In university for example I just feel like I‚Äôve had such a wealth of negative experiences in comparison to other people from first glance. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I try and victimize myself on purpose ?? because I‚Äôve really grown a lot as it is inevitable.. I just notice things about people that directly confirms that they haven‚Äôt struggled like I have, and it makes me feel alienated. I feel like people must notice that something is wrong with me just like how I notice that there isn‚Äôt something wrong with them. Because of this I feel like I can only get along with someone if there is some sense of relatability, or if I can romanticize it (in regard to intimate relationships). I just feel like everyday I am trying to mask the sorrow I have lived through. And most of all I feel misunderstood. If I‚Äôm having bad days or get in a slump I really cannot do much other than get out of bed to piss and eat. and I just seem so lazy. But it seems like people don‚Äôt like to hear real reasons about my behaviour because it makes them uncomfortable, so it‚Äôs easier to assume I am making ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù on purpose. Even those closest to me get tired of hearing about my feelings and since I started medication and therapy my episodes have been less ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù so to speak, so I just feel like Im coasting through life with no outlet to express this feeling that seems to be inherently my own. I feel like I‚Äôve lost everything that use to bring me genuine joy in different chapters of my life, and I‚Äôm not sure how to find that feeling anymore.

"Hey Reddit, I (22M) have been noticing a shift in my relationship where my girlfriend hasn't been joining me on travels for the past few months. Historically, I've been the one planning most of our dates, but when I stopped, she didn't take the initiative it's been 4 months since we went on a date. We've had a few fights about this, and recently, when I brought up breaking up, she claimed she wants to surprise me. However, I suspect it might be a lie.

My mom is my only parent and living with her was horrible since she was always very abusive. Despite this, we still remain in touch (small talk maybe once or twice a month).
My mom plays the ""I love you and I miss you"" card every now and then, and says stuff like ""If I had the money to visit you I would.""

She can 100% do whatever she wants with her money but this - on top of many other things - clearly makes me feel pretty unloved. She is completely capable of buying a plane ticket (either for herself or for me) so that we can see each other, but she chooses to get a new toilet instead.

My bestfriend (22F) and I (19M) met on insta' because we liked the same game. I've seen one of her coms' on a post, and dm'd her, in a totally friendly way because i knew perfectly well she had a bf. We talked and instantly liked each other, because we found each other beautiful and mentally cool. Then, we got closer and confessed, and we were both healing ourselves with our new relationship. We both felt lonely and sad when we met, then our relationship was a real rainbow. She's really really into her bf, and that was totally okay for me of course because i was absolutely sure that i wasn't in love, and btw their relationship is really really healthy and good for them. But... It's been months, we didn't meet yet, and three days ago, she told me she loves her bf more than everything, but admitted she had felt a little love for me, not in a Friend way, but in a lover one... That day i realized i loved her too... We got closer and closer again, she had dreams bout' me, we're crazy bout each other, it's incredible how i love her. Today she called me ""my heart"" and i liked it so much.. but i'm scared, i don't want her to hurt her bf, we told each other we would just keep this little love flame to make our friendship better with more attention and more love, but nothing more, no love relationship.

"I was being abused by my school guidance counselor in middle school (not sexually but verbally (though one comment was degrading in a sexual manner due to me being queer) and sometimes physically)

I had a English teacher who literally helped me survive that year. I was in a class full of slackers and he always took interest in the books I was reading due to me being the only one in the class who actually read during free time. 

He would often bring me to his desk to discuss the books I was reading. 

After the abuse started I became extremely depressed and started missing a lot of school. 

When I actually was there he always had me come to his desk and I‚Äôd sit with him for the whole class. He‚Äôd also let me sit at his desk and read sometimes when other students were doing worksheets that he knew I‚Äôd pass through.

He saw me having a panic attack in the hall once and brought me into his room and had his current class do reading and just talked to me about my dog until I felt better. After that we often would chat about anything that made me happy. My dogs,fandoms I was into,music I liked. 

A couple times when my best friend was gone, I ate lunch with him. He also told me if I had a panic attack at school and felt unsafe, to let the office know and he‚Äôd come because during the first one he saw I kept telling him I wanted to go home and I wasn‚Äôt safe. However I never did tell the office because she would call me a faker. 

I sat with him and his wife instead of my peers on a school field trip because the counselor was with us and I was afraid of her, they made me feel safe. 

I had a panic attack on that field trip because she told me I had to sit with her on the way back to the school. He stepped in and told her absolutely not. I leaned on his shoulder and cried just a little bit, I think he knew something was wrong but I feel he assumed it was peers.

I never came out to him, but I %100 believe he knew I was gay based on conversations we had. I think he knew something was wrong and he just wanted to make me feel like I had someone I could come to. He never tried to touch me in anyway except that time I leaned on his shoulder, he didn‚Äôt say no but I think if he had told me no that day I‚Äôd have had a melt down. 

He ended up working at my high school years later as a sub. He also still let me sit at his desk and talk to him during class. But he was a sub so it wasn‚Äôt often I was even in his class. 

I‚Äôve regarded this man as my safe space during that school year, and now I have a friend insisting that he was grooming me and he‚Äôs disgusting and it‚Äôs made me realize maybe people are being too loose with the term or maybe I‚Äôm just dumb?

"So I'm not the most confident guy out there, I'm short and fat and not the smartest out there and due to some past events I suffer from extremely low self confidence and get distracted pretty easily which is affecting my studies. I'm in a very rigorous course which requires me to stay in classes and study atleast 10-12 hrs a day but all this is biting me.

Now there's this girl in my class and I really like her. I'll be honest I haven't had any female interaction my whole highschool life, I've just been bullied and used as a cash cow, and I haven't got any friends and never been in a relationship. My highschool friends have all moved to a different city like me and I'm all alone. I have people around me but I feel lonely. I am not they guy someone comes up to and talks unless I introduce myself and keep the conversation going. I never get invited to parties and stuff and no one really cares for me it's really difficult for me to fit in.

Back to her, I started talking to her and we talked for hours in the start about pretty emotional stuff. She did call me emotionally unavailable indirectly but it was a joke and now I might have revealed a lot of myself to her. Even when she used to call me wr talked for hours and I loved it as it was my first time getting attention from a girl. She is smart and cute.

Now, it isn't like it was. She never talks to me unless I talk to her first. She did call me for studies but one day I ignored her call and after that she just kept me in the sidelines. She used to hangout with me during breaks along with her best friend and we really hit it off she used to laugh at my jokes and just be happy around me. But now, in the class I'm alone, even in the breaks, she just goes out with her best friend and never invites me like I used to. Many times I'm with them and they're making plans but never ask me or include me so I act like I dont care scrolling through apps in my phone even though it's dry af. She also never laughs at my jokes now, and tends to pay more attention to other guys in the class, ik it's really petty but it makes me jealous. 

I can't possibly think what happened or what did I do which made her so distant from me, but now all I do is think about her and waste my time which I could have utilised on working on myself studies and exercise etc.

What am I supposed to do, all I think about is her and it really hurts me to the point I wanna cry, but she doesn't know. Even when I think that I should disclose my feelings for her, she would never be with a guy like me. She's wayyyy out of my league.

Now I'm scared because I think about her send her random messages and can't stop myself just waiting hours to see her reply, but I can clearly see she doesn't give a damn about me and I still am too hung up on her.

I just wanna stop thinking about her and start making my life better but I can't and since I have no actual friends I have no one to talk to. My parents and I aren't really this open and the guilt of wasting their money on eating junk food smoking and other shitty things gets me and hurts me a lot.

Also, the fact that everyone around me is in a relationship and losing their virginity ( which I'm scared about too cause I ain't big) is really pulling me back from my goals.

I also looked at therepy but it's too expensive and my parents are already spending a lot on my education and living I don't think they can possibly afford more.

"Hey, everyone. I'm Aleks, I'm seventeen years old. I'm autistic and struggling with BPD and major depression. I like movies, (especially these with Cillian Murphy, working out at the gym and reading books. I love walks as well.) 
I thought that I might as well start with (some positive) things about me before going straight to the bad stuff. I want you to know that I've been struggling with staying alive ever since a little kid. I'm a trans guy, and even as a wee child I had several attempts to get run over by a car. 
Eventually at the age of twelve I tried to overdose for the first time. My brother found me and I got to the hospital and got ""saved"". They almost put me to in a mental hospital for children, but there wasn't much space left and psychologist written in my papers that it was an accident caused by desperation because of my insomnia. My life got much worse as my mother stopped taking her medicine, I can't count how many times i was told that horrible things, she was making fun of my suicide attempts and my look, and that she regrets not going through with an abortion. 
I have three brothers that despise me, beat me up several times and never wanted to be around me. 
I locked myself in my head for several years, the only thing on my mind was gym. I kept going twice a day, struggling with school and being lonely as it's possible. I looked really good too. Then a year ago I met online a woman that's from US. She was looking for someone older to talk to, so I lied with my age, profession, name and almost everything. The thing is, that i introduced myself as someone that I always dreamed to be, but never could. 

I didn't plan it, but we stayed in touch to this day. I met an organisation that promised me pact with identity, and I was so desperate and in episodes everyday, that I accepted it and wanted to go through with it. I paid over ¬£10 000 this year for ""rituals"" that never happened even though I was promised that someone will come and pick me up. It never happened, and I desperately wanted to believe every excuse. I believed that my wishes to become that person will come true, and that I will be able to be with that woman. She waited for me for a year, and guilt and depression eats me alive. We're very much through the phone and through messages, and even that way she isn't able to handle me for the last month's because of my BPD episodes. 
I stopped going to the gym year ago, and gained 60 lbs. I look horribly, I feel horribly and my life is a mess. 
To pay these people, I borrowed a lot of money from my family convincing that I'm putting it on my investment account, and that by the end of December I'll take it all out and give it to them. 
The thing is, these people stopped contacting me and I don't have any money. Not a penny. My family excitingly waits for the money, completely ignoring all the signs that I've been showing. 

I have a best friend, his name is Loki and he's a rescue. I hate that he picked up on my depression, and shows almost the same signs as me. He's a mix, and a rescue that I got two years ago. 
So well. This year I had two attempts, one time it was nine packs of paracetamol and three energy drinks, (which did nothing besides ruining my liver) even though nobody knows about it. Second time was in may, and these were random heart and pills from my mother's cabinets and 0.7 of vodka. I slept for three days and then woke up like nothing happened. 
I was struggling, working and paying these people up to a couple days ago, and now they cut me off. I was supposed to get picked up on Tuesday which didn't happen, of course. 

But to the point!
I bought a rope, perfect rope for a suicide. Handles up to 300kg so even my fat self won't break it while hanging. I'm sitting in my room and watching my favourite movies that are starring Cillian Murphy and having as much fun as I can. 
Going on walks with my dog and writing. 

Oh, for several months I was writing on Tumblr as well! If anyone from here was reading Cillian Murphy fan fiction there, then they probably know me. I won't let you know my nick unfortunately. (I have over 1600 followers!)

Anyway, I'm trying to get some positivity for the last days of my life before going, so If you'd like to talk, joke or even talk on the phone, say it in the comments!

I'll let y'all know that it's not only a thought anymore, and I'm not backing off from it. It's silly of me to say it when I was also trying very much to save a couple people here, but I get the reality. 
I wish I could leave a pic of my dog, but the community here doesn't allow it. We'll, I tried!
Much love, Aleks!",A little write down before I go.,18nlq7j,1703161043.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nlq7j/a_little_write_down_before_i_go/,

My brother(23) and his baby momma(20) had my niece a few months ago, since a month after she was born my brother has been living with me and God it's been a journey.  He basically lives off of my couch(he does pay rent, thank God, nothing else tho, not even groceries). He does nothing but go to his friends and sesh or play video games. He sees his daughter maybe once a month if he's lucky because the baby momma only let's him come around when her mom isn't around.       They split even though they are 'technically' still together,  as they say even though they never see eachother because her mom forbids it. My brother and her use to live with her mom and she still does.  The mom is the defention of single mom biker ho and baby momma is the definition of cradled spoiled white girl so she does whatever her mother wants including not letting my brother see his kid.  Mind you both of them forget my brother is autistic and has temper issues, always has and he's sometimes hard to deal with because he's unmedicated that sometimes my brother needs a lot of extra work when it comes to communication, and sometimes there's a lot of unnecessary arguing mind you a lot of the reasons aren't reasons he should be unable to see his kid or let any of his family see his daughter and be in her life. I haven't seen her since she was a month old I think. It's sad because I use to have a relationship with the bm but it's hard to even want to do that, when she does this and continues to do whatever her mother wants. Anytime we ask to see her, oh I'm busy, oh we're sick and have covid and can't but mind you like two days later you can go support your mother in the hospital for a month in a city over an hour away continuing to forbid my brother from seeing his child or helping in any way unless he comes to you and spends time with you there and nothing else. Can't leave your mothers side for longer then a day because she needs this or needs that. The reason why her mother got herself there in the first place was from Drunk driving in her brand new car she just got after having her last brand new car replaced. And she somehow got away with drunk driving? and the entire time her daughter was saying oh she was drugged because she never drinks that much! So this one time she couldn't have had a couple of more drinks? Regardless of what happened, she still decided to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and could have killed a family but you know let's excuse that. luckily this happened late at night.
Anyways, I know my brother isn't perfect. he's the furthest from it, he's a deadbeat like my father, he's exactly like my father but worse. Atleast he tries to see his kid but if he doesn't see her, oh well?  and this all drivers me absolutely nuts because my fianc√©e and I have been ttc for over a year, I told my brother we were ttc last year, less than a month later he told me she was pregnant. and a couple months after that he said to me, 'the only reason I got her pregnant was so spite you' and it always sits in the back of my head.  I miss my niece and I'm sad because people shouldn't be able to use children as pawns.","Some people shouldn't have children, Unorganized rant",18nlpu0,1703161006.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18nlpu0/some_people_shouldnt_have_children_unorganized/,

"I have embraced my bisexuality for a considerable duration, yet to assert that everything is seamless in navigating this aspect of my identity would be a falsehood. The jests from my friends, though seemingly innocuous, harbor a sting that I bear in silence. My family, attempting to be discreet, avoids delving too deeply into the topic. Despite my efforts to conceal my orientation, people claim to sense ""gay vibes"" emanating from me, rendering concealment an elusive choice.  
However, my current struggle transcends these challenges. There is a boy in my life, known to me for quite some time now. Since our initial encounter, I have found myself captivated by his charm, confidence, kindness, and overall brilliance. Regrettably, he identifies as straight, dashing any hopes of a romantic connection between us. Though he is not an intimate confidant, our recent interactions have become strained, making it difficult for us to communicate openly.  
My thoughts are consumed by him, and closure has become my sole desire. I am contemplating the prospect of confessing my feelings, recognizing that this might jeopardize the friendship we share.

"I (26M) broke up with my ex (20F) after about 10 and a half months into our relationship. It‚Äôs been nearly 2 months since

To give a bit of context about us, we met at work ,as stated we do have an age gap and we were each others first relationship. I was initially very hesitant but as we got to know each other and she insisted I had finally decided to ask her out and it was genuinely the most perfect date anyone could have and still to this day even with our breakup, one of my greatest cherished memories. I‚Äôll be honest in saying that I won‚Äôt say much in this actual post but will be more than willing to talk about certain incidents from the past in the comments over time. Either way it‚Äôs still gonna be a long one

So yeah me and my ex broke up and it was obviously not great, I did it over the phone and what shocked me is that she wasn‚Äôt sad but rather was angry, she had cussed me out and I could hear her hitting something. The thing that hurts is that I went into the call wanting to amend us and work through things but knew that if I had gone to her house it wouldn‚Äôt have been a mutual environment as her mum would‚Äôve been there too. I had sent her a large text explaining how I was feeling about everything, about her, about me, about us and we decided that when we had the time we‚Äôd call. To this day I believe that there is trauma that has negatively affected her trust and insecurities, yet she refuses to work through them. During this time and the call I offered that we could go to counselling, not just for her issues but also to help work through us but she refused. I asked her and said that for us to keep working that I would want from her a concrete way of knowing that she was getting help for herself. She stumbled over herself and said points she had said in the past that I had realised were empty and only to appease me. It was then I decided to breakup with her. To give some reasoning, she has huge trust issues and insecurities involving men based on trauma from her past and it had gotten to a point where I was tricking myself into believing that I was at fault for things and she was constantly arguing with me , we were essentially having a fight every week. I broke up with her at the time because I knew deep down as much as I loved her we needed to seperate. 

As previously said she didn‚Äôt take the breakup well and on the same day was calling me a creep for still having photos of her on my phone, was being petty with gifts that I had gotten her and things I had left at her house and so on. When I finally had gotten my clothes back she had sprayed her perfume on it so that I was reminded of her. Now again there is an age gap and for all I know this type of behaviour could be accounted slightly with her age but I‚Äôm not sure. As I said before we still to this day work with each other and tho the first week or two was dreadful with it being bad enough that a manager had to essentially warn her to calm down a bit, since then it‚Äôs been ok. Simply put we ignore each other and only talk if we really need to for work, even then it‚Äôs really basic stuff just helping customers etc. I still feel hurt with how she looks at me almost with like a sense of pain or mild disgust sometimes, she doesn‚Äôt look at me if I have to ask her for something and so on, I can‚Äôt lie it‚Äôs not the easiest sometimes. 

The part that sucks is that there are two sides to her, there is the one I fell in love with, intelligent, funny, beautiful, charming and so on but there is another side to her that is the opposite and what sucks is that of course no one from work knows some of the times she put me through and for me admittedly it can hurt and be frustrating. The time between the breakup and now at least for me has been filled with a lot of introspection and times sitting alone staring at the ceiling thinking about what both she and I could‚Äôve done better in the relationship and for the most part I‚Äôm actually quite at peace with things, not to say that they‚Äôre good but rather that obviously in life we can‚Äôt control everything and things will be what they are. 

That being said there‚Äôs this part that eats away at me, I guess it‚Äôs a sense of closure. I want to have a heart to heart talk with her and let her know that I didn‚Äôt break up with her to hurt her but that I truly believed we were hurting ourselves and each other and that a separation was the best thing to do for both of us. I want her to know that I don‚Äôt hate her and that I still do care for her, she had some health problems that I hope are being sorted out for example. I hope her family is doing well, I hope she‚Äôs eating properly and I‚Äôm genuinely happy for her because it seems like some things she‚Äôs getting on track, she has some friends at work that she‚Äôs hanging out with and she‚Äôs drinking water which I know sounds silly but yeah like I‚Äôm really glad. Essentially it looks like she‚Äôs doing some things that if she had done in our relationship like getting more of a life for herself and figuring things out maybe we would‚Äôve worked out better. I still believe that her denial of her problems during our relationship was like a defence mechanism because it meant she could essentially run away from her problems. To add to that I would say the two things she lacked the most in our relationship were empathy and accountability. 

Apologies for my rambling, essentially we broke up because I think for her she was never ready to be in a relationship for multiple reasons, she obsessed over control of us and ultimately it lead to our downfall. But here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs been 2 months and yet I still have this belief that we could work out, because when the times were good it was like I find my soulmate truly, we have a lot of shared interests and beliefs and we enjoyed doing a lot of the same things and in my head I wanted to never be with anyone else, I was going to marry her one day, that‚Äôs how in love I was. Maybe I‚Äôm clinging onto that hope but even if it‚Äôs like a 1% chance I believe there‚Äôs a reality where she realises that the first step to working though problems is to realise that she has them and that she gets the help she needs, and that‚Äôs somehow we rekindle what we had with a version of her that knows her worth and believes in herself. 

I guess I just ask if I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that we could still work out, that I still believe in us.

"Tik tok is literal brain rot. All these teenagers spend their lives scrolling and scrolling while feeding themselves pointless information and following all these shitty trends.

"30f. She is a good person. We have been friends for 15 yrs.
I think we have drifted apart.

She over stays at my home. Last time I told her to leave in 4 days. She wanted to extend it for 7-8 days. And This was going on for every month for 2-3 yrs. 3-4 months back I told her let‚Äôs meet after 2 months gap. How to put boundaries around this? I don‚Äôt want her to stay over atall.

I want to make my dependence on her less. I call her when I am feeling angry or want to vent. I have depression and I am in therapy. 
I don‚Äôt like that she wears my cloths, she over uses my cloths. I don‚Äôt use her cloths because they are not my type. I buy mid range clothes( sometimes expensive) and she asks for it to wear it. I can‚Äôt wear anyone‚Äôs expensive cloths as I feel I might not be able to take care of it. Also I don‚Äôt like she doesn‚Äôt handle her clothes properly. She doesn‚Äôt buy anything expensive, she keeps buying cloths from street vendors. She is earning well now. But she has financial truma growing up. Hence she is frugal. 
I feel judged. She is frugal. I am not. I know she trys not to judge me. But I still feel it. 
Even her excitement triggers me. Excited for everything. We don‚Äôt have any common interests now. 
She is very observant. And make judgments, not in a mean way, but how they are not in a good situation and should get out. She does this to our common 2 friends who are married. She projects her lifestyle of not giving a fuck on to others. Even me, you should do this and that. It comes from a place of love and concern. But for me it feels like my narc sister and my dad.

"Share ko lang. Kung kailan ako nagmove out sa bahay namin at lumayo sa parents ko. Saka kami naging close. Sinubukan ko talaga simula ng taon na to na maging mas expressive pa at verbal sa pagiging affectionate. Dati kasi nahihiya ako magsabi ng ""I love you"" dala ng minsan nakakaaway ko sila. Tapos nung college, kahit magkasama kami sa iisang bahay, iniiwasan ko sila at di kami naguusap masyado.

Sobrang daming nangyari sakin nitong taong ito. Masaya lang ako na natututo na rin magreply ang Papa ko sakin ng "" I love you too"".

"Idk if this is the right sub for this but...
I am very fascinated about modern pop culture from the 50s onwards and I die inside when people get it wrong on which decade a certain thing/media belongs to.

We have this upcoming Christmas party at my job and the theme was supposed to be ""80s"". I got really excited a little cuz it's the only time I could dress up as a cock rocker. Then it changed to ""80s """"""formal"""""""" "" cuz I think they mistook Miami Vice-like nightclub getup for formal, but yeah I am okay with it. I could still jokingly dress up as a European electronic musician around that time.

But then when the countdown for the party is near, it was changed again to ""70s retro"" but they meant cramming 70s and 80s together and it does not help that the banner edited has a fucking Game Boy Color and one of the ghosts in Pacman in it, also the 80s neon aesthetic is still there. Also there would be dance numbers that are not from that theme. Like I will fucking dance to Deja Vu dressed up like fucking Bono. That's how fucking stupid it is.

I'm sorry I just can't fucking take it. It saddens me when they get everything wrong about it.

"I'm generally a very chill, positive 'can do' person - at least outwardly most of the time (we all have our demons!). If I want to do something, usually I'll do it - or at least attempt it. I've fallen on my face plenty of times!  

In the last ten years, I've lived in four different countries, started a business, and completed some big adventure-type goals. This didn't happen overnight. Until I was around 25, I wanted to do these things but always came up with excuses why it wasn't possible for me. Until one day I just thought 'F it' and booked the one-way flight. And everything has been different since.

However, I've now got a few people in my life who keep asking me for life advice (I don't claim to be an expert in anything, I just do my thing) and keep ignoring it - but keep coming back for more. 

I've known both of these people for many years - they both have decent first-world lives - enough money, a nice house, nice families, one is married with kids, the other has a stack of money she made from property development. They don't know each other for context, but they are so similar in how they deal with life I'm beginning to think it's a me thing.

**They have a problem for every solution.** 

One wants to change jobs (she's on her third job in four years) as she hates it, and keeps asking me what to do. I've told her if it was me I would look for a new job and quit. And until then I would treat the job like an income source and nothing else - don't get involved in work dramas, don't get emotionally invested etc. 

She's done the opposite to all of this. 

She still calls me weekly to give me drama on her boss and her colleagues - asking what she should do about them. I basically stonewall her when she does this but it makes no difference. She's even had customers at her current job offer her amazing roles (as she is very good at what she does!) and she's come up with a million excuses why she can't or why it wouldn't work. This week she asked me if I knew any career coaches as she's so lost in it all. I don't, but through some contacts, I found some and sent her the info. She didn't even acknowledge the message.

The other wants to start a business similar to what I've done. So I gave her the full playbook that got me where I am with the caveat that every new business is its own thing. She didn't take more than 10% on board and just assumed it wasn't applicable to her. A year later she has a failing business. The problem is she doesn't want to put in the work. She's since read Rich Dad Poor Dad and thinks that income should come with minimal work. Now she's given up on the business and is asking constantly for general life advice, yet ignoring everything I say. 

It's so frustrating. I would consider both of these people friends - not super close friends, but enough that it pains me to see them constantly getting in their own way and going in circles. And the constant asking for and ignoring advice is getting more than a little tiring. 

Anyway just wanted to get that off my chest without sounding like a privileged asshole to anyone in real life...!

"I‚Äôm currently unable to sleep bc of a traumatic event that happened earlier today. I was followed home and I‚Äôm unsure of what steps to take next to secure my safety. I‚Äôve had awful encounters but none like this.

My bf (26m) and I (23f) met up in our separate cars after work to go thrifting. As we were headed home, he took a different route than I did to stop by and get gas. As I was a few blocks away from my house I noticed a blue truck following close behind me. It‚Äôs important to mention my car has hello kitty bumper stickers that gives people a big clue a young girl drives my car. I felt bad that I was driving slow bc of the rain and it was night time so I changed lanes to let him pass but he changed lanes with me. I thought it was odd so I changed lanes back and he followed. I sped up and so did he. I thought this was all so weird but coincidental and since I was only a block away from my house I thought I would be okay to pull into my driveway but when I did that same blue truck pulled in with me blocking me from reversing out. I immediately panicked and knew something was very wrong. I began to back up hoping he would move and he did but he parked right on the street and watched me from my car. I knew he was waiting for me to get out. I tried taking a photo but due to the rain it was hard to see. I called my boyfriend and told him to hurry home bc I was being followed. I was hoping the blue truck was there picking up a friend or maybe was doing a three point turn but he just waited for me to get out my car which I never did. After being parked out there for no more than 5 minutes he finally drove off. I waited until my bf got home a few minutes later to get out of my car. 

I‚Äôm also upset that my boyfriend didn‚Äôt seem to understand the severity of the situation and decided to hang up our call during the ordeal and instead of driving up to our driveway (we live in apartments and only have one parking spot that I use) and making sure I was okay, he parked on the street a block away and walked to my parking spot with out calling back. He said he didn‚Äôt think the situation was that bad so he decided to park like normal on the street. We got in an argument about how I was scared for my safety and felt disappointed that he didn‚Äôt take the situation more seriously and the argument got very heated and he said very awful things like ‚Äúfuck you and I hate you‚Äù during the argument which came out of left field bc I was expressing how I felt upset he didn‚Äôt take the situation more seriously. 

He‚Äôs currently asleep in bed and I can‚Äôt fall asleep bc I keep thinking about the what ifs and since my apartment isn‚Äôt gated I‚Äôm scared of the blue truck man coming back and trying to target me again. I live in a sketchy neighborhood so I know police won‚Äôt do much to help since I have no pictures of the guy and no proof of anything. I‚Äôm just very shaken up by the situation and I‚Äôm hoping he doesn‚Äôt come back and I‚Äôm very upset my boyfriend didn‚Äôt take the situation seriously and got offended that I said such. I‚Äôm alone in this and haven‚Äôt been comforted about the situation by my boyfriend so it feels very overwhelming. My main concern is the man coming back. What can I do to unsure my safety and peace of mind?

"I don‚Äôt want to hate my mom, I love her a lot actually, but she‚Äôs one of two people I trusted to tell about my sexual assault, which was from my brother, and her initial reaction(after apologizing for not helping) was to tell me that I may have ‚Äòremembered things wrong‚Äô.

"To preface, my family is proudly of a different culture. My siblings and I were raised in this culture despite not living in our home country and I am deeply grateful to my parents for that. My cultural identity is what kept me stable throughout my teenage years as it gave me a foundation to build off of while I figured out who I was. My siblings and I all learned how to speak our native tongue and English with no problems whatsoever and all of us are now well-educated, successful adults.

My boyfriend of 6 years is not big on traveling, but early on in our relationship I made it clear that it was extremely important to me that we travel to my family‚Äôs home country at least a few times during our lives so that he and our kids can meet my extended family and familiarize themselves with the culture I love so much. I also made it clear that any kids I have would be learning my native tongue and, in order to facilitate this, I would be speaking that language to them during their developmental years. He agreed to this.

However, very recently, my boyfriend has been going back on these agreements. We do not have kids, but, today, he said that speaking exclusively in my native tongue to our kids would be ‚Äúchild abuse‚Äù as it would developmentally ‚Äústunt‚Äù and confuse them (which is a massively damaging myth). He also said he would never travel to my country with me, nor will our kids, as it was too expensive, stressful, and time-consuming.

I didn‚Äôt know how to feel, really. I felt lied to, honestly. Insulted, too. Teaching *my* kids about *their* culture is child abuse? *What?*

He has also become very hostile towards my religion, too. I knew he didn‚Äôt want to raise any kids in my religion, which I was fine with, but the outright hostility is starting to get to me. He seems to *hate* my religion. He also disagrees with me on how our potential kids‚Äô education should look like. It truly feels like he hates every single idea I have regarding how our kids should be raised.

This feels like I‚Äôve had the rug pulled out from under me, since I thought all of that was settled. He told me I was ‚Äúbeing emotional‚Äù after I got upset and claimed that he had always felt that way and that he wants our kids to be raised exclusively in our country's culture. I don‚Äôt want that. I want my kids to know my culture, see my family's home country, and feel connected to that part of who they are.

I'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm not even sure how I feel. I just feel bad. Can this be fixed or compromised through? Or is this indicative of the end? My culture is the foundation of who I am. It has been (and always will be) a non-negotiable. I will not take that strong identity away from my future children, because I want them to have the culturally rich childhood I had. But I love my boyfriend and I was planning a future with him.

I‚Äôm gonna need to have a discussion with him about this. But, for now, I‚Äôll just put this out here to get all of these feelings out. They feel like a roiling sea of goo and misery in my stomach right now.",My boyfriend said something upsetting today and I don‚Äôt know how to feel.,18njp6l,1703153360.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18njp6l/my_boyfriend_said_something_upsetting_today_and_i/,

"On September 30th this year my grandma died from brain, breast and lung cancer.  At the ripe age of 71, she was a the strongest person I‚Äôve ever known. My grandpa was having a very rough time getting it through his head that she was in fact dying. He would get mad at hospice for saying she didn‚Äôt have much time, 2 weeks. In fact it was less than 24 hours she was gone, luckily I was able to say goodbye to her and her body before they took her away. 


When she passed he looked at us and said ‚ÄúIs she dead?‚Äù In the most wary voice. Straight faced, wouldn‚Äôt look at her nor speak. Didn‚Äôt cry, not a tear in sight. We had the funeral, he was sleeping at the table for almost 1 1/2 months he wouldn‚Äôt go to bed. He went to the hospital for heart failure (he had a pacemaker and a triple bypass already), about a week goes by it‚Äôs almost my grandmas 2 month anniversary. He‚Äôs acting strange, finally on November 30th we get a call from the hospital reporting his death at the age of 66. 


The nurses said he was screaming aloud ‚ÄúI just want to die, please let me die‚Äù, he had many tubes in him. He had this one in his neck connected to his artery because they were shutting down again. Grabbed ahold of ALL of his tubing and started ripping them out. Blood was everywhere, he bled out and entered cardiac arrest. That was it. Gone in two months.


I‚Äôm devastated (28f btw), I know it was because his heart was broken. 46 years together and couldn‚Äôt take 2 months, I don‚Äôt blame him, I‚Äôm not mad at him, I don‚Äôt hate him and I do forgive him.

"During Uni, I had a crush on a person. Incidentally I became a close friend to them and after a while I decided to shoot my shot. Got rejected. Which wasn't a surprise since I knew it won't work out, partially due to how I behaved, and cause they weren't just into me.  
  
Now this is where my major fuckup starts. I chose to remain friends. Both of us were single so we became even closer as friends, sharing the most intricate details of our day to day life. And I was happy. Over the years, around 4 - 5, I moved away from my feelings. I did not see that person as a potential partner, just as a good friend. They became a major part of my everyday, apparently a lot bigger part than I realised.  
  
Few month back, both of us moved cities. Due to that and some other circumstances, our conversations died down. I wasn't too troubled by that, thinking I had moved on, and it was a natural thing to happen since we had new things in our lives. Few days back, I got to know they were dating someone now.  
  
It was like a sucker punch. My heart just sank the moment I heard that. The heartbreak that I avoided by staying friends finally hit me. And holy shit batman, it hurts so bad. I thought I had moved on, knew and accepted them dating someone was just a matter of time. Despite all that it hurts. I don't really know what I'm feeling. Food tastes shit and there is this constant droning sadness that just wont go away. A big part of my life went away as we stopped talking, the realisation just hit me late. Where do I send my cringey memes? Whom do I rant about my minor inconviniences? With whom do I celebrate my small wins? Fuck, it feels so empty.

"I am a woman and I live in an apartment building. There are mostly men who live here.

There have been multiple noise complaints against me for months now, something about an exhaust fan or a fan operating at all kinds of hours...during the day, after 11PM... that kind of thing.

This all came to a head when I heard a bunch of loud music on the weekend, slamming of doors and just a lot of hostility below me. It started to trigger my PTSD because my father was very verbally abusive towards me and behaved in the same way.

I was pacing in my apartment because my anxiety was at an all time high. I finally heard someone storming up the stairs, opening the door very quickly, kicked my door as loud and as angry as possible and said ""TURN OFF YOUR FKNG FAN!"" and i'm there, frozen, crying, saying ""I don't have a fan!"" and then the response was ""YES YOU DO, YOU C\*NT!"".

I called my mom, called the police and then my mom came over, the police came over and they told us to not contact each other and that if he does this again, I need to call them right away.

This individual has taken keys to the utility room and my internet has already been disconnected twice, apparently it was deliberate according to the tech person.

I feel unsafe in my own home, the housing provider is doing very little to reassure me I am safe. This man has openly admitted to someone else that he will target people and make their lives hell. I am so terrified to be home. I have tried literally everything and i'll be calling additional resources. I really truly wish I could do more for myself because no one should have to live in constant fear that they're going to be harmed or k!lled. This is my reality right now and I simply do not know what to do.

I am so scared.

"I met a girl name ‚ÄúA‚Äù on Yubo About August 18, 2020. We have began to get to know each other and we were FaceTiming by the 21st. At the time I was in an extremely abusive and toxic relationship I had felt stuck in for a while. A and I started flirting and she even made me a playlist. She made me feel love my current girlfriend Paris couldn‚Äôt even attempt to. On august 29th I attempted to leave Paris.
Paris asked me to sleep on the phone with her one last time. Then Persuaded/ Manipulated me into staying with her. I really hurt A, I told her I left parts, then all of a sudden was like ‚Äúnever mind I couldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù This was a huge mistake causing a lot of mistrust from A to me down the line. Things were a little rough between A and I but we stayed friends. Paris and i broke up December 9th of 2020 and by the next day I was flirting with A again. We opened up more to each other and things were definitely going somewhere. Then on the 13th she told my friend we were ‚Äújust friends‚Äù when I had her ask. Which it was stupid of me to do that in the first place but cmon. According to A she was self sabotaging then. A and I were still friends after it all. Paris and i were back together by Christmas and things stayed that way till March 19th, 2021. In November of 2022 A said a few suggestive things to me and kinda flirted and I started resurfacing feelings. I told her and she said she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt reciprocate my feelings‚Äù. She later told me she was actually talking to someone at the time. Yet again we were friends until June 14ish 2023. I was dating a guy I had been with for 4 months, he wasn‚Äôt showing as much interest anymore and was overall being pretty bad to me. I was speculating he was cheating too. I was on FaceTime with A and I randomly blurted out ‚ÄúI never fell out of love with you‚Äù she had been in a longgg relationship with a shitty guy who cheated on her for a while so I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was ready but she seemed happy and asked for more details haha. Turns out her sister had a baby shower coming up and she was gonna come to the state she lived to surprise her. Just so happens to be the same state I live in and only 2 hours away. She told me about halfway through the day she was going to be coming to spend the night with me!! This was my first time meeting A!! She lives 8+ hrs away. Meeting her was amazing!! We had a good night with great conversations. She brought me her flannel when I was cold in the kitchen and it was adorable. She told me I was everything she expected and more. Her ex got into a car accident while she was at my house, not good. We were going to watch Howls moving castle but I told her about my cousins alcohol in the freezer and she wanted to drink so we did. We also listened to music and talked. We cuddled too lol. Eventually she was on top of me giving me Eskimo kisses. If you asked me how we got here. I couldn‚Äôt tell you. Eventually I just said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so close you might aswell‚Äù and you can imagine how that went. No we didn‚Äôt fuck but we had a good night and fell asleep cuddling. She kept trying to convince me to leave my bf and compared him to her ex. She thought he was cheating on me and was almost trying to reassure me he was so I‚Äôd leave him. I made sad excuses and just didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave something I was sure I was safe-ish in for something I‚Äôd never fully committed too and wasn‚Äôt sure if it was real. It seemed too good to be true. We cuddled and held hands all night then talked all day till she had to leave at 2 the next day. After she was home she seemed a little shallow but i just brushed it off. 3 days later I was ready to leave my bf and I told her I was going too. For her. She told me not too unless I was gonna do it to work on myself. My world fell apart in front of me. She made me fall out of love with my boyfriend just to want her with everything in me. And not want me anymore. That week we FaceTimed and we were still close, even making plans on living together. Then she got really dry. Our texts were rare and we got snappy with each other a couple of times. eventually I had asked her to call me to tell her something important and she was like ‚Äúwhy is it so important you tell me of all people‚Äù and it really wasn‚Äôt I needed to tell all of my friends and I told her that. She said she hadn‚Äôt felt like my friend in a while then she stopped texting me back. I texted her a few times just trying to figure out what happened. I had seen on her instagram she posted someone a couple of times but she wouldn‚Äôt really confirm the identity until she did and it was her Ex. They were back together. I wrote about/too her in my journal and sent it to her as a last ditch effort to reach out but to no avail. I stopped trying to contact her. Then on September 27th, 2023 I posted to instagram pictures with the caption ‚Äúur stubborn‚Äù quoting Limp bizkit in ‚Äúbehind blue eyes‚Äù and she goes and comments ‚Äúunbothered* I comment back ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really that self centered to think this was about you?‚Äù Then my friend texts her, they start arguing, then my cousin starts arguing with her, and my cousin‚Äôs boyfriend jumps in, so then her bf jumps in and they are going FERRAL. Saying some funny ass shit esp to justin abt him being a cheater but avery was acting like someone I‚Äôve never seen before. She called me crazy and obsessive. Accused my cousin of also making out with me. I stayed out of the conversation until I got home and had time to journal out what to say then wrote her a paragraph. She said i was ‚Äúangy‚Äù then blocked me. She‚Äôs only posted Twice to TikTok since it all and only one‚Äôs actually a video of her when she used to post regularly. She‚Äôs made 2 new spotify playlists (oh she still hasn‚Äôt deleted my playlist) but ones just Halloween music but the other is titled ‚Äúlittle star‚Äù and she used to call me ‚Äútiny‚Äù idk if that correlates but the playlist is full of sad songs and instrumentals. Some songs talking about females and others missing people, etc.
I miss her but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I really that crazy. She‚Äôs the only person who I‚Äôve never felt judged by until now that is. She‚Äôs literally perfection.

"The problem with us is that the highs are very high and the lows are so very low. When he's good he makes me feel like I'm the only woman to have ever been truly loved. And then seasonal depression hits and he completely abandons me and leaves me in the dark. I've always been quite introverted and literally have no other friends, so when this happens I don't even have someone to vent to.

I have been working up to 12 hours a day in the past few months, and he's been home just keeping busy. And when I do finally come home he prefers to continue gaming or find something else to not even acknowledge my existence. I've always tried to give him all the ""alone time"" he needs, but this feels different when I don't even know where I stand. I don't know if he hates me and I need to leave or he loves me and is just numb and I need to stay and help him. 

It's been 4 years of these extreme mood changes. He's always had depression, but during fall and winter it's just 10 times worse. It takes days and days of me begging for him to do a simple task for himself like making a phone call or something. Sex life is basically nonexistent and even when I try to initiate something I immediately get turned down which feels awful. He sometimes leaves me notes or letters describing how he's done with life and how he's going to end his life. It's extremely stressful. I spend all my waking hours worried he might do something while I'm away. I beg him to see a therapist and have made appointments multiple times, but he never once goes through with the process. He won't see a therapist even once for a change because he thinks there's nothing wrong with this cycle and that he's just now able to see life as it is. It's frustrating. 

Then he starts feeling better and he gets all romantic again and tries to ""make up"" for what he's done and promises to fix everything. He suddenly becomes the perfect partner planning a wedding and managing everything around the house. He promises he will take care of me and that he will never do anything to hurt me. Then once again fall rolls and his brilliant idea is to dump me because ""I don't deserve you.""

until the events of a few months ago where my dad's wife cheated on my dad with one of my dad's workers who ended up being a somewhat dangerous person and the woman and my dad ended up divorcing.

"When you don't have a pretty face, you'll always get rejected. Especially if you have a mental health issue too, that sometimes stems from being rejected all the time because of your looks. You see, it's a constant loop.

I watched my classmates at school being admired by the opposite sex. Receiving attention, getting gifts at Valentines day, getting a second chance to rewrite an exam all because of their good looks.

I was bullied because of my looks and it made me socially awkward too, because I was scared of socializing or even trusting people.

They had a separate group chat where they filmed me or took pictures without me knowing about it and laughed..

And you never get to experience what is like being loved by someone else. What it's like to be wanted. What it's like to be in a relationship. What it's like to receive attention from the opposite sex.

It really hurts. It's like you never get a chance to win. And if you work hard, someone better looking is always going to be preferred.

One time I decided that I need a relationship and I had a long distance relationship with a guy, where we would face time and send selfies with each other. It was on and off for about 2 years and then he came back to our home country and decided to meet me. After our date he said that I don't look like the pictured and dropped me like it's nothing.

And it happened the second time too. And the third...

It's like you don't have a choice.

And now I'm once again chatting with a guy who will reject me in the future like all of them do.

But I don't want to live that way anymore. I pretend that I'm alright. Each day I say affirmations to myself. I do my job. I listen to podcasts. I'm planning to take yoga classes or something. I love reading science literature. The more busy I get, the more I forget about not being good looking. I'll get a plastic surgery too in the future once I have the money. Life goes on.

Two condoms about five or six pumps each. And he did warn me so that isn‚Äôt truly what pissed me off/ made me regret it. What did is the fact he first lied about the first condom being ‚Äúoff‚Äù and then claimed he had a pulled muscle and couldn‚Äôt continue. And I tried to believe him, but the evidence in the condoms made it impossible to.

So okay fine he‚Äôs embarrassed, I can understand. I know some men get embarrassed about that type of thing. But the after math? He ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt‚Äù know where he threw my underwear, immediately started texting his ‚Äúbromance‚Äù about meeting up and the worse part? Started watching and laughing at people hurting/clicking delete on themselves. Like what???

"Not looking for advice just had the most mental year of my life and wanted to share it. Going to be long so will need to continue in the comments. 

I (24F) was in a very loving and committed relationship with my boyfriend (35M) for nearly two years, I was 100% certain he was the love of my life, he was crazy about me and would move mountains to make me happy. He lived for making my life better and I always tried to be the same for him. There was a bit of an age difference obviously and we were at very different stages in life but we complimented each other so well, I brought a bit more fun and adventure to his life and he brought more grounding and stability and peace into mine, we loved each other so much and made each other happier than we even knew was possible. The honeymoon stage never went away and I just got more and more excited for the life we had planned. 

I was at quite a restless stage in my life and felt like there was so much I hadn‚Äôt done that I wanted to do before we settled down and began the rest of our lives, and I made a slightly spontaneous decision to move to Australia for a year. Obviously I spoke with him before I decided anything, listened to how he felt about it and took his thoughts into consideration. I knew it was a big ask to do long distance from opposite sides of the planet for so long but he was supportive and happy for me and told me I should do it and that we‚Äôd be okay. 

I left in March and I was devastated to leave him but very excited. We called every day and he was happy to see me doing something for myself. About a week after I arrived I was raped and I was incredibly shaken up to say the least, especially being so far from home completely alone. I wasn‚Äôt going to tell my boyfriend or anybody else but he became annoyed when I didn‚Äôt respond to him the whole day I was in the hospital so I had to tell him everything. He was heartbroken and he was so so kind and caring with me. He stayed on the phone with me for hours on end despite the time difference and spoke to me till I managed to sleep. He begged me to fly home so he could look after me but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it for the feeling of defeat. He flew out to Australia a week later instead and I was so grateful and felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve his kindness and love.

He was so caring and supportive at first but he became very angry and hostile over the course of the two weeks he was here. He couldn‚Äôt accept that I wouldn‚Äôt report the incident (the investigation would take longer than my visa and I didn‚Äôt want to spend my time here going through that) and started to take his anger towards the man out on me. I ended up spending most of the trip comforting him rather than the other way around. We fought every day, he yelled and said some cruel things and I ended up wishing he hadn‚Äôt come and that I‚Äôd never told him what happened. On his last day we had a long talk and smoothed things over. I realised he only felt such strong anger because he cared so much and he apologised for the way he‚Äôd treated me and cried a lot. We agreed that we loved each other and that this couldn‚Äôt get in the way of that. We said goodbye at the airport and I cried all the way back to the city, but I was still as certain as ever that we were meant for each other and that we‚Äôd get through anything.

Now, this cousin is visiting, and she wants to go to the gym with me. She is just almost my age so everything I do she wants to do with me.

She barely graduated middle school, still lives at home. Literally cannot install an app onto her phone without me. And does not know how to set up a hotspot on her phone. does not konw how to navigate sourroundings, needs me to bring her back and forth. I believe her IQ is below 80 or 90. It's probably a mixture of strong antidepressants(superstrong), and bad trauma from an abusive school, and a tumor in her brain. She has always had problems with her physical health too, constantly in pain and doctors find nothing.

I'm not saying this to say she is bad or anything. Noneof this is my fault. But the entire family is dusguising it and the mum pushes us to have a eye-to-eye relationship. Sorry. My gym-time is sacred, I have my friends there. I do my training. no time to babysit. We are just not equal. I'm studying at a top10 uni (worldwide) on scholarship. We are not the same.

I love her and she is family. And also, the weight of unsaid truth is shattering my empathy. I can't tell the truth. I cannot say ""sorry I won't bring you with me to the gym becuase your cognitive abliity is that of a 10 year old"". Becuase the truth hurts too mcuh.

I dont' even know how to say no. I don't even know. I want to be a good cousin. I truly want to be a good person and I have a heart.

Saying the truth, I'm the villain, their hearts are so broken in this family that I cannot say this out loud. Everyone knows. Her mother cries for 5 hours a day I believe.

EDIT TO ADD: I'm not saying that having graduated high school and being in a top school makes me better than her. That's not the problem, it's that she is not indepent as a person, does not know who she is, she needs parents/caretakers, and everyone acts as if she doesn't.

They don't take it very seriously and one of the policemen even told me I shouldn't have gotten married to a person like this if I didn't want this to happen. I don't want to imagine what my husband will do when he gets out because he is furious about being arrested and treated like a criminal. To him I am still at fault for all of this and he is telling our friends that he will make me pay. 

I am still struggling so much with self-blame for letting all of this happen but I want to take my life back and be happy again. It will be a long way. I can only hope that the restraining order and the police will protect me until our divorce is through and he has to leave the country. I am trying to be careful about my every move too.

Even though it's hard sometimes, I know that what is happening to him now is not my responsibility.

"I (29F) have known this man (39M) since I was 23. We lost touch for many years because he was busy building his business and being married. 

His marriage is open and he's been with his wife since college. I know he loves her, at least in the strong committed way. 

I've had a crush on this man since I first laid my eyes on him. And he recently reached out to me around May when I was in a relationship, but I deleted him then bc I was committed. After my June breakup, I reconnected in September. 

Initially it was light-hearted and felt like catching up. Messages would be hours and days apart for the first two months. Like any normal conversation, there's drop off and i'd just leave it; he'd always come back saying something reminded him of me. 

Recently the chats have been throughout the day from the morning into the evening. 

Now he always is trying to offer me gifts, buy me things, and while I deny a lot of it, I think it is so hot how much he wants to give. As I am a giver, I really admire this trait. He takes notes when I mention things I like. This week he sent me a bracelet and roses. The roses were spontaneous as I woke up one morning and he mentioned he sent something to me. The sweetest message was on there too about how any man should see my value. He's even offered to pay for my MBA exams. He's so kind. 

I want to let this go but it's so intoxicating. I feel like I can tell him anything and everything, without judgment. Our convos are deep, fun, goofy, friendly, helpful, intellectual, sensual, etc. We are both Sagittarius, so we communicate similarly. 

He is almost everything I've ever wanted in a man, except for the married part lol. Why do I feel a little delulu like i've met my match üò≠

I'm trying my best to stay grounded. 

The craziest part is that I haven't seen him in years. We're on different coasts. He has tried to fly me out several times, but i've declined because I don't want this to go any further and mess with my self esteem. 

PLEASE give me hope that there's a single man out there like this. I feel bad letting this go because he is so good to me. I feel like I could easily direct this into a friendship bc nothing physical has happened. I love talking to him.

for context: i'm in 3rd semester in industrial design.

all my life i've always wanted to go into the health department, whether that be as a doctor, nurse, or paramedic. when i was in high school i expressed that to my parents, and they explictly forbade me from studying anything in the health department. my mom wanted me to study in her alma mater, and it doesn't have medicine as an option, so i chose industrial design which was the career that i disliked the least from their academic offer.

i'm now three semesters in, and even though i don't dislike the degree it's really not for me. i feel like my brain is going to waste by not studying what i know i'm good at and every day i wake up dreading another school day, when in high school i loved going to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

i also feel bad because the university i'm in is one of the top colleges (i think 2nd or 3rd) in my country, it's very expensive and not a lot of people can get in. i talked about this with my parents earlier this year and my dad expressed his disgust at the idea, even going as far as telling me that he will never allow me to ""drop out"" of college (i wouldn't be dropping out, just switching majors and university). my mom told me i could study medicine only if i finished the degree i'm studying rn.

I‚Äôm a junior in college pursuing a bachelors in Illustration, along with an immersion in Creative Writing, and I feel like all my skill has vanished, along with my inspiration and motivation to draw. For reference, I mainly work digitally in Procreate but have a background in traditional art like graphite and charcoal.

Every day these past few semesters, in critiques and workdays, I would see my classmates‚Äô work and just immediately lose hope for myself. Everybody is leagues ahead of me and some people seem ready for the art industry already, meanwhile I struggle to draw even with references. My professors teach us WHAT to draw and not HOW to draw. Most of my progress has been from me teaching myself Procreate. I feel the problem is also myself not committing and dedicating days to practicing, I just get so down on myself knowing my work won‚Äôt come out right. 

I have this huge story idea that I want to create someday, like a graphic novel or an anime, and I can see it so vividly in my mind. I told myself that if I have one goal in life, it‚Äôs to make that story. But I just can‚Äôt make it a reality, no matter how much I try, the drawings never look good, and that‚Äôs not even considering how many would be needed for a graphic novel/manga. I‚Äôve forgotten how to sketch characters, backgrounds, and my classes never taught me how to paint or render digitally. I feel like I would benefit from having a mentor teach me 1 on 1 with personalized lessons instead of a professor trying to guide 20 students from a broad perspective.

I feel like I‚Äôm wasting money and time in college. I am very lucky to have my parents support me for my classes and everything so I‚Äôm letting them down. I‚Äôm really not as good as some of my peers think I am; my work does not come anywhere close to internship or professional level. I see artists my age or younger posting splash art comparable to Riot Games artwork, and I don‚Äôt think I could ever come close to matching that level of talent. Do I just need to work harder? Is it a mindset problem? Am I just a spoiled kid having to deal with adult world stuff now?

I have multiple health problems such as PCOS, fibromyalgia, and suspected endometriosis. Currently waiting on a referral to a neurologist because one of my doctors suspects I need an MRI for something else, so that sucks too I guess.

"I need advice! So long story short I was traveling for a few months and fell in love with an israeli guy who changed my life. He had a beautiful soul and I‚Äôm so grateful that I met him. 

At the time I didn‚Äôt know much about the Israeli Palestine conflict. We eventually split and went out separate ways home. Me, the US. Him, Israel. Since we met abroad we were trying to do long distance until we could make it work. We slowly started drifting a little and started getting really busy with our lives. It broke our hearts and we really wanted to work it out (we even said maybe in the future we should work it out once I‚Äôm done with college).

On Oct 8th 2023 I was crying SO much and I don‚Äôt know why. At this point we would respond to each other once a week sometimes less. A few days later I heard about the conflict and it broke my heart! I didn‚Äôt know how to feel so I basically spammed him asking if he was okay and sending positive messages to him. But I started to feel like I was over stepping or getting annoying so I stopped. He replied within a few days telling me he was okay but he was now in the army since the conflict started. 

After I knew he was ‚Äúokay‚Äù I wanted to give him space and not overwhelm him (because we just broke up and it was really hard for both of us and now he was literally in combat). 





OKAY BUT here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused on what to do. I would send him cute positive vibes in my messages but he doesn‚Äôt respond. But he watched every single instagram story I post.

Should I hate him or revere him? Should I leave him alone or support him during this difficult situation?? I feel like I need to just exit this situation but that would be abandoning him. I have no idea how to feel I‚Äôm just sad overall. :(

"Please let me know if I should tag it as NSFW. It does treat with alcohol problems. 

To say it bluntly, my mother has got a drinking problem. It has been worse in the past, but still ain't great.

For context me (24), grew up with a mother that would drink beer every day until her speech was slow, slurred, and she became everything that is wrong with her. She'd be cruel, to my family or her friends, she'd give up our secrets we'd tell her in confidence to other family members and joke out loud when we gave her a ""don't say anything"" look. 

I've always been protective of my family, and specially my parents. After a bad fight when I was 9, I became hypersensitive to any arguments they had and I slowly became obsessed with making sure everything went right. I was hyper vigilant and would try to control every variable so nothing went wrong. That went on for around 9 years until I moved out of their house, much improving my mental health.

Anyway, off to now. I'm staying over at their house, and while she doesn't drink every day (most weekdays she's sober, and I get to see the mother I love), when she does she gets drunk. No in between. She knows I don't like it, but she's like ""don't judge me, on weekdays I don't drink"", but what she doesn't understand is that if she controlled it, had a beer or two only, it'd be fine. I just can't stand her getting drunk but I can't find a way to tell her. She says she isn't, or that it doesn't influence what she does, but it does.
When she's off alcohol she's amazing. She ofc has flaws but she's the sweetest person. Smart, kind, funny. She's my mum. After a couple drinks, as her speech becomes slower, that person I love starts to fade. All the biggest fights in our family have had alcohol around them. Hence my anxiety.
At this point, it has been so ingrained to me that whenever she holds a can I feel antagonised, hostile, towards her. I shut off and give her cold answers without much depth to them. 
As Christmas approaches, I'm increasingly anxious that things will go wrong. I know she will drink, and I feel so impotent. I just want Christmas with my mum, not the other person. I want to be able to relax and have a good time, not be on the verge of tears as she has one more sip, one more can.

If anyone has any tips on how to approach it, I'd be incredibly thankful. Also please send hugs, I'll need them. Hate Christmas.

"my best friend is one of those people that take psychadelics. I met him on a psychadelic forum because I was once considering taking psyches, I have since changed my mind, I changed my mind before he got psychosis though so this post has nothing to do with my reasoning for changing my mind. My friend thinks very spiritually and metaphysically. I use to think the ideas he had about life was interesting, I would listen to what he had to say. The reason I was interested in it is because his beliefs was incredibly different to that of christianity and other religions. It was incredibly weird, yet interesting. I didn't believe the things he believed, yet I respected his beliefs because I didn't see them as harmless or anything. But then everything changed, it's different now, it's not fun anymore. I am getting concerned as fuck for him and the fact he's ignoring me has me worried as he usually doesn't do this. 

He is thinking of becoming a budhist monk and I've been trying to convince him that that way of life isn't the best choice for him. His reasoning for it isnt very good, hes in the belief that life is pointless and that happines is temporary and will inevitably lead to suffering because of cravings so he should become a monk because meditating for the rest of his life with very few things would be better. He believes there's no point in doing anything else as the happiness will be only temporary. I've made some pretty good points but now he's just not responding to me. He use to be really open to being challenged about his beliefs, like, really REALLY open about it. Maybe he still is, but the fact he's ignoring me doesn't make me very confident about it.. He claims a entity told him that budhism is the meaning to life.

He's only a online friend. I don't know him in real life. but I care about him allot and I dont think this way of life is right for him. He has never in his life had a proper friend before he met me, every other friend hes had has just been faking it so I feel sorry for him. He is the most interesting and kindest person ive ever met. I like him more than any other person in my life so you can see why i dont want to lose him. It has been 3 days now. I've messaged him once each day but he has not responded at all. I'm REALLY REALLY worried. He debated me for a little bit, but then he just stopped replying altogether. No response, reply, nothing. I have no idea what he's doing. I have asked very politely and kindly if I could have a open discussion and maybe give him a fresh insight and different view, he doesn't ever respond. I am getting worried that I can't help him. I have no idea how to change his mind and I don't want to lose him. He means SO much to me and the fact hes ignoring me is not normal for his character.  

I wish I could help him, I wish I could give him a convincing answer. To me, meditating for the rest of your life is the same as already being bed, you might as well throw yourself off a cliff. I've never told him he's my best friend, he means allot to me, and I really don't want to lose him. I wish I told him sooner. I wish he would respond to let me know he's okay. I wish I could change his mind. I wish I could help him. My life gets worse every fucking year. As soon as I meet somebody who has the same interests in the mystery of life that I do he's just going to leave.

"A few weeks ago me (f18) and my older sister (f28) were talking about my dads side of the family at her house, and spending time with each other since our grandma (moms side) recently passed away. Our parents are divorced and we grew up in a pretty traumatic homelife for reasons I won't explain. But, my older sister has always had conflict with my dads grandparents since she is adopted by him (my half sister) and my grandma (dad's side, and who this story is about) seemed to likely dislike her because of that, and caused her a lot of childhood trauma through mental abuse and neglect. (this is something she has only recently talked about)

I was talking to my sister about how recently my grandma has been hitting her dog with a meter stick to get him to behave, and how my dad thought it was funny. This made me feel sick and I told him that it wasn't funny. We just got a family dog a year ago for the first time, but my dad hasn't ever hit our dog, thankfully, and is in general a very gentle person. I think my dad just copes with that stuff through humor. 

This is where it gets interesting. My sister asked the question ""Do you think she ever hit her kids?"" meaning our dad and his two brothers. My instant response was ""oh, absolutely"" because the older I get, the more I realize how emotionally scarred my dad and uncles are, even though this whole side of my family seems to be very happy. But this immediately brought me back to these visions/dreams I used to have since I was young young, and came back when I started to heal my dissociation from trauma through therapy. 

They consisted of me and my twin sister being babysat at this old house that had a big upright clock and an upstairs attic.  The downstairs was full of warm positive colors, but the attic was darker and had wood flooring and a cradle type bed. There was a middle aged lady who babysat us, and who I was terrified of, because she would hit and spank us. I remember feeling scared pulling up to the house, and not wanting to go. I vividly remember watching my twin get spanked until she was crying. Now I know this doesn't sound the most traumatic, and is defiantly not the worst thing i've been through, but once my older sister brought that up my mind instantly went to my grandma, and how she might be the mystery lady in my dreams. 

I always thought that the lady was one of my moms friends, and that this mystery house was from downtown, and I also thought that it was just my brain making up stories to cope with the other emotional abuse I went through. But now that I have a little more insight, It would make sense that this lady could be my grandma. While they moved when I was in middle school, their old house had a big father clock that they gave away a little bit after elementary school, and they have a wooden attic with dark lighting, and while they don't live downtown, their house resembles ones like you see there. I also remember being very nervous quiet and submissive to my grandma as a child, kind of like my grandmas dog. There was this one time I brought over my favorite toy (the marble rollercoaster tracks) and I got it all ready to take it home, my grandma yelled at me and called me selfish, and demanded that it stayed with her. I remember distancing myself from my family and thinking that there was something wrong with me. I was probably six or seven at the time.

Now, I have no clue if this is right, but I do have a very low self esteem, and for as long as I can remember, I have always been very afraid of loud noises, yelling, and physical contact. I was seen as a very anxious and shy child, but how anxious and shy can a young kid be before it seems concerning? I also remember always feeling like shit, and I have always wondered why some of my first thoughts  were of me being very low worth and anxious, even though my parents truly didn't start having conflict till I was about 8-9. It hurts to think that I might've been physically abused as a toddler, but it also brings me some relief to know that I might of not been born this way mentally. I have also thought I might be autistic for a while, and sadly I tend to have had a frustrating effect on adults, so It wouldn't surprise me if that's what caused my grandma to hit and verbally abuse me. Recently I have also found her to be controlling and she has made me feel very upset about my emotions and depression as it should be something I should be over by now. I haven't talked to her much since then. 

I just had to tell someone. I don't really want to talk to my older sister because she is grieving, and my twin will not believe me. I also just don't want to worry my boyfriend, since my emotions feel very raw about this whole thing and I don't want him to think of me as a trauma machine.

"
I‚Äôm a college student who just turned 18 a couple of months ago. I‚Äôve always had incredible self esteem issues, mainly because of my weight, as I am pretty overweight. I consider myself to look about maybe a 2ish out of 10 but that‚Äôs beside the point. 

Recently, I met a friend of mine, I‚Äôll call him, E, who I started to get along super well with. He was amazing, we had a couple of classes together, and he was overall just a super nice guy. He introduced me to his friend, L, who was a girl in basically all of my classes that had the same intended major as me. Now to clarify, I never had any feelings for her. I had a girl best friend in high school that I basically told everything to but we drifted apart as we entered college and I saw L as someone that I could maybe build that same kind of relationship with. She was telling me and E about her boy troubles, and this guy she was kinda into but also not sure if she wanted to do anything with him. 

We would talk into the late hours of the night, basically till almost 5am just about the most random things. Another thing to keep in mind, a lot of these nights I was smoking a pretty large amount of marijuana and getting pretty high as a result. After a full day of working I would kind of just reward myself, but neither E nor L smoked, as E just didn‚Äôt want to and L wasn‚Äôt feeling great. 

As nights went on, E started to hang in his room more to study for some upcoming tests leaving just me and L alone together. One of the nights, I was feeling extra comfortable after smoking a LOT and told her about something I had done in high school that was morally disgusting and honestly also maybe illegal. I regret it to this day, and wish I had never done it, but it kinda just came out. L took it fine at first, not really caring about what I said and kind of just laughing it off. 

The next night, I was once again high, and she asked for me to lay down on the couch we were sitting on, on my side, facing outward. I was curious and confused, but I obliged, and when I did, she laid down right in front of me, legs to mine, her butt to my crotch, and her back pressed against my chest. Obviously I was shocked, but it didn‚Äôt really mean much to me, as we were just watching TikToks on her phone.

The night after, she came again, but this time she and E studied for a test together. I was once again very high and L was completely sober. When E went up to bed, she asked to cuddle again and I obliged. Within about an hour, she told me she was sleepy, but she couldn‚Äôt go back to her room because it was too late and her roommate hated being woken up in the middle of the night. I didn‚Äôt really think much of it, and just climbed into bed, wanting to sleep and just wake up. She climbed in after me, and with college beds being small, we laid in the same position we had on the couch. A couple minutes passed, and then all of a sudden she grabbed my hand and brought it to her chest. I didn‚Äôt really think about it and just tried to stay still. She then took my hand again, and squeezed her chest repeatedly with it using my hand, before sliding my hand under her shirt and doing the same. She let go of my hand and I repeated the motion. 

This went on for a bit, but because she didn‚Äôt want to wake my roommate up, we left my room and went to a private area, where she blew me. This also went on for a bit, before we stopped, and just cuddled in that area until the morning when we both had classes. 

Following the experience, I was ecstatic at first, as it was my first and only experience to date and I was wrapped up in my own joy. But the next day, I spent the whole day thinking about it and honestly felt very uncomfortable about it, because I was under the influence and she was sober, and I never really consented either. I asked a couple of friends about it, and while some told me I was assaulted, others said it wasn‚Äôt that deep and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel that way.

A couple of days pass, this time not talking to her at all, and I hear a knock at my door. It‚Äôs L, and she wants to speak to me privately. I say sure, and we step outside, when she tells me that she felt really uncomfortable with what I told her earlier about the thing I did in high school, and that she can‚Äôt trust me anymore as I could do the same thing with her. Not wanting to make a scene, I said ok, I understand, and blocked her on everything with her agreement, and we haven‚Äôt talked since. 

It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since this happened, and part of me feels uncomfortable and violated, but another part of me is saying that if i remember it this clearly, then I probably should have just stopped it before it escalated.

"When I was a (M) teenager, I had felt a sense of peer pressure to get into a relationship with someone (F). Without going into too much detail, I am not the best at socialising, and school was a nightmare for me.

When I got to my late 20s, I decided to give online dating another shot.  Previous attempts lead to very short term friendships and a few years chatting with someone I tried many times to organise meeting with but it got pushed back so many times we never met in person.

This time I was more fortunate and we had a good full year together, the longest I‚Äôve ever had with someone.  Sadly it came to an end, as she wanted to settle down and I wasn‚Äôt in a good position (not having my own house and a satisfactory job) to do so.

Being single for about five years now, I haven‚Äôt felt the need to be in a relationship like I used to.  The experience I had prior showed me the pros and cons of one.  There are great things (closenesses, sex, great memories made from adventuring) and difficult things (time management, reliabilities, etc).  

As much as I‚Äôd love to date again someday, I‚Äôm reluctant to do so, simply because I feel any potential partner being with me would do more harm than good for them, and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair on both of us.   I‚Äôm shit at socialising and I‚Äôm trying to move away from a job that has been remote for almost four years since Covid - I was one of the few people that wanted to work in an office (not only for the interaction but having the workplace separate from home), but was overruled by my other colleagues who preferred being remote because it‚Äôs cheaper for them to live longer distance than locally.  Whilst I‚Äôm in a fortunate position sharing home with family in the local area the business is based, it‚Äôs not fair that I only see my colleagues face to face once or twice a year - I just feel I lack connection with them.  

The income I get is decent isn‚Äôt enough for me to own my own home either (especially since I‚Äôve been doing four-day working weeks to save my mental health from the repetitive workload I‚Äôve been assigned differently from my initial role since Covid), so I‚Äôm doing a favour by staying away from relationships.  Any potential partner is better off with someone who has a job they enjoy that‚Äôs in common with their own interests and passions that pays well, a nice place of their own, and socially confident with others.

"Currently I live with my boyfriend of 4 years. I don't want to be with him anymore but I can't leave for a while for financial reasons. I know I need to leave, but the time between now and then is really painful. 

I've committed to having at least an amicable relationship with him. He has anger problems and depression, with a bad childhood. He's been in therapy and is taking meds, but he's a full on man child when it comes to self regulation. He has no friends or connections besides me, aside from immediate family he sees once a month or less. 

I love Christmas. My parents died when I was young, but it was my dad's favorite holiday. I understand it's not the most honorable quality, but I really like gifts. Not expensive ones, just ""I know you so well that I know you'd like this and I got it for you"" that's what I love. 

I enjoy wrapping presents early and looking at them for a long time, it reminds me of peaceful times when I had loving parents. I miss having parents that loved me so much. My childhood also wasn't great but I have responded differently than my boyfriend. 

We agreed we'd do presents this year. I wrapped his presents nicely, took care of the stockings for him and even myself. That was like two weeks ago. I dropped hints that'd it'd be nice if he got me presents, and if I had some to admire under the tree. He said he did. I kept pressing because he's not great at executive function. 

Yesterday I texted him letting him know I was starting to feel really hurt by the lack of presents and why it was important to me. He said he was sorry and he'd do it soon. 

Today he was off work and was relaxing all day. I know rest is important, so I waited til the end of day to bring it up. I was expecting some sense of urgency to do it since I had communicated to him how it was important to me. I took a long nap, and came out and he was in the same place on the couch. I gestured to the tree and kind of gave a ""what gives"" face.

He said it made him feel bad that I kept asking about it. This type of response always annoys me because I'm the one that's hurt. I did some snooping and he didn't buy anything, I don't think he's going to. He makes six figures and can afford it. He's just an asshole. 

He says stuff that all the time especially if I express that I'm hurt, idk if he's capable of caring about how other people feel. Anyway, I finally broke down and started crying really hard. He shouts at me, and also says that im the one who doesn't care about other people's feelings. 

I'm so sad. One day I'll be away from this, it still sucks so hard until then. I'll return his gifts.

She was like an aunt to me and grew up with my parents and all my other aunts and uncles. She‚Äôd been sick for as long as I could remember and was being sent to hospice because there was there nothing more that could be done for her. My dad went to see her at the hospital and he told me it was bad. 

Then today, I was at work when my grandparents called me and told me I needed to get home (they live out of state) because my mom called them crying and screaming that she was gone. I was in shock but I was able to leave and when I got home, my mom was on the floor crying like I‚Äôve never heard another human cry before.

"Specifically my best friend.


We were on and off for many years, she(18f) was my first. Years later we are young adults, we both have boyfriends (although hers is an ass, of course I'm jealous so take that with a grain of salt)(my boyfriend(22m) and I(19f) are both poly- the ideal for us is a throuple, someone we are both romantically and sexually into).


I know I love her, my boyfriend knows I do- he actually finds her very attractive too and before she got with her current boyfriend we all heavily considered a threesome. Me and my guy moved so it didn't work out. 


For a while I was just like whatever, doing my own thing living my new life but we've recently started texting more often again and in turn- I've started thinking about her again.


She's a mess, going through so much and dealing with her deadbeat boyfriend. I feel so bad for her, because I think she's so beautiful, creative, and just a genuinely special person. She deserves so much more than life has given to her at this point. Even with the fact that she has treated me poorly in the past I know how much better she is than all that and the life she's currently trapped in.


I love her, my boyfriend adores her. I think she's beautiful, I think she's sexy. I haven't experienced this much attraction to a woman since I was a teenager (I identified as a lesbian up until I was 18 when I met my boyfriend and realized my attraction to men). 


It's horrible because she has her boyfriend and I do not respect him, but I bite my tongue to not cross a line- I respect their relationship but due to context I won't give- I do not see him as a worthy person for her.


It's so horrible. I miss her so much. I fantasize about spooning her, holding her- me and my boyfriend holding her in bed. Kissing her, just being with her- all things I haven't had the chance to do since I was younger.


I just wish I could have her back, I wish me and my guy could love her the way she deserves. 


Honestly (beyond my own selfish desire) I just hope she gets to a guy or girl who truly appreciates her for who she is, loves her and cherishes her. She deserves so much and never gets it.


Anyways this is all to say (as I've said so much already) I love her, only other person I've loved besides my boyfriend. I wish we could have another chance.


I want her to be happier so bad, I want her to be fulfilled and satisfied. I encourage her to seek out further education and better more supportive jobs. For now I'm her lil cheerleader but I hope we all get another chance on day.

"Context: I (33m) coach college basketball. In my career, I have worked on both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs side of the game, and have enjoyed both. However, my coaching style and overall demeanor has been proven (just gauging by overall success and the opinions of my coaching mentors) to be better suited towards the women‚Äôs game. So, over the most recent years, the jobs that I have held have been exclusively on the women‚Äôs side.

I love my job and find it extremely rewarding, but I will say that it‚Äôs more of a lifestyle than a job, and it makes it difficult to really put myself out there due to the time and travel demands. It‚Äôs hard to find a partner unless they truly are bought into the lifestyle right along with you. 

Recently, I ran into a former player out in the town one night and it was great to see her. 
I was never her head coach, but was an assistant coach. I remember her being a strong player and excellent student, as well as a very kind person. I take my job very seriously, and clearly understand the extreme implications of starting a relationship with a student-athlete. Even though I was 24 at the time and relatively young at that stage, I NEVER even considered toeing that line. Not with anyone, her included. I try my best to be professional because I love the job and would never risk losing it. Sure, I would be lying if I said that in my younger coaching days that I never found the occasional player objectively attractive. I‚Äôm only flesh and blood. But I‚Äôm not the kind of person to put myself, or anyone else for that matter, in a position where me having any type of authority over them could create a shitshow. Besides, even if I had been just another undergrad student instead of their coach, I would have said that most of them were WAY out of my league anyway. I can coach women on the court, but actually courting them in real life? I‚Äôm absolutely useless and always have been. 

Due to opportunities elsewhere, I decided to leave after her sophomore year and accept another position elsewhere. There was absolutely no communication in the five years that followed, not a text, not a phone call. Nothing except for a random encounter 3 years back which was extremely cordial and lasted maybe 8 seconds before we were dragged separate ways by our groups. It didn‚Äôt cross my mind even then. It didn‚Äôt until last week. 

This last meeting was different. She‚Äôs beautiful, smart, funny, and her personality is incredible. Again, after all my years of rejection, I certainly know what the tell-tale signs are when a girl is not interested. I would damn near say I‚Äôm an expert on the matter. But this wasn‚Äôt like that, and I felt a genuine connection that I have only felt a few times, all with the women that actually wanted to date me. I left the conversation so excited by the prospect, which was then followed by immediate and shattering guilt due to the nature and context of our initial relationship. 

I want to ask her out for dinner. I really do. Is that bad? Am I a horrible person? Am I a creep? I fully understand that coming to Reddit for these answers will almost certainly condemn me to quite a bit of abuse for even posing the question. However, I‚Äôm hoping that at least someone will consider all the details and provide me with a fair and balanced outlook on the situation. 

The age gap today is 33 for me and 25/26 for her. 

Please don‚Äôt hold back so I can consider all the potential angles. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I still work in Coaching, and I  need to consider the optics in the case that this situation would one day develop into something.

"It is going to be a long post, sorry if it is hard to read as I am writing this while the whole situation is very fresh and painful.

Due to our jobs, my husband (M29) of 7 years and I (M34) have been living in different countries since July this year. It was a hard decision to make, but, we started our relationship long distance 13 years ago. We agreed we were a strong couple, that our love was strong and that we could do it.

Forward to the second week of October, 2 months and a half after we have been living separate, I went to stay with him for 2 weeks, one week of which was a trip to Bali. In between we had seen each other at least twice a month, spending weekends together. While we were in Bali, my husband mentioned that in his therapy sessions (he started this to be a better husband he told me) he had discovered that our sex life was not fulfilling for him, and that if we could improve it, our marriage would be a lot better. He has a higher libido than I do, his idea was to start an open relationship so we both could experiment, find out things that we liked. I was reluctant and I said no at first, I did not want one, I did not feel like having sex with other people. My husband proposed it every day while we were in Bali, saying that it would just be sex, that it will be good as both of us have little experience in sex besides with each other. At the end of the trip I accepted. We stablished rules, and the main one was HONESTY. I accepted because I thought and still think that indeed our sex life was suffering because of me not wanting sex as often as he would like to, and that it would diminish that frustration he felt.

2 weeks after the trip, I went to visit him for a long weekend. Since we were in the taxi from the airport to his place he was strange, glued to his phone, not paying attention to me. He was constantly using his phone, while we were having dinner and doing other couple stuff. Next morning he went to the pharmacy and I checked his WhatsApp and there were a lot of messages to another man. Messages of a sexual kind, but also flirty and sweet. He had been messaging this man while he was with me, the last messages were sent at 2 am while I was lying in bed next to him, and were about him wishing he could be with this other man but unfortunately I was there.

We had a huge discussion about this, I was crying, it felt to me like this was not only sex, he had not been honest about meeting this guy, even though this was our first rule for the open relationship. He cried, convinced me this was just sex and the reason he didn't tell me was because he was scared of what I would think of him as he had had sex with a lot of men in those 2 weeks. After a lot of discussion, asking for forgiveness, we decided to stay in an open relationship but I asked for complete honesty and for him to not contact this guy, the rule was, open relationship hookups were just that and should stay that: hookups. He told em he did.

Since that big discussion, however, he has been very strange when he's with me, he never said it, but it was obvious he was not having a good time whenever we would do things together. Whenever we had plan to watch a movie over the internet, or have a conversation on the phone, they were often cancelled by him as he had things to do with his friends, swim, go to the gym, etc. around 1.5 weeks after this he suddenly told me he did not want an open relationship anymore, he didn't want to be on Grindr.

I asked him what was going on, he finally told me it was that in his therapy and being with those guys, had made him realised that what he was missing from our sex life was not the quantity but the quality, that a lot of these guys had shown him that he really craved intimacy and feeling wanted and desired and that he did not feel like that when he made love with me. I asked him if this was always the case, he said no, that before he would feel like that when he was with me. I asked what I could do, he said he didn't know, told me to go to therapy to find out why I have changed when it comes to sex.

This has been the story for the last 1 month and a half, he's been saying he really miss the intimacy and that he felt this was a deal breaker with me and that the reason he had been so strange with me was because he was really undecided in his head about what he wanted.

Last Saturday he came to my place to spend the Christmas holidays (3 weeks) together. But since the beginning, he was miserable, he was not enjoying being here, he did not want to do anything, we didn't even go to buy Christmas dinner as we had planned. And we talked and he kept telling me it was him trying to think, the intimacy thing. After 6 days of him being miserable here and a lot of talks about what was happening, on Thursday afternoon he finally told me his indecision was because he had developed feeling for one guy he met during the open relationship and he could not get him out of his head. The same guy whose messages I read, the same guy who he promised me he had blocked. He said he was sorry he didn't plan for this to happen but he had developed feelings. I cried so much, it was so painful, I told him I could change I would give him whatever this guy was giving him, and he said no, he would still have feeling for this guy. He booked a flight for the next day to go back to his place and meet this guy in person. He has told me he needed to clear his feeling and he could only do that in person, by finding out what this guy wanted for the future with him. He said he would tell me when he had made this decision. But the guy is not replying quickly to his messages, now the guy went to his hometown to visit his parents so they cannot meet, so he doesn't know when he will have made up his mind.

Since he left he hasn't messaged me, not even to tell me he had arrived safely, I had to ask him that. I called him last night and begged him to come back and not to meet this guy, that we can we can work it out, with therapy. He said no. I have asked him for clarity, do you want to continue with our marriage or do you want to pursue a relationship with this man. But he says he cant give me that now because he does not know and he does not want to hurt this man's feelings.

And now I am here, alone, without anything, just thinking, crying. Trying to be strong and not contact him to beg. I just don't understand how could he throw 13 years of a relationship, for a guy he's only met twice to have sex with and then only contacted through messages. How can he exchange unconditional love for a guy he doesn't know well, he's told me they don't know much bout each other. How can he change this for a guy he cannot even have a deep conversation with because of language barrier. How can he care so much about hurting the feelings of this guy but thought nothing about hurting mine. He's accepted a job at my school now (we're both teachers) and he was making plans in front of me about how it would work if he decided to go with this guy instead of to be with me.

This is just killing me, he was my whole life, I don't do anything besides working and doing things with him or waiting to do thing with him. I have no friends here, no family. And I don't even know, he hasn't told me if he's going for this guy or staying in our marriage. Deep down I feel he's already made a decision and he is just waiting to see what this other guy says about starting a LTR with him and then he will let me know. And I know I should not, but I have this little hope that he will choose for me and that this will make us stronger. I know I shouldn't expect this but I cannot manage to let go of this hope.

"Cw: Faked death &amp; harassment. ... also a fair amount of swearing.

As much as I want to go into full details, I don't want to risk him seeing this &amp; putting my friend in a bad position.

So, I'll cut to the chase.

I got a really fucked up text a few years back from this guy telling me my friend had passed away.  It was particularly cruel.  I had to inform the rest of our shared friends back home.  We mourned her for a year together.

The following year though, the guy sent me anonymous shit to my house &amp; pretended to be a different friend.  It resulted in that friend getting harassed via my name/number (I assume asshat just spoofed the caller ID or something, he didn't SIM swap me).  

Asshat, a few days out of the year texts me pretending to be friends he thinks I've lost contact with to say shitty things as them.  Thankfully, he's really fucking bad at it &amp; if i block the number he spoofs a different one to continue talking (not great with continuity, huh?)   I made the mistake of responding a few times, but I won't do that again.  Due to him fucking with me, I dug deeper into my best friend's passing. 

Still no death certificate.

She isn't dead. (Confirmed through more than just lack of death cert).

I can't do jack shit with this information other than seeth and worry for her safety while she's living with this unhinged guy.  (There are safety reasons I'm unable to take action &amp; have been advised not to do anything :/ )

Even though most of the harassment has been mild, the guy is known to be violent.  I have a history with harassment &amp; various forms of assault, so even though he hasn't done anything in nearly a year now (I expect that will change) it's been triggering the fuck out of my PTSD.  Last thing I want to do is give him the satisfaction of getting under my skin, but man it's hard not to. 

I'm just so tired.  I hate this.  I hate him.  I don't generally wish people ill, but knowing he's still with her &amp; there's nothing I can do?  I still don't understand WHY any of this is happening or why he suddenly started hating my guts enough to pull this.

I changed my number and junk, staying with friends, so hopefully he's had his fun and won't try to up the anti this coming year.

Idk, I just wanted to put this somewhere, even if it's heavily sanitized &amp; barely touches on anything.  üòÆ‚Äçüí®

I'll probably delete this after not too long to further reduce the chance he sees this.

I just want my friend to be safe &amp; for me to be left in peace.  I'm a hermit.  The only reason I even know this jackass is because ***we helped him out*** when he showed up with my *not dead* friend.  Fuck this guy.  I really hope he reaps what he's sowed at this point.

I‚Äôm not a pedophile because I don‚Äôt find younger kids attractive at all it was just when I was horny for some reason I kept going even though the girls weren‚Äôt far from age I can‚Äôt help but feel like a monster and feel disgusted with myself I try to forgive myself but can‚Äôt and it seems like driving my car into a wall at 100 mph would be much easier then trying to deal with this pain.

"TW: sexual abuse, child abuse

My mother (64F) was abused. I (23F) don't know the details, but I know it was physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Understandably, she ran away (at around 17 or 18 years old) and built a life for herself completely estranged from her immediate family. She merited scholarships, paid for her tuition, and led a fairly successful professional career before I came into the picture. She's a hyper-independent and driven person who overcame a terrible situation - and she did her best to give me the childhood she didn't get to have. I had the coolest birthday parties, I got to explore every interest from robotics to music via extracurricular programs, and she sent me to an expensive elite private school.

To preface: have never been PHYSICALLY abused by my mother. But, it's become clear to me that much of the ""discipline"" I received as a child was not as merited as I was led to believe. My mother operates on an emotional cycle. About half the time, she's ""Mom of the Year."" She's one of those creative Pinterest moms who knew all the parenting hacks and was prepared for almost everything. The other half of the time, she is deeply resentful of me.

Her childhood trauma turned her into a \*\*self-fulfilling prophecy:\*\* the phenomenon whereby a person's or a group's expectation for the behavior of another person or group serves actually to bring about the prophesied or expected behavior. Because my mother couldn't depend on her family, she learned from a young age that she could only depend on herself. So, she went about my childhood with a ""single mother"" mentality. She had a hard time asking for or accepting help from my father because she preferred doing everything herself. But this just wasn't sustainable. Naturally, operating with this ""I can only trust myself"" mindset by taking on everything alone became extremely stressful, so she'd lash out, complaining that my father wasn't helping her enough (for the record, he was helping, she's just a very hard person to help considering her independent mindset). This constant tension of my mother becoming stressed and projecting said stress led to my parents living on separate floors. Basically, she treated her husband like she couldn't depend on him until he eventually became undependable. 

Her stress caused by her need to ""do everything"" created an emotional cycle. She was the ""spunky happy mom"" until eventually she broke down and became outwardly resentful of her family. She would lock herself in her room and whenever she came out, she'd be extremely hostile. If I happened to be in the same room as her - say, the kitchen, eating a sandwhich- I'd usually get a lecture about how ungrateful and selfish I was because I didn't do my chores to her expectations, and whatever dish she was holding ended up in pieces on the floor. The lectures were confusing because her reasoning for being upset constantly changed during her lecture. First, it was about the specific trigger, then it was that I ""didn't help out."" Then, it was that ""no one helped out"" and it became clear that her frustration had a lot less to do with that one chore and everything to do with her overall unhappiness as a mother and spouse. Typically, she attacked my character first, which, looking back, didn't make a lot of sense, because I was a child. What kind of parent tells their 7-year-old that they are a ""selfish brat"" who ""doesn't have empathy?"" I quickly learned that talking back only escalated the situation, so I usually just stared blankly and dissociated until I was excused. Then, I'd avoid her and any conversations with her until the switch flipped. Sometimes these hostile episodes lasted a week, sometimes months. Then, one random day, she'd offer me some food and she acted like nothing happened - she was back to spunky happy mom again. Back to elaborate birthday parties and fun activities. She would never acknowledge the conflict or why she was mad in the first place. It was just swept under the rug until the next cycle.

The ""trigger"" was usually chores. I've never been great with chores, but I know that my incompetence as a CHILD (7-17 years old) couldn't have merited that kind of hostility. Forgetting to do the cat litter shouldn't mean that I don't feel safe around my mom for months at a time. Also, a child being irresponsible is part of learning how to be responsible. Kids are kids, they aren't intentionally being incompetent. I certainly wasn't. Her signature line was always, ""Why don't you want to help?"" I was always made to feel like I was incompetent by choice. Now, I realize that this behavior was a projection of my mother's trauma. The language she used with me, insulting my character instead of helping me find solutions, was likely the same negative energy she experienced as a kid - but worse and physical. She never acknowledged when I succeeded at doing my chores. Instead, she treated me like I would disappoint her until I did disappoint her and ultimately validated her frustration. When I advocated that I was contributing, it was met with ""Well you didn't contribute in X, Y, and Z scenarios so that doesn't count."" This made me feel helpless and like I would never meet her expectations. She manifested that I was an unhelpful child who couldn't do chores until I basically was. Eventually, I stopped trying to meet her expectations, and it gave her even more ammunition. It wasn't until I got my first job in high school that I realized that I could be helpful and that I wasn't a problem. I WANTED to help, and when my coworkers were appreciative of my help, it made me a better team player. 

I understand trauma is complicated, and I'm extremely grateful that my mother isn't physically abusive like her parents and that she wanted to give me the childhood she didn't get to have. When she's not having one of her episodes, my mother is extremely kind, generous, and bubbly. She's incredibly talented and has a huge network of friends because of her magnetic personality. It breaks my heart that her family could have been so cruel to such a genuine person. I often wonder how she might have been if she received the childhood she deserved. But unfortunately, her trauma created a very damaged person and it's absolutely leaked into her parenting of me. I'm a lot like her and I've noticed I take after her in my relationships. I also try to take on everything myself and become resentful for it- and it's something I'm working on overcoming. 

I empathize that I was allowed to fail in ways she couldn't. It must feel extremely unfair for your kid to get away with not doing chores when you know that your parents would have beaten you up so bad you needed to go to the hospital for the same offense. It's extremely difficult to break that cycle and for the most part, she did. The constant telling me how ungrateful I am has nothing to do with my chores and everything to do with the fact that I didn't have to endure what she did. She lovebombed me, hoping to live vicariously through the childhood she didn't get to have. When I didn't understand the value of her hard work in breaking a terrible cycle, she felt unappreciated. But at the time, that wasn't my job. Children don't exist to validate their parents. Now that I'm older, I understand it all a bit better. And now I guess I'm just trying to navigate the trauma her trauma caused me.

"Growing up, I never felt connected to my mom's parents, especially my nana, but all my older siblings did. I just never felt a want to get to know her, and especially when she and my Tata moved in after he was diagnosed with alzheimer's. It also didn't help that my nana and my mom didn't have good relationship when she was very young.

For context; my mom was adopted and my nana didn't want to adopt another child after adopting my uncle but was pressured by my tata to adopt another. And my nana would make my mom's life a living hell. My nana would bad mouth my mom to her side of the family, making everyone hate my mom, even though they never gotten to know her personally, they just hated my mom's guts, even though she was just a little kid! Heck, ever since my mom was a child, my nana would literally tell her, ""You have this many: x years, x months, x days, x hours, and x minutes until you turn 18 and you'll be kicked out."" And my mom having enough of that, she moved out at 17 with my late father. And my mom would tell me this a few times growing up, how horrible, manipulative, two faced and compulsive liar nana is, and yes I personally have witnessed this habit from my nana growing up, and I always disliked calling her ""nana"", and the fact that I would practically have to yell at her (she was hard of hearing due to working in factory) and I would get scolded bc I had to yell at her by my mom (even though she does it too). But last year was the last straw.

Last year, I lost my dad and my mom was under a lot of stress with the house, grief, and my Nina's health was declining (she also fell on the same year, after drinking way too much, and she's on plavics that makes her appear bruised) and her cognitive as well, and was trying to get help, but my nana screwed it up twice, panicked, called up her SIL (who hates my mom's guts and I'll be calling her witch), and got APS involved spewing how we abuse my nana (even though my mom's been the only one taken care, and none of my Nana's family has ever checked on her, or stepped in one foot in my mom's home) - thankfully it was dropped-, and a week later that witch and her god awful son (who by the way is paramedic) verbally attacked my mom IN HER OWN HOME (I was about to go off on that witch, but my mom stopped me), took my nana and abandoned her in an ACTIVE senior community (my nana has trouble even walking a few steps, and having problems with her valves, and doesn't remember to eat or take her medication). 

And just barely two weeks ago, my nana was sent to the hospital after her doctor found out she was taking her medication and her health was declining as the witch told him incorrect information (even though my mom gave them everything about nana's medical history, upcoming appointments and whatnot), and my mom and I (I only went bc I wanted to be there for my mom) were the only ones to visit her, as her supposedly family just straight abandoned her again!

And today when visiting my nana, she got me a gift (for context: she was never good at giving gifts, it's always what she liked and never what I actually liked growing up, the same thing happened to my mom growing up), it was this painting of this (to me) creepy Santa Claus, even though I don't have my own place (due to my disability and the economy), and I just never been a huge Christmas fan - and just not my personal style, but my mom told my nana it's going to be a family heirloom, even though I want nothing to do with it. (To tell you the truth - I'd probably at best gift it to my sister who loves nana, the same thing with her wedding ring I'll just let my sister have it,, or just donate it).

So for context me and my bf are both 19, I have abuse trauma having to do with being pinned down, and some s/a trauma not having to do with it but making it so I don't feel safe saying no sometimes.

He knows about my sa trauma, not the pinning down thing, and usually I find this funny and it's okay. He's made it very clear he never wants to make me uncomfortable especially with my trauma and I can always say no

Recently, i relapsed w self harm and ever since I haven't been wanting to have sex or anything because I don't like him seeing. I told him this, while he was at my house he asked for a handjob and after a while of joking I said no. Then, (hours after ) he wrestled me and pinned me down.

He left for a sec because he said I made him feel like he was annoying me and wanted to cool off, and I had a panic attack.

I forced myself to cool down when he came back but I feel so shit about it. I know he meant nothing by it but being pinned down by him when he's much stronger and I couldn't move and having him shove his dick on my face while I repeatedly told him to stop felt so traumatic.

I wanna bring it up to him but I feel like crying thinking about it. I know he'd be heartbroken to hear how scared he made me",Bf triggered me hard,18owafe,1703301186.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18owafe/bf_triggered_me_hard/,
"To not make this too long of a post, basically i am a really lonely person who never had any real good friends until recently. My friend (25M) has been really busy the past 3 months and we didnt see each other (also because its a long distance friendship). Thursday we finally did and i was really happy to finally see him again. We spent the day at his house just talking and chilling. When it started getting late, he went to the bathroom and i was sitting alone. I started crying and when he came at first he didnt notice until he saw me. He was shocked. He asked why i was crying and i couldnt even talk but then i did. I explained my reasons and he advised me to try therapy again and to get a prescription for antidepressants. I will do that because i take his advice seriously, hes like my older brother. Hes the only one who is willing to listen to me and he does love and care about me.
Now, onto the title. I‚Äôm weak because i cried and showed him my weakness. I‚Äôm weak because you shouldnt cry to someone but i couldnt take it anymore. I‚Äôm weak because i dont like any kind of physical touch (even hugs and small things like that) yet i asked him to just hold and hug me. It felt really nice. Like someone truly loves and cares about me. I felt warmth and love for the first time in years. I just was so happy. We didnt catch feelings for each other but it was just nice. I then hugged him and went home. But i just got to thinkint about how weak and vunrable i was. He loves me and will do that again for me but do i really want to bother him?

"I‚Äôm an electrical apprentice so I work 5 days a week plus overtime with the end goal of becoming a qualified electrician. The work I do is fulfilling mentally and physically, but I‚Äôm the only woman on site and it‚Äôs a much more isolating and sometimes uncomfortable experience than I expected. 

When I see what my college friends are up to (meeting new people, partying, going on dates whilst i‚Äôve never even had a bf and now it seems ever harder to meet people), in conjunction with the judgment I receive from my parents and some others for learning a trade, I feel like I‚Äôm missing the *college experience* that‚Äôs been marketed to me for the past 6 years and consequently losing friends. I also miss maths and chemistry and feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äòwasting‚Äô my abilities in maths, chemistry, and physics. (but also jobs in those fields aren‚Äôt super appealing to me, I only care about learning the topics and having a deep understanding)

I really do like the idea of being an electrician, and working hands on, and being in debt for a degree I‚Äôm not 100% certain about when I could be making a decent salary as a sparky seems obsolete, especially when I can always go back to college to learn something and feel fulfilled in that way ‚Äî maybe if I ever have a child. 

I just worry that without college, I‚Äôll struggle to make friends/experience the ‚Äòfun 20s stuff‚Äô (I wasn‚Äôt social to begin with I had 2 friends in high school who are now in college) and feel lonely most of the time. Still, it doesn‚Äôt seem worth a debt I could very well regret. 

This post is a little aimless, but I‚Äôd appreciate any input. Almost everyday my mother reminds me that my high grades and hours of studying ‚Äòwere for nothing‚Äô and I‚Äôm kind of going insane. I realise this is a first world problem but it‚Äôs really a constant, nagging feeling I have.

"I 22f am having trouble with my 27m Boyfriend and would like some insight

My boyfriend (27m) and I (22f) have been dating since October.
He is a seemingly nice guy but there have been a few problems that indicate the relationship may not last long.

I have this weird feeling he just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt like me, beyond sexual attraction. 
When he compliments me it‚Äôs never how i think or the things i come up with, he is affectionate in a sense but i guess, not really in the sense i need. When i tell him how i feel he responds that he is ‚Äúindependent ‚Äú and states that I am clingy‚Ä¶ he needs his ‚Äúalone time‚Äù‚Ä¶. ok
He has a tendency to complain about me a lot and then say it‚Äôs ‚Äúconstructive criticism‚Äù and then tells me i push him away when i get angry with him, at times i feel like he nitpicks‚Ä¶ 
for example: 
It would be a normal day, and everything is going as usual but something small will make him so disturbed and upset, maybe a joke, maybe a meme or maybe it was my tone in how i said something. Something that isn‚Äôt really a problem or is one that can be resolved easily takes a huge toll on him and he resorts telling me  that i am abusive‚Ä¶. and then he gets mad and tells me i‚Äôm pushing him away or that i always do this or that‚Ä¶

When he does something to upset me he always says that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúreaction ‚Äú to something, to either ‚Äúhow i act‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat i said‚Äù‚Ä¶ he can not take accountability and just openly and simply admit he did or made a mistake or something wrong‚Ä¶. 
He constantly says relationships are so hard for him but it‚Äôs really bothering me when he says this because our relationship in my eyes had no major problems, but i‚Äôm growingly becoming impatient with his jabs and ‚Äúconstructive criticism ‚Äú he cannot seem to take back, and I feel disrespected, because it makes me feel as if he just doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with ME, but hides it under the guise of ‚Äúrelationships being hard on him‚Äù

"For background purposes: I am a recent college graduate currently working a full time 9-5 job at a university while I apply to graduate school. I have always been a very successful kid. I've gotten almost every job I've ever applied for, worked through college to earn extra money, I have a myriad of hobbies, and I graduated with a 3.9 GPA, making the Deans or presidents list every semester. My parents should be proud of me. I have tried my best in nearly every aspect of life. The problem is I have also suffered with Autism and OCD my entire life, and that has put a strain on my relationship with my family. They're tired of me. They don't understand how important plans are for me, or how loud noises are physically painful to the point I start crying and even screaming. Trust me, I'm ashamed about it too. 

My dad has been pretty physical with me in the past. Nothing major, but he would cover my mouth when I was screaming as a kid (sometimes accidentally my nose too and there were times I couldnt breathe), he would grab me if I tried to leave the house, he often blocks my exits, or will pick the lock to get into my room if I lock the door, leaving me nowhere to run. Today he followed me out of the house. We were having an argument and I went for a walk to clear my head. He tried to block the door, but I went a different way. I walked for about two minutes when he ripped my headphones off my head and grabbed me, I screamed because I was so surprised and shocked. I think all this may contribute to why I have problems trusting men my age. 

But he always apologizes and says he didn't mean to and that he's sorry and he loves me. He's a great father in other areas. He always did activities with me as a kid, we bond over tv shows that are important to me, he's always complimented me on my writing skills, as he knows its my dream to be a public author someday. I love him, but sometimes he does scare me. 

I am not innocent either.  I used to be pretty violent as well. I have had trouble regulating my emotions and I have never received proper treatment for my autism or OCD. It was assumed I had Adhd and anxiety disorder as a kid. In the past I have kicked in walls, thrown chairs, hit my dad pretty hard (only if he was prevented an exit or holding me down. to my knowledge, I have never initiated violence), had violent screaming fits, and have cursed out every member of my family. I can also say some really hurtful things in the heat of the moment. I am sure people will suggest getting a therapist. It is really hard for me to do that. My parents put me in therapy as a kid when I was 8. I have some unresolved trauma with that particular therapist. I don't really want to get into it in this post, though.

I am writing this post now because we just had another huge fight. For context, a few weeks ago my mom asked my dad for a divorce. I was there for everyone. I became the adult of my family. I supported my younger sister, my mom, and my dad. No one was there to support me. I had to move to a new state for work, and I don't have any friends or a significant other to talk to about the situation. I have felt so utterly alone the past few weeks. I listened to my family members cry and I offered advice and condolences and offered support the best I could. No one was there to support me. 

My company allowed me to go home early to do some remote work at home. I have been at my parents house since December 9th. That entire time, my parents have allowed my sister's (20F), new boyfriend (21) to stay with us. He has not left. It was my understanding he would leave a few days ago to allow us some family time. This is not happening. My sister informed me today that he was actually staying the entire time, and that he'd leave for xmas, but would come back the 26th. This is mind blowing to me. I was promised time alone with just the 4 of us. With this divorce going on, I want to be able to talk and communicate freely without worrying about the presence of a boy I don't know. Plus I don't think it's crazy to want to have a few days with my FAMILY. In my eyes, this is kind of our last xmas as a real family. 

I ended up getting into an explosive argument with my parents. I feel lied to and betrayed, but that's nothing new. I tried to explain why I felt the way I did, but they accused me of being jealous and selfish. I am incredibly hurt and a bit weirded out that they think I would be jealous? I could get a boyfriend If i wanted, this is just not what this is about. The only thing I'm mad about is the fact they bough xmas presents for him, but never did that for any of my bfs.  It makes me sad they don't understand. Anyway, they ended up saying some really hurtful things and ended up buying me a plane ticket back to my apartment for tomorrow. They say they won't give me any xmas presents either. That's incredibly hurtful. And I went out of my way to get them some pretty awesome gifts this year too. Anyway they said I need to apologize and they'd consider letting me stay. 

I don't know what to do. I'm in my room reflecting on all the damage we've done to each other over the years. Maybe it's better to cut them off entirely. It would suck to not have a family, but I'm just now realizing how much abuse I've gone through over the years. They're amazing parents in some areas and I truly love them, but I have also suffered incredibly. Not sure how to proceed.

"I dont even know where to start right now. I feel really just sick since it happened yesterday 

So i (15f) do martial arts, and yesterday in class we were doing this thing called dragon circle, and if you dont know what that is we all circle up and take turns attacking the person in the middle and it was my turn in the middle and this guy gets called up, let's call him Sebastian. He's 40 something with young kids and when he got called up he was directly behind me and i was still dealing with the person in front of me and when he came up behind me he just grabbed me and did like this big hug from behind and pinned my arms to my side. And in that moment my fight or flight instincts just took over and i pushed him off of me and flung around to hit him full power. I didnt actually hit him since he had backed pretty far away and we just stared at each other for a second and i was still in fight alert mode.

And when i turned super fast to hit him he just looked so surprised and said ""woah üò≥"" facial expression included. And we just kept going and it was almost the end of class so i just stuck it out and kept going to the end. I know he definitely didnt mean anything by it, hes a chill guy and i dont talk to him much, since, you know, im 15 and hes in his 40s so i probably talk to him for a few minutes a week which is not enough time to do that to someone. He also has never done it to anyone else, NOBODY has ever done that to anyone in dragon circle as far as im aware. Ive never seen that happen in my over a year of doing my art. Im guessing he thought he was being funny but i obviously didnt.

After class i just walked up to him and really sternly in a super firm tone ""_____, im gonna have to ask you to NEVER to that again"" and he said ""okay i wont"" and then i left to go to the car

And then my mom told me to go ask what their schedule is gonna look like for winter break so i ran back in to ask the instructor, and the instructor called me over to talk and he told me how he noticed my face and my response and asked how it made me feel etc and i just told him that i just have bad experiences with people grabbing me like that and i was not ready for it. He emphasized that i can always say i dont want to work with someone and he wont put me with them, no matter what the reason is. 

Ive also just been super stressed lately for other reasons, but ever since yesterday i just feel super. Sick, violated, uncomfortable, and disgusted, gross. It feels like a bunch of stuff i shoved down for years has just come back up. And its like, if it all turned put fine, everything worked out, and i SHOULD feel better, why don't I?

And now even just drinking water makes me feel super sick and i havent eaten much and i just feel so awful overall.

"First post here, I‚Äôm sorry for the length and possible formatting, i‚Äôm on mobile. 

A little background, I (22F) moved in with my Aunt and Uncle, when I was 14 because my mom wasn‚Äôt able to take care of me. My mom was my best friend, she was an addict and it‚Äôs what took her life but she was still my ride or die, go-to person. She died when I was 18 and 3 weeks away from graduating High school. 

My aunt and I have also had our ups and downs, she‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs sister and she carries his temper, so we fought often. It‚Äôs a little better now that I don‚Äôt live under the same roof, but we still struggle. Now onto the issue-

I was at my aunts house while she was helping me sign up for health insurance (I live in the U.S), after we were done me, my aunt, and my uncle were standing in their kitchen talking about how ridiculous health insurance is when my aunt kinda just stopped and said to my uncle ‚ÄúWhat if we just adopt OP? I feel like that would fix so many problems‚Äù. My uncle and I both looked at each other for a second and I know I made a ‚Äúwtf‚Äù face, my aunt went on to explain that it would help with benefits on taxes if I were legally their daughter. 

My uncle asks her a couple questions, the main one being, ‚ÄúWhy would we adopt her? She‚Äôs an adult now?‚Äù, I doubled down on that question. My aunt responded that she had seen it done a lot and if they ever wanted to add me to their inheritance, they could without issue from their 3 bio kids. She then goes on to say ‚Äú It‚Äôs basically like if we would have adopted OP when she was 14‚Äù. The conversation didn‚Äôt really go anywhere after that other than her saying she‚Äôd look into it more. 

My problem is, why didn‚Äôt they just adopt me when I was 14? They had Temporary emergency custody of me, my father wouldn‚Äôt have made it an issue, and my mom wouldn‚Äôt have either. It just left me feeling so shitty because what was the problem before? Why only want to adopt me, AFTER i‚Äôm 18, when it benefits you? I feel rejected of some kind, like im only good for when she needs me.

"i know that what im thinking right now is extremely biased because i have very high emotions right now and I KNOW that i have been triggered but i really need to let it out. 

i (18f) have a long distance boyfriend(18m). i admit everything happened pretty fast but we have been together for nearly 3 months, previous to him i was pretty badly let down by another guy and it really changed my perspective and affected my confidence. 

everything has been lovely for the past 2 (nearly 3 months) we call often and text all through the day, i feel like he trusts me and recently hes opened up to me more. 

except there is this nagging thought repeating in my head and idk if its just anxiety or its a gut feeling but i keep thinking about how i would cope if he broke up with me, maybe because i keep thinking about how badly that other guy affected me and i cant let that happen again. 

recently i have noticed a few changes. we dont call for as long, we used to sleep on the phone often and talk for seemingly endless hours. we havent slept on a call or called late in what feels like forever, i want to do it more often but idk how to initiate it - it used to just happen. but now he gets ‚Äútired‚Äù and leaves, only to text me for like an hour before he sleeps, it just hurts and feels like he doesn‚Äôt want to spend time with me anymore like we used to. 

maybe its just the ‚Äúhoneymoon phase‚Äù ending, but i still feel totally the same, i love him so much and want to talk all the time, but when we call, sometimes it feels like he is bored or cant think of anything to say, whereas he used to just blurt out the most random things to get a conversation going. 

but what bothers me the most, at this very moment, is how i send him a text, and i can literally see him come online, stay online for a few minutes and then go offline - without responding. make it make sense? if im on my phone i will always reply if i see the message - otherwise whats the point? i don‚Äôt understand why you would think ‚Äúoh yes let me just leave her for a minute she will get it‚Äù because no, i dont get it. its almost like we barely ever have conversations over text where we are both present in that moment at the same time. 

i just cant help thinking that is lack of time spent together, dry texting and purposefully leaving me on delivered whilst clearly being online might indicate hes pulling away?

Like I get he was a bad person who treated me very badly but I just want him to leave me alone and honestly I don‚Äôt really gaf what happens to him.

"This year was a hard year for my ex gf &amp; stepson. 

My relationship with them both was emotionally abusive for 12 years. This year it got worse. 

Sometimes I was a good partner. Sometimes I was a good father. But my main setting was invalidating their feelings &amp; going thru long stretches where I‚Äôd lose my empathy. 

I‚Äôd started going to therapy in April but it was too late. I have BPD. My therapist thinks I don‚Äôt have NPD but i think I lean that way. I also suspect I have other mental illnesses too . 

Let‚Äôs take it month by month.

In February my step son‚Äôs ex gf killed herself. 

In April I got angry at him for not telling me it was her birthday until morning right  before school. 

In June I had a bpd ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù episode &amp; yelled and screamed at him bc he came home from school for lunch &amp; I wasn‚Äôt expecting that.He was crying &amp; shaking it was so bad.

I checked myself into a psych ward &amp; his mother had to clean up the damage. 

I was asked to move out. 

I was still on good terms with my ex. She was being supportive of my struggles. 

In June I became very emotionally attached to an OF model &amp; I   started sending her money &amp; messages. 

In July my step son‚Äôs mother got cancer. She was in the hospital most of the summer. 

I was very caring of her &amp; my step son over the summer. I am hot &amp; cold like all abusers. 
 
In October I had a falling out with the OF girl &amp; she called me a stalker &amp; that collapsed my ego.

I told my ex about it and she said the story ‚Äúeroded her‚Äù bc when we were together I was a porn addict &amp; we‚Äôd stopped having sex. 

I was always making her into my therapist. In November my ex found a suicide note in my step son‚Äôs room dated from June. She called ers &amp; he was not admitted. 

However I was admitted to another psych ward the same day by a crisis center I‚Äôd gone to.  Bc of my stupid ego collapse over the OF girl.

While I was in the hospital another one of my step son‚Äôs friends killed themselves.

Three weeks ago I was asked to come over &amp; help my step son thru a mental health crisis. 
I think I helped in the moment.

I was up  all night feeling good that I‚Äôd helped my family &amp; I got to be with them. 

The next morning she texted me that she didn‚Äôt think much had helped so I begged her to let me come over. I was in a panic &amp; wanted to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù my step son instead of validate his feelings. 

I had a mild sore throat that I didn‚Äôt tell her about &amp; thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just wear a mask!‚Äù 

She is 1/2 thru treatment with leukemia. 

I didn‚Äôt really help much bc my step son just wanted to be left alone &amp; sleep.  I left. 

I did wear a mask the whole time. 

I started to get sicker &amp; I tested positive for covid..

I told her &amp; neither one of them got covid thank god. 

I have been disinvited from Christmas &amp; my ex no longer wants to talk to me outside of what‚Äôs necessary for the child. 

Now I‚Äôm writing this. I‚Äôm not proud of any of this. I‚Äôm disgusted with myself &amp; am ashamed that I have traumatized two people that I supposedly loved. 

I don‚Äôt know how I got so callous &amp; terrible. I‚Äôm 48. I‚Äôve lost hope over the kind of person I am. 

My therapist says all people have inherent value but I wonder if I do. 

Wtf is wrong with me? Why couldn‚Äôt I be the rock &amp; protector my family needed? 

I don‚Äôt know  why I‚Äôm writing this.

Just so  much shame in me.",I am a terrible person.,18ov3g5,1703297246.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ov3g5/i_am_a_terrible_person/,
"My mom doesn‚Äôt believe in Christmas, but in fact, believe Christmas to be the birthday of Satan and that Jesus actually was born in the spring solstice. (There‚Äôs a lot to unpack but I‚Äôd get off topic if I did). Nevertheless, she and my dad sends me something from Amazon every year, despite kicking me out  because I was gay seven years ago. 

I was a homeless youth, and now am a couch surfing adult that‚Äôs teetering between homelessness and finally gaining enough stable income to afford a low quality apartment. My mom sent me a year ago a self help yoga book. The year before that, a self help book about why manly men are superior. The year before that, a self help book about getting rich fast‚Ä¶.The year before that, a worse, really gross alt right anti wanking Christian propaganda ‚Äúget rich now‚Äù self help book. This year was kinda milder than the latter, but another self help book that caters more conservative values with a helping of pseudoscience on how to read people and ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt want my mom to waste her money on these books because I‚Äôm not going to read them. I‚Äôm tired of them, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt care about my interests either. Before I was kicked out, anytime I brought up an interest of mine, they‚Äôd brush it off and tell me I was being annoying, a know it all, and tell me to talk to my friends and not to them, or that I‚Äôm the reason I have no friends because I‚Äôm so boring. 

Not to also mention they‚Äôre the reason why I was homeless for so long. I was a minor when I was kicked out and it was a lot of pressure on my life to sort everything out. 

I called my mom on the phone today, letting her know in the kindest way as possible to stop sending me books. I made a white lie up saying that because I am moving (god knows when) I have so many books that I need to be mindful with how heavy the move will be. She got insanely angry, told me to not complain about the gift (I lied and said I‚Äôll read it) and hung up on me. 

Sometimes I feel like a bad son. I really try my best to be the best person I can be and no matter what I do my parents won‚Äôt accept it. I am low contact/no contact with them for a reason.

"I already made a post like this somewhere, but I just want to confess yet again for some reason. Don't make fun of me, please.

Okay, so I'm a 14 year old girl. I'm still in 8th grade, so go easy on me. I know I'm young. Anyway, the thing I wanted to come on here to discuss (again) is not related to school or anything like that. That'd be problematic. What I wanted to address is that I feel as if I'm too sexual for my age. Or maybe I should say too interested in the art of sex.

I mean, I legit created a collection of just pornographic materials, and topics related to sex and whatever. I named this collection ""Coitus Memorandum."" This collection includes 5 categories, which are topics to research, H games, H artists, doujins, and hentai anime. I know, it's strange.

I don't know why I'm like this. I always thought, ""yeah, I know damn well no girl my age is being weird like this"" and I think I'd be right. I don't know why I'm so into sex right now. I know people will say, ""Well, you're at that age where you're starting to explore your sexuality!"" And I want to believe that this is normal, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm taking it too far. Again, I think my age is my main concern. Like, shouldn't I be out doing fun things and not making a porn collection? Like, why? 

And no, my weird interest in sex is not interfering with my personal relationships or whatever, so don't worry about that. I keep this part of me well hidden, but there are a few times where I just want to tell someone about this side of me. I'm too young, I know, but it feels a little lonely?

"I‚Äôm 24F &amp; he‚Äôs 22M. I met him when I moved overseas to finish my undergrad. He started his degree in 2019- I was doing my second year undergrad back then. I moved again at the start of 2022 (we‚Äôve been doing long distance since) and graduated from my masters just this month. He failed uni two consecutive years and switched courses and is now halfway through his 3rd year. Now, I don‚Äôt blame him for this, but it does play a role in why I had to end things.  

We had a talk and we feel like we‚Äôre on 2 different paths. I asked him if he could guarantee me that he‚Äôd at least be done by mid 2025 (that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs supposed to graduate now) and he said he couldn‚Äôt cause he‚Äôs unsure about where he‚Äôd mentally be at that point (he‚Äôs a Muslim convert and fears his family might disown him cause of accepting Jesus + he‚Äôs not a 100% sure about his career choice either atm).

I let him know that me personally, I‚Äôve had the toughest past 2 years of my life with our relationship torn apart cause of the distance, the sexual assault at the start of my masters which ruined me, the course itself which was rigorous and I‚Äôm still here standing by God‚Äôs grace. So why can‚Äôt he trust God to do the same for him and give me that confidence in our relationship? (Yes, I‚Äôm aware everyone has a different capacity, which I had to accept &amp; come to this decision). I told him that I was initially hoping he‚Äôd be graduating with me. Now that that didn‚Äôt happen, the least he could do was promise me he‚Äôd finish mid 2025 like intended &amp; he couldn‚Äôt do that. Imo, it‚Äôs the bare minimum. He also couldn‚Äôt say for sure that after 2025, he‚Äôd get a job and want me to start a life with him. Not for the lack of loving me, but because he was unsure of where he‚Äôd be at emotionally &amp; mentally. However, I don‚Äôt feel secure with a partner who I can‚Äôt rely on. 

We‚Äôre both sorry we can‚Äôt give each other what we want atm. So, I suggested taking a break until mid 2025. We decided that if we talk about it then &amp; still find that we‚Äôre even further away than we are rn regarding what we want, we decide to keep going our own separate ways. If not, we get back together. 

I told him that I don‚Äôt wanna completely cut off contact cause I still wanna be there for him when he needs me. He feels likewise. However, I said that if he were to find another girl, to please inform me &amp; cut ties with me cause I can‚Äôt watch that.

Now, the reason I feel like an asshole is cause he has never treated *me* badly‚Ä¶ just my time ig. He‚Äôs always prioritised me throughout our relationship, even tho he‚Äôs had busy schedules. He‚Äôs been a real rock for me through everything we‚Äôve been through the past 4 years and I believe (truly hope) I‚Äôve done the same for him. There hasn‚Äôt been a single day I haven‚Äôt thought about him these past 4 years. We‚Äôve had a great run. Never in the past 4 years did I doubt we could make it.

Trigger warning for child sexual abuse

I can't link to my original post, see my page.

I talked to my son the day after I posted. He said he reached out to his former friend's wife when he found out what happened. She said she confronted her husband when her son said something graphic about a ""game he played with Daddy"". When confronted, her husband calmly told her he had done ""everything"" to their son. It started when he was only 2 years old. She turned him in. She told my son her only regret was not killing him when she had the chance. She and the boy are in therapy. She doesn't have the greatest family support so I hope she will keep up with the therapy. They were actually trying to conceive at the time of his arrest. I can't begin to imagine the trauma they are both dealing with.

The sentencing hearing was two days ago, where a statement was presented describing the abuse. It was a tough read, very graphic stuff. He admitted to raping the boy, among other things. He produced images, some even depicting his son's face. He indicated he started having an attraction to children at age 8. He said he had never hurt anyone before his own son.

He was sentenced today and received 14 years. Several restrictions will be put into place after his release from prison. It still feels surreal. My son said he was tempted to visit him in jail just to say ""WTF dude, you're sick"", but figured there was nothing to be gained by doing that.

I don't know how his parents or siblings are doing. I hope they get therapy too. Personally, I would rather lose a child through death than live with the fact that they have done this.",[UPDATE] Turns out my son's childhood friend is a pedophile,18our0y,1703296160.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18our0y/update_turns_out_my_sons_childhood_friend_is_a/,
"I have been separated from my husband of 15 years since 2021. Our daughter was almost 4 when we went our separate ways after many years of verbal, mental, emotional and physical abuse. What really strained our marriage was when I finally pressed charges against him after he physically assaulted me and threatened to kill me.  
  
During our last year of marriage, I reconnected with someone from my past and that's where I fucked up, because I should have moved out before rekindling anything with someone else. I stopped that rekindling and many months later my husband found out and put a knife to my throat and threatened to end me right there and then. He didn't, but he beat the fuck out of me, broke my door from the back entry of the house, stole my phone and left me on the ground. He had held me by the throat so hard that I couldn't catch my breath. That's when charges were laid on him and we went our separate ways.  
  
I know a lot of you will probably stone me to death because I got involved with someone else while technically still being married, but I was truly miserable, unhappy and desperate from some love and affection, which is what I got temporarily with this other man. I recognize I should have left my husband beforehand, but things happened the way they did and there is nothing I can do about it at this point.  
  
It has taken me many years so far to try to have a healthier co-parenting relationship with this man, but he has made it disgustingly impossible. He doesn't speak to me, he rarely looks me in the eyes, he doesn't pay child support, he doesn't contribute nothing for our daughter. I work 3 jobs to try to make ends meet. Whenever my daughter asks to see her dad, or spend the weekend with him, I am more than glad to do as she wishes because she loves her dad, and to be honest, he loves her too, he treats her well, he is very hands on with her, he spoils her, he plays with her and you would never think that he's a piece of shit husband. The issue here is me. He bullies me. He mistreats me. It's always been like that and it's my own fault for ignoring the red flags for 15 years hoping he would change. They never change.  
  
What I don't like is that he uses our 6 year old daughter to get his points across, he communicates with her asking her questions about when and where should they meet? What time will they meet? How long til she gets there? I mean, who asks a 6 year old child these types of questions? And when I try to respond or get involved, he pretends like I don't exist. Instead of making proper plans with me, he goes through her and gives me the silent treatment whenever I ask him anything related to the when and wheres.  
  
If I message him asking him anything, he leaves me on read. When he calls and whenever I pick up he just says ""PUT MY DAUGHTER ON THE PHONE"" and doesn't say anything else until I put her on the phone.  
  
The only reason why I go with the flow is because I know how excited my daughter gets when she is going to spend time with her dad. I do it for her. I suck it up so that she doesn't have to miss out on not spending time with her dad, I already feel guilty about how everything turned out between her dad and I.  
  
Today, I drove over 65 miles to drop our daughter off to him. When I got there, she said ""daddy, let's all go for dinner, you me and mama."" He said sure. Let's go. So we went. We had dinner, he ignored me, pretended I wasn't there but was very vocal and cuddly with her and overall the dinner went fine.  
  
Once we left, I remembered I had a piece of Lindor chocolate that I started eating, gave a piece to my daughter, and offered him some as well. As I went to offer him a piece, he gave me a side eye, a side look, and looked the other way. I was annoyed by him so I said to him; ""No Thank You, is what you should say"" and he just snapped.  
  
He raised his voice at me and said: ""Shut the fuck up you B\*\*\*\*."" I said ""Excuse me?""  
  
He goes: ""You heard me, you B\*\*\*\*... you and your B\*\*\*\* ass mom"" and he proceeded to grab our daughter to take her. That's when I grabbed our daughter and walked away as fast as I could, holding back my tears and put my daughter in the car and we went back home.  
  
My daughter is sad, she tells me she feels uncomfortable inside. That her daddy is a bully, but she doesn't understand why he is nice to her and mean to her mama. She is confused. It ripped me to pieces to see my daughter so disappointed. This isn't the first time something like this happens, but as my daughter is getting older, she is witnessing things that are affecting her. I took the opportunity to explain to her that it is unacceptable behavior and that we should never allow someone to disrespect you and bully you this way. That the best thing to do is walk away like we just did.  
  
She is still so confused and hurt by her daddy's actions and tells me that she feels like crying but is trying hard not to, I told her that if she feels like letting it out that it would make her feel better. I am trying to be strong and supportive but deep inside I am confused, hurt, angry, disappointed, triggered, hopeless and much more.  
  
I have full custody of my daughter. Am I hurting her by wanting to cut ties with him? Will I cause her traumas by keeping her away from her dad? She loves him so much and he is the best dad to her... It's just when I am around that he turns into this monster, I guess this is why he avoids me and doesn't even look my way, so we avoid having to fight... I don't know anymore, all I know is that these types of altercations are hurting my daughter and I want to protect her. I don't know if my way of protecting her will cause her pain and traumas in the future. I don't want to keep her away from her dad, I was excited for her to spend the weekend with him. She doesn't see him often. I just feel like if he wants to have a solid relationship with her, he needs to respect me. Is it ok for me to think this or am I being selfish? It has nothing to do with me right? ... I don't know what to do. I wish I could just disappear and block him out of our lives but I can't do that, that's her father.

"STOP FAPPING, it will cause prostate issues

Hello everybody, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons and will most likely delete this post later in the week due to the shame I feel.

I am a 20 year old male who never did any drugs, alcohol and lived a good life style such as working out and running. Even though I lived a good life style, I had a dark addiction to masturbating since the age of 12 and I wish I never touched porn. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say I jerked off 3-4 times a day, but I would jerk off once every other day but sometimes I would watch xhamster models for two hours or more back in 2020 and 2021 which I feel deep shame and regret. There would be times where I would go without masturbating for a month and a half but would relapse but I believe what did the most damage was watching the models for hours and edging. 

It wasn‚Äôt until 2022 when I got a girlfriend and started having frequent sex, and rarely masturbated as much as before and would only use our sex tapes to let one out but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs too late for me.

Looking back then, I remember having urinary symptoms such as frequent urination but it went away later in the years of 2021-2022. It wasn‚Äôt until earlier this year where I started having trouble peeing but I would just use my phone to relax then it would come out so I didn‚Äôt question it or go to the doctor which was stupid of me.

Fast forward to my current situation, I‚Äôm experiencing random body aches, urinary hesitancy, pelvic pain at times, weight loss, chest pains, weird bowel movements, shortness of breath and my body just feels off. I believe I have developed metastatic prostate cancer from the years of my teenage years watching porn and masturbating. 

CT scans of my abdomen/pelvic, ct scans of my head, ultrasound of abdomen, blood work is good, psa is good but I have yet to get an MRI of prostate or DRE. Either way, my symptoms are progressing every week and I just can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm going to die from having been a horny teenager who had no self control.

 I believe in the future prostate cancers will rise in the future because of porn and frequent masturbation but I believe what took me out was watching xhamster models for hours while edging. 

I wake up in shame every day thinking about how I‚Äôm going to leave my family soon all because I was thinking with my dick, and wanted to start a family with my girlfriend and see many more Christmas‚Äôs. 

I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm going to be a fatality in the masturbation era, and in the future once it‚Äôs confirmed frequent masturbation causes prostate cancer, my family will look down in shame at my grave.

All I‚Äôm asking is you guys to stop before you end up in my situation, I wish I never started masturbating and my 12 year old self would have never known this would cause physical damage.",Quit porn and masturbation,18ounvx,1703295886.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ounvx/quit_porn_and_masturbation/,
"I‚Äôm F/29. When I was 25 I got involved with a coworker. I know, that‚Äôs the number one rule of what NOT to do. 

We were coworkers for 6+ months before anything happened. We had grown closer over those 6 months as friends and eventually things developed. 

Happy hour drinks, nights out to dinner, sleepovers, lunch dates, etc. but we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúdating‚Äù. He wanted to apply to grad school not in the state. He wanted to move out of his family house. He was unhappy in life so he couldn‚Äôt be a good partner. These were the reasons I got why we weren‚Äôt officially together. 7 months of this. He came to meet all my friends at one of their birthday celebrations. Posted me online. I thought things had changed. Maybe he realized what he had right in front of him. But right after that, back to the same behavior. 

The more he pulled away the more I grasped at straws. Had to see him every day and act like nothing was wrong. 

The last straw was when a new girl was hired at work. Irish accent, long blonde hair, amazing body. He had all the time in the world to buddy up to her, and right in front of my face. 

I put in my notice shortly after. 

I realize looking back that I was holding on to something that was never going to be there. It was a lesson I learned the hard way. I vowed to never allow another person to keep me on the backburner like that. I vowed to work on respecting myself enough to walk away. 

The problem is that something inside me is broken. I went on a hiatus from men and dating for over 3 years. 

It took until this novemeber to go on one date. And I couldn‚Äôt even remain open minded enough to see the guy again. 

My faith in men just doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. I‚Äôm so utterly disgusted by what I went through with that coworker that I have no more feelings left for men. To the point where I questioned if I‚Äôd become asexual. Because I don‚Äôt know how I will EVER be intimate with a man again. 

The way my coworker discarded me was worse than any real relationship breakup I‚Äôve ever had. I cringe at the thought of a man kissing me or touching me ever again. Because I truly felt safe and open with my coworker. I feel so violated still to this day. 

My other mental health issues have gotten worse. I now feel sexual shame. I feel infantilized. Reverted back to younger me. I no longer feel like a grown 29 year old woman who seeks and enjoys sex. I feel like sex is now something men have with me for their own benefit and never mutual pleasure. I haven‚Äôt even had sex in 3+ years but those feelings still linger. 

I was in therapy for a while but due to financial reasons I had to take a break so, here is where I let it out",My last ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù broke something in me 4 years ago and I‚Äôve been unable to move past it,18ounr4,1703295875.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ounr4/my_last_situationship_broke_something_in_me_4/,
"I have five brothers, two older than me and three younger than me all ranging from ages 27-6. I really do not get on with any of my brothers really apart from my youngest brother, who I love very much and cuddle with all the time. They do not really like nor respect me and I guess I don‚Äôt respect or like them either. Even though I am the middle child I carry the weight of everyone in my home as I am the only daughter in an immigrant household. Everything counts on me mostly, I have to sort everything out, I have to act as a translator, a baby sitter, the only responsible one. I‚Äôve grown up in a single parent low income household all my life mostly and I‚Äôve always felt upset with my mother for the way she allowed my step dad (father of my younger brothers) to treat her and her family and never allowing herself to build her life up after 18 years of moving from a less developed and unstable country. We were always poor, barely ever had food, never had new things, always being evicted, experienced homelessness multiple times. 

Me and my mum have a terrible relationship due to many reasons such as her allowing my step dad to live with us and be part of my life after he sexually assaulted me (She believed me at first then he convinced her it didn‚Äôt happen but even when she did believe me she never kicked him out she just got angry with him and let it go), allowing my step dad to ruin our lives, physically and financially abusing me (strangling me and making me feel bad for having money which I received from college) and verbally abusing me as well as mentally. As well as her gossiping to all my family members about me and how disrespectful/dirty/rude I am. Her and my older brother read my diary and made up lies about it and told everyone in my family. Just constantly spreading things about me to every family member.

I started to experience horrible depression from the ages of 11 when my mother got pregnant even though we were homeless and my step dad barely was around and it hasn‚Äôt stopped. Through this, I just wish I had a sister who understood what it was like to be a girl from a culture who seem to hate women living in the UK. I wish I had someone to go and cry to when I felt depressed or even just sad about a boy, since my mother gets mad at me for being upset or if she sees me cry. I wish I had someone to steal clothes from and to steal mine, I wish I was able to experience sisterhood that didn‚Äôt only come from close friends but a real sister. I wish I was able to walk into my bathroom without fearing that my brothers have left their skid marks and piss all over the toilet, dirty boxers on the ground and I‚Äôd have to be one to clean it and pick it up (my mum has her own bathroom). I wish I didn‚Äôt have brothers who are being taught by the internet to hate women and therefore disrespect and hate me because they‚Äôve never tried to get to know me. I wish I had a family member who loved me. 

I wish I didn‚Äôt have brothers who leave their mess for me to clean because my mum has taught them that their mess is my and her problem to clean. I wish my brothers didn‚Äôt only think of their belly‚Äôs and eat every food in the kitchen and leave none for us. I wish I had a sister to laugh and smile with, to pretend I hate but secretly I really loved. All my friends have sisters and they seem like the best of friends even when they argue, I wish I had that. I know I‚Äôm my best friend‚Äôs best friend, but I know her sister is always going to be her number one which I understand I just wish I could relate.

My older brother (21) had attacked me many times when he feel I am not giving him enough respect, meaning I am not allowed to argue with him when he is clearly in the wrong and my mum allows this because she says I must respect my elders. My mother allows my older brother to attack me and scream at me when he clearly knows he is stronger than me, and I have been hit by him many times and my mother says I deserve it. My step dad has also beaten me many times especially after I told my mum what he did to me and in those times her only thought was telling him he can‚Äôt hit me because he‚Äôll get arrested and to allow her to do it instead. She has told me many times that she didn‚Äôt love me because I was having school counselling because of my depression and she did not like that I was talking to people outside my family about my mental health while also doing nothing to be there for me. I don‚Äôt know why she hates me.

"But I know I can't stop existing over it.

After everything I've gone through in 2023, comparing it to other tragedies or world events makes what I'm upset about sound silly. But I still dream almost every night about my old friends, it's either we're happy together, or they're still casting me out and rubbing their happiness in my face. I still have dreams that I'm with my ex, those are the worst to wake up to. Realizing all the effort I've tried putting in to let this stuff go hasn't worked. These people are on my mind 24/7 and it's haunting me that I can't seem to stop thinking about them.

I miss them so much. I feel like an idiot for how I let my own insecurities about my relationships with people mess things up. It's almost been a year since the fight with my friends and 4 months since my break up and I still cry over it everyday when it hits me. I haven't had a day of peace with my brain in a good bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I just know it‚Äôs stupid to be this distraught over it and it seems like it should be easy to let go. Plus, the thing is that I know nothing would be the same if these people accepted me back into their lives. I still hold an anger towards them that would eventually come out and lash out even more. I wasn't even all that happy with my ex and yet he's the only person that I can even think about being with. I felt like I had to walk on egg shells not knowing if the next thing I said was going to be taken out of context and a fight would start.

I know I can find better people elsewhere but I want these old people so desperately that it makes trying to connect with anyone new feel dull compared to what I had with my old friends and my ex.

"I don't want to give a huge long sob story, but basically I struggled with my health when i was a teenager- lost most of my hair, became underweight, at risk for organ failure, have had a (not visible with a prosthetic) amputation, etc. Fast forward I'm 25 now. I have my degree, a good job in UI design, a nice circle of friends, and am close with my family. I really have no huge complaints, people come out of my scenario a lot worse off and I'm really grateful for my health/life now.

As stupid as it sounds though, sometimes I wish I were more like a normal woman. I know women are more than the hair on their head or the curves on their body, but it just feels like something so normal yet out of reach for me. I have to wear a wig still and aren't very developed, but I try to work out regularly and take good care of myself. By just looking at me, you'd never guess I almost died and spent a year in IP but I get mistaken for a teenager despite the fact I'm closer to 30 than I am 18.

I kind of keep it to myself, but I don't even try to date because of how I see people talk about how unattractive fake hair or small-chested women are. I've been told to my face too. In the few experiences I have had, I just see the way they look at other women and the way they look at me is like I'm this broken thing or like a baby bird.

I could have gotten implants, but I still am on the fence about that because I feel ""fake"" enough already having to wear a wig to not look sick. I feel like anyone I'm with I'm robbing a man of the chance to physically be with someone who is actually real- more of a woman, beautiful in a way unrelated to character or someone more lively, sexy, and fun and not run down and quiet.

I hate feeling pitied and opening up about this, even at work no one knows. I guess right now it's harder with the holidays, not really having anyone when my family/friends have their own things going on. I guess I just feel kind of lonely, so I hope anyone who gets the feeling knows they're not alone in that feeling",I feel like less of a woman,18ouihb,1703295409.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ouihb/i_feel_like_less_of_a_woman/,
"Relationship Crisis

I (25m) am home for Christmas and my girlfriend is going to come visit, but I think I might have to break up before. I've been dating my girlfriend for 7 months now. Initially I really didn't want to date her because I never planned on being in a relationship at this stage in my life, but I got sucked into it because we had so many trips planned together and it juat kinda happened because we were spending so much time together and I felt bad cancelling on her. But I decided to give it a try. And for a few months it was really great, but then I started to have my doubts. 

She's beautiful, we get along so well and I really do love her, but I kept thinking about other women and my desire to become single again. I also noticed my girlfriend began to gain a bit of weight. I went through about two months of debating about breaking up with her and finally decided to do it. And then I found out her mom might have cancer. I decided to put this on hold, but knew in the back of my mind breaking up was the best decision for me. 

To give a bit of context for the remainder of the post, I have a history of anxiety and have been on Prozac for it since I was 9. 

We are set to go on a NYE trip with another couple next week and she'll be coming to my family home first. A week ago before she left for home for the holidays, I really wanted to break up. I stopped myself from doing it out of consideration for her mother, but I literally had a full on panic attack just picturing how difficult it is going to be for me to put up a front for the next few weeks including on a 6 day vacation with her. Then I calmed down and the next morning I drove her to the airport. I debated breaking up with her over FaceTime, but then she found out her mothers cancer prognosis isn't looking good, and I felt like she deserved better than to be broken up with over the phone. I feel like I should have just done it before she left and put myself first, but I didn't do that. I came to the conclusion that I would suck it up and wait until after new years. 

Fast forward to now, I just had another panic attack and I am terrified about the thought of putting up appearances for this trip. I feel like I've been losing my mind waivering over this decision. I was so sure about breaking up with her last week and now I feel like if we do another trip together we are going to get closer and I'm not gonna wanna break up with her anymore. I don't think I can fully break up with her before she comes, but I feel like I might need to have a conversation with her to let her know how I feel because my mental health the past week has been absolute shit. At the same time, I know that if I initiate that conversation and tell her I have been feeling uncertain about our relationship, we're likely to break up. That might be what is best, but I feel terrible about doing it over the phone. 

I really don't know what to do and I'm driving myself insane and giving myself tons of anxiety overthinking this. now I'm not even sure if I want to break up with her anymore. I really do love her but I feel like maybe my gut has been telling me breaking up is the right thing to do. What should I do, tell her how I have been feeling or suck it up and put up a front for another week and a half and tell her how I'm feeling afterwards? And if I should wait til afterwards, how do I cope with putting up an appearance for the meantime?

"I was tiny my entire childhood and I weighed 45kg for as long I can remember. Then quarantine happened and I slowly started putting on weight. It wasn‚Äôt very noticeable but I moved from a size 6 to a size 8 over year and a half. From my understanding, size 6-8 is still extra small so it was only skinny jeans I outgrew. Then a little over two years ago, I had a noticeable change when I grew into a size 10 which is my current size. Obviously growing from an extra small to medium will show all over my body and I loved it. After being criticised for being ‚Äúskinny‚Äù my whole life I thought I could finally be optimistic about my body. I didn‚Äôt think I would ever feel the need to be self conscious anymore. The problem is that‚Äôs all my mother ever talks about and it‚Äôs never positive. I‚Äôve mentioned how uncomfortable it makes me feel a few times and one time she specifically said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you need to lose weight‚Äù. A few minutes ago she called me into her room to show me a facebook memory she saw. It was a picture of me when I was 7. I said it was cute and her response was ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get that cuteness back when you lose weight‚Äù. I asked what her obsession with my weight is [which was rude I know but I‚Äôm tired] and she just said I just look different. In August, she visited me while I was away for school and convinced herself that I was bigger. Mind you I have been a size 10 since early 2022. I have had the same pairs of jeans since I purchased them in April last year. My mom is typically a size 12-14 and and she asked to borrow my jeans. I mentioned that they were a size 10 and I didn‚Äôt think she would fit but she did. Cue the weight gain comments but I remained quiet which she tormented me about. On Wednesday I went to get my hair done and I had my passport with me. My passport photo was taken over 4 years ago when I was 16 and still 45kg. She made it a point to show it to everyone in the salon and commented on how ‚Äúpretty I used to be‚Äù. My Aunty made the same comment earlier this year but I chose to ignore it at the time. The same day we went to a store and I was trying clothes on. I found a denim dress I really liked and got a smaller size which happened to be a medium. Everything else was a large and sometimes you can tell if you can fit something just by looking at it. She handed me the bigger size as well and asked me to try it. I tried the medium one first and it fit really well. For 5 minutes I looked into the mirror and and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so pretty‚Äù. It was the first time it happened in months and everyone in the store agreed that I looked cute in the dress. While I was in the changing room, she found a beautiful emerald dress and she brought me the biggest size which happened to be huge on me because it was an extra large. The lady in the store brought me a medium and it was the perfect fit. Anyways time to pay for the items comes and she asked which denim dress I got and I was honest about it being the smaller one since it was the only one I tried. She stood here in disbelief and forced me to try the bigger size over the dress I had on and it was obviously too big because it wasn‚Äôt my size. For the last two years, my perspective of my body has changed so much to a point where I can barely look at myself in the mirror. I feel so self conscious all the time and I‚Äôve cut myself off from everyone. I‚Äôm in uni and I don‚Äôt have any friends because I can‚Äôt help but feel like people are judging me every time the look at me. Now I‚Äôm wondering if these comments are actually true or if it‚Äôs all in my head. Maybe I‚Äôm actually too big and need to lose weight. I‚Äôm 20, 5‚Äô6, a size 10 and apparently I‚Äôll lose weight when I get heartbroken. I just want it to be over because surely these comments should have stopped if I have mentioned how uncomfortable it makes me more than 3 times.",My mom is bothered by my weight and it‚Äôs taking a toll on me,18ou82w,1703294488.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ou82w/my_mom_is_bothered_by_my_weight_and_its_taking_a/,
"We met in our first year of grad school. We both lived on the rougher side of town and would walk each other home after drinking until late. Summer term came around and he got some temp work that took him away a few months. During our last outing he admitted that a big motivation for him going back to grad school was to find a girlfriend and that if he didn't he might quit. Unknown to both of us, we both had our eyes on the same girl. I had three months alone with her and during those three months we dated a few times. But about a month after he got back to campus she started dating him. 

The next year, him and I got an apartment together with another grad student. It's been over a year and we're still living together. I've since started dating someone else, another grad student, and she is lovely. She told me my roommate is a creep and hits on all the girls in the classes that he TA's for. She even told me he made a move on her and touched her inner thigh when reaching for her laptop that was placed on her lap. I guess this isn't really known in my social circle, but it is in her's. This being the case, she's insistent upon not spending time at my apartment, and this has caused further distance between me and my roommate and his girlfriend. 

I really love my girlfriend, but I'm envious of my roommate. I just think that I could have treated his girlfriend so much better. He doesn't go out of his way to do anything for her, the only reason they're together is because they already had a few common interests. Anytime he has to do anything for her he complains about it. He forgets special occasions and even waited until the day of to get her a birthday gift. He spends 3-4 days a week apart from her when they live only a few blocks away. I've talked to him about what he wants out of a relationship and he says a big family which according to him is something they're gonna have to work on because she isn't that interested in having kids. 

He hasn't utilised his time in grad school very well. He swapped advisors twice and is dropping out at the end of this academic year. He's honestly not that motivated to actually get work done and comes off to me as someone interested in appearing to have esoteric knowledge more than actually contributing to a field of study. He's reapplying for programs and says that his girlfriend and him are going to go long distance for the next two years. 

All of this and she still fawns over him. It's terrible of me to say, but I really hope he doesn't get into another graduate program. ",I'm envious of my friend's relationship,18ou6xt,1703294398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ou6xt/im_envious_of_my_friends_relationship/,
So I had a stuffy nose and I wanted to trip at the same time. So yeah Benadryl. To be honest it was actually kind of interesting I took like two handfuls. All I know it was the rest of the bottle. I passed out early and woke up at like 2 am. I went to the kitchen and I smelled something cooking. I saw my mom cooking something in there and I had a whole ass conversation with her. Then I blinked she disappeared and the pot wasn't on the stove. I was shocked. Then I realized I took at least 200mg of Benadryl. Yeah so I had to shit really bad so I sat down on the toilet started shitting and I was staring at the bathroom mat. It looked like there was some type of trench warfare going on in that shit its hard to explain. Like a whole ass WWII battle in my bathroom. I checked my phone. Apparently I was on the toilet staring at the bathroom mat for at least 20 minutes. I realized I should probably try to get my shit together and just go back to sleep. Only problem was when I layed back in bed I swore there was bugs crawling all over me. There wasn't. I was just fucked up. So I stayed up all night tweaking off Benadryl. Luckily I didn't see the hatman. I went into school still tweaking until like 4th period. It was a learning experience I'll say. Also I couldn't shake the feeling of bugs crawling all over me until I researched my symptoms like a few days later. I had this shit called like tactile hallucinations caused by abusing drugs.

My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt ever really seem to have any interest in how my work is going, how my day was, how I am, etc. as she never asks about any of it, and even when I try to talk to her about that or my hobbies or anything she just ends up going on her phone in the middle of me talking and just stops responding. My friends are so willing to just talk about their jobs and the things going on in their lives, but as soon as I try to share anything about me they either interrupt or clearly stop paying attention.

When I talk to anyone, I love to hear what they have to say, how things are going for them or what struggles they‚Äôre having, or even just random stories. I love asking questions and digging further into whatever they‚Äôre talking about. I ask my girlfriend questions every single day about how she is or how her day is going, we will have conversations about her day that last nearly an hour, but as soon as I relate anything to me or try to talk about my day without her asking, she shuts down and stops paying attention, or she might even just put a show on before I can even start talking. 

I‚Äôve always been insecure about ‚Äútaking up space or people‚Äôs time‚Äù and I‚Äôm very conscious about how much I‚Äôm talking or if it‚Äôs something that the other person might find valuable or not, which is something I‚Äôve been working on for quite some time.

"Trigger Warning: Death

It‚Äôs been a rough year for me and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me right now. My aunt, who was like a second Mom to me, died in Jan 2023. My own Mom passed away five years ago, so having this ‚Äúsecond Mom‚Äù pass away felt like my heart shattered in a million pieces. Today December 22nd, is her birthday actually.

A person who I considered my closest friend has practically become a stranger to me. I‚Äôve known this person for 15 years. In April of this year, she started to become distant. I asked her if everything was fine, she said yes but I could tell someone was wrong. After a few months I stopped asking her to hang out because she always had reasons why she couldn‚Äôt. She never made plans with me even though she‚Äôd constantly say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out soon‚Äù. 

It was a miracle I didn‚Äôt get fired from the job I had earlier in the year. I‚Äôm not the type of person who talks to my manager or co-workers about my personal problems, but things began to affect me at work so badly I had to eventually be honest with my manager. I‚Äôve never had so many breakdowns in front of a manager like I did with this one.

I‚Äôm taking some college courses because I‚Äôm doing a career change. It‚Äôs only from the kindness of professors who let me turn in assignments late or take tests late, that I passed my classes. I don‚Äôt regret taking the classes, but it took so much out of me. 

Managing depression, anxiety, and ADHD has been exhausting. Oh depression and anxiety increasing? Well that means ADHD meds aren‚Äôt working. Oh life is falling apart because unmanaged ADHD makes it difficult to function? Hello increased depression and anxiety. 

Therapist and I had to part ways due to financial reasons. I knew her for 9 years, she saw me pretty much everything in my life, including my Mom dying. It‚Äôs sucked having another familiar person be gone from my life. 

A guy I met, who I ended up falling really hard for, ended things a few weeks ago. I wasn‚Äôt even looking to date, we just happened to meet. Life felt blissful in the month of knowing him. I was laughing again, getting excited for things, experiencing what it was like to have something healthy with someone. 

The last week or so, I‚Äôm either in a state of depression or anger. The depression I‚Äôm familiar with, it‚Äôs awful, but at least I have some tools to help myself. The anger is so confusing though. My fuse is so short, I‚Äôll get pissed off over small things. I try not to take it out on people because I know it‚Äôs never them, it‚Äôs me. But sometimes I snap and I can‚Äôt control the rage that comes up. I feel like I‚Äôm walking around with a huge stormy cloud over me. I try to outrun it but it‚Äôs still there.

For the people who are around, I feel like they don‚Äôt see me. They haven‚Äôt once asked me how are you? Despite me telling these people how much I‚Äôve struggled this year.

It hurt her worse than I thought I would, so I immediately apologized and explained myself. When she explained why it hurt her, it made sense.

TW: child-on-child sexual assault. self-harm, suicide.

i‚Äôm 18, 19 next month. my adolescence was plagued by so much sexual guilt and was never given a talk about consent or boundaries growing up, only being told when sitting with my parents that porn was bad when i was 13. however this does not excuse any of the evil pain i caused and i wish i knew how to work past everything in a way that would help everyone involved, but ive felt so emotionally and motivationally paralyzed, and I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve anyone‚Äôs love or support.

i wish i knew the reason i felt like what i did was okay. despite my brief conversation with my parents about porn being wrong, being in a christian school from 8-14, i hadn‚Äôt really learned from anyone close to me the importance of boundaries. i become heavily addicted to porn when i was 11-15, and a lot of stuff i saw from places on reddit, i thought were normal behaviors to partake in, like viewing celebrities in a sexual context without their consent or just the entire step-sibling content, which heavily distorted my view of family and created some really unhealthy feelings as a young teen.

for the reasons i feel so guilty and am writing this post, from the ages of 12-13 on multiple occasions, (hidden for possibly triggering content) &gt;! i would feel my niece who was three years younger than me over her clothes with my hand or pulling her shirt slightly up and and one occasion my younger niece, while they were sleeping. the most repulsive and disgusting detail is that i would at a few points take clothed photos which i would immediately be repulsed by and delete them right after. when we were younger there would be moments where I‚Äôd pretend to play ‚Äúsanta‚Äù and ask her to sit in my lap which has completely left a really bad taste for me when christmas comes. !&lt; 

my mother would have us sleep in the same bed in hotels and at home at times and we were always around each other. eventually, i don‚Äôt know what made me stop, but i realized the severity of what i was doing and how it was becoming more dangerous and would spend every night crying wishing i could go back and tell myself how wrong it was before it all started. despite that realization, i still continued being reliant on sexual pleasure and started sexting with other people around my age when i would feel lonely. all of it has been the root of so many suicidal ideations and when i was 15 I sat with my mom and confided in her and told her everything that happened. i feel like she downplayed it and it caused me to resent her for a short while.  

both nieces are out of the house now, but we still see each other often, and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any distance, me and the older one still text almost every day, and the tone hasn‚Äôt changed. around last summer, the older niece reached out to me telling me about this older guy at the pool who had been pointing his phone camera at her and her friends for long periods of time. knowing that someone else was most likely willing to be that disgusting of a person, especially being an older adult, made me grow so much more guilt because i know if there was another family member around my age who hurt my nieces the way i did, i‚Äôd feel absolutely uncomfortable being around them let alone acting friendly.

recently, my oldest brother was arrested for being suspected of what Ive been told is possession and distribution of CP, and i feel im the only one in my family to share how deeply uncomfortable it makes me feel, with my family calling him in jail and being so friendly, it feels like the family i grew up i‚Äôm finally realizing how uncomfortable they make me at times, like my brother whos ten years older than me  with a learning disability having his phone left in the hotel room when I was 6 so that he wouldn‚Äôt take pictures of girls at the beach. touching my butt and commenting on it being ‚Äúfat‚Äù but my family not finding any danger in it, or my mom touching my chest and saying she can see my nipples just a few days ago which was even more uncomfortable because i had started estrogen as I‚Äôm transfeminine, but was scared that she‚Äôd get defensive if i told her that it made me uncomfortable. my sister would often have audible sessions with her ex boyfriend as my nieces and I grew up, and i remember us hearing it and talking about us being uncomfortable before the abuse started. these are all appearing to me as possible explanations to why i didn‚Äôt initially realize the severity of the abuse i had been perpetrating, but still there‚Äôs absolutely no real or valid excuse to make any sort of sexual abuse any less painful than it is.

later on, my sister‚Äîtheir parents, told me that she was taken advantage of by an adult family member as a child and since then i realized the extreme severity and damage i caused. ive been in therapy for years but was trying to avoid telling my therapist because i was terrified as a mandated reporter that it wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay confidential. but at this point, i feel like if i don‚Äôt share it to her, im at risk of hurting myself. if CPS or the law is involved, than so be it, at least i‚Äôll feel like im not escaping punishment and accountability. i‚Äôve started cutting myself again as a way to feel some physical punishment i guess, but it all feels so self-pitying.

i get so scared writing this because i don‚Äôt want to paint myself in the light of the victim. i feel so disconnected from the person I was but still ive been unable to move on in life in all areas, feeling mentally paralyzed when it comes to taking care of myself. there‚Äôs days where I don‚Äôt take my estrogen because I feel as if i‚Äôm the epitome what some people think all trans girls are, simply predators. in a way estrogen has completely lowered any sexual desire, and i feel as if im feeling more connected to the term demisexual, because it‚Äôs almost impossible to find any sexual attraction to any sexual content lately. this is extremely refreshing because any sexual activity would fill me with so much discomfort, whether alone or with others

i haven‚Äôt dated anyone seriously in a while because as soon as i get too close to someone I feel intense fear that they wouldn‚Äôt feel safe with me if they knew the abuse i took part in. i‚Äôve been so scared of anything sexual with anyone and become almost overwhelming when it comes to consent because i get so scared people are feeling pressured.

in researching survivor‚Äôs stories i saw abundantly that the most common question among them are ‚Äúdoes my abuser feel any remorse or even remember?‚Äù and i cannot feel okay with myself if at the very least i dont make her aware that i‚Äôve felt so guilty and give a genuine, sincere apology, and if either of them don‚Äôt  feel a full desire to forgive me, which i don‚Äôt doubt, ill be fully understanding and asking what they need, even if that means indefinite no contact.

"I am an 18 year old girl. Let me just start this post out by saying that I have never been SAed by a man and I can interact with men positively. I have a loving bf that I talk to daily, helping me overcome this fear. I regularly try to interact with and trust men. Even though just lingers in the back of my mind.

Most people know the fact that on average, men are stronger than women. I have no problem believing it is the truth. However, this truth makes me regularly scared for my life daily. My parents since a young age have ingrained this idea into my head that men are scary people but they can also be good. I hate walking my dog alone at night because of the fear that something may happen to me.

Every time I even see a man a small voice in the back of my head tells me that almost any man could kill me and there's nothing I could do about it. It scares me to my core that men are stronger than women. I've tried wrestling with men shorter than me and they beat me 9 times out of 10. (That one time was because they were tired or because I played dirty). I am built like a stick bug. I am tall but ultimately super weak and will fold like a lawn chair if you try to fight me. I even lose wrestling fights against women sometimes.

This just makes me even more scared. I carry weapons like pepper spray and knives but I don't know how to use them. A man could easily wrestle it out of my hand and use it against me.

To make matters worse I can't even run fast or for long distances because I cracked my patella and tore the ligaments in my knee when I was 16. I had to have surgery but I never fully recovered. It is also impossible for me to bulk or be stronger due to a medical condition I was recently diagnosed with that I've had for years that causes borderline malnutrition.

Just a reminder that I don't hate men or anything and I know that women can be bad people too. I have been bullied by both men and women in the past. It just makes me feel better that I at least have a CHANCE of kicking a woman's ass over a man's because of my height and biology.

I would love to be as strong as a man and do sports, be in physical labor jobs, or protect my family and friends just as well as they can. I just know this isn't a reality.

I know if I were to be attacked I'm just dead and there's nothing I can do but scream and pray someone will help me. If I am attacked I know I will never mentally recover either if I survive. I think about this all the time regularly and this thought torments me all the time.

I hate how my weak body makes me nearly defenseless.

This is just a rant but if anyone has any tips on how to get over this please share it.

"So, for context. I have a friend called Amy and we‚Äôve been friends since we were little. 
We‚Äôre now both in college, and unfortunately she found it difficult to make friends and really struggled with her mental health.

Because of this, i let her stay at mine to take her mind off things. During her stay she met my college friends and took a liking to them. We had a heart to heart and i was genuinely happy that they cheered her up.
Since that visit she wanted to visit more. Which i was ok with seeing as they got on well, however it seems like it‚Äôs a recurring thing. She stayed over maybe 4 times during the year? Her asking me, not me offering. 
recently she wanted to stay over for a xmas house party which i said in conversation that we ‚Äò‚Äômight‚Äô do although there was no plan, but i said i‚Äôd let her know, to which she said ‚Äúgood because me and *her other home friend* would be there‚Äù. 

I thought the language was a bit pushy and i hadn‚Äôt even said that it would be ok for her other friend to stay, but brushed it off. i don‚Äôt know why but it made me feel so anxious.
when i‚Äôve met up with her the last couple of times, she asks me ‚Äúhow the gang is‚Äù and how she‚Äôs misses them, and she misses one of my friends in particular, like they know each other so well, and how she was sad my college friend hadn‚Äôt messaged her since visiting.

 I feel so bad but i don‚Äôt like the idea of her trying to join  my new friend group, bc she knows i won‚Äôt say no? like obviously it‚Äôs nice for your friends to get on, but it seems like she‚Äôs relying on the friends i‚Äôve made for herself and i can‚Äôt help but feel quite possessive over it, which may make me the asshole in this situation.

the other reason to why it‚Äôs making me anxious, is because she‚Äôs been quite insulting to me recently, which is bubbling up some resentment. also when she‚Äôs stayed over she‚Äôs commented on the fact i can‚Äôt cook apparently, she‚Äôll call me stupid casually, just be subtly patronising and just makes me feel weaker and it really triggers me. I think because we‚Äôve known each other so long in her mind maybe she thinks it‚Äôs funny and because we have that bond it‚Äôs nothing deep,  but like i say i feel uncomfortable when she says stuff like that . 

i also feel as though i listen to her talk about anything she wants, then when i want to talk about something i‚Äôm interested in, she goes quiet. or if she texts me i‚Äôll properly reply, but when i text her most times she‚Äôll just read it. She‚Äôs kinda always had this personality of banter and little digs and does it to everyone so it‚Äôs nothing new, but now i‚Äôm older i‚Äôm just like, no one else talks like this to me and i don‚Äôt like it anymore.

i always ask everyone about their day, or just casually conversation with everybody because i know how it feels like to be left out and i want to be known as the girl who never makes anyone feel excluded. i‚Äôd listen to everybody‚Äôs stories and once it was my turn to share, they just cut me off and start talking to each other.

i didn‚Äôt really care about that, i mean it sucks but kids are cruel, especially in high school. but then i found out the teachers in the area i always sit at school invited all of them to a new year‚Äôs party at the school. except me. i wouldn‚Äôt care if it was at someone‚Äôs house, organized by them. but even the teachers don‚Äôt like me‚Ä¶ i thought they had to be nice to everyone. my whole family is out on NYE so i will probably just sit at home by myself, scrolling through everybody‚Äôs posts of all my friends having a blast without me.

"When I was 13, I had a crush on my friend‚Äôs best friend. Everyone around us always thought they were both secretly together because of how my friend would always chase him around and would basically tell people that no one else could hang out around him. Because of this, I was very hesitant about making a move on him because I didn‚Äôt want to upset my friend since I thought she liked him. However, one day we were talking about crushes and I asked her if she liked him and she said no and then she asked me if I liked him and I told her that I did. She basically gave me a green light to try to get close with him so I made a plan. I planned that I would first get as close with him as I possibly could and become his friend. Once he considered me a close friend, I would try to make him fall for my personality rather than my looks since I had noticed that in middle school people usually only went out with each other if they were attractive. Then once I knew that he liked me, I would confess my feelings. I honestly think that she never expected me to succeed (especially since once I succeeded she stopped talking to me and talked about me behind my back).

The next day at school, I asked him if he had Instagram and he told me he did, but he would never give it to me so I went through my friend‚Äôs followers one by one till I found his account. I eventually found it and started bugging him on instagram by sending him pictures I took of him when he was off guard. This kept on going for months until school ended.

During the summer, my friend randomly told him that she didn‚Äôt want to be his friend anymore and didn‚Äôt want him to hang out with her at school. He texted me because I was one of her closest friends to ask me why she might‚Äôve done this. When he texted me, I saw this as a chance to bond and have a long conversation so I would purposely answer his texts 4-5 hours later so that the conversation would continue onto the next day. Eventually, I told him that he could hang out with me once school started again. 

When school started again (this was 9th grade now), we would hang out every day during lunch at school and I would purposely end our conversations right when a new topic came up so that we had something to talk about and whenever I did this, he would text me once school was over.  This kept going for months and I was able to tell that he was growing fond of me. Everyone around me would always tell me that it was obvious that he liked me back, but I still wasn‚Äôt going to risk messing everything up so I chose to wait until he would say something. 

After about 6 months, he asked me if I wanted to go to his house for his birthday. I went and once I left his house he texted me and told me that he had a lot of fun and then he told me that he had a crush on me. I was really happy and I told him that I liked him back.

TLDR: was raped.  Intimidated with gun during investigation by friend of rapist, Bob.  Bob soon later went to prison for 10 years for attempted murder and kidnapping.  Was let out.  Bob took an axe to someone‚Äôs head.  Booked for attempted murder again.

Throwaway obviously

I was raped by an acquaintance at a party.  I *believe* I was drugged.  I felt weird so I went upstairs to lay down next to a girlfriend of mine who was asleep.  I passed out.  He pulled me off the bed and had sex with me.  The next morning I had woken up in my own urine next to my rapist.  A friend had to carry me out because I was so out of it.  When I got home, I slept for a day and a half.  And I again woke up in my own urine.  This was way out of the norm for me.

My phone was off that morning.  My parents knew I was in that apartment so they tried to pick me up because they were worried.  The people that lived there wouldn‚Äôt let them in or tell them if I was there.  My dad called the police but they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything since I was 19.  He had to call my ex, who was friends with them, to go inside and carry me out.

When I woke up I had no memory of what happened.  Just a few flashes.  I called the friend I was sleeping next to and she said ‚Äú___ basically raped you.  He doesn‚Äôt want you to press charges‚Äù.

I told my parents and they urged me to go to the hospital.  I finally went that night.  They couldn‚Äôt find anything in my system at that point.  They did the rape kit and gave me plan b and I went home.

I had a bump on my head from him pulling me down and hitting my head on a dresser.

The police questioned me in front of my parents.  The same stuff you hear everywhere.  They were hung up on my drinking and what I was wearing (a sweatshirt and jeans).  They took my clothes and I never got them back.  After their questioning in the hospital I hardly heard from them.  The case was later dismissed.

They questioned my rapist once. I knew because I asked him. 
I don‚Äôt know who else they questioned. If anyone.

That isn‚Äôt the worst part.


A month later on May 13th.  I know the exact date because it was my birthday.  

A friend of my rapist.  Call him Bob.  We were also acquaintances.  Bob came into my work wearing a big straw hat.  He went straight into the bathroom.  He was with maybe 3 other guys.  They all casually surrounded my register looking at candy or whatever.  Bob came out and stood near the end of my register.  He was staring at me and then pulled his shirt up or ‚Äústretched‚Äù to show a gun tucked in the front of his pants.

I froze and I don‚Äôt really remember much.  Something scared them off.  Or they decided they scared me enough and they left.  The only reason I remember why he wasn‚Äôt charged for this is because they couldn‚Äôt make the gun out in the surveillance video.  He later messaged me saying ‚ÄúI always have my gun on me‚Äù.  Basically saying ‚Äúnothing personal‚Äù.  So we do know he did in fact have a gun on him. 

They had also posted a lookout, later seen in the video footage, walking the front of the building and the car was idle outside

My parents had to move us to another city to keep me safe from him.  Luckily now I‚Äôm still states away.

Today, I looked and saw an arrest date for two days later on the county website.  So he may have been booked and questioned but the case says dismissed.  

He was sent to prison for attempted murder and kidnapping not much later.  He got 10 years.

He was let out of prison.  I don‚Äôt know how much time he actually served.  He was also ex military which is a big part of this but I can‚Äôt go into detail.  I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize anything by this being seen.

Now‚Ä¶as of a few months ago, he was booked again for attempted murder.  He tried to kill someone with an axe to the head.

The family of his victim has reached out to me because I knew him and I have a case documented against him. 

So there‚Äôs most of it. 

I no longer want to prosecute my rapist.  He has kids now.  I just can‚Äôt.

What, if anything, CAN I do at this point?

I would like the department to answer for not doing more in my case, which left an armed and dangerous man out in the street to hurt someone else.

I want to make sure Bob stays in prison.  I want to protect myself and my family.  I want to make sure his recent victim‚Äôs family gets their justice.

"I never had many friends in school. Hell, Im not even 21, and I only keep in regular contact(weekly at worst) one person from the entirety of my schooling days. When I was entering middle school, I was nervously excited. I wanted to meet new people, but hated, and ignored social heirarchy. My first class I sat in the back next to the only person why wasnt really socialising. I said hi, she said hi back. Over that semester we would talk about new games and media that were releasing, and became friends. Then I went on a vacation, and had a siezure, the type you see in movies. Thankfully a nurse was on board, and I was ok. Thats when I started having just about every ounce of independance taken away. Over the course of that vacation, and the week following, I had my school schedule cracked down on hard, I had my screen time drasticly cut, I couldnt even enjoy these things more on weekends. After the vacation, I took time off school to get some testing done. I was having mini seizures frequently, and large ones occasionally. After the MRI, I was told I had a tumor in my right temporal lobe. I didnt know how to process this, but told the one person who I was friends with at the time. She got up, and gave me a hug. It took everything for me not to cry. We started talking out of school via text and other services, as she was in a shitty home situation via parents that would range from being really close to each other one day, to being enemies the next, in a trailer home, with 3 cays, 3 kids, and the parents. Late middle school I told her I had a massive crush on her, and she laughed and said she did too, so we dated the only way people who are lack independance could. School. The end of middle school is when I lost more, and she lost more. I was forced onto a diet for seizures that were now happening almost daily, screen time was an hour of non essentials, and bed time qas strictly enforced. I remember living for the hugs I would get before classes started. Then it got worse. I was failing classes via adhd, and feeling like all I could do was make it another day. I would forget food, get bullied, and would often cry muself to sleep at night. The surgeon in my state(Alaska) said he didnt wanna operate via how close the tumor was to the brain stem. At this point I looked much more resiliant than I was. I have been told recently that I was a piller for people, but I didnt feel like one. When the surgeon told me he didnt wanna operate, I got hit with a bullet to the head. I remember breaking down, and this girl, who told me the only reason her life was bearable was her friends, did the best job of making me feel like someone understood what I was going through. Then things got stable. I was able to do after school stuff, hang out with friends more, and rules got more lax. This is when I got hit with another bullet. She said she was moving after this school year. It didnt dawn on me how much it would hurt. Then I made more friends, was granted a wish from Make a wish, and all seemed good. Then I started a new set of seizure meds. These gave me IBS, and I lost 50 poinds. I was 5'8 and 110 pounds, with stomach cramps, frequent wet bowel movements. They got so bad I was missing school. Then covid hit. I went from seeing her 5 days a week to maybe once, to not at all. Then she moved. We kept talking to each other, but broke off any relationship we had via large distance and my medical problems. Fast foreward 2 years, and im seizure free, out of school, and try to talk to her again. It goes decently, but then she stops talking to me. One of the only people who made sure I was more than ok, gone from my life completely. I still have the occasional dream about her, and I wake up crying, not only because I miss her, but because I wish I could have helped her the way she helped me.",I kind of wish she broke my heart...,18orw1z,1703287486.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18orw1z/i_kind_of_wish_she_broke_my_heart/,

Mother has now raked in an impressive 78k (not in dollars), and the person she has got in debt from is a close friend of mine.

I work free lance and since the economy is shitty, I have been hard pressed to make ends meet. My kids no longer have nice clothes, something that I took great pride in, and I haven't been able to get my daughter's glasses made. I am sick and tired of asking people for help. I am stuck in a never ending spiral of debt that begins and ends at my mother's. My back aches and I haven't been able to sleep with this constant worry on my shoulders. I was able to make ends meet and now I cannot. I cannot take on more work, I cannot buy shoes for the kids nor new jackets that they desperately need. I cannot stay on top of my payments, all because of her. I come from a culture where taking care of your parents is obligatory, but i am chafing at the bit. I constantly have to ask my friends to chip in and I'm scared they will eventually get tired of me. My own expenses are nil at this point. I have no jacket, only a sweater.

"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm 26 years old and have struggled with my drinking since I was 15. After a DWI, breaking a tooth while blacked out, failed friendships, ruined relationships, and just many more happenings that are too embarrassing to recount, I‚Äôve called it quits. 

In this past month of my sobriety, I‚Äôve gone through a breakup and the death of a dear pet, and not once have I decided to turn to alcohol. For once, life feels hopeful. I‚Äôm learning helpful coping skills through weekly therapy, and becoming more comfortable with relying on friends and family for support.

Anyway some childhood friends I‚Äôve known since I was like 4 came to my country and whenever They do we see them. Each time it‚Äôs like no time has passed and easily makes my year, there‚Äôs a similar sense of humour, all of us get along so well and it‚Äôs like perfect to me.

"I have a considerable age gap in my relationship (25F 20M). I understand it seems strange and might raise a few eyebrows. We‚Äôre both medical students, in the same year, so in the same stage of life, and honestly before him, I never ever thought i would go for someone younger than me in my mid-20s, not even a year younger.

He pursued me for many months and I kept saying no, no it‚Äôs ridiculous, the age gap is too big, but i ended up opening up a bit and falling for him.

it‚Äôs been really great so far. We‚Äôre together for a year and living together, and I can say he communicates better and is much more mature than the people I‚Äôve dated who are 30-35 (i might have just been picking lousy people from that age group, who knows). He can talk to my mom for hours, which is extremely important to me (having an understanding with my family), and is something none of my prior relationships have been able to really accomplish (my mom is living in the US but has really kept her personality and values from her home country lol, i think this makes her come off as a bit scary or reserved to american guys).

However, sometimes i get a bit scared thinking about the future. i want children someday, and he‚Äôs mentioned marriage / children after medical school, and he talks so seriously. i get nervous about having children during residency. I also get nervous at the thought of being 31 when he‚Äôs 26, 39 when he‚Äôs 33, more tired than him maybe. Maybe he‚Äôll have more energy than me? 

This is so shallow and silly but I get worried about my looks fading before his, maybe he‚Äôll want to be with women his age or younger. He hasn‚Äôt really given me any reason to think this way, I guess it‚Äôs just societal norms, and the fact that it‚Äôs considered more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for the guy to be older. At the end of the day this is my choice to make and I‚Äôm happy with him, but sometimes these things weigh on my mind.

"hi first and foremost i‚Äôm sorry this is so long 
i‚Äôm really confused so please anybody if please can look at this with a fresh point of view and let me know something anything that would be great bc im losing my mind over it. im desperate 

i‚Äôm 24 (f) my best friend is 26 (m) 
we‚Äôve been friends for 2 years and in those two years we‚Äôve gotten extremely close to the point that we hang out almost every day. 
our friendship started off as a drunken night
 we were had only spoken to eachother in work place previously. 

I was at the club with some of my friends and he spotted me in the crowd so i walked over to say hi. for the rest of the night i was between both crowd of my friends and him with his. eventually the night ended and me and him made plans to smoke at his place after the club. once we were there ofc naturally we smoked and the conversation of hooking up was brought up. i always thought he was attractive and he admitted to find me attractive as well but was unsure about the idea bc we worked together. nonetheless we kissed.. we had sex for the first time. ever since then we‚Äôve been pretty much inseparable. although that first meeting we decided to not catch feelings as we weren‚Äôt eachothers typical type. i was the first to actually say ‚Äú hey let‚Äôs not fall for eachother and keep it causal ‚Äú in fear that i didn‚Äôt wanna look so clingy 
it started off as hooking up very casually here and there then it lead to hanging out without sex sometimes. 

i‚Äôve moved into the city about 8 months ago and i happen to live around the corner from him bc my job is also next to him which he no longer works at 
nowadays we spend almost everyday together 

i bring ingredients to his place just to cook dinner together so we can together as well. every holiday that comes around we do movie days count down where we watch a related movie to the season, i‚Äôll lay on him and recently we completely intertwine our bodies to be closer literally we cuddle. i rub his hair and tickle his arms with my nails bc he asks me to. sometimes we also  takes naps together.  

we text everyday from morning till one of us sleeps and not only text but calls for over an hour we talk on all platforms at the same time. we could be having 3 different conversations on 3 apps simultaneously. 
he‚Äôs been the one to watch my pet when i‚Äôm away to see my family 
he will come pick me up sometimes when i need a ride and we will go out to eat just the two of us but we never call it a date. 
he will play hit me (not painful just playful) and tease me and it always just feels like a non sexual excuse to touch me. don‚Äôt get me wrong he does it in a sexual way too. 

when i talk about cute guys he gets jealous i think bc he tells me he doesn‚Äôt care or that they look ‚Äúmid‚Äù sometimes he will even say doesn‚Äôt he look like me? he will do the same with me and talk about pretty girls and show me pictures when i tell him to pursue he shakes it off and says eh too much work 

i‚Äôve met his brothers and been the only invite to go out with them out of our mutual friend group. i‚Äôve been to their birthdays unlike any of his friends here im the only girl he invites 

on his birthday he was really drunk. he told me ‚Äú i feel like i like you because when you‚Äôre not here i notice, almost like i miss you. it‚Äôs weird because we get along so well in every sense but i just don‚Äôt get overprotective like i have in the past with other woman. ‚Äú i told him ‚Äúwell if we‚Äôre both 40 and single let‚Äôs just marry eachother at least we know we would get along‚Äù. till this day i don‚Äôt think he remembers this conversation nor have i ever brought it up again
he jokes about marrying me and says don‚Äôt you wish in love with you?
we‚Äôve never really fought and if we have it only lasts 15 min he ways immediately say sorry if it is on him and vice versa‚Ä¶ i feel like i found my soulmate 

here‚Äôs the kicker tho on why im unsure if he feels the same. 

he will tell me he‚Äôs not into causal sex and when i pull away saying maybe we shouldn‚Äôt he gets quiet.  then i‚Äôll say can we just once more and his response is yeah idc you‚Äôre the one who wanted to stop. i told him i would only want to if it‚Äôs mutual ofc and he said there‚Äôs a possibility. (so mysterious for no reason ü•≤) he always throws it back onto me never  revealing how he feels 
we tell eachother we‚Äôre not eachothers type but honestly i usually start and in fear that i seem like i like him (ik i feel like the queen of self sabotage and self rejection) we both tell eachother it would never happen but i can‚Äôt shake the feeling he‚Äôs saying it  for the same reason i am. i told him sometimes i don‚Äôt like that he says things like pertaining to my ethic background. he said i do it to him all the time  but that‚Äôs just always been over joke since i frequently do it too about his ( he‚Äôs white im indian ) and under no circumstances is it ever like racist it‚Äôs just terms like ‚Äúi wouldn‚Äôt date an indi girl /white guy ) i only say it bc im scared in my past the of men just simply never picked me and made fun of me for being brown. he‚Äôs only ever been with white woman sexually and in terms of dating. when i told him i know he would never visit india he was offended saying it would be a once in a lifetime experience and he‚Äôd take any opportunity to go   

i just don‚Äôt understand these mixed signals 

i‚Äôm going to speak as if i was speaking to him now

dear you,
___ if you happen to ever see this. yes i‚Äôve fallen completely head over heels for you. you are my comfort when i close my eyes to go to bed i think of you and deeply visualize the feeling of laying on your chest being held by you. i think about holding your hand. i think about kissing you with passion and not just a part of sex but rather in a way of love. you are my happy place. you come in my dreams and i wake up wishing it was true, trying to close my eyes to remain in that paradise . do you ever feel the same way? do you think we can have a happy ending? i think about you being apart of my family and how you would mesh in the cultural differences, whether your family would enjoy being mixed into mine. i think about wedding traditions and how you‚Äôd look on ethnic clothing and if you‚Äôd partake in all my traditions as i‚Äôm already very familiar with yours and happily would be part of it. 

please
say you feel the same 
say you fell for me 
tell me 
how could you not feel the same 
could you not feel what is happening between us  
our sex is great 
our conversation 
we talk for hours 
we could laugh for hours 
we sit with eachother days at a time 
we could be in silence and still enjoy eachothers company 
my touch for you is different can you feel that? 
i know i make you feel something
please tell me im not crazy  
 i love you and i am scared to tell you. because first and foremost you are my best friend 
one way or the other i need you in this lifetime until we become old and wrinkled

"Idk if this is more a rant or a plea for advice but It‚Äôs draining the life of me and I need to share this with someone, imma leave out details to not be connected irl  
To my person, I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs male, child of immigrants, living in A European country. I‚Äôm an academic failure, went to Uni so my parents would leave me the fuck alone as a teen although now regretting my decision but it is what it is, been going since 2018 and will finish around 2026, now the following is why I‚Äôm here:  
My father dropped a Humongous bomb shell on me after I failed University exams (again), as in ‚Äúlad you have a better shot at life than me, if you pull through Uni and Land a good job you can marry whoever you want, have a lovely marriage and do whatever you want, look at how miserable I am and don‚Äôt waste your life‚Äù, mind you until this talk I thought my dad to be the most energetic and positive person on earth (he also knows that I suck at dating)  
he told me that when he was a teen he was pressured into marrying my mom by our whole family. Grandma was the main culprit but his siblings were all telling him to marry, too. (Went as far that granny pretended to die of heart failure to guilt trip dad)  
The reason?   
My dad had an accident as an early teen and was deemed a burden, in our culture the wife has to take care of her husband no matter what (eastern Asian) so it made sense for them to get him a wife so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with him and they did, a village girl who never even saw 3. grade elementary school, a wonder that I ever made it to Uni tbh but also I tasted the belt more than hugs so there‚Äôs that  
My mom was brought from the shithole our home country is, she fell in love with the looks and charm of my dad (and also having a chance to live in Europe was probably attractive too), so she fell for dad on the spot. Dad did not want her at all but, as said, got pressured into marrying her anyway   
Now, my dad told me he would have left my mom if I wasn‚Äôt born, (I mean they were married, being able to have intercourse with 0 repercussions was probably to tempting for him to remember that he hated mom) and he assured me that one‚Äôs my siblings and I leave home he will divorce mom  
Since then my world view has changed, not that my parents were very intimate to begin with, but I at least thought they liked each other. now I see every single interaction as what it is, one side blindly in love, the other despising 100% (probably also the source of my incompetence in love affairs)  
I think my question is, how can I make these two/my dad like each other? Can I kindle something or is this 100% outside my power and I just have to bear this knowledge, fully aware that one‚Äôs my parents are alone, dad will leave mom?  
Idk what he expected how I‚Äôd react but, now that I know that someone will have to bear the responsibility of looking after mom, the eldest of the kids (I‚Äôm the eldest as you might‚Äôve guessed), my life just got crushed before it even started. Never had a SO due to incompetence and now probably will never have a SO because, why tf should I knowingly get a poor woman into this mess if I know that it‚Äôs coming? So there‚Äôs that I guess  
Tldr: dad wanted to motivate me to be better, outted that he hates mom and will leave her ones my siblings and I leave. now IDK how to plan my life around this.   
Should I try to rekindle some love or preparer for the inevitable?

"I'm doing the best I can for our family to have a good relationship. But there are actions of my mom that triggers me.
They got married very young and depended on my father's big sister for support. But they fully depended on that aunt of mine (who is lowkey narcissitic and always want to be included in everything). We are 7 siblings. They did not pay for our college education. Our eldest brother was financed by my aunt. Ang my second brother was adopted by that aunt. And my college education was financed by my eldest brother and I am now financing my younger brother. This is the setup that they assigned us to do which is messed up. My parents just do what they want and if they have extra money, my mom would splurge and my dad would invite his friends over for some drink. And my younger brothers needs are neglected.
What triggers my rage the most these days is after 3decades of them being parents, they still don't know how to prioritize their expenses. I still have brothers that are living with them. The youngest is 10yrs old. They are depending on them.
My mom is religious and is active in church. She cares so much about her image to other people and is unrealistically generous. But she would procrastinate in providing my brothers with their needs like new shoes. But if there are solicitaions from the church or other people, she is quick as a cat to give. And here I am helping out. Because i feel pity towards my brothers i want to give them what they need and make them happy. 
I just hate my mom. 
At this point I don't care about building a relationship with her anymore. She's the worst. She is also a bad mother when i was growing up. Shed be doing stuff in the house but when it comes to me, if i am not the top of the class, she will despise and let me know that i suck.

"
Hi everyone. My head is a bit of a mess and I don‚Äôt know if any of this will make sense. I suppose I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm desperate. 

Yesterday I found out that my boy Whiskey is sick. Really sick. 
It started a couple of months back with losing weight and a bad stomach. I took him for a check up and the vet said he suspected he could be anaemic because of pale gums, but we decided to try some treatment first for his tummy problems. 
I really saw what I thought were signs of improvement over the next couple of weeks. Then my worry returned ten fold. 
He lost even more weight, fast. 
I told them I wanted to go ahead with some bloods and an ultrasound but it took a couple of weeks for the insurance to pull their fingers out and get the vets the info it would all be covered. 
I don‚Äôt know if those couple of weeks would have made a difference, or if I‚Äôd just sent him for the bloods when I first took him in a couple of months back we would have had a better chance. 

Anyway he finally went for his tests yesterday. It‚Äôs really not good news. 
He has hyperthyroidism which explains a lot of his symptoms like the weight lost and constant hunger. 
His bloods might suggest something wrong with liver or kidneys but they also said it might be the thyroid manipulating those results? I wonder how that makes sense or if I‚Äôve misunderstood. I don‚Äôt take in information very well. And I‚Äôm so anxious and my head all foggy. 

But the worst problem is he‚Äôs emaciated and severely anaemic. 
He would need a transfusion like, yesterday. 
They said he‚Äôs weak, and not just lost fat but also muscle mass or something?
They said his prognosis is ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and described his quality of life as the same. 

But I look at his darling face and I find it so hard to believe. 
He still jumps up on the counters where he isn‚Äôt meant to be. He follows me around everywhere, eats and drinks loads and never stops talking. 
He‚Äôs the sweetest, most good natured cat. He‚Äôs my baby boy. 

The vets gave us the option to try treatment for the thyroid problem, but admitted that if we weren‚Äôt going to go forward with a transfusion for the anaemia then it‚Äôs basically pointless because they still won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs caused the anaemia.  
They seem to think it‚Äôs so dire they wanted me to consider euthanasia as early as Saturday. 

After lots of discussion and back and forth, and more talk with the vets, we have decided we think his quality of life is good enough to see him through a few more days to have Christmas with us, say our goodbyes and let him go on Wednesday. 

We are all heartbroken. We can‚Äôt imagine it got so bad so fast, or that to look at him he could be in so much pain he needs to go as soon as possible. How can we truly know?

I am still torturing myself over whether we‚Äôre even giving him a chance, or giving up too soon. Is there any hope for him at all, or would it just be prolonging his pain and leaving us in debt. I‚Äôm lead to believe all the treatment would start running into the thousands. It‚Äôs money we simply don‚Äôt have, and we already hit the insurance limit for the year. But I hate feeling it‚Äôs putting a monetary worth on whether he is ‚Äúworth saving‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting here. 
What I need is to hear I‚Äôm doing the right thing, the kindest thing letting him go in peace before he can suffer more. But I know no one can tell me that. There are no guarantees. How will I ever come to terms with feeling I‚Äôve ‚Äúgiven up‚Äù on him or not given him a chance. 

But he‚Äôs old too. He‚Äôs old and tired. 
We don‚Äôt know for sure how old because I rescued him literally from the streets over 11 years ago. 
He has 14 approx on his paperwork but the vet said he could be even older by a couple of years. 
So is it just his time? No matter how much we treat him, we can‚Äôt fight his age can we?

I‚Äôm in pieces. I can‚Äôt face life without this boy. I can‚Äôt comprehend a life without him. 
So should I be doing everything I can to save him, be willing to go in to debt all so he we can have the comfort of knowing we ‚Äútried‚Äù. Or is it cruel to put him through all that?
Are all of these conditions just too much for him? Would there be any hope?

I can‚Äôt rest. I can‚Äôt settle. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve rambled enough. 
I just can‚Äôt let my boy go. 
We only lost our bunny of 10 and a half years 2 months ago too. I‚Äôm still not over her and now this?

Which then broke my heart but we continued talking for awhile more and in the mists of all that I met another guy 24m.

"Besides the fact that I'm madly yearning for silence... is this my fault? What do you think honestly?

Basically 2 and a half years ago I had some ear pain (maybe stress, who knows, jaw or something) and instead of going straight to the doctor I bought over the counter Anauran ear drops. I read the info on the piece of paper and it said that in some cases it can be ""ototoxic"" so I hesitated. AND YET I put them in anyway!!

  
It's because partly I thought that it was just one of those cautelary info, listing even the most rare and dramatic things just to be on the safe side and avoid lawsuits (correctly) but it's also partly because I PUSHED myself to put them in, like ""don't be a wuss"" and ""just do it"" (this attitude is one of my flaws in life). The ears immediately started ringing. One of them subsided, the other not.

  
Fast forward to today there is no moment when I don't fret about it and I keep blaming myself hard. ENT doctors all say it's going to go away but it hasn't. I've spent gazillions in supplements and quacks just to do something, doctors did hearing test and fibroscopy and it's open Eustachian tubes, all of three doctors and a pharmacist was like it will go away don't think about it. It's still here.  
Cherry on the cake I recently started using (rarely, but I can't live without music and I have flatmates) over the ear earbuds to avoid using the in-ear ones, but THIS gave me ringing in the ear that wasn't ringing, and a different sound to boot. I just so straight up hate myself.

  
Tell me honestly: is it my fault? How should I go about it? I'm really in a difficult mood basically every day about it.

"Hi! I, 18F, am tired of being butt fucked by capitalism and the world, to be frank.

For some context, I attend a sixth form that is swarming with wealthy middle-class children - whilst I am a measly council estate kid with ¬£0.39 in my bank account.

I am also nearly 19 and older than everyone in my current grade because, just my luck, I had been victim to a terrible crime leading me to spend a year of my life in a court case and being held back a year in school.

I look at everyone there and I get so sad, upset and honestly angry at them for how different we are. 

I grew up in abject poverty (though I am much better off now as my brothers grew up and participated in income), where I had to scavenge for food scraps, with holes in my clothes and looked after my little brother all whilst being physically and sexually abused at home.

That barely scrapes the barrel of what I've been through but those circumstances alone have created a thousand-mile-long rift between me and practically most of my demographic.

I work really hard at home to be a straight-A student and get into a top university thus leading me onto a good career path because it practically feels like my entire life is on the line.

These kids at school - they've got millions in their family net worth (not joking, that's the fancy parts of the UK for you), they've got part-time jobs - many of them have procured, thanks to nepotism - and most of them spend the half-term breaks in some fancy resort in Spain, Greece or God knows where. Just me stating where they go takes ¬£50 out of my name.

Meanwhile, I am at home swatting bedbugs off my cracked desk, writing notes 24/7 to ensure I don't - for the love of God - mess up my life. It's incredibly hard for me to get a job with my diagnosed mental illnesses and how competitive the market is and I am just so tired of seeing how I live on a completely different world to these guys.

I don't hate them, of course, many are snobby but we are all just kids. I think it's a person's duty to be kind to others no matter what, so sincerely, I feel no ill will towards them.

But man, satirical tone aside, I'm sick of being a victim of capitalism alongside everything I've gone through.

"Me (24f) and my boyfriend (28m)  have been dating over a year now. Everything seemed to be going great. I have been in abusive and toxic relationships before and this is the first time I felt secure and loved in a relationship.  

At the beginning, when we started going out but we hadn't really made a deal to be exclusive with each other, I came over to his place in the morning and his ex was there. He told me that nothing happened and they were just drinking and she needed a place to stay for the night. I didn't make a big deal out of it that day because like I said, we weren't exclusive. 

When we finally made our relationship official, I noticed that he was still texting and calling to his ex. So I asked him to shut it down and he promised me that he will do it. 

A year has passed by after that promise and I never saw any red flags. Everything was great. We actually moved in together and started discussing possibility of having a family of our own. 

2 days ago, it was already late, he was going to bed already and I planned to finish reading the chapter and join him when my phone binged. I saw that his ex was sending me a message requests. So I yelled to him that his ex texted me and started reading her texts. He asked to read it out loud. 

She told me how he had been sleeping with her the whole time and how he was discussing my private or my family matters with her. How he told her that I had asked him not to speak to her again and how they were laughing about it. And she sent me screenshots of their texts which were very sexual nature and showed me that he never stopped talking to her. At one screenshot there was a case where he was panicking because he didn't remember the night he spent with her and pleaded with her not to tell me about it. 

I read all the texts out loud to him. Then storming to the bedroom, demanding to see his phone, their texts. Part of me was hoping that she had just photoshopped these. He had deleted all the texts with her. So I couldn't get any conformation. I left outside, crying. I think I walked about 20 minutes and when I came back he had left. 

I texted him asking if he was with her. He sent me a picture of a store parking lot near our apartment, telling me that he won't be coming home until 1pm the next day and that he will stay with his parents. I of course wanted to know if I should just pack my things and leave by that time. He called me, telling me that he doesn't want things to end. 

So he came back home, we talked, I asked about everything. Trying to understand why this even happened and I still don't know. 
I told him that I want to give it one last chance and if he ruins it, then I'm out. Asked him to block her everywhere and show me the proof.  He has done everything I have asked since. Blocked her, showed me his phone and texts, booked an appointment to couples therapy for us.... 

I want to believe him that he won't ruin it again. I really want to. But at the same time I'm just sitting here, trying to plan a way to place cameras in our home so when I'm working long hours, I can still see what's going on. Same time knowing that if I want to move forward I can't spy on him.

First group, i ended things with my ex-bf early this year due our volatile and toxic relationship then he removed me from the friend group I'm in together with him because he thinks his friends are his. Some of them was my friends who i knew longer than him and trusted. But none of them reached out after that.

This Christmas, we all gather for a party at M's place, i heard M said things that really upset me but he quickly joked it off. Next day, I texted my closest friend to get some clarity, they told me he never heard him said anything like that. They thought i was going crazy and imagined things and tried to give me clarity that the friend won't ever say those things so i told them I'll let this go and give M the benefit of the doubt. While we were talking, M saw those messages i texted to my friend and got upset and mad. Now there's been tension where I've been excluded to hang out with the friend group because M is there. I tried to resolve things by apologising to M and told him about how i got those assumptions and how it could been a mistake. M insisted that i wasn't being sincere enough because i had those assumptions in the first place.

My husband will cuss too much and offend both our mothers, and will generally be in a state of adolescent rebellion. 

I feel obligated in every way. Wife, daughter, DIL, hostess. I just want people to be a little less self-centered and a little more amenable.

"Hi, I have just seen my sisters rings and she is wearing quite a few family gold pieces. I‚Äôm really resenting her lately and I‚Äôm going to ask her to stop wearing them. 

She‚Äôs 3 years older than me but very immature. We are both recent graduates from uni so in our mid twenties. I have been lucky and worked hard and have a stable job in the finance sector that I managed to sign for before graduating. She studied law, and managed to land a stable long term job after a year and a half of her graduating. She recently lost that job but didn‚Äôt tell us(her family me my mom and dad), she lied to us and was secretly using my moms card linked on her Apple Pay, spending about $3000 on the card over 6/7 months. My mom is awful with technology and online banking so this went unnoticed, when I confronted her she was so defensive and came up with a plethora of lies. Only to our father did she slightly apologise but was still denying it blaming her phone/Apple Pay as if it made a mistake. We could tell all the transactions she made as they came up with the ApplePay reference no on the statements when we checked. 

Now after the first time we noticed, my father kept an eye on my moms bank statements but after a few months he must have slipped and my sister then started using the account AGAIN. My dad then drained my moms account so any transactions would be declined and that‚Äôs when my sister finally learned her lesson.

So as she had lost her job and was using my moms account, now that she didn‚Äôt have this she must have been using her overdraft. Her bank was in overdraft and because she didn‚Äôt pay any of it back it was sent to debt collectors, we got repeat letters asking for $2000 to be paid. She was hiding these letters, as well as letters where she hadn‚Äôt paid for petrol and got fined or paid car tax and got fined, which had also been sent to debt collectors. 

My parents in the end also paid of this ¬£2000 debt. Finally the reason she had lost her job I‚Äôm pretty sure is because she failed out of her masters, I went on her laptop a few months ago and looked for her certificate and could not locate it , I found her test results and found she had failed her exams for her masters. 

Recently my dad has moved away to live back with his mother, so that means I was left to pay the bills for our house. I have my graduate job and have started paying for the bills as soon as I started, my mom pays the rest of the mortgage. While I was at uni, my sister had graduated and did not pay anything towards the bills, and now has left to live with a friend who I think is letting her live there for free until 2024. 

I really resent her for everything she‚Äôs done and she still seems to hold no accountability especially as she‚Äôs not at home anymore. But to be honest I don‚Äôt even mind if she lives with her friend, pays rent and has a job but I just don‚Äôt even know if she is working or what. She‚Äôs just floating through life. Anyway I‚Äôm going to ask her to give me those pieces of family gold, I don‚Äôt think she deserves them.",Resent my older sister,18opv6c,1703281789.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18opv6c/resent_my_older_sister/,

Recently I started thinking about my mental health and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very good but I‚Äôm confused on what my issue is and what to do. Ill start with my background, I grew up with an unstable family mentally ill ( depression, ocd etc) mum with an alcohol issue and a slightly abusive dad, my mum says he has a personality disorder lol. I know that my mum had a difficult childhood with her mum calling her fat and locking her out of the house etc. i think my mum and dad have caused a lot of trauma to me so I think I‚Äôm developing/ or developed a issue. When my mum drinks I rage, I‚Äôll break stuff and have no empathy for anyone, I still rage at other things but it‚Äôs less intense. My mum has called me a narcissist and her friends hang up on me and justify her drinking and careless thinking towards me. I have paranoia (also when I was younger), a couple nights ago when I was trying to sleep I believed someone was under my bed and was moving around my room. Also when I‚Äôm in my room (which I‚Äôm pretty much always in) I have these disturbing thoughts of unreal things like people in my closet or people outside my window. Loud noises make me paranoid too like when my mum is drunk shouting. I‚Äôll say a couple more issues. I‚Äôm severely scared of water, I‚Äôm scared of pools and closing my eyes in the shower. It‚Äôs weird because the pool reminds me of the ocean and when I close my eyes in the pool or shower I don‚Äôt where I am so I could be in the ocean. Also I struggle with my identity I feel numb ill look in the mirror and feel disconnected from my face almost. I don‚Äôt feel real and feel disconnected from my point of view.

"I[27F] am getting married to my long time boyfriend[26M] of 7 years because of visa issues in America. To give some context on this situation, he's currently on an H1B(work visa) visa whereas I'm still on stem opt(student visa) which expires next year in July. I lost my job 3 months back and my unemployment days end on Feb 1st. I haven't been able to find a job yet and the only way for me to stay in the country is through an H4(dependant) visa. Moving to another county is not an option because my boyfriend currently has a stable job in the US and we both so far want to stay here. 

Although the marriage for visa issue was always looming in our heads, we were optimistic we would find a job and possibly I'd get h1B next year in the lottery.

Now the problem is, we didn't have a plan of getting married this year and we needed some more time to think about stuff. For my boyfriend there are understandably some deal breaker issues like currently sex isn't frequent, I had cheated on him once in the past. With the job loss, sex and body positivity or any Happy thoughts have been off the charts for me. I do make a generous effort to keep the sex going but the cheating in the past I unfortunately cannot undo. We both love each other and I feel extremely guilty for having put him in this situation. We both needed some more time to make this decision and I wanted him to be sure about whether he would want to marry me or not. For me there aren't any deal breakers apart from some occasional fighting. It doesn't help that I am also my bf's first  relationship. This is a very messy situation for the both of us. While my BF is having to make such tough decisions, I'm sitting here and feeling extremely guilty, miserable and also studying and preparing for interviews because I can't afford to waste time. I had never thought something as joyous as marriage could become so hasty, disorganized and unfortunate. The only thing that's been comforting us all this while is we both love each other and have been there for each other so far through thick and thin. I don't know what to do.",Getting married for visa,18opd2j,1703280368.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18opd2j/getting_married_for_visa/,
"I know it is silly to feel so anxious and depressed when I have a roof over my head, a good job and enough income that I don't have to think too hard about money. And seeing those suffering from all kinds of abuse... And yet I still feel suffocated and hopeless about my situation and need to vent.

So I'm a guy who turned 30 this year and is struggling with long stretches of loneliness of increasing intensity and duration. It's particularly bad at the moment because my few online acquaintances are dealing with constant lovesickness while I am at the same time dealing with my colleagues' questions about how I spend Christmas and can't come up with anything to say. I can't tell them the truth, obviously. That I don't know what family or love means and that I will just sit and simmer in my loneliness.

The thing is, I'm deeply ashamed of my home situation. Of my cowardice and lack of independence. I never had a social support network. I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school life, ostracized by the entire village because I was the designated victim. Then, just after graduation, a day before prom, my mother found out that my father was cheating on her. She confronted him, he eventually fled to his affair and went hiding. I was in the process of moving out for university, but my mother soon followed into my tiny two-room flat, since she was unable to afford the rent of their house on her own with my father under the radar. Throughout my studies, I had a front row seat of six grueling years of legal battle that broke my mother and caused me to become very avoidant with fellow students as I was too afraid of them dropping me if they got even a hint of my messy home situation. In hindsight, she always had a penchant to be very fearful and quick to offend. And now... well, she's still very, very paranoid. Thinks cars are following her wherever she goes, avoids walking past strangers (to the point of tackling me off the sidewalk in the rare cases when I have to go out with her to someplace) because she fears they are going to mug her... but most of all, she is convinced no landlord will allow her in with only her alimony, part time job and my support, so she insists that I have to buy us a house and care for her until she dies because she's now at the age her own mother died and it could happen any day now and I should be happy because I got so much time with her that she never got with her parents, because they died when she was still very young.

... and... I can't anymore. She's so happy and content about this arrangement, while I am so resentful of it. I put off so much of my growth and experiences I would think normal ""for later"" when I have a place just for my own and be independent, including searching for love and finding a family, but as it appears I still can't do that within the next 30 years or so. First and foremost is her constant worrying and her fear. I can't pick up any hobbies or even go out without receiving some kind of comment about how it will be harmful to me. She says she's drawing up those worst-case scenarios because I'm impulsive and arrogant and need to be cut down or I'd harm myself, but I'm an anxious mess who can't go out and do anything without weeks of preparation and in utter secrecy because of this.

I know what you will say, so many people online have recommended to just abandon her... but... abandon her and trigger all her fears... yeah, that will only cause her to do harm to herself or to me. The last time I even just implied that I feel pressured and restricted by the situation, she absolutely exploded and spent hours wrecking the flat while crying ""I don't deserve this! I don't deserve this!"", threatening to kill the cat and destroy everything I own while I'm at work until I assured her that I won't stray from her house-buying plan as this is the only financially sensible option in today's economy. She is deathly afraid I abandon her just like my father and is convinced that if we separate, she will end up homeless on the street. After this I have mostly stopped reacting to her. I still do whatever she says and will listen to her rambling at me (since she naturally got no friends or family left with which she is on speaking terms and I'm the only person in her life), but won't react and don't say anything myself. It's a very oppressive atmosphere at home and I honestly dread returning to it from work.

But I can't change it. What would be the point? Why should I destroy her happiness if I don't even know if I could ever catch up. I can't know whether I could magically be more independent. I can do chores, sure. But I suck at stuff like cooking. I tried to, but my mother would be upset I used an ingredient she doesn't like or doubting it's cooked enough or about how it's too simple and then not touch it, preferring her own cooking and so I ended up just not doing it. Likewise she would criticize me for when and how I clean or on the groceries I bought, always saying that I wasn't thinking myself of stuff is showing I lack independence and it got to me so badly that I ended up with an attitude of ""just tell me what needs to be done and I'll do it"" and stopped doing stuff out of my own volition. Who says I wouldn't enter a relationship with a similar mindset and become a slob who needs to get told to act.

I hate my current enmeshment and what it does to me. But I feel like it has damaged me forever. I know I shouldn't think of love and romance in this situation, as I can only deserve love once I got my life sorted out, but that will never happen and I have this deep empty hole in my chest, craving for some kind of affection that I never experienced and only ever existed in my mind. I don't want a woman to fix me, or be replacement mother like I'm seeing so many horror stories about lazy cowardly guys like me. Ideally I would want an equal to look at me and love me for myself even though there is nothing to love about me. Despite everything. I would want someone I can be best friends with, whom I could support and who would lean on me... but fear that I would end up doing all the leaning because I'm just that broken. I fear that I would be too anxious to return their affection, too anxious to know how to do anything... and instead do nothing at all, hurting them in the process. Falling back into current patterns of stoic acceptance and resentment because I wouldn't dare communicate about issues because I am seeing right now how badly expressing my wants and needs are being reacted to. I just... don't know whether I'm worth having a life on my own. I feel like it's just far too late already...",I never had a chance to experience love and now it's too late for it,18opcx2,1703280355.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18opcx2/i_never_had_a_chance_to_experience_love_and_now/,
"Back story on this fuckery. He was seeing her before we separated. But he kept me in the dark so he could be the ""good guy"" who did it the ""right way"". Instead he lied to my face while I made him dinner every night so he could see the kids. I saw him every day. I'm a stay at home mom. I only saw him, and the para who helped our child out at school. I didn't even have a phone of my own. He kept me entirely isolated from his other life while I took care of his kids. And everyday he told me there was no other woman he was living at our guy friends house. I was just a shitty wife. I knew it didn't all fit together. And no matter how I tried to smooth over the gaps in his story the reason was that he was just fucking lying, His family met her. They love her since they hated me. They love his mistress. And within 10 minutes of admitting this multi month secret he kept from me he talked about our kids meeting her. I want to set fires, kick daisies. Smash buildings like godzilla. He said he didn't tell me because I would freak out. I've been tricked for months or years. Of course I would freak out. I loved him I wish I could fucking smash things. I want so badly to send it to her when he leaves on Christmas. I haven't seen her face but a few of my friends have found her profile. I know if I see her I'll have a panic attack and just start screaming obscenities'. I know thats not the way to handle this --Anyway the letter.  
  
Hi, Nice to meet you. It‚Äôs about time. I am your boyfriends wife. Hello to my husband‚Äôs mistress.  
  
I knew for awhile something was off. The sex was different. He swore nothing was going on. Then one day he told me he loved me and the very next he said suddenly he didn‚Äôt anymore. Less than a day and he didn‚Äôt love me anymore. I asked about you that very first day. ‚ÄúIs it that girl who worked at \_\_\_\_\_ and has a kid (kids) age?‚Äù No. Recently he told me I guessed everyone so it didn‚Äôt count. Thats because when I guessed right he lied to my face.Of course I kept guessing. I knew things weren‚Äôt quite adding up.  
  
I don‚Äôt know if you are the woman who left the dirty underwear in the front seat. That was the day I also found sexting on his phone from possibly a different woman? Or the woman on the other end of the remote control vibrator he was taking to work. I don‚Äôt know if you are the woman he was fucking in the closet at work while I was pregnant. Or part of the couple where he sent messages explaining he was an ‚Äúexperienced bull‚Äù and ready to fuck the wife. I don‚Äôt know if you are the woman whose breasts I found on his phone talking about missing his c---. Or the time he linked our computer files and I asked ‚Äúwhy are there a bunch of pictures of your penis?‚Äù before he disconnected those files never to file share again. I don‚Äôt know if you are the woman I caught him texting in the shower one morning. Maybe you are none of those women, or all of them. It really doesn‚Äôt matter. He told me he couldn‚Äôt even tell me how many there were. More than dozens he assured me, maybe hundreds. But nothing ever physical. He swore over and over.  
  
He lied about you for days, weeks and months, maybe longer, only you know and I don‚Äôt expect you to be honest, telling me I was crazy and making things up.There was no woman. I told him ‚ÄúThe reason the things you say don‚Äôt make sense is because they just aren‚Äôt true. I don‚Äôt know where the lie is but I know it is a lie.‚Äù Later he told me that was when he thought I had figured out that it was you, still he swore he didn‚Äôt know you better than any random woman on the street. I of course hate you. But maybe not entirely the reason you think. When I was a kid my father cheated on my mother. It has wrecked my life and shaped my soul. It‚Äôs for sure been a topic in my marriage. I have always talked to husband since we met about how the only thing that made me absolutely revolted was people who cheated when kids were involved. That when you cheat on your wife and you have kids you cheat on your kids. The time and energy you could spend on them, even thinking about them now goes to someone else. That the damage stays forever. I pointed to it in my family tree and also in his. Decades go by and that damage stays.Generational damage even. And that while the spouse is the one with more blame the affair partner is also shitty. No good person sees a disloyal man and is like hot damn serve me up some of that! But that part is weirdly not personal. I would hate you if you were the man down the streets mistress or the mistress to someone who worked at the local bank. I hate all men and women who choose their c---- and c--ks over loving their kids. I‚Äôve walked away from friendships where I see someone doing it to their spouse. It‚Äôs just yucky. You just happen to be my husbands mistress. So I also hate you for not finding my kids rest of their lives worth being a decent person for. But weirdly for the first time in months I am not sad or mad. Finally. The truth. Or part of it. You fucking freed me with your lack of character. A hero and you didn‚Äôt even have to get out of bed.  
  
In the time since he has been gone I have cried to him and begged to him ‚ÄúIf theres a woman just tell me. If you hate me so much, kill it for real. I could never feel the same if you did that to your kids so if thats who you are just tell me. It would end my love. If thats what you want just do it..‚Äù And still he denied you existed.  
  
Only now when I asked him to swear on the life of our child did he admit he was seeing someone ‚Äú A few weeks‚Äù Which turned into ‚Äú A few months‚Äù which turned into hes taking you on trips and staying at your house with your parents and knows your kids, all within a half hour he let me know that he‚Äôd been manipulating me and lying for simply ages. He hasn‚Äôt taken me on a single date since our oldest child was born. Hes taken you on multiple trips so far. Told you he loves you. I suppose it must be true love. He lied to me hundreds maybe thousands of times over the last year. Like real gaslighting. He lies all the time, everyday and he tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just time sharing you.‚Äù No out of work those are just lies. He lies constantly. I don‚Äôt recognize him.  
  
And thats crushing. I married him because he was my very best friend. I have sincerely in all our years together never lied to him like not ever(Though when he left he did say I told him I would swallow more which, well, congrats I guess.) He was the center of our friend group and he created at atmosphere where you could always say ‚ÄúI fucked up. I caused the wipe.‚Äù In the last few months I have watched him try to twist out of responsibility for every choice he has ever made. Absolutely NOTHING was his fault. He even said I should have known his mother and grandmother were fucked up from the start. I should have guessed he was lying when he told me he wanted to get married and have kids. I have had to explain I can‚Äôt be responsible for not knowing he was lying to me.I believed the things he said. Why would I have a reason to doubt at that point? I didn‚Äôt lie to him, why should he lie to me? He‚Äôs rewriting history and he is just not the man I knew. I would have fought forever for that guy. The guy who said ‚ÄúWhat kind of parent could think there was somewhere more important to be than with their kids?‚Äù Its the line that inspired our second child. My heart was full and I knew I had chosen the right man to share my life with. I guess he found a more important place though.  
  
Thats not who he is now. This man who lies as much as he breaths who I told this week ‚ÄúThats how you tell the truth ‚Äúand he responded with ‚ÄúIts new to me. I‚Äôm trying it out.‚Äù Thats how he regards being truthful. An experiment. I asked him if this was his best self he was so happy to have achieved? He seems to think it is. Honestly if he is a man who cheats and lies constantly then I absolutely think he should be with a woman who shares those values. I‚Äôm happy he found someone in step with him in that regard. It was hell being on different pages of the fidelity book. Sincerely I hope I was a one off, that he never, ever does that to you. I absolutely hate that now he is a guy who lies all the time and who has piles and piles of adultery partners. It‚Äôs not ever what I wanted for the kids. Its not what I want for him. Maybe you are the one who can fix that. It is the exact specific thing I tried to save them from. He heard my worst fear and followed the script.  
  
I know that I should have made a big fuss the first time I caught it. I was pregnant with (kid 1) and we were visiting my family for the holidays. I went into the bedroom and grabbed his phone while he pretended to be asleep‚ÄúI love you‚Äù he sent to some woman he swore he didn‚Äôt know in a role play forum. I threatened to scream and tell everyone in the house if he didn‚Äôt explain what was going on. He cried and said all he wanted was (kid 1) and I. I should have made the smart choice then and flipped my lid. I really wanted so badly to not repeat what had happened with my father that I let it go. It was just texting after all. Like a dirty story. Not‚Ä¶real cheating right? As you obviously guessed it kept happening. I kept wanting to believe him in spite of like, the obvious red flags that everyone who is reading this can see. Yes dear reader, I am in fact a fucking moron. No argument from me. Dumb ass am I.  
  
I loved him. He has been my greatest love in this life so far. Maybe he‚Äôll be the greatest one I ever had and thats just it for me. That happens. I know I appreciated every moment we had together though. I always felt lucky to have found such love.I know I didn‚Äôt take it for granted. I treasured it every single day. There was the other side though. He slept around and lied for months or years, who knows? I don‚Äôt. Maybe he tells you though. Thank you for being the one who was finally physical proof of his sex with someone else and blatant repeated dishonesty to my face. Without you I could never have stopped loving him. I would have been looking through rose coloured glasses and remembering that man I married who believed in accountability and who I would have walked through fire for for all the fucking days. I would have fought forever to keep my family together. Because thats what I vowed. All the days. And that I would never run away when it was hard. He wrote them. I lived them. Hes not that guy now, sorry you missed out on that first one. He was fucking amazing. Thank you for lifting the veil on just how much of a double life he was willing to live. Sincerely. Thank you. No sarcasm. I needed someone to help me get to the other side.I was stuck. I never thought it would be the person he was fucking. Thank you for being my absolute worst nightmare come to life. What a funny emotion to have. I could never have stopped loving him if you hadn‚Äôt made yourself sexually available to a married man. Weird the things that free your soul. Flip the switch. So many things over the years should have killed my love. I admit I was an idiot to try to wave over so much infidelity. Still whenever he would walk through the door I would light up. There he is. My very best friend. He makes the fucking sun rise.  
  
I do absolutely hate you, as I do ALL adulterers.As I said that bits not personal, I just find adultery revolting. I am devastated that you chose to take part in destroying my children‚Äôs family but I do understand that if it wasn‚Äôt you it would have been any of the other women I mentioned. He shot a lot of arrows before he landed on a woman willing to physically engage with a married man, or maybe he landed more tail than I know about. I‚Äôll never truly know. It‚Äôll always be the question in the back of my mind. Lucky him to have found you. I obviously hope I can protect my kids from associating with someone who helped fracture their future as long as possible but I know it won‚Äôt be forever. Eventually they‚Äôll have to meet the face on top of one of those many pictures of breasts in my husbands phone. I sort of hope that you were one of those girls. It‚Äôs sort of funnier that way, I‚Äôll be trying to figure out which naked body was yours like a game ‚ÄúAre they pink and puffy? Tan and inverted? Is the pubic hair in a landing strip?‚Äù Do tell me when I‚Äôve guessed right and sunk your battle ship won‚Äôt you? In spite of all the bullshit you have brought to my door I at least have my sense of humor. I am sure you‚Äôve enjoyed it, he always steals my best jokes.  
  
Merry Christmas. It‚Äôs my favorite holiday. After asking about how many times you fucked my husband I asked the most important question ‚ÄúDid you decorate a tree together?‚Äù I said with a pitiful sob and a sigh. I‚Äôve known about you for 7 days now. God it sucks to have to meet you at all. That you exist to break apart my children‚Äôs world. Wow it sucks. This is me doing my best to embrace the changes in my life I cannot control. To try to laugh when my soul is splitting in two.To let him go to live the life he wants with you. Not lose my shit when I have to meet the person he chose to do this with. So Merry Christmas, here is my husband! The greatest gift I ever had. And while I am done crying today who knows,maybe I will have more tears tomorrow. But right now, I truly thank you for bringing me to reality. I am a bit of a daydreamer and I idolized him. Even when he was doing wrong he could do no wrong. Thank you for bringing me to earth. I did need someone to burst the bubble. To break the last bit of my heart that believed in my wonderful husband.

"My (19F) boyfriend (21M) of 3 years is breaking up with me, and the reason being is because of our height difference. 

Okay I'm unfortunate when it comes to height, I'm 154cm (5'0) and I'm also decently skinny because of my fast metabolism. I do look younger, but I really dont think I look drastically young because I do wear a lot of makeup and act my age. 
My boyfriend is very tall and buff. Hes 199cm (6'6) and goes to the gym literally everyday (I dont know anything about the gym so dont ask anything about what hes able to lift but all I know is that he can pick me up with one hand without a struggle, and I'm 49kg) and I personally think he looks his age.

We met when I was 15, he was 16 (about to turn 17), and we were friends for a year before we began dating. And ever since we began dating, me and my boyfriend have been getting MANY dirty looks. Once, someone came up to me and privately asked if Im being groomed. And ever since covid, its been getting so much worse. We get so many judgmental looks, because so many perverts think that my boyfriend is a grown man dating a minor (which obviously isn't true because we are both adults) and its genuinely been getting to my boyfriend. Hes been so distant to me lately, and refuses to go out in public with me. 

I spoke with him about it a week ago, to see if hes okay and why hes avoiding me (because at that time I didnt know why he was avoiding me) and he confessed that he feels incredibly uncomfortable with all the comments and looks we get in public and hes thinking about wether or not we should end things. This broke me because I truly love him and hes my soulmate. 

I tried to talk him out of it and to help him ignore all the comments and glances we get in public but it really doesnt work. And I do understand how he feels, because hes literally being accused of being a pedophile almost daily but it still hurts to think that a breakup is the best thing we can do because his mental health is declining very fast.

***To clear things up, I was born in 2004 and he was born in 2002. His birthday is in November and mine is in April. We met when I was 15, he was 16 about to turn 17 in 3 weeks.

Everytime we talk, I say 1 word while she about 5 or 10. I don't want to talk to her anymore, it's tiring. She makes long stories to say nothing. It's not always like this, but it's too often.

&gt; In psychology, logorrhea or logorrhoea is a communication disorder that causes excessive wordiness and repetitiveness, which can cause incoherency. Logorrhea is sometimes classified as a mental illness, though it is more commonly classified as a symptom of mental illness or brain injury. 

She talks alone, up to the point when I am in the room while doing something, I don't know if she's talking to me or not. She is often vocalizing things she is doing, like ""I am doing this, where is the thing I need, I need to do this next"".

I am using earmuffs (the one you see in construction), to be quiet and not disturbed. If she wants to talk to me, she has to signals me that she is talking to me. She ends up gaslighting me that I am the one who is sensitive and needs less noise.

our date was fun but that was the extent of it. i found him physically attractive and saw him a second time because he seemed very interested in me and i wanted to give it another chance. 

during this time, he told me that he had an ex girlfriend who lives in another country and that ‚Äúthey broke up a year ago because of long distance‚Äù. it seemed believable enough and i didn‚Äôt think much of it. didn‚Äôt really care not to believe it. 

then he told me he was going to travel with his friends for a week and suddenly i was being ghosted. 

i didn‚Äôt care but i found it weird. also, removed him from my instagram because i didn‚Äôt see a point in keeping him there lol

then after his trip he texted me on my number, said he was ‚Äútaking a social media break‚Äù not ghosting me and then tried to make plans to see me again‚Ä¶which i declined. 

now a few days ago he follows me out of the blue again and starts messaging me. complimenting me and AGAIN insinuating we should meet up. shortly after, i get a follow from a girl that is only followed by him. i follow her back and my jaw drops as i see her story highlights. 

this girl was clearly in a relationship with this guy. she had a bunch of photos of them together with long captions about how much she loves him- and the worst part is these photos overlapped with when he was seeing me. i literally felt sick to my stomach.

"Just once in my life I would like to have someone give a true crap about me. 

I have tried so hard to be a good mom and wife. I am working on my PsyD dissertation and working full time. Our youngest has an alphabet soup of diagnoses. I am the one that does all school, medical, or extracurricular activities. I have to nag to get any help from my husband or kids for any cleaning. But every one complains when nothing gets done. I get labeled as the bad guy when I get fed up and go off.  I never ask for help anymore. It is not worth it. 

It has been like this since I was a kid. I was ‚Äútoo emotional‚Äù when I would get upset about how people would treat me. Always had to be the responsible one. Never ask for help because others (siblings) always needed more help. Picked on and degraded for everything. So I became hard. Took rationality to the tenth degree. Always the person who gets things done. Now, other moms don‚Äôt want to be my friend because I am ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù and ‚Äúmake them feel inferior‚Äù because I can do so much‚Äù.

I got a disbursement from my school and spent most of it on gifts and things for everyone. Got all the kids‚Äô gifts and got things for my husband. Got stuff for the house. Took the kids out shopping to buy for the whole family. Let them pick out everything for each other. I have tried to do all the things for everyone to make Christmas good, if not great for all of them. I have given up on everything.

Husband asked me a month ago if I had a specific item (attachment for my mixer). I told him he got that for me 2 years ago‚Ä¶ smh. He got mad and ranted about having to cancel that order on Amazon. No attempt to somewhat keep it a surprise. I should not be surprised or hurt by this as he normally just hands me whatever gift a day or two early and still in the store bag as soon as he brings it home. 

FF to now, he finally asked me what I wanted two days ago. I told him the only thing I wanted was to be able to finally play a game I got back in March (my current laptop is 4 years old and works great but has an integrated GPU and windows will not update the patch I need to run the game). I have been complaining about this issue since then and he always said he would take off my case and see if he could get a new GPU (sometimes you can add one and make the integrated one a secondary). Because we didn‚Äôt have the money for a new computer. He never did it. So now he is scrambling to find something for me. He ordered a desktop and told me I will have to find a monitor for it. But the rest will not be here probably until sometime in January or February‚Ä¶. 

I said thanks and was semi-happy about it. But my face must have betrayed me (which is rare as he normally tells me I am an emotionless b‚Ä¶.). I told him that just once I would like to not be an afterthought. Of course this makes me the bad guy.

I will be getting 4 blankets from my kids (all they could think of), one present from my in-laws, and one from my side of the family (normally get 3, one from parents and each sibling). And no stocking. I am tired of having to do my own and am just going to leave it empty. I will still have to wrap everything from everyone. And fill the stockings because no one else will do it. Because I am just an afterthought to everyone.

anyways so after it ended i messaged him because i really wanted to get to know him and ofc i liked him and he responded well we spoke a bit but were both really shy and this was my first fumbling

he asked me out like not directly to a date but if im not a total idiot it kind of had that undertone and i said that thats a good idea BUT DIDNT TALK ABOUT WHEN OR ANYTHING WHEN I HAD THE OPPPORTUNITY and of course i never talked about it after that because i was scared and it never came up again. 

then weeks went by we didnt really talk and i started losing interest because his responses were a bit slow but it was because he didnt really use the platform we were on so at one point in october a weekend camp was announced and then i remembered him and went to message him that we havent really talked and how things were going and he responded with all good and asked me if i was going to the weekend camp..!!/‚Ç¨/‚Ç¨:):) i said that i was and asked if he was going too and he said yes things were going well UNTIL I ENDED UP NOT GOING THERE BECAUSE I WAS SCARED AND EMBARRASSED TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

i‚Äôve liked him way more than any guy before in my life and i even WROTE A POEM about him and its so heartbreaking to read because i realized that he was probably my first love or something like that because i cant really describe the feeling i get when i think of him but hes been lingering around my mind for half a year and hes the only person ive written about, first person ive dedicated a song to, and hes the one i think of while watching romcoms.

"Recently, I made the decision to transfer schools. The university I was at functioned almost like a high school and I soon found my mental health deteriorating. Last year, something really traumatic happened to me at my university. Due to that traumatic event, I lost all of my friends. After that, even hearing the name of my university would trigger anxiety attacks. I couldn‚Äôt attend classes, I would avoid people, and I began to loathe my major. My grades plummeted. I went from being a successful, straight A student who loved her major to a B and C student with no motivation for anything. 

Due to this, I took a semester off to try to transfer schools. I knew it was a stretch since I still had to finish work from the previous semester (incompletes) and I had enough units to be a senior, but I really wanted to leave my university. I knew I had to for myself. And so I tried.

And I failed. My major only allows people to be admitted for fall semester, so I would have to wait for a whole year to reapply.

"So my wife (44f) and I (40m) got married in October, and we‚Äôve been living together for just over a year now. We have a pretty solid system of locking the door to engage in nsfw activities, but every now and again, when the moment is there, and we feel PRETTY confident that it‚Äôs late enough we won‚Äôt be getting visitors, we just go for it, right? The kids are all pretty good about knocking first, so it‚Äôs never really been an issue. 

Except one kid, her 17 year old daughter. I think it was several months ago, she just barged right in, and it was like midnight, mind you, and that was a little traumatizing for all involved, since I‚Äôm pretty sure my naked ass was out for all to see on top of her mom. She has been better, but not great, about knocking since then, but last night was an interesting situation. No one ever brought it up.

So there have definitely been some close calls, where we‚Äôve been in the act but then had to disengage real quick when someone knocks. That brings me to the other night. I was feeling kind of frisky and it was late and we were a little overdue for some fun, so we start to get things going. Well, as things start to near a breaking point, I‚Äôm literally hitting the point where I can‚Äôt stop once I start, and to my horror I hear a knock and then the door handle immediately after two quick knocks and I am full-on in the middle of spewing my seed everywhere as I pull out and try to cover up, and there was literally nothing I could do, other than bury my head in my wife‚Äôs shoulder under the covers.

"So, I am a workaholic. I can't stop myself, so I do unpaid overtime from time to time, I do more and more at work and it's influencing my health. Aside from that I read a lot of books to escape reality in my free time. I am depressed to the point where I overstimulate myself with caffeine (since coke is too expensive here) to properly function. I've stopped dating, avoid people more and more and generally my life doesn't seem to be the best.

However, I make progress. I lost an opportunity to make business worth millions, but I found a decent job despite dropping out of uni. My grind allowed me to be able to save enough cash that I will have my appartament by the time I'm 27 (and I'm 26). I get promotions regularly as well. I still feel like failure, but I am working on getting a different degree and I'm still able to hold an intelectual conversation with most people I meet. There are people who grew to respect my hard work and knowledge. I'm glad it happened.

What I hate is people who won't do anything to save themselves even to actually save their lives. Nobody helped me. I could beg over and over and the best I could count on was for some people to make fun of me for their amusement. I know that nobody is going to save me and that I need to save myself. Plenty of people around me gravitate towards me because I understand their pain and I honestly actively try to distance myself from them. I've tried helping people, thinking that if I do good, people will act in similar way towards me. That's bs. They only acted like emotional vampires, needing me to be strong for all of them fuckers. I'd be visiting my relative while they were in hospital after an accident and those people wouldn't leave me alone. They'd act like their gf/bf issues, some emotional drama or other bs are more important than me talking to the person I share bloodline with. 

What I want to say is that I hate how weak people have become. I grew to understand that I can't rely on others, but why do they feel justified to demand my help while they are strangers who didn't even do the same thing for me? Treat it however you want, but sometimes I wish they tried to do something stupid, so thay they can be locked in a mental facility and leave me alone. I regret doing the right thing. Most of the time there was no happy end, just more whining till I told those people to fuck off. Once that happened they'd suddenly go back go normal. I am not going to fuck somebody whom I am not attracted to or baby some loser just because they beg. I seriously feel disgusted by those people, because their lack of drive to help themselves screws up my plans so often. 

I'm writting this post, because I'm fed up and I'd rather vent here than broke someone's nose for talking shit. If you are a person, who still believes their only way to save themselves is by making someone save you, then I hope you get your shit toghether.

I looked for help at the time, but it was made a joke and there was even a person who tried to make me change my beliefs, because she smelled that I was in that state of mind.

"Today is my 25th birthday. I remember when I was a kid I was very emotional and traumatized. I would cry every single day of the year up until I was around 11-12, BUT I always had a rule with myself to not cry on my birthday. And I never did, until I was an adult. Last year I had a small gathering with my parents and my only friend at the time (who I cut off earlier this year for his behavior) the day before my birthday. But on my birthday it was very lonely. Barely any birthday wishes. My roommate had just abandoned the apartment to be with her soon-to-be fianc√©. It was my first birthday spent alone and it was really hard. I had to ask my local queer exchange for birthday wishes which sounds pathetic but they were all so sweet and my post got hundreds of comments. My mom works for a radio station and almost forgot to ask them to play a song for me when she always remembers for the rest of the extended family.

So that‚Äôs why my parents cancelled. Not only am I dealing with the pain of anticipatory grief for someone I love so much, but I also feel like I‚Äôve been forgotten again.

"(Op note: I'm sorry if the grammar is off, I wrote this while at work on my phone)

I (27F) just married my husband (28M) last week. It was a small courthouse wedding. We had no one come because it was a last minute decision. 

We live in different states. He's in the military and we're still waiting on our marriage certificate to come in so we can live together. I visited him for the wedding and to see him then left to come back last weekend because I had work this week. 

This morning while getting ready I suddenly got a wave of anxiety. It started off with me thinking about how I don't feel like a wife. And it kind of just spiraled from there to thinking about how permanent this is and reflecting on horror stories I heard in the past about married life.

I tried to tell myself that I probably only feel this way because of the distance. And I never had something this permanent before. 

I thought about taking the day for myself and to be alone, but I then thought that was a bad idea to be alone with my thoughts like that. So I called my husband.

I dont think I explained myself well and I tried to re-assure him that this anxiety wave has nothing to do with him and its all about me. But I don't think he believes me and kept asking if I regretted getting married and how its not permanent if I don't want it to be.

I want this marriage to be permanent, but that permanence scares me too? 

It's extremely hard to explain and I feel absolutely awful feeling this way.

I love him so much and I do want to be his wife. I think this feeling is temporary and if it doesn't go away I'll seek help.

I just hate this and I can't keep my thoughts from racing.",Sudden Post Marriage Anxiety,18on83h,1703274351.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18on83h/sudden_post_marriage_anxiety/,
"My mom LOVES babies and children.

She likes dressing them up, tying their hair, buying matching clothes, cute shoes, etc.

When i was younger, my mom took me EVERYWHERE. Even to work in our matching dresses. She referred to me as her bestfriend and such.

But as soon as I turned 16, everything changed. She stopped taking me out, stopped buying me clothes, got annoyed whenever i talked to her about school. She didn't give two fucks about my life and would often ignore my messages to hang out (we dont live in the same house) when back then she'd pick me up from school to eat at mcdonalds.

This also happened with my cousins, when my cousins were younger, she took us everywhere and bought us whatever. But as soon as my cousins hit middle school, she ignored them.

Now that I'm 20, she confessed to me she wants a baby. This broke my heart.

For context, she has a very strained relationship with my brother and now.. me. I've cried to her several times how i felt like she left me to which she excused with she grew up in a broken home.

It broke my heart to hear my mom say she wanted to have a baby. She'd rather start fresh with a new child rather than fix her relationship with her two children.. and I know for damn sure that once that baby hits puberty, my mom will ignore it like she did to me and my brother.

"Hello, I am new here. I would like to talk about my problem, my dilemma.   


Firstly, to get a better view of the story, I'm a girl (I will not tell you my age) with a lot of friends, and I know need other people in my life. I'm super extroverted and I never shut my mouth. I love having conversations, meeting new people, and spending time with them. I'm a controversial and impulsive person. I also have ADHD, depression, and other emotional issues, if that'll help with anything here.

I even have a boyfriend (let's call him Dean). I've been with him for almost a year now. He's so different than me - shy and introverted, not talkative, a ""quiet mouse"". But since he's very sweet and opens up a lot when alone with me, our relationship is, I would say, **not that bad.** ( I will say more about why I call it that way later)  
We hardly ever fight, because even if I get angry at him or something else (I easily get very frustrated over small issues) he's very understanding and calm. He can easily calm me down as well. I get quieter with him, I'm... a different person. No, I don't do it intentionally, it's just how he influences me. We're in the same grade, same classes, same friends, basically the same everything. the only issue is... we have other personalities, very different from each other. At first, I thought it was a great thing. This is also a reason why our relationship started - I noticed him cause in my head he was *mysterious* or something... idk.  


Even though we have lots of differences, I thought he was the one. Until... I met KK (let's call him that).  


KK is one of my closest friends. He's my classmate as well. We became closer when I was in 3rd month of my relationship with Dean. KK is so optimistic, he always has a smile on his face. I can talk with him for 3h+ straight and I never get bored with him. He's also a little flirty but with everyone not only with me (even with boys as a joke - he's heterosexual). I love spending time with him and the other people in our friend group.   


When we started getting closer, this was the first time this little innocent thought flew through my head... ""What if Dean isn't the one?"" (I know I'm young, and have a whole life ahead, and I shouldn't even think he was **the one** in the first place... but I did.). I tried to push that thought away ASAIC. And I did, surprisingly fast. I forgot about KK in a ""boyfriend candidate"" way.  


The reason is that everything is much easier with KK. I don't get mad, I'm happy, and the convo is great. Well you see, I have to take a break from Dean sometimes. As my mom said, ""he's too calm for me"". I need someone who is crazy like me and can handle my craziness, iykwim.  


Recently, I had a birthday party. Most of my closest invited: 4 friends from my friend group (including Dean and KK), people from other classes, and even my cousin. Everything was going very well and I was having so much fun.   
I remember KK was lying with someone in my bed. I laid down next to him because I was a little tired and wanted to chit-chat with him. Suddenly he put his arm around me. I think it was OK, we're friends after all. I turned to the right side, so I was facing him now. And we talked like that for a while.   
Later, everything went back to normal, they sang Happy Birthday, we ate a cake, and we danced a lot. I can't remember how it happened, but I was hugging him in my bed. Again. And I'm sure **I** initiated it this time. Next to him was our other friend who was *feeling sick* ;), so he didn't really pay attention to all of it.  


We were hugging. It was cozy and warm. He didn't have his shirt on. This was my first time touching a man's chest with hair, which he has a lot. To my surprise, **I liked it.** I liked lying with him, I liked the way he stroked my hand, and I liked how comfortable it was.  


But it's not the end of the story. Later, were lying even closer. Face to face. It was dark in my room, everyone was either sleeping or talking on the other side of it.   
He was... very close. Much closer than a friend should be. I was almost asleep, I think he was as well. Our lips were almost touching. And he changed that. **KK brushed his lips against mine.** It was so soft, like a butterfly. I think I was saying something about Dean, but I still didn't push him away. I let him do that. Maybe I was too tired, maybe too much %, but it doesn't matter... I have a boyfriend, and I still didn't do anything with KK's actions.  


Yes. I'm aware that is cheating. This happened a week ago, and Dean already forgave me. But this is not the problem.  


**I can't forget about KK.**  &gt;!and I don't know if I want to forget.!&lt;  


He messed with my mind. As my friend suggested, ""Maybe the thought you had at the beginning of our friendship with KK **wasn't really gone?**"". Maybe she's right, idk. But I know that I feel something for KK, even though I have a freaking boyfriend!! And I'm pretty sure KK feels something too, otherwise, he wouldn't do that, right?? I think that *drunk* actions = sober thoughts...  


Now I have to make a choice... a really hard one. in every option, I'll hurt one of them and myself, which is very hard for me.  


**DEAN:** I still love him, maybe not as much as before this incident but it's still love. But what I'll never be able to forget about my feelings for KK? I don't want to be unhappy in a relationship with Dean, just to not hurt him and don't mess up anything in our friend group.  
**KK:** I know I feel something for him, otherwise I wouldn't hesitate so much... If I choose him, I will hurt Dean so much, as I'm his first girlfriend ever. In addition, it would give him a bad reputation in our school as a ""girlfriend thief"".  
Also, one of my classmates asked Dean once, ""How is it to have a girlfriend who flirts with every other man?"", which IS NOT TRUE. I swear, this is just the way I am. And I talk like that to everyone I know, parents, girls, boys, friends, strangers. EVERYONE. I remember I was mad at Dean for not standing up for me because these words were very insulting imo. This question could ruin our relationship if Dean was a little less calm.  


So, if I choose KK, people will say ""(classmate) was right..."". This is so frustrating.  


Some people tell me to stay with Dean and try to forget about KK. Some people tell me to take the risk and try something with KK.   
My mom today told me, ""Time will show what's next. Sometimes you have to take the risk to know things""  
But at the same time, my other friend from the friend group said, ""You have to decide for yourself. I think you should try to fix things with Dean and forget about KK. If nothing changes, then we'll see""  


I don't know what to do. I like both of them, and I don't want to hurt them, though I have to. That's why I decided to ask for help here. Maybe one of you had a similar situation and can give me some suggestions. I really hope for your help guys

"Hey y'all this is a really weird one. 

4 years ago I finished school and started a job in IT. I wanted to become a pilot but covid came and the flight schools shut down. So I became an IT Admin and finished IT school in June 2023. Since then and during IT school as well, I am working in a medical devices trade company. And for the most part I like my job but it is quite boring at times. I really began to get into history and fell in love with the post war times in germany (which is where I live).

The average working hours during that time were 50 hours a week and they were really getting shit done.  I really want that. The feeling to get shit done and extreme working to make something important. Due to me being a huge fan of cruise ship vacations I am really thinking about applying to work on such a ship. 10-12 hours work days sound so good to me rn. I am so sick of working in a boring office with the same middle aged burned out people, that my brain would love to get challenged somehow.

Which is how I came up with the idea stated in the title and I am dreaming of it for a few months now. 

I would love to fight for my life in a Situation like the Costa Concordia or the Titanic event. It could be something similar but I dream of a slowly developing event in an isolated location (like a ship) which you can totally escape by the choice of your actions (so no plane crash etc. Because that's likely to kill you and you can't really do something to influence the outcome). It's just so appealing to me. Having experienced something that'll make you appreciate life and especially the boring moments of it. Having a specific checkpoint you can mentally refer to. Something that makes your brain to become superfocused and using it 100% (I think no one is using more than 10% of their brain in the office) I just want that. Thinking of all the boring years ahead of me is just to frustrating. And yeah maybe I am crazy and probably would think different if I'd really be in that Situation.

"I was molested by my cousin

I am 27 years old male and never talked with anyone about this, even now that I‚Äôm writing about this I have tears in my eyes. 
I was molested by my male cousin and eventually this led into sex without my consent.
This all started when I was only 7 years old, my cousin was 16 at that time he started threatening me that if I wouldn‚Äôt do what he tells me he would beat me and tell my family things that weren‚Äôt true about me, and he knew that everyone would believe him since he was older than me. This went on and on for years, after a few years when I was 11 I was fed up with this and tried to kill myself but what did I know about the ways of killing myself at that time? 
This continued till I was 14 years old and you do the math about how old he was..
I fell into deep depression since that time and I never got the courage to tell my family even for my depression and let alone about what happened to me, i still time to time see that cousin and he stills sometimes reminds me about those times and tells me ‚Äú you my little boo I miss fucking you and your little virgin ass‚Äù, I never recovered and I don‚Äôt think I ever will from this. 
I have nightmares about this so often that sometimes I am even afraid to fall asleep. 
Just writing about this my whole body is shaking and it‚Äôs making me feel a bit better that even though people don‚Äôt know me at least I‚Äôm talking about this to someone.

"When I was a kid around 7-8 years old, my family got me a Labrador puppy, Sam. I had wanted my own puppy for so so long and when I finally got him I felt like the happiest girl in the world. My household was broken and chaotic so I was happy that I could finally rely on a friend. He was there for me when I cried, he was there for me to cheer me up. He needed me and I was so happy to take care of him. I still remember the first day we got him and how sweet he was, his blonde coat, his green eyes and his beautiful pinky nose. Sadly I didn't get to share my life with him a lot. My family wasn't happy about how naughty he was, he would destroy and bite stuff in the garden and they didn't feel like he had enough space. They should have known better than to just get a breed with such requirements. They should have trained him well. 

Once I overheard a conversation of how my mom and my aunt where just talking about just putting him to sleep. I broke down in tears and ran upstairs scared they would kill my dog. He was not older than a year old and they wanted to euthanize him. Not too long went by, when one weekend I went away to spend time with my grandma. When I came back he was gone. They first told me he was at the vet ad that he will be back soon. He never came back. They kept lying to me for weeks until I finally lost it and demanded the truth. They told me they had taken him away to a farm. Promised me I could see him. But I never saw him again. I never got to say goodbye to my only support, to my only friend.  I struggled for years after that. I missed him so much. I never stopped missing him. 

Just recently I started thinking more about him and processing, because I am going to therapy and traumatic events are coming up. I asked my mom again, they told me they took him to a shelter and came back for him after 2 days but he was already been adopted. I hope he had a nice family and that he didn't missed us much. I hope his new family gave him a better life. I hope he never got lost or abandoned again. I hope he knows he is and always will be in my heart, my best friend. I hope he knew I never would have left him there.

Weeks after we gave a big concert, she took a break of the band, so I couldnt really talk to her. For some reason, I've never felt so good and comfortable with someone as I've felt with her.
Yeah, so my biggest fear was not being able to bond a strong/deep realtionship with her. Welp, It came true. She left the band. She is in my high school tho, but she's with her friend group and I dont wanna annoy her (I also have my friend group, but I'd much rather be with her)

"The following situation has been eating me up inside and is really killing me.  I have no one impartial to talk to about this whole situation.

**Background**

Me (28M) and an old friend (28M) have been friends since 2001. Let's call my friend Mike.

Mike never had a girlfriend until he met his current girlfriend (26F). Let's call her Roxanne.

Mike and Roxanne got together 3 years ago. Mike and I moved in together with another friend (28M - Jack, who also never had a girlfriend until around the same time) and my girlfriend (27F) shortly after Mike and Jack got together with their girlfriends. Mike and Jack work together at a high school. We used to be a tight knit trio.

I will try to condense the whole story over the past 3 years in the following sections. I apologise if it is slightly disjointed.

**Mid-Late 2020**

1. Roxanne quickly became quite nasty to my girlfriend, including one particular instance where she physically bumped into my girlfriend in the kitchen at our share house (which Mike witnessed). To my knowledge my girlfriend did nothing to provoke the initial nastiness (I believe Roxanne was just jealous that we were living with Mike or something petty).
2. Mike and Jack kept having their girlfriends over for double dates. My girlfriend and I were often excluded (this may not have been intentional - they're nice guys). In any event, I would have probably declined, as I was going through my own struggles at the time which included an awful marijuana addiction which killed me socially - it was a coping mechanism I used to deal with my own issues I was experiencing during the Covid lockdowns.
3. My girlfriend was really worried about me during this time and even asked Mike and Jack to try help lift me out of the rut I was in. They did their best to help which I am still grateful for, even though I may not have shown it at the time.
4. My dog (4 month old Labrador at the time) ate some free bathroom samples that Roxanne got at the shops (Christmas gift samples I suppose). After the incident where Roxanne bumped my girlfriend, my girlfriend asked Mike if Roxanne had a problem with her and the excuse was essentially blamed on the dog eating the free samples.
5. Roxanne really started to bother me, especially after I heard through the grapevine (through a family member and some people the same age as Roxanne from her high school) that she had been quite nasty to many of them over the years and was not very popular amongst that group of people.  I became a bit cold towards Roxanne due to the way she had treated my girlfriend and this new-found knowledge.
6. In December 2020 Mike texted me to say that Roxanne had told him that my girlfriend had told her that I had been disparaging Roxanne and Jack's girlfriend. I had not disparaged Roxanne or Jack's girlfriend to anyone other than disparaging Roxanne to my girlfriend privately (perhaps this was overhead by Mike, but he never said anything).  I was super pissed as I took this to be an attempt by Roxanne to drive a wedge between me and my girlfriend and/or between me and Mike. Not to mention Mike texting me rather than talking face-to-face as we lived together and been friends for 20 years.
7. Things settled down after this.

**NYE 2020**

We had a NYE party at our share house.  Roxanne and Jack's girlfriend arrived to the party late and when they arrived they looked a bit awkward.  I made an effort to go over and make them feel welcome and introduced them to everyone at the party which they were apparently grateful for at the time.  I am not usually petty so I thought I would let the past go and try to be inclusive and kind. We were going into a new year after all, and it had been a hard year.

**2021**

1.  Same old, same old. Lockdowns came back around and Roxanne continued to have a negative attitude towards me and my girlfriend.
2. Mike decided to move out at the end of our 12 month lease (despite indicating that he would be keen to stay long term (2-3 years) given I had just got a dog and we had a big backyard).  In any event, I felt relieved that the tension would be eased and me and my girlfriend would have our own space, and mine and Mike's friendship could resume without the annoyance of living together.
3. During one of the lockdowns, Roxanne came over when she had been sick with a cold. My girlfriend works in healthcare at a hospital, and I called out to Mike to come and speak with me, and I noted my unhappiness that he was allowing someone who was sick to come over. I should note that I was tripping balls on acid too at this time, so I may also be construed as a bit crazy.
4. I understand that Roxanne stormed out and Mike and Jack's girlfriend followed - Jack stayed home - assumably to keep an eye over me whilst tripping (thanks Jack).
5. Shortly later, I noticed Roxanne had deleted me on Facebook and unfollowed me on Instagram. She blocked my girlfriend on both.  So I blocked her on both and shortly later get a text from Mike to ask me if there was a reason why I blocked Roxanne on socials.
6. I did not respond to the text. Mike avoided the house for days before I finally got a chance to see him in person to address the situation and tell him he had been misinformed.  Despite being lied to by Roxanne, he is still with her now, two years later.

\[Two years without a single Roxanne sighting or incident - things are just slightly cold and uncomfortable between Mike and I without anything being said. I would have loved to have talked about the situation, but it's not in Mike's nature to be confrontational or to talk about things, so I left it at that, despite it bothering me deeply.\]

**2023**

1. I went camping with Mike, Jack and another friend in June. Mike picked me up and dropped me home. When he dropped me home he brought up the topic of Roxanne and the uncomfortableness of the situation. I felt so relieved it wasn't just me. I cried when I got inside. Mike wanted to catch up the next weekend to talk things out.
2. The next weekend we caught up and Mike said ""I want you to apologise to Roxanne."" I was completely taken aback and felt ambushed. I told him I completely disagree with his point of view, but reluctantly agreed to do so for the benefit of our friendship group. I was told Roxanne would not apologise and is very strong in her views and would not budge. I immediately backflipped on my apology promise, instead opting for a mutual apology only.  I was and am willing to concede that I had been cold and perhaps even rude, but for Roxanne to not reciprocate an apology just feels fake and is unlikely to achieve anything.
3. A few weeks later, Mike uninvited me from our high school friendship group's 10 year reunion which he was hosting - the day before.  I had taken an afternoon off work to travel to the event and was extremely excited to attend.  Instead, I sat at home in self-pity smoking marijuana whilst all of my friends assumably had a great time.  I slipped back into this bad habit again for a few more months.

I am better again now, but whilst I am well again I felt like I needed to vent and get this off my chest and out there - a far more productive coping mechanism.

Mike is a great guy.  I could not say nicer things about him.  I am just so heartbroken that this has happened.  I have never had a falling out with a friend before.  I even get along with my ex-girlfriends.

Am I dealing with a narcissist in Roxanne? Am I just a delusional asshole?

"I stumbled my way into a job I quickly found out I loved. I graduated with a microbiology degree, got a job as a lab tech in the core laboratory at a hospital, hated it, quit, then found a job as a social worker with the intent to save money for grad school. Within the first few weeks I finally found a purpose and absolutely loved what I was doing. I realized that I work best in a collaborative environment where I can use my communication skills as a way to produce something meaningful.

Fast forward 4 years, I‚Äôm exhausted, burnt out, and have lost my way. Before you think to yourself ‚Äúthat‚Äôs social work for ya‚Äù I will say, yes, it‚Äôs demanding, but in my case it‚Äôs not the content of my job, but the people who are above me. I work in a behavioral home full of adults that live with mental disabilities. I‚Äôve garnered a relationship with all of them and when I first started working, I could see my coworkers and I implement *actual* improvements to their quality of life. Love my coworkers as they make it easy to weather the storm on our bad days. Everyone communicates well, we navigate crisis situations very well, and everyone is so willing to make accommodations to your schedule. My bosses are awesome too. They have our back and are a really good source of guidance.

Everything in the home I work at is awesome and is a reminder of why I love what I do. The politics on the other hand? Just pure evil. And I don‚Äôt say that lightly. When I started, we had 4/5 beds full in the house. Our residents meshed well with each other and some were even close friends. The office wanted to fill that extra bed so they could get the full money from the state. So, they decided to evict a resident for no reason other than they had two other residents from a different home that could move in. My bosses begged and begged and begged to not mess with the chemistry of the house. They had long phone calls, countless emails, and even more meetings to think about the residents who lived in this home. It moved one of my bosses to tears. The office said they were touched by their testaments. It was pointless. They called one random Tuesday, said they were evicting the resident and the two new ones would be there in the coming months.

It was incredibly sad to literally everyone in the house‚Äîcoworkers and residents. We got the two new residents and they have their behaviors, but it‚Äôs hard not to instantly like them. Regardless of the relationship we were building with these new residents, their behaviors totally off-set the balance we had in this house. Nothing in our skill set helped. The behavior analyst was even dumbfounded as what to do. This led to about half of my coworkers quitting. It quickly became known that we do not have the services and resources to help these individuals. This was continuously relayed to the office. For almost three years now, it‚Äôs been like talking to a brick wall. They do not care. They see our residents as money and they will do anything in their power to keep them in that house. One of these residents does not follow rules. These are important rules as it is required in order to keep our licensing. *We could lose the license to our house* but the office cooks the books and calls it good.

So now here I am. Working day by day. Watching every one of my residents deteriorate and regress. All the progress we made, all the fun times we've had, all the memories we have made with these guys. Gone. Every day is just trying to survive rather than trying to improve the independence of our residents. Now, all we do is try to limit interactions between them so they don't set each other into a behavioral crisis. We have to try and maintain the smallest sense of stability. No longer am I noticing that we are improving their quality of life. We are keeping them baseline. And it's not like we don't want to. The tools and resources we are given do not work. The behavioral analyst is MIA for months at a time. The office does not care. All they want from us is to keep things in order so they can keep their money and keep licensing off their backs. It is so fucking incredibly evil of them to use these people for money. At least three of them no longer belong in my program. We do not have the resources for them. Their ability to improve is out of our hands. This is relayed continuously from my bosses to the office. Radio silence.

Every day is just watching these people live in hell. No help in sight. All while we just try to make sure none of them head into a crisis. It is so sad. I am so furious and tired and broken. I've noticed how negative I have become and how hopeless I am. I care for these guys so fucking much and there is nothing I can do. There is nothing any of us can do. Days wasted away when they could be somewhere better. Somewhere else that would actually improve their quality of life. Fuck.

Anyways, I am looking for a new job. I don't want to abandon a sinking ship. I want to be there for my residents and I want to fight for them. But it's been 3 years with no sign of change.

"

I (19M) believe I've made a massive mistake and possibly ruined a friendship. I understand I might receive criticism for my actions, and I agree that I deserve no sympathy in this situation. I had a female friend who was in a relationship, but we hadn't talked in some time. Common sense suggests that confessing past feelings for her would be the worst possible thing to do. Regrettably, that's exactly what I did.

To be clear, my confession wasn't intended to change anything between us. We had lost touch, and I believed being honest about these feelings was necessary for my own emotional closure and to dispel any unspoken awkwardness in our friendship (ironically, I probably made things more awkward). Additionally, I felt I owed her an explanation for my past behavior. The thought was so persistent I couldn't sleep. So, I idiotically believed that telling the truth would ease my mind.

I tried to clarify that I no longer had such feelings, that I completely respected her relationship, and that my intention was purely to be transparent, not to change anything between us. Despite wanting our friendship to remain platonic, I ended up developing feelings over time.

Now, several days have passed since I disclosed all of this, and I've been completely ghosted. I regret making her feel uncomfortable and awkward. She likely wants nothing to do with me. I understand that no one else is to blame for my predicament but myself, and she probably feels worse in this scenario. Yet, I can't help feeling embarrassed, guilty, and regretful myself. I should have 100% known better that this is likely what would have happened.  Let this be a cautionary tale to others: telling someone in a relationship that you had feelings for them is unacceptable and inappropriate no matter what. Honesty is not always a good thing. Some things are better left un said. It doesn't matter how strong the feeling is to confess.Trust me, it will only make things worse.

A couple of things: my childhood friend (also 50s F) and her husband (50s) recently adopted a cat.  Neither of them is a 'pet person'  -- they got the cat for their grandson (aged 4).  They don't mistreat the cat but have made it clear that if the cat ever scratches the kid, she'll be returned to the shelter.  They don't show the kitty any affection.  I am a big animal lover and this bothers me quite a bit. Why adopt an animal you don't want? I am tempted to ask if I can just take her with me when I go home.

He remarried and I get along well with his wife, who I have known since I was a teenager.  They are like second parents to me, which is important as I am not close with either of my biological parents.  What bothers me is that they love Donald Trump and watch a whole lot of Fox News.

Edit: Posted this 15 minutes ago and think I have an insight.  People I care about do things that I think aren't good.  I don't know that I could introduce them to friends that I know from other areas of my life. That feels a bit judgemental.

"A little background info:
I (23M) live with my parents and I quite hate it since they don‚Äôt seem to accept me at all.
They despise everything about me, from the way I dress, the way I talk, my political views, my gender expression, all the way to the women I date. 
The biggest issue they‚Äôve been having with me since I was a teenager though is the fact that I make music, and i take it very seriously. They obviously don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a sustainable career choice which is why I went to media/graphic design school. Now that I graduated, I freelance and I have a safety net until the music thing works out. I used to even have a 9 to 5 design job but i quit because of low pay.
But me making money wouldn‚Äôt stop them from picking up fights for me not treating it as a hobby.

Now to the meat and potatoes, my friends.
I‚Äôm a pretty introverted guy, I don‚Äôt really make friends easily. Most of my friends are fellow musicians I work with, it‚Äôs a very accepting community and they‚Äôre incredible people. 
Somehow my dad doesn‚Äôt like that.
He has been that way as long as I can remember, but it keeps getting worse. 
He truly DESPISES my friends, despite not knowing anything about them and having no reason to do so, it even extends to my non musician friends.
ESPECIALLY my male friends, he has a special hatred for them. the only way I see it is insecurity and fear of any other male figures in my life (despite them literally being my age lmaooo). It‚Äôs super weird, and every time I confront him about it he wouldn‚Äôt answer me and would change the subject.
Thing is it doesn‚Äôt stop there! He always tries to vilify them in whichever way he could.

I asked a friend for a service and I‚Äôm paying him for it? he‚Äôs scamming you.
I can‚Äôt find something in my bag? one of your friends stole it.
I‚Äôm working on a project with a friend? they‚Äôre using you.

The list goes on, it‚Äôs silly at best, but it build this weird tiny bit of resentment, and makes me struggle to trust people when I already do‚Ä¶
I know the best solution would be to move out but it‚Äôs not very economically viable for me since I‚Äôm a fresh grad. My parents also keep telling me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to step foot in our house again if I leave, as if it‚Äôs a crime to be independent‚Ä¶100% bullshit obviously but still leaves a negative image and reinforces my anxiety.",My dad is unhinged and he hates my friends for no reason at all,18oksea,1703267730.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18oksea/my_dad_is_unhinged_and_he_hates_my_friends_for_no/,

"i (19M) was recently really badly hurt by someone i had a huge crush on. afterwands it just started to feel that itll be so much easier to just stay single and be away from all this drama forever. it just feels like a waste of emotional effort at this point.

at the same time, somehow there have been a spike in the false alligation from women against men in the country i live in. for some context, there are very few or almost no laws in the favour of men in these false alligations imposed by many many women in my country. at this point its just scary, af you are seeing guilty from these crimes the second those alligations are made against you even if those are false and ofcourse there is no penelty against the women doing so.

these instagram reels have shown me enough cases to just think that its so much easier to stay away from women forever as these allegations are getting out of hand at this point. many men kill themselves over these false allegations because of the amount of hate they get from the public. i think it is best to just stay single forever. 

at this point in life, im also so scared to be accused of something like this that ive literally started keeping my hands like a wakanda forever pose in a crowded lift to show that im not trying to touch anyone in any way, people might think its excessive and weird, but it just rings a bell in me saying better be safe and giggled at than be in a trouble have false r\*pe allegations on my back.

i respect women, and i will always respect them, i will never do anything that will hurt not only a women but anyone. but still i just think its better to be safe. i think this applied to me in a great way because i am not the best looking guy to put it in less harsh words, perhaps i might be the ugliest and for some maybe giving creepy vibes, but what im told by others, im the kindest and the sweetest person they know after they got to know me. but obviously not everyone know this. i have natural facial features that other normal people wont have because of a genetic condition i have,  so yeah, i strongly think its better for me to be safer and giggled at than be on the other side of bars

it has gotten to an exted that if im walking with anyone of my female freinds, i tend to stop the side of my hand to rock forward and backwards on the right or the left depending on where she is walking so that i dont accidently touch them. im just too frigntened now. even though i love hugs, i try to stay away from them untill and unless a girl specifically asks for one.

i think its just better, im not scared enough that i will ever stop talking to any girl in my life, but im scared and conscious to do everything in my power to stop something like that to happen to me, even if it includes walking funny, or doing movies poses in the lift.

and somehow me thinking that its better to be single in my life never involves me being without having my own family. i dont need a women to start a family that i want in the future, what my plan is to first adopt a dog, they give unconditional love and i think it just might be enought for me to be happy, and for kids, there is oncemore an easy way to resolve this, which is adoption, they dont have to be the same blood or the same species to be called a family. whenever i think of this, it just feels perfect, no worries about anything breaking apart a family, me having and giving unconditional love to everyone in my family, it just might be the perfect and the happiest thing in my life ever.

might get some hate for this post, but think about it, i think it'll all be just right even if i stay single forever, even if that means not having a first kiss ever, or a first date ever. i will still be happy without a women in my life an giving myself a gift of not being emotionally hurt by anyone ever again",Its feels easier to stay single at this point,18ojyo9,1703265534.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ojyo9/its_feels_easier_to_stay_single_at_this_point/,
"( tw mention of grooming )




Heyy in the late summer of 2019 I met a guy on Omegle and he was older than me , smarter than me and I thought he was kinda cute .  he lived in the US (texas) area but was in India for an internship Lets call him RAY.

We kept making conversation on Omegle on webcam and RAY asked how old I was I said 16 which I was at the time he looked to his side where his cousin was seated and they both looked at each other kinda surprised  RAY exclaimed ‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna get in trouble‚Äù and laughed 
Again before cutting the conversation we exchanged socials. 
He messaged me on Instagram and asked me for my snap. I was kinda reluctant to give him my snap since I had a very low score and I was embarrassed little me cared about all these things :(

Anyways this was sort of the end of the beginning.Ray stared sending me explicit messages and would comment on my body creepy things like I remember he wud swipe in my story and he like I ur soo thick for a ‚Äú16 yr old
 Once he send his cock unannounced this was also my first time receiving a dick pic 
I was really upset and cut him off .After a few days he apologised for it and I felt kinda bad too and I was starting to like at this point coz on paper he was perfect. He was doing good in college on his way to get a software job , he was attracted to me and seemed like a good guy overall .


I was always the wierd kid in high school I didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends at the time and felt lonely. 
He gavel a lot of attention many of times sexual attention but I didn‚Äôt think too much about it sincerely he seemed so chill and I didn‚Äôt want seem like a prude 
I wud go above and beyond for his validation sometimes 

I feel sick to my stomach every time I wud think about this ordeal . RAY told me how  inebriating it was for him to wait for me turn 18 . He would often describe in graphic detail how he wud have rape/ have sex  with me  he wud go on and on about it once he even tried to me meet me in public and I was unaware he was even in the area. .he describe how hot i looked and he said he wanted put me to sleep and kidnap me in his car . I never even got to see him in irl but he saw me but I guess I saw  his car in the fleeting moment while I passing by a parking lot .

Ray groomed and he took advantage of the fact that I was young and naive . He forcefully took pictures of me naked while on video calls and he would ghost me when I told him NO. he never cared about me and I thought it was true love like something seinfield had ( i used find hi, funny then) I didn‚Äôt want an age gap to get in btw me and the loml . I learned the hard way that it was not love but a horrible mistake.


One day in February 2021 I had the guts to tell him that had enough and he blamed for trying to get him trouble and threatened to ruin my life . I was scared I stopped contact with him since but ever since then I‚Äôve had this weight on my shoulders a knot in my chest anytime I think about him or anytime related to him like the us , or even the fact that I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable being in a relationship,ray  ruined my childhood ray  ruined  relationships  for me 

The worst part is I don‚Äôt have any proof of all this since the phone I used in high school was damaged. The recipient I had was all in that phone it was my only hope . I feel so powerless . I can‚Äôt don anything it

"I (38M) hate my life right now. 

I should be happy and content, with a great job, a wife (35F) and four kids (12, 11, 8, 5), all in decent health. I volunteer weekly at the church my wife works at, and the kids I work with think I‚Äôm cool.

I feel so alone despite all of these blessings. 

My marriage sucks. There‚Äôs so much to unpack here, but I‚Äôve made financial mistakes. The reasons why don‚Äôt really matter, but it‚Äôs definitely financial infidelity. We‚Äôve recovered from most of the damage, but I feel my wife will never recover no matter how hard I work at it.

This has resulted in a dying bedroom. Borderline celibate, nothing exciting. I‚Äôve never been surprised with hugs/kisses/affection. I don‚Äôt receive compliments, unless it‚Äôs a humble brag post on Facebook to her entire friend group.

I love our kids, but I‚Äôm the sole tutor when helping them with homework and projects. Their activities are wild, two of our daughters are in competitive dance, and they‚Äôre out of the house from ~4:30-9 twice a week. We have three different schools currently for pickup/dropoff‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm always the person dropping them off in the morning, and usually working their pickups into my schedule during my workday. 

I have been the one trying to keep the house maintained, but I can‚Äôt between laundry, dishes, making meals, facilitating homework, and doing the kids bedtime routines. Not to mention I have been the sole person to wake up in the middle of the night with our animals or kids. I‚Äôve been the one who has administered medications to our pets (we had a diabetic dog, and a cat that needed IV fluids), and this past week, was the sole person to manage the euthanization of our 14 year old miniature dachshund.

Last night, I stayed up until 3 am to make sure there was a fresh load of specific laundry for my wife and kids. I had to fix the error code on the washer, which led to most of my delay in getting sleep. But I did it out of love, but no one would ever do the same in return.

I‚Äôve been in therapy for nearly 7 years off and on. I‚Äôm also being treated for bipolar depression, ADHD, and anxiety. I‚Äôve dealt with two sudden job losses, albeit I have more than landed on my feet both times in better situations.

Therapy has been useless at best. I‚Äôve had three therapists, and it seems they hone in on my contributions.

‚ÄúPerhaps your wife is burnt out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you tried doing more for the relationship?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you lessen your wife‚Äôs mental load?‚Äù

There‚Äôs no discussion of why I‚Äôm hurting inside. I feel alone, and overworked to an extreme degree. My guilt and shame drags me down. The last thing I need to hear is how I need to do more to feel better in my marriage.

But where‚Äôs the focus on why my thoughts are the way they are? Are my struggles not valid? My wife refuses her own therapy, and is super hesitant to resume marriage counseling, as she thinks it‚Äôs a forum for me to excuse my wrong doings. 

I hate hearing how therapy is supposed to be the end all panacea to triage and identify what‚Äôs ailing you. At least from a medicinal perspective, I can trust that my spinal stenosis, sleep apnea, and the pain in my testicles (think there is a lump and getting it checked out) are real and treatable.

I like Stephen King novels but have stopped reading all together the past year or so. 4/5 presents were SK related. I like the books but I don‚Äôt exactly want my house decorated with merch. Some were from the movies, some from books, and none of them match AT ALL. One is a canvas in horrible quality and damaged beyond repair of the picture of Jack at the end of the shining movie. 2 more are metal plates - one for the BOOK misery and one for the MOVIE Christine.

So, those have all been stashed in the closet. I asked if he could return the horribly damaged canvas and he said uhhhh I don‚Äôt know.

The last thing he got me is a Lego set. I absolutely HATE putting things together. I‚Äôm also not a fan of legos in general, HE IS. He KNOWS this.

I got him a bunch of new button ups because he had said he wants a new wardrobe. I also got him new pillows/sheets for our bed because we really needed them and he‚Äôs been complaining that our pillows suck (too true).

"My issue compared to everyone else‚Äôs here feels light, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I didn‚Äôt really know where else to go.

I [M22] was in love with [F23] for an entire year. We started off as close friends for two years, and then one day I woke up to realize she meant more to me than I wanted to acknowledge. I‚Äôll omit the details, but we shared many magical moments together, the kind you would find in a book. We shared each other‚Äôs joy and pain. We struggled to get through classes together, and we always talked about what we were going through in life whether it was something good or bad. Let‚Äôs call her Girl A.

After I realized how I felt about her, I spent three months trying to cope with it, three months trying to move on without potentially damaging our amazing friendship. I realized the reason I couldn‚Äôt get over it is because I really wanted her, and I decided to tell her about it. I told her to think her answer through, and that she didn‚Äôt have to answer right now. I gave her a month to think it over. In hindsight, she might have said yes if she didn‚Äôt think it through given her smile, her tone, and her texting me within an hour of that happening.

A month passed by, and she rejected me. She said our cultural and religious differences would cause problems down the line with her family, and that she has so much on her plate, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle a relationship. I respected her decision, and we decided to continue remaining friends‚Ä¶ that was until she ghosted me the same week. She very clearly avoided me as much as she could, and it was plain to see.

That summer, I was so depressed something changed within me. I started messing around with women, I started taking the gym seriously, and I stopped taking shit from anyone. I didn‚Äôt like what I turned into, what she made me. Then once summer passed and my senior year began, she reached out to me wanting to fix things. I decided to give her a second chance because of her apology, and because of what we used to have. Little did I know I would fall for her all over again.

Towards the end of the semester, I realized how I felt for her never changed, it simply faded until it was polished with her being around me again. I made a decision that I will not initiate anything with her, and that I will never try to get into a situation-ship or a relationship with her. February 4th at 10pm, we were sitting in my car, listening to each other talk. Before we knew it, she leaned in to kiss me, and we somehow ended up in the back seat. 

She assured me that she would take responsibility for her actions because she initiated it, and that she won‚Äôt run away. Even if she decides to backtrack on her decision with me, nothing would change between us, we would always remain friends. The next few days we were busy, and then she talked to me about what happened that night. She told me she isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, and that she needs to work on herself. When I asked her what if I waited? She told me not to because she didn‚Äôt want to rush her healing process. I respected her decision once again.

That was the last time we ever talking to each other. I should‚Äôve figured she would have ghosted me again like last time. The next few months up until my graduation was hell for me. I was more depressed than I had ever been my entire life. Every day I woke up remembering she left me out of the blue without any explanation. When she left, a part of me had permanently died. I was cut off, out of the blue, without an ounce of closure. If anything, I had to opposite of closure.

It wasn‚Äôt until I had graduated and I was visiting my home country that I finally moved on. Over the trip, I heard something about her from my friend. Girl A has a best friend who I‚Äôll call Girl B, and her best friend recently broke up with her boyfriend of 8 years. She was heart broken and even seemed counseling from Girl A. Within a year of their break up, Girl A had gotten with her bestie‚Äôs ex boyfriend. I do not know the circumstances or the situation, but what I did find funny is this: Girl A is Burmese, and she said she can‚Äôt ever see herself marry in her community because she hates everything about them, what their values are, their mindset, etc. The man she currently dates is Burmese. 

That was the last I had heard of her in 6 months‚Ä¶ Well, until I saw her walk into my gym three days ago. We made eye contact, we didn‚Äôt exchange any words, and she tried walking away as soon as we saw each other. I actually talked to her boyfriend since we were acquaintances back in high school which I find kind of funny. Anyways, yesterday at 3:48am, I received a paragraph sized text from her. We haven‚Äôt traded any messages since March, so it was a big shock to me.

She apologized to me very vaguely once, and continued to talk about how much she appreciated me and how much she cherishes the memory of what we once were.

"So quick recap:
Together 20 years, married 6, she had an affair before Rona, and again two years later with same guy, left her, she claimed mental health issues caused it, and I tried to be amicable till this week when she took me off her work insurance without giving me notice. 

Alright, so next day she sent me a loooong text outlining she had meant to discuss the insurance with me because I shouldn‚Äôt be on it, but‚Ä¶she‚Äôs afraid of me. She‚Äôs afraid of all the things I‚Äôll do to retaliate because I plan things. 

Alright folks, let me outline all the scary things I did to her during the 15 months she lived with me while we were split up and a bit after. 

-cooked for her (she cooked too)
-paid more of the rent so she could save 
-bought her $1000 kitchen knife set for when she moved
-stored all her extra boxes when she did move for free (she moved them the day she cancelled the insurance)
-didn‚Äôt throw her out when I caught her stealing from my liquor collection to give to her new boyfriend
-loaned her money multiple times both during and after she moved (she always paid it back to her credit) and never once hesitated. 
-told her as long as I‚Äôm alive she will never be homeless or hungry even when she‚Äôs on her own. 
-continued to split paying our subscriptions like Netflix and others 
-continued to keep her on my phone plan to save us both money and she was often late in paying, but not a big deal. 

So as you can clearly see, I‚Äôve been very abusive for an ex husband, scary even. Yall should be wary of me when I get angry because I‚Äôll toss my bunny slipper right in your general direction. 

For those of you who want to ‚Äúyou‚Äôre leaving things out‚Äù ya, never once ever harmed her, never once abused her, and took care of her because that‚Äôs what a husband does. She was fighting and on her knees crying to keep me, so clearly I am such a monster. 

She has told this story that she‚Äôs afraid of me and I‚Äôm scary, and I didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs why some people who knew about the affair stopped speaking to me. She‚Äôs a liar. She has vulnerable narcissism? So everything is about her being the victim regardless of the facts. 

I hope she doesn‚Äôt mess with divorce proceedings. I just want her gone permanently and we never have to speak again. She‚Äôs a terrible human being, and I‚Äôm a chump who gave her the benefit of the doubt.",My soon to be ex is a narcissist,18ojjiv,1703264414.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ojjiv/my_soon_to_be_ex_is_a_narcissist/,
"I really want to cheat on my boyfriend but I love him

So I (F24) have been having these intense sexual cravings. My boyfriend (M26) and I have been together for 8 years. I love him and he really is my soul mate. If I had to be trapped on an island the rest of my life, he is the person I would want to be trapped with.

However I have this kink for feeling very risqu√© and very desirable. Of feeling so filled with lust that I lose control and do terrible things. His best friend comes over some times and we all hangout and watch YouTube and play video games. They have been friends since they were 4 years old. My boyfriend often tells me how as much as he loves his friend, he has very little control over his desires and often cheats on girls.

So the other day my boyfriend went upstairs to go to the bathroom and we were all down stairs playing some trivia game. While we waited on him we were just casually talking. I rolled for my turn and a dice rolled off the board and under the entertainment center. I had to reach my arm under really far and when I got it and turned around, I noticed he was 100% checking out my ass. I have to admit, I immediately became super aroused. The fact that he desires me so much he would stare, knowing I'm his best friends girlfriend? It made me feel hot.

Anyways, and I do feel guilty about this: I liked that feeling so much, that I pretended I wanted to look at dvds we could watch later after the board game. Pretending I didn't want to get off the couch, I just leaved over the arm of it to search our DVD tower on its lower shelf. Essentially this had my ass pointing in the air (In my blue leggings) and I made sure I bent over really good. Like I could feel my leggings stretch across my ass. I pretended to look for quite a while and I know he was staring hard because he stopped talking while I looked. I made sure to even wiggle my ass back and forth like I was just having trouble reaching.

While I did all this I felt myself getting really aroused. Specially because it went on for such an awkward amount of time that I think he could even tell I was doing it on purpose. I think it's safe to say I know if I threw myself at him he would jump at the chance.

Anyways I heard the upstairs toilet flush and then stopped. When I turned around his friend was jumpy.

Anyways, now I can't stop fantasizing about seducing his friend and fucking him on our couch while my boyfriend is away. Something about having a quick fuck and being able to get caught is arousing. Also being so irresistable that my boyfriends friend would betray him just to fuck me.

I can't shake this feeling. It really gets me worked up and I'm afraid I'll do it.",I really want to cheat on my boyfriend but I love him,18ojfxq,1703264150.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ojfxq/i_really_want_to_cheat_on_my_boyfriend_but_i_love/,

"hey, i (19M) might be a little too young to make such a decision right now, but at this point, it is how i strongly feel.

Whenever or whatever it is, im always hurt by girls, at this point i just feel it'll be better to leave such hopes of ever having a significant other and rather be single forever

About 5 months back, i has a crush on a girl, we used to go out and have fun, i  really thought that she might also like me. im a very shy guy, and the week i decided to ask her out, finally had the courage not onlu to just think but also decide that i will, there was a fight between me and my roommate, i guess he knew i liked her and i guess he also liked here ever though he literally used to call her his 'sister'. he went and told like about me to her, that i spread rumours, her secrets etc to our freinds, i didnt do anything of such sort at all, and just to confirm i went to my friends and ask if by chance ive said such things unknowingly, just to confirm.

at that point it went out of hand, i tried explaining her everything how its a lie, how he lied to her, but she didnt listen, even after being so good friends, sharing secrets, she didnt trust me enough to think that i was the one telling the truth

then after one week i got to know from my friends that apperently she and my roommate have started dating and i still remember that day so clearly. my heart dropped, i was trying to keep it. my mutual freinds realised how messed up it got. and since then it has almost been radio silent between us. we tried to make up for everything, but there are things you cant just let go, i always wanted to get everything back to normal between us but well, my strong feeling towards her kept getting in the way.

some people say that im better off without her, but i still wonder how great it would have been if none of this would have happened. i wanted to hurt her and my roommate sooo much but at the same time i still cared about her so much. it has been really difficult.

there was times in the middle that she would call me and ask for help in studies, in the starting i used to say yes thinking that there was a smalll possibility that we might just start talking once more, but ofcourse that didnt happend. i helped her and then she forgot i existed.

for me her being there in my life was so important. i am in no way attractive or flawless, i just might be the ugliest in a group of 1000 people, ive my fare share of flaws, and i try to correct them always but im a human after all

this all hurt me soo much that i couldnt imagine being with anyone ever again. it made me empty inside after a while, i couldnt smile or enjoy world. i dont want to be hurt anymore by anyone, this wasnt the first time it happened, but i could try and make it the last,",Dont wanna be hurt anymore,18oj6no,1703263470.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18oj6no/dont_wanna_be_hurt_anymore/,
"I can not stand this man and it‚Äôs not because he ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt give me what I want‚Äô or some selfish reason. I promise, I have many reasons that are valid.

1.) When I was born, he left. He would visit stay with my mom and I on Saturday‚Äôs and Sunday‚Äôs and then leave again. He came back into my life fully when I was 8 years old and by doing so he made my life living hell. Like it was traumatic not growing up with a father figure, but it‚Äôs even more traumatic to see him come back! 

2.) My mother is Palestinian, my father is of Argentinian descent. Obviously waters are fucking high tide in my household and I just‚Ä¶ seriously can‚Äôt stand him now more than ever. 
(I understand he is intitled to his own opinion but why would he marry a Palestinian woman??? He already has her convinced that there is some neutral ‚Äòstance‚Äô and now my mother is defending ‚Äòboth sides‚Äô. Like we are talking about the side that literally killed half her family.) We were talking about Yemen and I said ‚ÄúI think they are really brave and helping so many people.‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúHow do pirates help other people? They are violent.‚Äù So I said ‚ÄúWhat do you classify as a pirate?‚Äù &amp; he responses with ‚ÄúThefts. People who take what is yours.‚Äù This made me want to scream. ‚ÄúOh, so by that logic, are you Pro-Palestine since Israel stole their land.‚Äù is what I said to him after. He looks at me and goes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about this with you anymore. It‚Äôs much more complex and you are completely sanitizing the situation.‚Äù AGH . i‚Äôll just type a ‚Äòdialogued‚Äô version of the conversation: 

Me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that complex and I‚Äôm not sanitizing anything. In 1948-‚Äú 
Him: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about it anymore with you.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù
(silence for like a minute)
Him: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you are talking about and you‚Äôre going off of whatever left wing media you follow.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúI thought you said you were done talking about it?‚Äù
Him: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even talking about it with you. I‚Äôm trying to explain why you are wrong.‚Äù
(he then picks up his phone and goes ‚Äòoh i have to take this‚Äô but nobody called him, he called someoneüò≠) 

3.) In 2021 I was really depressed and he told me that I chose to be depressed. I told him that‚Äôs not true and he kept telling me that I am just lazy and such. It made me cry so I went to my room &amp; he followed me up shortly. He walked in and saw how messy my room was. He then proceeded to tell me to ‚Äòclean up this shit hole‚Äô and I was thinking like ‚Äòdepression doesn‚Äôt really work like that but okay!‚Äô (I told him ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù).
He was like screaming and yelling and everything then my mom came home and told him to leave me alone. An hour after that, I went downstairs to get a cup of water. He asked me how my room looked and I said ‚ÄúThe same. I literally can‚Äôt clean it right now I have no motivation.‚Äù So he was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking motivate you.‚Äù He proceeded to run to the staircase, I knew he was going to take my phone so I followed. I ran under him and tried to get my phone from my room before he could. He got to the top of the stairs just as I did and then grabbed my wrist and pushed me into the wall. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever fucking do that again. I‚Äôll smack the shit out of you next time and break your fucking phone.‚Äù Once again I started crying. When he left go, my wrist hurt so bad so I was like holding it and touching the red marks left. He moved so quickly from the wall to my bedroom (tbf it was less than a second away from the wall) and grabbed my phone to then lock away in his safe. I started bawling and hyperventilating because my phone was the only way to get in touch with the outside world during a pandemic and he just took it. He now to this day, denies that this ever happened. 

4.) When I was a child and he was around me on weekends &amp; then when I turned 8 til 13, he would constantly physically punish me. I was always getting slapped, beat, pinched, etc whenever I behaved poorly. Mind you I was a child who did not know better.

Long story short, this man gave me so much trauma and I told my mom that I don‚Äôt think he loves me. She said that‚Äôs not true but I don‚Äôt agree. He is a father of a child but he is not a dad. To give him the title ‚ÄòDad‚Äô would disgrace every papi, every daddy, every baba, etc that ever existed.

"The game keeps switching. College degrees were highly valuable and almost a guaranteed ticket to a better life in the past, and only wealthy and connected people went to college. Now it's widely available with a lot of no-name schools that advertise to working class and middle class people, and certain racial and regional demographics. Tons of working class people now get into college and come out with a degree, and they think ""I got a college degree! Life should be easier now""... but then they realize it's not. The doors are still closed to them. The game has changed and now it takes more specific requirements to open gates of opportunity than just the credential.

I have a friend, from a middle class black family in the south (no idea about the jobs or education levels of her parents and family members), who decided to better her opportunities by enlisting in the military. She already had a degree. She worked on an online master's degree from an accessible state university while serving active duty in the military so she can aim for a higher paying job right as she separate. She used her GI bill during active, so she didn't even get the housing stipend she could have gotten outside of service. She juggled hard, and got that credential that she expected to open gates. Turns out, that master's degree didn't mean much. No internships, no research opportunities, no friends from her classes to vouch for her or hook her up, her professors only know of her as another student name on the screen and don't even know what she looks like - hence no network. She didn't know anyone who can help her get a job. Even if a recruiter sees my friend's resume and never saw what she looks like, there's a strong hint of *noire* in her name. She makes around $40k-$50k/year at an unrelated government job that she had to move for, that's all she could get, which doesn't require a master's degree in the first place.

The reason you go to a brand name college isn't for ""education"", the classes are pretty much the same in most colleges (except tech-oriented schools like Georgia Tech or MIT). You can self-teach most of what they teach in colleges, there's tons of free resources online. Will Hunting was right in that he can teach himself at the library what the college douchebag learns from his classes with expensive credit hours, but what he doesn't know is the other things that a college provides you with. The reason you go for the highest status schools is for networking, befriending other motivated, talented, or privileged and well-connected peers, and research/internship opportunities. 

I hear a lot of working class and middle class people say ""it doesn't matter where you go to school, just get an accredited degree"". They're right if they just want to mark the checkbox for a local no-name company where you cap out at 80k/year for a STEM job, but that's not enough to get into the six figure jobs and climb higher and higher. Or, even with the right name and associations for your credentials, it's still not enough if the gatekeepers feel alienated by you due to cues not related to the job - your gender, your race, the way you dress and your regional accent (and the assumed political party people may assign to you based on that). Especially for women and people of color, likability and not rocking the boat is heavily considered (though nobody will just say it out loud). Hence, people get into tons of debt just to stay exactly where they are.

Why do you think so many sex workers come from marginalized backgrounds? Women of color, white women from working class backgrounds, LGBT, disabled. Because the vanilla job market isn't fair, it's highly political. Even male sex workers are usually racial minorities and LGBT, even the straight white ones don't come from a household where the parents stayed married and was depositing money into a 529 the past 18 years while expecting their son to go to college - so once he hits 18, his parents tell him to get out, and he realizes a bunch of gates are closed to him because he doesn't signal to the gatekeepers that he belongs and can play the part among them.

I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt remember it but I wasn‚Äôt drinking, I remember it clearly and it stung. It was months ago and I still feel like crying when I think about it. 

Anyway, the bigger issue here is that we do not have sex. At all. In the last almost 2 years, we‚Äôve had sex one time. Apparently he has erectile issues but like what the fuck?? I can‚Äôt talk to him about it because it‚Äôs a big sensitive topic for him and it seems like he doesn‚Äôt even care. So what‚Äôs he doing? Looking up women that get him a little semi hard so he can get off?? 

I don‚Äôt think my naked body does anything for him, to be honest. And at this point I‚Äôm so insecure that I don‚Äôt want him to see my naked like when I‚Äôm in the shower or changing. In general, I feel just fine about my body and only feel this way around him. 

I don‚Äôt look like the girls he looks at. 

I don‚Äôt even know what the hell
I‚Äôm rambling about here. I just don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm not enough. Why he doesn‚Äôt see me as a sexual person. It just feels like I‚Äôm living with my best guy friend most most of the time. We have no physical relationship aside from a kiss goodbye in the morning and it fucking hurts to know that he‚Äôs looking at other women in a sexual way. 

These things really wouldn‚Äôt bother me as much if he made a point to make me feel like he thinks I‚Äôm attractive. I get nothing. Not even when I‚Äôve attempted to send him nudes during the day. Not when I try to do my hair and makeup extra cute. Not even an acknowledgment.

Well, the stalking his best friends gfs pics would still bother me because that‚Äôs just creep behavior. Maybe next time I‚Äôll rant about how he had a body shot of one of his coworkers saved in his camera roll.

"I‚Äôm not really sure what am I doing here. I go to therapy, but I feel like I want to vent this to the outside world? I just want to take it out.

My wife was raped early last year. It was horrible. I was on a short work trip and she called me because there was a big water leak in our house. I was going back home next day, but the leak was unstopable. I mentioned one of our closed friends was doing plumbing jobs so I asked her if she wanted me to give him a call, she agreed. He was a fucking close friend to both of us. He was having money problems, that‚Äôs why we also tought was a good idea to call him, it was a win-win. He was married (I think he still is) my wife was friend of his wife. Never crossed my mind something bad would happen. I called him, he agreed to go. 

A few hours later my wife texted me saying she was suspicious that he was drunk or something more. I told her she could send him away but he was already inside of the house working. She told him it was better if he came back next day because she didn‚Äôt have money to pay him, but he answered saying it was not a problem. I called him and lied to him, told him I would call him back tomorrow, but he refused to stop working.

 My wife started to text me she was a bit scared, he was acting strange. I told her to call the police, if she was feeling that insecured. I was already telling my brother to go and check what was going on at our place. Then everything happened very fast, she was distressed and send a voice message, then stoped answering. I was so scared, I jumped to the car and drove back home. 

My brother found her unconscious on the sofa in the livingroom, her clothes rioped off; he was asleep on top of her. He called the police, an ambulace, helped my wife (who didn‚Äôt wake up until she was at the hospital) and beat the shit out of him.

Police took him. He dared to say sex was consensual, but she was so hurt no cop or detective believed his words. He had enough time to do whatever he wanted with her. She was bleeding, had a lot of defensive wounds too, bruises all over her body, it was fucking terrible. Our daughter was at my sister‚Äôs house having a sleepover with our niece and our boy was playing with a neighbor, so thank God they weren‚Äôt home. 

She has been very strong, even had to testify in the trial and he was found guilty. With lots of therapy, help and love she‚Äôs starting to regain her life; step by step, little by little each day is a won battle. We all are here to help her: me, my family, her family. I quit my job because it involved a lot of traveling and I couldn‚Äôt leave her alone. Of course she has her breakdowns, but she‚Äôs learning to control them and she seems a bit more relaxed, happy. She‚Äôs happy about Christmas, about spending this time with our kids. We also started to regain our sexual life, intimacy. This has been a big step for her. Ups and downs, breakdowns, nightmares, but we are working through this together and she‚Äôs been doing well, better. 

Yesterday I found out he was released from prison. I am extremely mad and sad about this. Why now when she‚Äôs having a good moment? I hesitated on telling her, didn‚Äôt know if I should wait until the holidays are over, but I couldn‚Äôt hide it from her eighter, she has the right to know. What if she found out somewhere else? She would have found out somewhere else. I called her therapist to see if we could arrange a last minute session to tell her, but she‚Äôs out of town; she told me how to do it, tough. It was the second worst day of my life, she broke again. She‚Äôs been on bed all day, hasn‚Äôt gotten up. She‚Äôs sleeping, crying or pretends to be asleep. She‚Äôs very, very scared too. 

I honestly feel very guilty every day since the moment I open my eyes. If I hadn‚Äôt call this fucker, nothing of this would had happened. I knoe it is not, but it feels is on me. I do hate myself sometimes.

"This is my sons first Christmas. My first as a Dad. I‚Äôm 25 and my son will turn 1 in January!

This is my first Christmas without my father. He passed in August, and my son never had the chance to meet his grandpa. In ways I am thankful.  Him and I grew closer as I got older - but holy fuck did he strap me in for a home life I did not deserve. After my parents divorced he began a slope downhill. He was an addict, chose to be with his domestically violent girlfriend for 13 years of my life and let me witness some excruciating things. 

When I was 10 or 11, my dads GF threw a crystal ashtray at him and gouged his head open. She then swung a cast iron pan directly into her own face busting her nose and immediately called the cops to claim he hit her. Cuffed and off to jail he went. Christmas Eve.

16th birthday, they throw me a party for me and my friends to have some beers and have fun safely in our home. They got too drunk and started fighting and thrown themselves in the bonfire during the altercation. Cuffed and off to jail he went. Now all my friends see what I‚Äôve been hiding at home and the impression lasts forever. I‚Äôm still embarrassed.

I hate Christmas. I hated my Christmas‚Äô as a young kid. I hated the holidays growing up. 

I coparent my son with his mom since birth. This is my business as a man and father, we are both supportive of each other but a relationship is not sustainable. Our relationship to our child as a team is the most important. That being said, I have my son on Christmas Day and mom has him Christmas Eve. Very thankful for this. 

As my perspective changes from son to Dad, I would have never put my boy through something like that. It‚Äôs plain and simple. He deserves a healthy home life between his mom and I. 

What I‚Äôve gained from the year 2023, my son being born, my father passing, in order for MY chapter to start - the chapter of my Dad and I had to end. I‚Äôve found my peace with that. Mashallah

"After many years of staying in established social bubbles, I have recently changed my job and became a part of a new large collective. 
It's been exciting and refreshing but also a bit stressful and confusing. 
First off, I almost stopped noticing how small a percentage of people actually thinks and processes the world in similar ways as me. Even in my discipline, where I'd think people are shaped in certain ways, there's so much mental diversity. 
I was once again confronted with how many people have gendered minds and stereotypical attitudes. Even some openminded, intelligent, flexible people believe that humans come in two forms that must behave and think differently. It's so sadly rare to encounter someone who approaches people only as people without this sort of bullshit.

However, my main concern is how much attention has my presence already attracted. So many people wanted to talk to me and approached me that I felt really welcome. I appreciated it and reciprocated the interest to make new friends and socially integrate. But slowly, I started doubting some people's motivation and got confused. 
I'm a female in a technical field. 
So far, I've experienced several ambivalent or uncomfortable situations ranging from innocent traditional assumptions to strong gender expectations to inappropriate comments and unwanted touches. Not all of them were directed at me, but the insight into people's thinking was disappointing. Often, I didn't know how to react and I let it slide. A few times, I said something to object or draw boundaries but it might have come out a bit forced. Either way, I'm unhappy with my reactions.

I don't want to be harsh to the colleagues who did something more obviously inappropriate. I believe they might have misjudged the situation and behaved stupidly because they're imperfect people. There's also been some alcohol involved. They might be still fine to talk to or work with. I don't want to start off on the wrong foot with people and then regularly meet them and feel even more uncomfortable.

Another thing is, I think that the more problematic interactions has affected my perception of other interactions that are possibly alright. I may feel unnecessarily uncomfortable and internally overreact to minor stuff. Maybe some people are genuinely interested in getting to know me as a colleague and they would treat a male newhire the same way. I might be overthinking things. 

Problem is that I don't know how to properly interpret the interactions and where to draw the line. I don't know what it's like to have a gendered mind. When someone approaches me as a woman, I can't help but think that it must be somehow relevant or that the person is very old-school or possibly ignorant.

I assume that for most people, my gender and sex would be relevant for a personal/intimate relationship. However, that really doesn't belong to the workplace. Alternatively, I can accept that stereotypical thinking is a shortcut and people could use my assumed gender as a guide to choose the topic and learn something about me in a standard, easy way. But I'd hope that after talking to me, they would find out that I'm not stereotypical and drop this attitude.

So the question is, what do they mean when they keep treating me as a woman and what do they expect from our interaction? Why and how is my assumed gender relevant at the workplace? We have similar jobs, do similar things every day, have similar interests. Why approach me differently? 
I'd really like to know so that I can calibrate myself and feel more comfortable.

I think that if I had more energy to rise above it, behave like I'm too just having fun and it really doesn't mean anything, it would be totally cool and I would also gain more space. But unfortunately, I don't have the vibe and social skills to do such a thing.",Ambivalent interactions at work,18ohazd,1703258453.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ohazd/ambivalent_interactions_at_work/,

"I have had body dysmorphia since I was a teenager. I had severe acne worse than anyone in my class. I felt subhuman and ashamed to talk to anyone. I felt disgusted to go out in public. Whenever I did, I would always compare my skin to everyone else. Why must everyone have clear skin but me? Sometime in 2019, I cleaned up my diet, went to a dermatologist who prescribed me tretinoin and finally there seemed to be progress. Finally my skin was clearing up. But just as my skin cleared my hair started to fall out. Just when my confidence was coming back, everything was crushed again.

I hoped that this was just body dysmorphia and maybe the mirror is lying to me. Maybe my hair is perfectly fine and my mind is playing tricks on me. Then one time after I got a buzzcut, my friends commented that my hair seemed thin. The fact that my worst fears were confirmed sent me into complete depression and severe anxiety. I couldn't accept that I'm going bald. 

I went to multiple dermatologists, most of them said my hair seemed fine. I thought they were all lying to me. Then in 2021, 1 dermatologist finally said yes your hair does seem to be receding slightly but the rest of my hair was still thick. She prescribed me finasteride and minoxidil, which I have taken for over a year now. I have no side effects but I also have no effects. I don't know if it worked or not some days it seems like my hair has improved some days it looks like it has worsened. Some days it seems like my hair loss stopped some days it seems like I have shed a lot of hair. I keep obsessively checking the mirror to see if there is a change. 

I constantly worry that I might be the unfortunate 10% of people for whom finasteride does not work, especially given the fact that my grandfather went bald very early. Im conflicted on whether or not I should switch to dutasteride because while it might work better I don't think I'm mentally capable of handling a shedding phase that might result from it. I also read somewhere that you can't get a hair transplant until you're 25. How am I going to last 3 years like this? Every day is a living hell.

I cry in the shower every time. I overthink my hair loss and worry that I might also be getting diffuse thinning on top of a receding hairline. I wear a cap everywhere I go. I cry in the shower. I cry myself to sleep. I can't accept going bald. I only just turned 22 and honestly even if I was 50 I don't think I can accept hair loss. I feel even more subhuman than when I had acne.

If my crown started to thin, I don't think I could take it anymore, I'll probably just end my life. Because it's worthless. I could be Jeff Bezos, one of the richest people on earth, be very smart and have accomplished a lot but at the end of the day, I'll still be bald. I'll still feel a sense of inferiority over the common man. I'll feel ashamed to look another man in the eye, constantly bowing down in my shame. Constantly comparing my hairline to everyone I see.

And no this isn't about getting girls. This is just my sense of self worth and self confidence. I don't even care if I got erectile dysfunction. I don't even wanna have kids. Im pretty much asexual and aromatic anyway. I even considered chemically castrating myself if it means I can keep my hair. I just want to look normal like every other 22 year old.

"We have had a very close relationship since forever, and sometimes when I'm overwhelmed I lay my head on her lap and she ""babies"" me basically (I'm 30F and she's 40F).

She calls me her baby, tells me she loves me, that it's going to be okay, etc. I become a toddler for 50 minutes, and we have done this for the last six months almost every session.

We have acknowledged it's weird and ambiguous because I have an adult woman's body and I'm not actually a child, but I feel so loved in these sessions.

"
For as long as records of me exist (18 years), I have been in a perpetual state of existential crises and despair: 9 years ago I wrote in journals about how my nightmares were more real than everyday life, and I wrote events like those for years. It became a legitimate problem in 2015 when I came under the impression that someone was out to get me and had killed my parents, and for the next seven years, I was given drugs to administer this feeling; nowadays, I just realise my parents are awful parents who, upon hearing my paranoia about my ‚Äúlast day on Earth‚Äù, told me ‚ÄúI hope you go to Hell!‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt help that my memory is so poor, as every memory is a blurry disposable: I can hazily recall an event one day, but not the next. It‚Äôs this feeling that I‚Äôve written pages about, that I‚Äôm lost in time, inside my head, that I can‚Äôt get out: that reality is just a dream, and that I have seen and experienced everything, despite not purportedly being alive for modern historical events. 

This issue is so bad, in fact, that this year, I had to question my age because of such a poor memory and shitty guardians. Logic, reason, and common sense all point to the early 2000s, but my intuition latched onto the Vietnam War era, &amp; it won‚Äôt let go, so now I‚Äôm stuck with a forever-changing birth date.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm not spiritual, philosophical, or religious in any category; in fact, these experiences scared me out of religion. I‚Äôm vulnerable, scared, and oversensitive, and everyone who tries to help really just wants to drug me so I shut up and stop bothering them and their lives. My hypochondria is at its worst point; my ADD shoots down motivation to do anything with my life, so I just sit here rotting, unable to come up with one story for my past, telling my problems to anyone who listens (only to realise they‚Äôre self-motivated), and sinking further into a bitter misanthropic rage of having ever told anyone anything, because I‚Äôm honestly just better dead. This world is cold, and I should have realised that I had to be that way too. Worse yet, I‚Äôm vulnerable, but selfish &amp; egotistical, so a hypocrite. I really want to say that I‚Äôll keep on living, but it‚Äôs questionable. I realise I sound like an asshole, and I‚Äôm at my limit. I have no more excuses &amp; I‚Äôm petrified of what‚Äôs next.

"So I (28F) just wanted to come on here and vent a little because I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life I can go to about this. I also feel like maybe I‚Äôm acting spoiled or entitled for even caring about this but I can‚Äôt help it.

So this year I had the worst birthday ever. I suffer with gastro problems and from time to time becomes extremely ill and throw up for a week straight basically. And this year that started on my birthday. I spent the day in A&amp;E and didn‚Äôt see anyone other my mum and dad. I managed to spend a copy and paste reply to everyone over text thanking them for their birthday wishes and that I‚Äôd respond properly when I‚Äôm feeling better as I had an extreme migraine and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to even look at my phone, but I didn‚Äôt want to be rude and ignore everyone recently. Needless to say I didn‚Äôt have any birthday cake either. I was also staying with my mum and dad while this went on so they could look after me.

I‚Äôm now recovered and have seen my friends and even some family since but none of them have acknowledged that it was my birthday. No cards, no presents, no anything. As if it was never my birthday at all.

I always put a lot of effort into getting a good gift for my friends for their birthdays too, gift giving is my love language so it‚Äôs important to me that I give them someone they‚Äôll actually really appreciate, even if that means spending a bit more than I can afford. For example, my best friend had been really wanting crocs so I got them for her for her birthday, even though they cost at least ¬£15 more than what I would typically spend on her birthday.

To add insult to injury, when I saw my friends they started asking me if my family‚Äôs holiday home would be available in the summer for us to use for a holiday. We have done this before and my family don‚Äôt charge us for it so the cost of the holiday is literally just the cost of the flights. I just felt a bit offended that they don‚Äôt care enough about me to even get me a birthday card but are happy enough to use my family‚Äôs holiday home so they can get a cheap holiday.

I have been feeling like they don‚Äôt really like me as much as I like them for a long while now and I feel like this has just kinda confirmed that for me. I had even said to them before my birthday that I didn‚Äôt want to do anything to celebrate this year (as in going out) because I always feel so let down on my birthdays and didn‚Äôt want to feel like that this year. (In the past close friends  have not come to my birthday party because they have made other plans after I planned my birthday to see people they could see any other day of the year and in one case after not drinking and leaving early because she ‚Äòhad to be up early for work the next day‚Äô one friend left to go get drunk with her FWB and stayed up until 4am with him). 

As for family, well I guess you can‚Äôt pick them anyway. I‚Äôve always felt left out from my dads side of the family so this wasn‚Äôt a big shock to me or as hurtful as it was with my friends.

I think this has shown me that I need to step away from these friendships. Unfortunately it will mean I literally won‚Äôt even have one friend but surely that is better than feeling like this?

If I‚Äôm being dramatic and self centred I‚Äôd really appreciate if someone would tell me but if not I‚Äôd really appreciate a bit of sympathy for this.

"Hey I'm Chris 20m from central Europe. I've had a pretty rough life so far because I don't fit into society well. I'm gay and my family is heavily christian and awful people. Then exactly a year ago I've found a delightful guy here on reddit. I wasn't even looking for love, quite the opposite. Despite that it was the best thing that has ever happened to me. We started dating. He helped me through graduation, university, moving. He was always there. However he is from Germany so when we are together it was always online. 

We are dead set on living our life together we are the perfect match. So about 5 months ago we've decided to spend Christmas together. We both have a bad relationship with our families so he found the place, I got the tickets......
I was supposed to leave today. But his friend let me know he got into a car accident. 

Broken leg, ribs and the timing could not be worse. We had such a short window to meet each other and have some rest. Now it's all fucked. Obviously I'm upset and really fucking sad that the week of peace I've been looking forward to for so long is all ruined. 
But I'm worried about him even more. 

He will get a blood transfusion today and a leg surgery in the next few days. He doesn't have any internal organ injuries. But he will probably be knocked out from the anesthetics for some time.

"Now, to be clear, I'm not for diet culture at all. In fact, at the base level, I agree with these anti diet culture people. Society shouldn't shame people because they have different body shapes. People can be ""fat"" and still be healthy. I recognize that. I also recognize that we have terms like ""morbid obesity"" for a reason. As much as you can be both fat and healthy, I wish these people would recognize you can also be fat and unhealthy. In fact, being fat enough can kill you. Another thing that bothers me that I hear all the time from these people is ""there's no such thing as 'good' food or 'bad' food. Food is food"", which is just blatantly wrong. Should I be allowed to eat McDonald's every so often? Sure. Can I expect to eat McDonald's 3 times a day every day for the rest of my life and not expect to become 600 pounds? Absolutely not, because McDonald's is demonstrably unhealthy. Not all food is equally healthy for you. Food may not have morals, yeah. You're not a bad person if you have McDonald's for lunch once a month.

"So u recently got promoted at work and wanted to go out to mini golf with two friends of mine and then head to the pub for some drinks afterwards. 

Both agreed but last minute found out that one of the girls had to wait for a delivery and she told me and my other friend this later on in the day and she couldn‚Äôt leave it till it arrived as she was the only one home. The friend waiting at home spoke to me all day up until the agreed time we were supposed to meet. So in the end it was just the two of us at mini golf which was fine but even when the tree arrived the friend said she would not leave her house as it was too late and she had work tomorrow. 

Bear in mind this was at around 7pm and there were plenty of means to come to see us and we had no intentions of being out late or drinking heavily. Her reasoning for not coming out was only sent to my other friend and she in no way tried to apologise to her or me about not coming out to celebrate.

"So I went to visit a friend with terminal cancer in the hospital the other day. It is a sad and messy situation, plus I have a lot of other personal stress going on right now. I haven‚Äôt been taking great care of myself I‚Äôll admit. I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded in my friend‚Äôs room, so I stepped out into the hallway and promptly passed out. Came to with all sorts of medical staff around me. They put me in a wheelchair and I slid out of it onto the floor, too dizzy to sit up. So it was a bit dramatic. My blood pressure tends to run low - I have had a few episodes like this previously in my life. My pressure was indeed really low this time, so they wheeled me in a stretcher down to the ER.  After some testing they determined that I was dehydrated and had low potassium so they started an IV of fluids. I began feeling a lot better, but the doctor had ordered a CT scan  and I had to wait for that. After about 45 minutes, they wheel me over to where the CT scans are done. I am lying outside the scan room on the stretcher when suddenly I realize that this is going to be really expensive because of my high insurance deductible. And why do I need a CT scan anyway? I know what happened to me and why. This is stupid. So I tell the guy that I don‚Äôt want to do it because I can‚Äôt afford it. And he says no problem, he will wheel me back to the room. And then conspiratorially says, ‚ÄúThe doctor will probably try to convince you, but it is an expensive procedure and you have every right to refuse it.‚Äù We get back to the room and the doctor didn‚Äôt try to convince me at all. She was just like ‚ÄúOK no CT scan then? No problem. Let‚Äôs get you out of here.‚Äù Damn. How many times are people intimidated into letting these things happen because doctors are authority figures and nobody tells them that the tests are optional?

A big stressor of mine is Family. I know that family is supposed to be your home. The one you run to when your tired and drained of this sick and unfair world. The one that would always be by your side. To listen to your problems and worries. To be your rest. But what if your family is the one causing you to have problems. I'm not saying im perfect nobody is. As a little brother I might be lazy and not partake in household chores. I want to help I really do. But what if I cant since I'm already drained and tired?   
  
My dad is addicted to gambling specifically cockfighting but sometimes he secretly goes to casino's. One time he lost around 80,000pesos or 1400+$ which is of course a lot to us. until now he still goes to gamble in cockfights or if he isnt gambling hes drinking. When we all gathered to talk about it he said it was just his pastime I understand that but he doesn't put a limit to how much he bets sometimes. He still provides for us. Although I think the money could have been used better by using it to continue the construction of our house that is already been going for at least (5years) or at least i know of and its barely halfway done. even at one point he was thinking of just selling it after funding it for all those years. (luckily not though)  
  
My mom is prideful. She doesn't want to admit her mistakes. I have to be the one to say sorry. These past few days even though she's in the wrong I am always the one who apologizes. ""Sorry Ma"" I always tell her that but not even once she told me that. She also wants me to be vulnerable to her but she wont do the same. I could tell she's going through some things but I'm not a mind reader to guess what she's going through. But instead of letting it out shes just holding all these emotions inside of her causing her to belike  a volcano that at anytime could explode due to these emotions its holding.  Maybe she's scared to be vulnerable because she thinks she will lose authority when she shows this side to us. Therefore she's always in moodswings one minute shes happy the other shes upset. Its hard. When I told her that I just wouldnt see her as someone I would open up to anymore and that I would just understand her she said ""Bakit ikaw ang iintindi?"" which means why would I be the one to understand? she even mocked me saying Mature na pala ang baby ko (My baby is already mature) but in a mocking way while she also cries. thats it. that line hurt me so bad. she mocked me.

Second Sister She hates both of us (me and my eldest sister) she has no respect for my eldest sister. shes manipulative and she gaslights people especially my parents. Shes the favorite and sometimes my mom isnt even trying to hide it. Asking her to do anything would not be good. An example would be if she were to tell me to get her towel I would do it no complaints but if I would be the one to ask her to get me my towel she would do it but with attitude she would look into my eyes before rolling it. But from the POV of my parents shes the only normal one. She is the reason of countless nights i cry myself to sleep sometimes thinking what did I do to deserve this treatment? Until now we still dont get along very well. and I doubt we ever will.  
  
Eldest sister. You see im not trying to boast about it but I have quite a decent amount of eq aswell as my eldest sister so we get along quite well. I am very aware of my emotions and what im feeling. Although not all the time when I do get verbal with what im feeling or what someone made me feel I make sure to let them know. I dont want you to think bad about my parents since we arent from the same generation my mom was already 38 when I was born so yeah. But should I really be saying that? just because my parents aren't from the same generation as me I shouldn't give them credit anymore? Well they're trying in the ways they know and my mom is aware that our generation now (Gen Z) is more on emotional problems but thats basically it. My mom tries to tell me to tell her my problems whether it may be from acads or anything but after I open up she would just forget about it. They only like to talk about problems when its occuring but after that they will forget about it and move on with their lives. Wihle they are ""present"" providing for us etc. they aren't truly ""present"" for us. They have the mindset of im doing what im supposed to do so why would I care about other things? Its sad and dissapointing. they dont try to look at the bigger picture but instead just look at what they see and call it enough. An example would be they see that my eldest sister and I arent emotionally stable but thats what they'll ever look at. They wont look further on what could be the cause of it. Thats why my second sister seems to be the one thats normal but she is also one of the reason we're both emotionally unstable. It pains me. Im so tired of this every. single. day. Im still trying my best though after all im just a grade 10 student. Who knows maybe tomorrow will be a better day than today?

"I can't stand this anymore.
My ex and I were together for 15 years between dating and being best friends. He dumped me suddendly back in july saying he realized he is gay and I'm a complete wreck since then.
I've done it all, went to the gym, traveled, started therapy, a journal, hobbies. And I am stuck! 

I'm stuck going back to every memory of us together trying to pinpoint just how much he lied, how much did I not see, how can he just go on without me, how could he just lie to me for so long. How I could be preparing to move in with him and longing to marry him and at the same time he was getting ready to leave and I didn't see it.

We speak like once a week these days, he always comes and starts complaining about his life, his debts, his poor choices. This weekend he kept saying he regrets ending things, regrets going away and that he really loves me still and wants to be my friend, wants to see me before the year ends, wants to hug me. I was doing barely ok but since that conversation I feel like I'm back to july, I can't sleep, all I do is cry.

I said no. Despite the fact that all I want to do is hug him and not ever let go, I'm not ready to see him because I still love him with my whole soul, I tried to forget him all this time but I still love him and miss him absurdly. I just can't see him now, I can't be supportive, I can't hear about anyone new, I can't see any changes. I still love him and I'm not ready to see in his face that he really doesn't.

And at the same time, I'm really hoping he just shows up here sunday. I'm desperate for it. It makes no sense but I just wish he comes here. I'm tired of being the one who is constantly humiliating herself. Let him come and try.

I know he lied, I know he used me, I know he just wants my friendship back, not our relationship, he just wants my devotion, not me.
But I love him and I'm horrified and scared of just how much I want to see him and I'm disgusted with my lack of self respect and self love. I shouldn't want to, I should have moved on, I shouldn't care, but I do.

Now to the present day, we were in a social hangout game together meeting new people and talking. We ended up in a room with another guy, and that‚Äôs when he went silent and told me before he left that he was gonna be afk. P.S. Just to add I like to draw male genitalia doodles. It‚Äôs funny. I and the other guy, I'll call him M, talked for a bit and laughed at my doodles on the walls and he made a joke about me wanting his member, tbh here I don‚Äôt remember much of the convo, I think I joked back that I wanted one as in I would like to experience having a uk what, he then asked if A and I were dating. I said no cause we are not, just getting to know each other, then he proceeded to ask me what I think about him and I said he's cool. After I believe he asked to add me to the game I said sure we could be friends, he said sure, and not thinking much of it I added him. (My first mistake) 
After that interaction A left and M ditched me. How I know is because when I tried to join a game he was in, thinking he disconnected, he left immediately.

"I grew up as the only child of two very wealthy parents, both real estate moguls. I always thought I was lucky to grow up in such a privileged background, since I was never wanting for anything as a kid and could get anything I wanted. Went to private schools, had lots of hobbies, traveled the world, you name it, I probably had it.

The real problem came when I started dating. My parents have always had sky high expectations for my future, and that includes my possible future wife. Most parents would be content to know that their kid is dating someone that they like who‚Äôs a good person and leave it at that. Not mine. They‚Äôre both admittedly good-looking people that can pass for celebrities, and I won‚Äôt deny that I inherited their looks. As such, they expect me to end up with a girl who is just as physically attractive. I mentioned our economic status for a reason; they want me to date within our social status, so to speak. Middle class or upper middle class girlfriend? Not enough. Gotta be just as wealthy. Now I‚Äôm also studying to be a doctor. And that‚Äôs why their ideal partner for me is someone who is also set to become one while also fulfilling the aforementioned criteria.

And I hate it. I am not a shallow person. I never felt like my wealth made me better than or above other people. I want to become a doctor in the first place because I want to help people. I had to break up with the last two girls I dated because they didn‚Äôt fit my parents‚Äô criteria for an ideal partner. I tried to stand up for them too, but my parents are overbearing and controlling and made sure to remind me that they‚Äôve invested so much in me and that as their sole heir, I‚Äôm set to inherit everything, so the least I can do is do what they say. It hurts that I can't just love who I want to love without them having to fit my parents' ideals. 

I'm dating a girl now, told my parents, and guess what, the same thing happened. I thought it would be better this time since the girl is the daughter of a former colleague of my mom's. I was dead wrong; that former colleague is just ""upper middle class"" and my parents both described the family as ""simple"". She's not studying to be a doctor either, though she's in college, but that's still not enough for them. My mom even asked if there was something wrong with me since I apparently keep ""lowering my standards"". My parents have always been good to me; provided me everything, and undoubtedly invested a lot of money into me and my future. But now I see that that's what I really am to them; an investment. Not a person with the freedom to love who he wants, just another asset they can control. I'm still going to keep dating this girl on the off chance that when they meet her and get to know her (yeah all those judgments on her and her family when they haven't even met her in person) they'll hopefully warm up to her.

"Mid/late 30s, we were seeing each other for about 2 months. Started greatly, went on the same way. Hit issues and said goodbye 2 weeks ago. I'm not over it/him yet, it was the best I had felt in years and I had so much hope.

It hasn't been goodbye goodbye though. I do clean cutes, but I haven't been able to do that with him I guess because I still have some hope that it might somehow magically work out :(

After he reached out last week we agreed to take these days to think and talk again afterwards and maybe text in the meantime. And it's been back and forth texting, him asking me to join him for holiday trip (I declined, seemed to be only because he was lonely), he sends me Instagram posts about missing me, he texts me saying how much he misses closeness with me and how he wishes he could fall asleep next to me while I'm reading, etc. All these emotional stuffs...

I still have feelings for him and I still wish for things to work, and these messages should be a good sign, but I just saw today that he has updated his Bumble profile. I wasn't expecting that. I could see him opening it before since I could see his location/our distance (yes, I was stupidly checking that), but I wasn't expecting him to actually be using it. I reinstalled the app myself after we said goodbye as a distraction, to tell myself ""there are still other (maybe better) guys out there! get over this one that wasn't for you!!"". The very few conversations I had there in the ""date"" mode I told the guys directly that I'm not into dating right now as I'm still involved with someone.

I don't know why I wasn't expecting him to update his ""dating"" profile and although I haven't shown any reaction to him about it it's hurting me a lot...

Why does he send me these emotional messages then? And why am I so stupid to take them seriously? Why do I still like him? What makes me so weak? Why am I not just cutting him and moving on instead of waiting for the days to pass and for us to talk again? What is wrong with me? :((",What makes me so weak?

"I realised this week my mother and my grandmother and exactly the same.

 I was raised by my grandmother until I was 18 years old and then moved in with my parents because my grandmother developed advanced dementia and wasn't able to take care of herself ir ro rememer what we talked 5 minutes ago. 

What they have in common is being angry all the time about the most basic things in the world. They would start to scream and curse me for a t-shirt I just got or for how I prepare an omlete or just anything.

Going out to a restaurant was a circus show every time. My mother would complaim she doesn't like anything from the menu, scream at me for what I want to order and we would move to a different restaurant to do the same. After 2-3 restaurants we just go back home where my mother would complain she just wanted to have a nice meal and we ruined her day for refusing to go to restaurant number 4 after she cursed me at the first 3 restaurant. Everything ends with me starting to cry.

Every time I buy her a present, she would scream and call me stupid, idiot, useless or whatever she wants because she dosen't like the present...or the cake...or the fact I don't want to stay and listen for her complaing as long as she want. My grandmother was the same... nothing was good enough, no matter how expensive. Last time I got her a new smart TV and she made me return it after saying I ruined her day with the worst TV in the world. On the other hand, she gave me 50$ for my birthday and I say thank you :)

The worst is I can't tell her anything about my life because she will use it against me ?

- Not having a master degree ? --&gt; You're a failure. Other people can do it, but you're just dumb and lazy.
- Got accepted to a master degree ? --&gt; You don't need it, you're wasting time and money.

- Renting an apartment ? --&gt; You're wasting money and you should live at home with us until you got married and have a child. You should buy you own house.
- Buying an apartment ? --&gt; You're a horrible person. Why don't you just live with us ?

The list goes on and on and on. Nothing I do is good enough and she will try to convince me to give up. Diet, exercise, a new job... nothing is ok unless it's what she wants for me.

And then she would act hurt because I don't wsnt to talk with her about important things in my life. I told her a lot of times I don't feel like saying her something if she will just complain, scream and make me feel guilty for it... especially if it's a good thing.

She never said she's proud of me for anything. Finishing university, getting a job, buying an apartment, traveling... everything is just an opportunity for her to scream and start a fight.

I'm tired and frustrated. Other people have cool, understand, supportive parents and my mom will have a screaming competition if I buy a pair of gloves she dosen't like.

What would you do in my situation ? I'm considering never talking with her again because I always end up crying at the end. We live in differebt cities, but we meet after 2-3 months and talk every week.","My(26M) mother(56F) is angry, screams and complains all the time.",18oe7s9,1703249456.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18oe7s9/my26m_mother56f_is_angry_screams_and_complains/,
"I feel embarrassed just typing this out. I'm a 16 yr old M and sometimes I just feel like everything goes in a way just to fuck with me. I'm under no illusions, I understand I don't actually live in some rendition of the Truman Show with the central premise being my own problems (and, with perspective, they are all very 'first world' problems) but nonetheless, despite being born into a good family in a good area in a good city in a good country, having good friends, being good socially and being good at school, it feels like I just might never be  truly happy. Ever since I‚Äôve been 13 or 14, excluding brief fleeting spells of respite from the crushing feelings that control me, I‚Äôve always just felt to be in a hyperbolic state of loneliness and pessimism. I suppose, for as long as I can remember, I wanted to be liked. Often this didn‚Äôt happen and for the first couple years of high school (ages 11-12/13) I just didn‚Äôt really have a lot of friends, and I think it is in this time that I started to develop a bit of a ‚Äòdesperate onlooker‚Äô attitude if you will. I felt like an outsider looking in on these groups of boys all chatting, playing football together and going to parties, when I didn‚Äôt have any of this, bar a couple of friends. It didn‚Äôt help that my older brother has never had these issues, which he reminded me of often, even though it wasn‚Äôt intentional. Two summers of high school were primarily spent in my house, fending off questions from my parents about why I‚Äôm not meeting my friends. All 2 of them? I was an arsehole, I still am, but I certainly was then, trying to push my isolated pedestal as high as I could for my own sanity. Then when I was 13 (nearly 14), through some miracle (xbox), I made a group of friends, kids who I was ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô with at school, but they were their own group, one of the ones that I had grown to resent myself for not being in. I started to become very close with them, and for the first time in my adolescent life it really felt like I belonged. We would spend our schooldays having fun, lunchtimes playing football, weekends playing xbox together until late at night on our Minecraft world, or playing pro clubs on Fifa, and for once in my life it really felt like I had something that I had always wanted, but sadly this is when those late nights led to crushing feelings of loneliness, which was strange to me. I had what I had longed for. The feelings manifested themselves slowly and carefully, making sure not to immediately trip any alarms as they began their slow coup of my mind. They first began to present themselves in the form of laziness during the day and hyperactivity at night time. This led to many a nighttime wasted away on screens, which led to me waking up late the next day and feeling rubbish, only to go back to bed and repeat the cycle. I became irritable, but a different kind of irritable than I was used to, with a dull blade. My schoolwork took a hit, I chose to try and numb the pain through idle business, or in other words, playing a fuck ton of football manager whenever I was meant to work. I became pretty successful with it too. In a virtual world. I suppose that‚Äôs where a lot of the satisfaction came from for me at the time and it provided me with something else to do other than feel sorry for myself. My friends had noticed a change in my behaviour, but to them it was all just a joke and I became known in the group for my ‚Äòdeep chats‚Äô that to them were just so trivial. Winter fell like a heavy blanket and amplified everything I had already been feeling. My constant attempts to reach out an arm had been knocked back, and when somebody actually grabbed me I chose not to accept their help. What did they know? I never got help through the channels that I should‚Äôve done and it was all starting to culminate. In Jan of 22, this is what I wrote:  
I feel so fucking hollow. Right now I‚Äôm just floating around inside my head watching my life go by. My emotions are hurting someone else. I‚Äôm sitting in the backseat of my own life. I feel that I‚Äôve detached from my own body and that and my mind are separate. When I was feeling the pain I wanted it to stop but if I knew it would be replaced by this life-sapping numbness then I would‚Äôve just taken it on the chin. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt know how to break the cycle. I just can‚Äôt see myself every feeling how I used to again. I‚Äôm so fucking naive. I don‚Äôt want to die I just wanna be happy. I‚Äôm sorry.  
This was after a long period where, I must specify, I had no intention to kill myself, but I had been having lots of thoughts pertaining to topics like suicide and death, and the futility of it all. As you can quite clearly see from what I wrote, I didn‚Äôt see any way forward and I held no hope that things would improve for me. The couple months after this I‚Äôd like to not-so-affectionately dub ‚Äòthe black hole‚Äô, because essentially that‚Äôs what it was. I hardly left the house, I did actually no work of any kind at school, lost a hockey cup final (which, hurts a lot still) and, worse than doing no work, my parents found out that I‚Äôd been doing no work, so they gave me a much needed kick up the arse in terms of that, but don‚Äôt let it distract you from the fact I was genuinely just miserable on a constant cycle. A girl who I‚Äôd been very close with and had relied heavily upon for support had completely left my life. I felt like I had nothing. These feelings were so intense that they earned this period in time the term ‚Äòblack hole‚Äô because I can‚Äôt even remember it. Things then got better, for a while, and maybe I thought I was over it. This was pretty naive however, as just as I felt okay again, in June ‚Äô22 I wrote this:  
I evidently don‚Äôt have the correct words to describe this rn so I‚Äôll let it all spill out until something fits. i feel so shit rn and its the kind of hopeless shit that i remember feeling when stuff was really bad and it just peaked again when i was walking home earlier it just‚Ä¶ kinda hit me. Not hit me in the ‚Äúive got an idea‚Äù sense but like someone physically came up behind me and fucking smashed my legs with a metal pipe. I dont want to use the word ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù but im feeling the absolute shitness coming back and right now it feels so shit because the last few months of my life I‚Äôve just fought it and fought it and just now as i started to relax again it‚Äôs decided to just reappear. It makes all the progress I made seem pointless. Everything is slower and it‚Äôs like im back in a nightmare but i know its just a dream. i kinda accounted for what would happen if i started to feel the way i did again but this is all so sudden and i just dont know what to do. ill sleep on it and see if it passes.  
This ‚Äòrelapse‚Äô was short lived as I walked into what was probably the most enjoyable summer of my life so far. Our group of boys had merged with a group of girls, and everything was exciting and refreshing and warm. The evenings were often seen out lying on a grassy cricket pitch, feeling very naughty because we were drinking alcohol (#shock revelation). Long story short, since then, it has been on a steady downhill. My friend group has started to fall apart into smaller sections, I‚Äôve not been able to stay consistent at the gym and it all just feels a bit.. Flat. The only positive to draw is that I did really well in my Nat5 Exams, getting straight As.

"I was driving home from work, thinking about what to eat for dinner. I just hung up my phone with my fianc√©, there was heavy traffic. I waited in a long line of cars reaching the off-ramp. As I neared the off ramp, traffic started to pick up. I started to pick up my speed (maybe 40mph)and realized everyone was coming to a stop. It was abrupt, but I saw it coming from at least 8 car distances away. I immediately started slowing, I checked my rear view mirror.

"Me (24F) and my ex (23M) broke up around 18 months ago. I find it very difficult to talk about to people in my life as we live in a very small community where rumours spread like wildfire and everybody knows everybody.

When we broke up he harassed me online and in person, as well as going out of his way to spread malicious rumours about me not only to his friends and family, but to my friends, family and coworkers as well (a number of whom sadly believed him)

"I moved out to Toronto 3 years ago and saved money cause a car is a must have here at least in the suburbs. I didn't have a shit ton of money so I was looking at something that would just drive me to school and work, nothing fancy. 

Last year it was a crazy complicated year to buy cars. Supply was very low and demand was crazy high to the point that some cars got sold while I was taking the bus to meet them. Until eventually I found an old car that was within my budget and arranged a day to meet.

Before I started checking cars out my cousin that is mechanic told me what I had to look at before buying a car. It must have less than 200000 km, check the rust and what parts of the engine to check too. Most important was that the safety certificate is a must have.

When I went check the car out it complied with every point in the checklist but when I went check the car out for rust it had a black oil/grease underneath. I thought it was just the rustproofing they did here as I didn't notice any major rust for my eye. So I was already really tired of looking for Cars in this market and I had to start college soon so I decided to buy it. 

A year after when that oil underneath dissapeared and I took it to a mechanic for checking a noise in the back he told me that the whole underneath back part was rusted out and It could break at any moment and I should get rid of it.

However, despite this large family, I've always felt slightly alone. No one ever knew who my father was, and my mother died 3 days after my birth because there were complications. I must take after my father in looks, too, because everyone says my only resemblance to my mother is my natural hair, which I like to cut and dye in ""unique"" ways. My mother never had any other children, either, which makes me the only one in my family with no siblings. Still, my family has always included me and seemed to love me. My grandmother (57F) was my main parental figure, though my aunts and uncles helped too.

I've heard some people say that antisocial personality disorder (or sociopathy, for the layman) can sometimes be caused by trauma. Without going into too much detail, I did go through quite a few traumatic things as a young child, though none were the fault of my family. When I was little, I could tell that I didn't quite fit in with other kids, but I had already been diagnosed with autism at age 4, so I assumed at first that that was why I couldn't understand their emotions. 

Autism runs in my family, but unlinke me, most of my family members are hyper-empathetic. They can't stand the sight of roadkill, can't bear to kill bugs, cry at the end of every movie, even when it isn't sad, and comforting others seems as natural as breathing to them. I've tried, but when other people are upset, even if I care for them, the most I can feel is frustration. I usually just distance from them until the issue is resolved or try to solve the problem myself so they can get over it and be happy again. I've never felt any real grief or sadness, even when I lose something important, the most I can muster is, again, frustration. I do hate change, and I hate losing things that I see as mine, including people and relationships, but I don't get sad, no matter how hard I try. People tell me that sadness isn't fun, but I've lost far more from not being able to feel it than I think I would have if I could.

I think I first realized I was different when I was 9 and my grandfather (48M at the time) died in a car accident. Everyone was sobbing at the funeral, but I felt nothing. I still remember how he taught me to tie my shoes, and the words to my favorite song at the time. Everyone seemed shocked that I was so unaffected. I think my aunt thought that I didn't understand what was happening, so she brought me up to ""say goodbye"" to him, but all I did was stare for a while and then say that I wanted to sit down again because my fancy shoes hurt my feet. She asked me if I understood that I would never get to talk to him again, and asked if that was really the last thing I wanted to say to him, so I responded that technically, the last thing I said to him was to pass the milk for my cereal the morning before he died, and he couldn't hear me. She got pretty hysterical after that, but I think people have mostly forgottten about that whole incident these days.

I've never been very good at hiding my lack or empathy or sadness, or even true anger. I think the only reason it can still surprise people is that I can feel happiness. I love being happy, so I indulge in it. I have hobbies, interests, and goals that bring me joy. I make surface level friends so that we can have fun hanging out, but I try not to let them get too attached to me, because I know that eventually I won't be able to offer the support they need. If I see them starting to get too close, I either distance or cut them out and start new again. After all these years, I think my family knows, too. They still include me in family events and invite me to participate in games and meals and fun activities, but no one looks to me for support or advice. Honestly, it's a relief. I do care about them, but them trying to seek me out for comfort will only make both of us uncomfortable.

As the title says, despite all of this, I am not a bad person. My family taught me right vs wrong, and I believe in it wholeheartedly. I might not understand their emotions or their hurt, but I have fought for my family members in countless ways and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I will protect them and the morals they brought me up to believe in at any cost. I refuse to stand for injustice, and I largely do not care about the repercussions to myself, because those repercussionsare only further injustice to fight. I know that most people are really only out for themselves, but that's not a bad thing in my opinion, because most people want good things. People want peace and happiness for themselves, I don't think that's bad. People who hurt innocents are unforgivable, because hurting innocents is hardly ever necessary. I'm out to protrct myself and the people and things that are important to me, and anyone who claims any different is either naive or manipulative.

I've seen many people with sociopathy talk about hurting people when they're bored, but I think my affinity for happiness helps to stop that. When I'm bored, I mostly do the same things anyone else might. I draw, or listen to music, or go out with friends. There have been some occasions where I crossed the line for fun, but I never did those things again. For example, I once spread a rumor about a friend at school that she had a secret long-distance boyfriend. I was a kid, and honestly, I just thought it would be a fun story to tell my other friends. I went all-out on the details, inventing his fake family, their first meeting, etc. I hadn't really considered the fact that she already had a boyfriend at the school. It wasn't until a week later when i was called to the office to see her crying that I even realized I'd hurt her. I admitted to everything immediately and it was handled by the school. Obviously, I lost her as a friend, as well as the rest of the group, but I never did that again. Even if she was sort of annoying sometimes, I didn't want to have to watch her cry or shout at me again, it made me uncomfortable.

I don't know if I'm truly capable of love. Honestly, my ideas of emotion are probably completely messed up, but I know that I can care about people. I can like being around them, have fun with them, and want them to be happy. I protect what I care about, it's when I can't help that problems start. I didn't expect this post to get this long, so I'll just leave this here. I guess I just wanted to share and hopefully get some replies from people who at least try to understand.","I think I may be a sociopath, but I don't think I'm a bad person",18oc59u,1703241764.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18oc59u/i_think_i_may_be_a_sociopath_but_i_dont_think_im/,

And probably not in the way you think.  
I work full time. I put nearly 70% of my income aside in the hope of one day becoming a homeowner (gen Z, you know). 15% goes towards my rent. And the remaining 15% goes on food and hygiene, always the cheapest products (I avoid brand names at all costs). 

I use public transport to avoid paying for a car. I cut my own hair. I avoid any 'unnecessary' expenditure.  If I'm ill, I cut back on food to be able to pay for treatment. When I don't have guests, I don't turn the heating on at home.

"Idk why I‚Äôm making this, it‚Äôs definitely selfish but it‚Äôs been eating at me recently. This was a couple years ago and I‚Äôm probably not over it and the whole thing is probably silly but idc. 

This is a letter to you, person who made me feel like I was a teenager struck by lightning and then just ceased to exist in my life. 

I‚Äôm not sure what space I was in, but knowing me I was probably in a dark place. It‚Äôs not healthy or even fair to blame you for these feelings but you pulled me out for a bit, and while that‚Äôs not on you - I blame you. I‚Äôd rather have been in that hole than have met you. 

We matched on one of those dumbass dating apps. Idk who said what but it was clear we were into each other and we met (with my dog as security of course) at a nearby park and hit it off immediately. We took pictures of the trees and flowers, it was winter in the low country but we still had stuff to see. We talked about so many things and then we kissed, and kept kissing, taming it for people walking by. It was random and sudden and enveloping. I didn‚Äôt want to drive you home but, despite our ages we were unfortunately restricted by living with our families at the time. It didn‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôd figure out any way to spend time together in that short span of time. 

If we weren‚Äôt together we were texting. How hard I fell for you as a person with the words you gave me. You drew my favorite Pok√©mon on a whim and I don‚Äôt think you ever understood how much that meant to me. I can‚Äôt even remember what we talked about. Maybe I was just using you as a distraction from that hole I was in. 

I remember we went to the movies once, we saw some bullshit movie about a circus troupe or some such and there was fraud involved, idk it didn‚Äôt matter. It was only you and I and we couldn‚Äôt keep our hands off each other, until the fire alarm ended it prematurely. It was almost shameful and yet I was so happy, I felt like I was a teenage boy all over again feeling every feeling for the first time again. 

We managed get ourselves a room in the city for a night, actually taking steps to fulfill all the dreams we talked about in text. We got to the room early enough and then walked around the old city holding hands doing all that fun stuff - the kind that young lovers do. I wish I had you send me the selfies we took, maybe not. That night we went for sushi. I can‚Äôt even remember it being particularly good, but I know when it hurt my stomach you didn‚Äôt judge me.  Later on we stayed up late doin the things we said we‚Äôd do. I knew when you rolled over and asked me if I‚Äôd ever been in love I should‚Äôve told you how I felt at that time, for everything I had felt, I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt but maybe it‚Äôs for the best. 

The next morning we went to Waffle House, essentially my church - which you knew. And I dropped you off, and we kissed. We kept texting and everything was normal and fine. And then suddenly there was nothing there, no response. Even after sending a niche meme which normally would‚Äôve elicited a response - nada. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened and I don‚Äôt even blame you - our love was a long shot for a myriad of reasons. I‚Äôm just mad that you showed me how I want to feel when I‚Äôm in love, I hadn‚Äôt been so comfortable and weightless in so long. It‚Äôs not your fault, there‚Äôs not fault in this ordeal other than my own. It was something I needed to learn again, and the sting of losing it was also something I had to relearn.

"Writing it down and posting it here because I can‚Äôt really talk to no one about it. All everyone says is that I‚Äôm better off without a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù like that, or to let him go f#ck himself. They‚Äôre right and I know all that, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt me like hell. 

I met him a couple of years ago and we became very good friends. We really had good times. He went through a difficult time and I was there for him, trying to help him as much as I could. I really wanted him to feel better and get through it. He would call me for hours on end and whenever we were together we would talk about it. 

Well, I felt the friendship changed from his side some months ago. I noticed I was always the one reaching out and trying (hard) to make plans. It didn‚Äôt feel right and I tried to talk about it with him. His response was that there was nothing wrong etc etc.. always some reason that apparently he only had with me, but that was only a feeling. I tried to let it go, doubted myself because when we would finally meet everything seemed to be fine. After some time I expressed how I felt again; same answer. It made me insecure but I thought it was just me.

The last time I was with him, he was very distant. We planned to have dinner together and watch a movie, but right before dinner he told me he made other plans, so I basically had like 30 mins to eat my dinner and leave. I felt like he only agreed to eat together because he didn‚Äôt want or couldn‚Äôt say no. I felt like I was an appointment or something, squeezed in into his schedule. 

After that I invited him one more time and he agreed. At the very last minute he texted me he couldn‚Äôt make it. Now if I go into detail this will be a very long post, but his story/excuse just didn‚Äôt add up. He went somewhere else instead, but he doesn‚Äôt know I know that. I only texted back: that‚Äôs too bad. I simply didn‚Äôt know what else to say. At that point I kind of expected him to reach out to me to make other plans or something, but that was August and I have not heard a single damn thing from him since. I am also done reaching out, trying, begging almost to be my friend because I tried to communicate but nothing changes. 

Today I had to learn from someone else that he moved out of his house, and now lives with his girlfriend. I knew nothing about it all. 

Now, of course it‚Äôs none of my business if he has a gf or not, and I wasn‚Äôt there for him just to get something in return, but I was his friend and it meant a lot to me. To now realize I meant nothing to him hurts very much. It makes me doubt myself because I have no idea what I did wrong. How can I do something about it if I have no idea why he‚Äôs doing this. 

I‚Äôm very sad. I feel used. He clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and I have no idea why and why he‚Äôs doing this. I want to delete him from my social media (he still lurks, watching my stories) and my phone but somehow I‚Äôm not ready yet. But I don‚Äôt want to make a fool out of myself and reach out again either. The friendship meant a lot to me. It made me feel like I‚Äôm not a nice person, not fun to be around, not worth it. It makes me wonder how many people are just pretending to like me. I can‚Äôt stop crying.

"I don‚Äôt know what else to say.

The more I grow older, the more my stances are becoming firmer.

I realized I absolutely didn‚Äôt want kids the moment I babysat a few kids for a month. The kids were great, but I saw misery and agony in the parents. 

When I confronted this, I‚Äôve been met with excuses like ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be, having children isn‚Äôt gonna be easy!‚Äù Yet I‚Äôm encouraged if not pressured to have one anyways. 

I‚Äôve been getting constant compliments such as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be a great parent‚Äù whenever I handle kids. For some that‚Äôs great to hear but it feels like a burning insult. 

The other question comes in with how marriages are also just as miserable. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe in love, it‚Äôs just how I see the  financial burden that comes with signing a contract for union. 

I see a couple mention that marriages are rocky and that divorce rates are high, but I see married couples divorce quickly either because the dynamics of them being parents go out of hand the moment it comes to chores; or that them being together costs a livelihood that could‚Äôve been flourished had they had more time to figure themselves out.

But yet I‚Äôm getting the question of ‚Äúso when do you plan on getting married‚Äù from the mother of the partner I‚Äôm dating. A pressure that I have to feel, that I‚Äôm not ready for and don‚Äôt plan on doing.

I (24m) still think about my high school ( so I was 18) sweet heart almost every day. We broke up after high school before we went to college just because we didn‚Äôt want to potentially hold each other back initially or not initially. More her idea than mine.  I had been sexually active before but with her I was not. And even despite that I feel that I fell in love with her and have not found anyone who I feel as strongly about.  

We dated for several months really and got together essentially because I asked her to senior Prom. I always thought she was cute when I met her junior year of high school but never pursued anything as we hardly talked.

I think about the little things we did and our dates . Just her beautiful blue eyes and the one time we went camping and I woke up and saw them looking at me as I woke up. Thinking of her makes me want her gaze direct towards me right now . Her attitude , upbring and just outlook on like I admire and think about all the time.

I (24M) thought it would go away as time went by but nope.  I know I ‚Äôve never liked someone as much as her and I still have thoughts about if I saw her and if I could win her back. Everytime I go back to my hometown for the holiday I just wish she flys back and fantasize about her reaching out (I  did reach out one time but I went to our home town on a non holiday time of the year and she informed me she lived in the east coast)I think about ways to impress her if I see her. I even have thoughts about visiting the city she‚Äôs in and seeing if I can meet up with her. Or even think about what if I ran into her and etc.

"Let me explain

Lately i have been paying more attention to the conversations i have with other people. What i concluded is that almost every interaction a person has in the conversation is by relating, or telling a story a out him/herself or comparing him/herself to it. 
For example, i say ‚Äúi am so tired from work‚Äù. The most typical answers are ‚Äúand so am i ‚Äú or ‚Äúif you are tired , imagine how i feel having worked 10 straight hours‚Äù. Almost 99% of the time people interact by deviating the conversation to themselves, and never by wanting to learn more about the person who spoke. 
Almost never is the answer ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre tired, it must be tough‚Äù or ‚Äúdamn, but are you feeling happy? Rewarded?‚Äù

I called him and told him i‚Äôll be at his soon. I was late 15 mins and he started yelling at me, admitted to blocking me and that we were done.

I'll admit and I even told him I didn't like him at first but he grew on me. We texted all the time, sent each other music, talked about our lives etc. When they were looking for a new manager I pushed for him. He's one of the hardest working people I've ever met.

He had also just moved to another town to manage a store and was feeling similar feelings to me about being lonely. 

Once I came back home I saw him twice because he had moved from our hometown but like I said we never stopped communicating.

Back In 2018 I (19F at the time!) was in a somewhat serious relationship and my Grandmother (Paternal) gave me her stunning engagement ring just incase the day ever came along that we got engaged, long story short that relationship ended, badly, but my gran told me to keep the ring because she‚Äôd never given me anything before and she wanted me to keep it, engaged or not. 

In December 2020 we lost my Gran, Im still not sure what actually happened because everyone has told me a different version of events, most peoples story‚Äôs changing every time they tell it too so I‚Äôve accepted I might never really know what happened to her, I just know that she was fine the week before when I went there for dinner and the next week I get a frantic phone call from my dad telling me she had died. 

Now on terms of context of my dad, he‚Äôs been struggling with addiction since around 2007 when my youngest sister passed away not long after birth, I‚Äôve always been my dads biggest advocate and supporter but he consistently disappears for years at a time, has been in prison a good few times and a couple of years ago I let him borrow my PlayStation to play the remake of FF7 (the original was the first game I ever played and it was my dad that got me into it so I wanted to share that with him) but a month later when I asked for it back he ghosted me for over a year and then got back in touch to ask me to go pick a new one out with him so he could buy a new one for me without saying anything about the old one but obviously, he sold it, this was the first and only time (I‚Äôm aware of) that he has stole from me.

This brings me onto the present. My dad turned up at my door last night after about a year of not seeing or speaking to him, with his new girlfriend. He stuck around for a bit and told me he‚Äôd just picked up my grand ashes, apparently nobody had bothered before now, and then told me that he and his girlfriend were engaged, the conversation changed course a little after this but it wasn‚Äôt too long until he dropped in ‚Äúhave you still got your granny‚Äôs ring‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even skip a beat with it, I knew where this was going so I just said ‚Äúof course I do but you can‚Äôt have it she gave it to me‚Äù and this went on to a whole mini argument 
‚ÄúWhy not‚Äù - dad 
‚ÄúBecause granny gave it to me and told me I could have it‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not going to use it‚Äù
‚ÄúI might use it and it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway, she gave it to me I‚Äôm not giving it to you, nobody gave me anything else from her house after she died this and the guitar she got me when I turned 20 is all I‚Äòve ever gotten from her so it means a lot to me I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt have it‚Äù 
And then he kind of dropped it after I said that but I‚Äôd like to add the ring fits my hand PERFECTLY and I am proposing to my boyfriend who I have been with way longer than he‚Äôs been with his girlfriend for in February, I‚Äôve bought him his own ring but I am planning to wear my grans,  yes, I identify myself as male but I‚Äôm still generally quite a feminine guy, I don‚Äôt mind the feminine style ring &amp; it was my grans so it has a lot of special meaning to me, more than any other ring would. 

He didn‚Äôt stick around much longer after that but since he left I can‚Äôt shake this feeling of guilt, this ring means so much to me, I have plans for it &amp; she gave it to me and as guilty as I feel about thinking it I just don‚Äôt trust where it would end up if I gave it to him. 

I already struggle from a really extreme anxiety disorder but I‚Äôve been having mini panic attacks since last night because now he knows the ring is in my house as well as other stuff he saw in here (consoles, TV, etc) because I guess I‚Äôm just terrified I‚Äôm going to get robbed &amp; with it being right on the back of Christmas I‚Äôm panicking even more. I don‚Äôt think he would break into my house and rob me but I also thought once upon a time he wasn‚Äôt the type to steal off me &amp; sell my stuff and I was wrong about that. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do or how to stay calm &amp; stop feeling guilty, I‚Äôve asked him before to stay away until he‚Äôs been clean for a long time but he‚Äôs so good at lying and he knows exactly how to push my buttons, I hate thinking horrible things about him because he‚Äôs my dad but his addiction has caused me so much pain in the past I just don‚Äôt trust that it won‚Äôt happen again but these feelings of guilt for saying no to him (I‚Äôve literally never said no to him) and fears of being robbed are nawing away at me, I don‚Äôt want to bother anyone close to me with my stresses because it‚Äôs already an extremely stressful time of the year for everyone without my shit, guess I was just looking for a place to get all of this out.

"i, a female teenager, fantasize about being scooped up my someone older and taken against my will. i want someone experienced to make me feel good and leave me no room to make my own discussions, i want to be taken care of by someone i give my everything. 

i know theres a lot of things wrong with this and i‚Äôm going to break it down.

first, i‚Äôm a minor, wanting an adult. off the bat thats horrible, i have had no connection or relation with someone older. just the idea of someone experienced and, though its shameful to admit, rich to take care of me. i struggle with mental health problems and i can never ever find a will, or the motivation to live so the thought of someone who can take care of me excites me, and even though i know it wrong, i know theres a higher chance of me being able to obtain this because i‚Äôm underage with a pretty well developed body.

thing is its easy to do online, say your 18 and no one baits an eye, but i yearn for something in person, what scares me the most is that i‚Äôm not horny when writing this, nor am i under the influence of anything at the moment. which to me means i‚Äôm not being pursauded by a temporary motive. 

another thing i can point out and recognize as wrong is how i want it to be against my will. i know theres a lot of victims who struggle and in no way am i trying to undermine that. i don‚Äôt know why this appeals to me, i wish it didn‚Äôt. but not getting to make a choice, not getting caught up in my own head. just having it done, and having it feel so, so good. stains my mind, its a unrealistic fantasy cause what the hell do i know? i‚Äôm a teenager.

its gotten bad, i‚Äôve had these thoughts for a while, to the point where i looked into those sketchy hook up apps that would need a lot of celerity about my age. what do i do? i cant go to anyone for help for this and i‚Äôm not sure how to better myself from this.",i‚Äôm a teenager who wants someone older to ruin me,18ob5zm,1703237853.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18ob5zm/im_a_teenager_who_wants_someone_older_to_ruin_me/,

I have 2 jobs with hours that just increased and I‚Äôm struggling to keep up with the workload. I just finished a couple of online college courses and I‚Äôm still trying to decompress from the pressure of those. 

I live in a small rural town in Alaska that‚Äôs 2 hours away from the next biggest town, and I‚Äôm feeling trapped because it‚Äôs always snowing and the roads are usually too bad to get out of town this time of year.

"Hi, I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôve never used this sub so I hope this is okay, but I need somewhere to vent really bad because I just finished screaming in my house so loud my neighbors came to check on me. 

I don‚Äôt really know where to start and I‚Äôve deleted this and retyped it so many times but. In 2018 I found out my wife was cheating on me, she simply just got bored, we had been together for 5 years and started dating at 18. I never even considered the reality of that happening, cheating is something I never even thought about. We have a kid together, and I have another kid with my middle/high school sweetheart. It broke me in ways I never imagined. She became very mentally abusive and spread lies and rumors so she could play victim and I just let her. I was too depressed to argue or even care. She successfully isolated me, and later that year filed custody papers on my birthday knowing I have been constantly fighting with my oldest kids mom to kick me while I was down.

I maintained 50% custody of both of my kids at the expense of a couple tens of grand I didn‚Äôt have, putting me really financially behind. I lost my job because I was so hollow I couldn‚Äôt even take care of myself, I went through a long couple of years constantly in and out of mental health facilities. Fast forward to just before covid. I had a pretty good job, I was finally doing better and catching up on everything, but I worked for the state dealing with court stuff. Covid hit, and I lost my job because we had no idea when we could go back to work. I couldn‚Äôt find a job, and it took 8months to get my first unemployment check. I couldn‚Äôt find anything at the time due to everything closing down where I lived. So I ended up sleeping in my car for a few months. During this time my kids moms used my homelessness as a reason to take all but every other weekend supervised away from me. This pushed me into the darkest place I had ever been. I tried to kill myself about a year into covid, and am only alive today because I somehow didn‚Äôt kill my liver despite drinking 3 bottles of NyQuil and 3 more of DayQuil. 

I woke up the next day in horrid pain, which stuck around for about a week, pulled myself up by my bootstraps and kept going. I eventually found a new decent job, which I struggled with because I am so empty, maintained it, slowly started to catch up, fell in love, everything was finally moving forward again. I saw a light at the end of my few years of darkness. I could finally ‚Äúafford‚Äù therapy. I had everything financially planned, I was making friends and coming home to feel safe and loved. 

Then things got bad, I tried to get equal custody back but couldn‚Äôt afford to fight in court, which was really heavy on me. My kids are the only reason i even made it so far. It started weighing heavily on me and I started to get depressed again. My partner at the time didn‚Äôt want to or know how to handle it, and so she dumped me and asked me to move out of our place. This happened in March. I had to sleep in my car again, done it before. Then my car started to break down in may and I couldn‚Äôt afford to fix it, my job wouldn‚Äôt let me work remote and it was a 30 minute drive away. Ended up losing my job because I couldn‚Äôt make it consistently anymore. Ended up finding another job in July, even further behind, at the end of July someone pulled out in front of me while I was on a main road and totaled my car, but I have liability, and so my insurance and the cops were adamant I was not at fault, and won‚Äôt help me, her insurance will not pay because they think she‚Äôs not entirely at fault since I should have had time to avoid her, which is not true. I lawyered up but we‚Äôre still fighting and I haven‚Äôt seen a penny. My new job wouldn‚Äôt work with me and eventually let me go at the end of November. I didn‚Äôt have my car to sleep in anymore. 

I convinced someone to let me crash on their couch until now, but they want me out now and I don‚Äôt blame them, I‚Äôm just over 30,000 in debt, I have no vehicle, I had to get rid of everything I owned because I have nowhere to keep it. I can barely see my kids. I feel so empty and hollow.

I have nothing left to lose, and as I sit here unable to buy my kids Christmas, or even see them for the holiday for that matter, not knowing what I‚Äôll do come the new year and I truly end up homeless. Seeing years ahead of me of lonely suffering while I grasp at air to try and fix my life, I just. I think I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt do any of this anymore. Come the new year I think I‚Äôm just going to walk off into the countryside and kill myself. I don‚Äôt want to suffer anymore, I can‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt felt anything but pain for months, everything is so fucked up. I have failed everyone, but most of all myself.

"First time posting here.

My heart is broken.. 

Grandma came home on hospice after being in the hospital for a long time, and passed the next day. She was surrounded by family. She's no longer suffering.

The night prior, my mom and I took turns monitoring her; I'd been awake 24+ hrs straight after traveling back home. I took a nap for maybe an hour before Mom woke me because Grandma stopped breathing.

It didn't (and still doesn't) feel real. I keep hoping it's a bad dream and I'll wake up anytime. 

Mom and Grandma raised me by themselves for the first decade of my life. I'd go over to Grandma's house for sleepovers and visits as I got older.

I feel so lost and empty, like I'm a little child again. I wish I spent more time with her after moving out with my spouse. I wish I talked to her more. I wish I had more patience as her memory gradually got worse. I wish I had more time with her. She never got to see the first home my spouse and I bought. She never got to meet my newest dog. She'll never get to meet her future great-grandchild(ren).

The last thing I said to her was ""I love you Grandma"". She responded ""I love you too"". That was several days ago, and I'm afraid I'll forget the sound of her voice.

I never stopped loving him, I just tried so hard to move on and be an adult, a mature, respected adult but my heart still skips a beat when I see him.

He's trying to date others and I try to give him space but he and I always end up in bed together. He hasn't confessed anything and neither have. I don't know if he still has feelings for me but God I love him so much it hurts every day.

"Last year my families Christmas plans changed a little and my older sister (22 so she doesn't live in the house) said she would come to the house later instead of the agreed upon time because she was tired because of work. 

This caused my mom to flip and spend Christmas eve night till 2 in the morning walking in and out the house and to my sisters place to yell at her lying she saw someone with her and that she was apparently ditching Christmas

In the morning my mom started making us (me and my twin) do things like hold champagne glasses with her so she could take photos of our hands and make it look like she's with other adults to guilt us for our sisters actions.

Then she got piss drunk and started to accuse me of stealing her vodka and then proceed to smash a plate right against the wall. So me and my twin went off with my sister after calling us to spend Christmas somewhere else.

As soon as my sister turned up and phoned the police my mom completely changed seemingly sobered up in an instance.

So we went off to a friends house and stayed the day and night their and then proceed to go home in the morning with my mom going ""my own family left me alone on christmas""

So this year I just suggested we just didn't do it this year because of what happened last year. My mom called me ungrateful but its not that I don't care about the gifts I'm grateful for that it's just everything else.

I kept saying whenever Christmas was brought up that I didn't want to do it or that they can do it and I'd go elsewhere but everytime my mom just calls me names and ungrateful.

I'm just worried this Christmas will be the exact same as last year. I just can't wait till I'm old enough to move out.

I just want to yell at her everytime she says ""my kids left me alone on christmas"" or ""I was all alone on christmas"" to explain why we did, then say to her if she doesn't pack up her selfish shitty behaviour that she will spend more then last years christmas alone.

That is something he wouldn‚Äôt have been comfortable with at the time, and I still can‚Äôt fathom why I did it. He knows and he said it‚Äôs weird and attention seeking and embarrassing for him.

"about 14 months ago i (19f now) was violently raped and it was horribly traumatic for me and caused me to develop severe ptsd symptoms. it was the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me and it ruined my life. ive been in therapy for it and have finally been making a little bit of progress. 

ive been dating my boyfriend (19m) for about four months now and he is the most wonderful person ive ever met. he knows the full extent of what happened to me when i was raped and respects all of my boundaries regarding certain things that i thought would trigger me. we‚Äôve been sexually intimate with one another from very early on in our relationship but didn‚Äôt go all the way until about a month ago. he took my virginity as what happened to me last year does not count and was my only other experience with penetration. when we have sex, he checks in on me regularly and always makes sure that i always finish first. it is always very emotionally intimate and vanilla, usually face to face in missionary holding hands and looking into each others eyes. he is so sweet and i love him so much and i find what we do so incredibly beautiful. 

however, i am extremely surprised to have recently realized that i think my trauma from last year has given me some pretty intense kinks that i find myself thinking about in order to finish. ive done a lot of research about the subject and i know that it is extremely common for rape survivors to develop pretty violent and intense kinks after their assault, but i feel absolutely crushed to be one of those people. it devastates me that i cannot get what i want out of our loving, passionate sex. i feel like my rapist broke me and ruined my perception of sex and pleasure. i want our gentle loving sex to be enough. 

i always thought that the types of stuff ive realized now turn me on would trigger me and send me into a flashback of panic attack, as i have dealt with those pretty intensely with my ptsd from things as simple as smelling something that reminds me of that night. so why am i suddenly fantasizing my boyfriend doing these things to me??

i don‚Äôt know how or if i should tell him. i don‚Äôt want him to think i was faking my boundaries before or something for attention bc now i want those things and more?? he has held me through bad episodes and we have talked at great lengths about everything, but this just feels so different. i am scared it will be too much for him or that he will judge me or be disgusted by how i am fetishizing my trauma. what if he‚Äôs not into it? how would i even begin to broach this subject?

"I‚Äôm (18f) visiting home from college for the holidays. I feel so sick. I was sitting on the corner part of the family-room couch and my dad (57) stood over me yelling, I could see the spit flying out of his mouth. He slapped my leg and I just froze for a few seconds. I suddenly felt like a little girl again and started crying and yelling back and kicked his legs a couple times and ran away to my room and sobbed there for a while. 

I‚Äôm so sad for kicking him, I want him to be well and healthy and I literally just inflicted pain on him wtf. He knocked on the door shortly after and said he was sorry from the hallway. I yelled crying that I didn‚Äôt care and he wouldn‚Äôt have done that if he was sorry. In hindsight, my response didn‚Äôt make much sense since that‚Äôs now how apologies work. 

He‚Äôs said sorry for things like this before and then went on to repeat them time and time again. So what do his sorries mean? That he feels bad but not enough to fix his problem? What am I supposed to do with that?

I know I‚Äôm only barely an adult but I thought this stuff ended after childhood. I knew back then it wasn‚Äôt okay and that logically it was abuse but emotionally I hadn‚Äôt accepted that term, ‚Äúabuse‚Äù for him. Because he‚Äôs my dad and I love him. I don‚Äôt want him to be an abusive person. 

But as an adult, being ‚Äú18‚Äù, I feel more confident in my judgements and perceived experiences with that title of sorts backing up my credibility in this. This is abuse. I can‚Äôt imagine him doing that to my mom, so he obviously shouldn‚Äôt be inflicting that on me, a grown woman. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with this epiphany or how to navigate this. I‚Äôm just sad.

I‚Äôm making an edit here more so for myself just as a reminder to trust my judgment here and not to forgive/forget like I‚Äôve always done.

"My partner (27M) and I (26F) have been together for 2 years. In that time I've always suspected he was bi, but never asked because I figured if he felt the need to tell me he would. Ultimately it wasn't anything that had an impact on our relationship, or so I thought.

We were both comfortable commenting on the attractiveness of other men and to be perfectly honest it actually has been the most healthy and honest relationship I've ever had. A few months ago he sat me down to tell me he was bi, that he's always been bi and known it, but he's never said it out loud. I felt immensely honored that he felt comfortable sharing this with me and being open and honest and was really proud of how brave he was. I made sure to tell him this and made sure to communicate that I was ok with it. He assured me it wasn't going to change anything about our relationship as he'd always been aware of it, but it was just something that simply went from unspoken to spoken.

We were out the other night and one of my gay friends started hitting on my partner. This isn't anything new with this friend and my partner usually responds back with a cheeky flirtatious joke. My friend regularly comments on how lucky I am to have such an attractive man in my life and has jokingly said when drunk ""if you guys weren't together I would shoot my shot."" I trust this friend, I know he would never do anything to hurt me and he is genuinely so happy for us as a couple because he knows our pasts. Normally I'm not insecure about this, but this time when he said ""so when are you going to realize your gay and carry me away like a Disney Princess?"" My partner replied with, ""well I mean I did come out as bi recently so who knows what the future holds."" We all laughed, but in the pit of my stomach I felt fear.

My ex cheated on me, 6 times that I'm aware of, and my partner knows this. He left me with some major emotional and mental scars that took a lot to get through. My partner was also cheated on by his ex it's one of the first things we connected over when we met. I know maybe starting the foundation of a relationship with ""hey I've been cheated on."" Probably isn't the best, but we both understood we had trust issues since our exes both cheated on us with other people who were in our lives. People we called friends. We both have strong boundaries that we've set and we respect. 

I truly do not believe my partner would EVER cheat on me I want to make that very clear. I trust him, genuinely I do. It's just the trauma that still lives in me doesn't. I also though am very afraid of coming off as crazy, jealous, or doing something that makes him feel insecure about who he is if I bring it up. Him coming out to me was not an easy task for him, and I don't want him to regret his honesty with me.

She doesn‚Äôt remember the name of the bar and suddenly acts like she has an insight and wants to go to another bar. We enter the bar and it‚Äôs in the red light district with many gogo-girls and sketchy dudes. She asks me if I want another drink and before I answer, I start to feel very light everywhere. My muscles are suddenly relaxing and I feel a lot of dizziness. As I get anxious, I run out of the bar to my friend in the club. I message the Tinder-date that I feel very bad and she doesn‚Äôt answer but instead deletes me off tinder.

"Roughly three weeks ago, I mentioned being at the end of my rope with my job as a school bus attendant. My main worry going forward from there was about a student who received a 3-month suspension for her behavior. Her suspension ended a couple of days ago, where it became clear very quickly that she hadn't changed at all (unsurprising).   


The problem student in question arrived on the bus that afternoon, where she immediately threw a tantrum, punched other students, and kicked the bus driver when he tried to scold her. When the administration came onto our bus, she put up a struggle, which required 4+ admins combined to remove her from the bus. In the chaos, the bus driver pulled her from her seat to keep her away from the students she attacked, who were sitting behind her. From what I saw, it looked like he was trying to help out.  


Today, I had a substitute driver, and the problem student did not show up at all. Neither did her siblings. I took a nap after work and woke up to my family suddenly asking me all these questions about what happened. To analyze the student's behavior, administration requested the tape from the bus camera, and reported the bus driver to law enforcement apparently because of how he handled the situation.   


I watched the chaos unfold from the front of the bus, and I personally don't know what he did wrong. To me it looked like he was only trying to help keep her away from the other students mentioned. I'm worried now because my family told me it's likely I'll be defending my co-worker in court. I only know what I saw, and what I saw just looked like him trying to help.

"My boyfriend has some mental health issues that are absolutely debilitating. He views himself as weak, embarrassing and a burden to be around. Obviously I think the opposite. 

Earlier this month he tried to commit suicide but failed. You can imagine tough this month has been for everybody, especially him. I do my best to be there for him, and the guilt knowing I should have done more eats at me everyday, but he‚Äôs alive. And that‚Äôs what matters, right? But we never talk about what happened. It‚Äôs too painful. We ignore it.

Ever since this happen he has pulled away from me, stopped talking to me and to be honest I thought we were going to break up eventually. He was always around me in my company, but never ‚Äòpresent‚Äô - if that even makes sense. After one incredibly tough month, I broke down at work. I realised I hadn‚Äôt really let myself cry yet. My boss sent me home.

Later that night, I worked up the courage to finally talk. I told him it was necessary as we couldn‚Äôt live like this. He was hesitant, but could see my desperation so he agreed. I told him my thoughts - he was in an extremely vulnerable situation, and he thought he was weak when it failed. so he pulled himself away. He distanced himself as a means to make himself feel safe, and to hide the feeling of shame and embarrassment. He was quiet, but essentially said I was right. I told him I just wanted him to be ok, and it didn‚Äôt matter how long it took, how we got there or what we did I‚Äôd do it with him. And that‚Äôs when I realised that, yes, this month has been absolute hell. But god, I would put myself through it every month if it meant he continued to live. Because he deserves to live.

"I have one specific memory of my sister and I in bed when I was around five. She was telling me that we are acting like we're filming a video and to suck on her nipples. She said that since I have buck teeth, it'll feel better for her. She was ten. 

I'm 30 now and I was hypersexual in my teens and early 20s, meeting men on Craigslist while completely disregarding my safety, becoming a sugar baby, selling my underwear, etc. I thought I was like this because I had a messed up family life (beyond my sister, physically and mentally abusive dad, poor) but now, I wonder if this is because I was molested. 

However, here's the thing. My sister has no recollection of any of this and we are best friends. If I told her this, I know for a fact that it would mess her up for the rest of her life. Our relationship hasn't been tainted in any capacity and she is my main support system, we had kids close in age, and I have no ill will towards her in any way. She was a child too. She has never displayed any sort of predatory behavior towards me or anyone for that matter. 

But I just can't shake the feeling that I have a different type of relationship with sex because of what happened to me. Do I tell her? But what will that accomplish?

We used to go to ""normal"" clubs where she wore regular clothes and danced all night. She always said she couldn't let the Punks know cos they were her tribe and she had  no other.

"I know this is pretty insignificant, especially compared to other posts. I guess I'm just sensitive and I get attached easily.  
A couple years ago, this new person‚Äìwe‚Äôll call them Sam‚Äìstarted working at my job, but in a different department, so we literally never talked, but we passed each other often enough to be aware of each other‚Äôs presence. Some months ago, Sam began a very short and casual conversation with me. Soon after, they transferred to my department, and we started to talk a bit more.  
We didn‚Äôt become besties or anything, just a random chitchat here and there. I swear at one point Sam would just laugh at everything I said, and I never really considered myself a talented comedian or anything. It was nice and made work a little easier.  
I don‚Äôt have many friends so I hoped this could turn into a real friendship. I know, most work friends don‚Äôt become anything, but one really close friend of mine met me at work from a different job way back. Plus, I just adored Sam and thought they were a good worker. My partner who also works with us had a similar jocular, somewhat talkative but not bestfriend-sort of relationship with Sam too. Said they used to laugh together as well.  
Then, one day, out of no where, Sam stopped talking with me‚Ä¶stopped saying hi and joking, and would ignore or brush away my attempts to talk to them. They even started to give me attitude and sometimes was just straight up rude. It‚Äôs like Sam became a completely different person.  
 When I talked to my partner about it, they said the same thing happened (and they wouldn‚Äôt admit it but they seemed a hurt by it too). It‚Äôs weird because Sam still talks and laughs with other coworkers, it‚Äôs just us two. Hell, once Sam really pissed me off when they complained to our boss about my partner and I, specifically that we talk to much and it‚Äôs affecting out performance or something. So our boss talked to my partner and I about it and we promised to do better, but he even admitted that he hadn‚Äôt noticed any decline in performance.  
Everyone talks to each other here all the time, including Sam and our boss. My partner and I are super outgoing people so we talk to everyone as often as we talk to each other.   
Now obviously I‚Äôm not losing sleep over this and I‚Äôm really content with my life. It‚Äôs always just a little heartbreaking when you lose someone you liked.   
My friend pointed out that this behavior seemed to have happened maybe around the time my partner and I got together, and suggested that Sam may have had feelings for me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely, though, unless Sam did a good job of hiding it, because I usually can tell if someone likes me. Plus, I know Sam is now going out with someone, though I have no idea if it was very recently or for a long time, so even if they were jealous then, they probably wouldn‚Äôt be now.   
I‚Äôm not going to talk to Sam about it because I suspect they‚Äôll just be a dick and not give a shit, thought maybe I‚Äôd prefer that over not having any closure and never knowing what my partner and I did to deserve this. Still, the relationship is strictly professional so I‚Äôm not trying to be inappropriate or anything. I decided that I‚Äôll only ever tell Sam I used to adore them and why did they suddenly act like they disliked me in the unlikely occasion that we run into each other into the wild after one or both of us quits. Sort of like a sign from the universe that i was meant to know what happened. Though I‚Äôll be over it by then and probably not give a shit. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve always been a if-this-person-never-knows-how-I-feel-soon-I-might-actually-die sort of person.  
Obviously I‚Äôm not losing sleep or anything over this; I‚Äôm pretty content with my life and I‚Äôll be fine. Occasionally whenever I see Sam, who is the only coworker now who doesn‚Äôt say hi to me (and some of these people are assholes). I just wanted to let it off my chest here since I will probably never talk to Sam about it. So Sam, though you‚Äôll probably never read this, I just wish you knew that I admired you once.

"This is the first time I posted on a subreddit like this, and I will probably never post again here to protect my and my now ex-girlfriend's privacy.

This story begins a few weeks ago, where my (m/23) then girlfriend (f/23) of seven years went on a one week long university field trip to france. When she told me that she got the opportunity to do an excursion like this I was happy and supportive. After all, both  of us are students and could therefore not afford too many nice vacations and it seemed like a good and cheap way for her to explore more  of another country (We have been to paris together before and she really liked it). 

Once she went on the trip though, things started to change. She would barely text me, let alone call me, leave me on read when I asked how things are over there and basically reduce all communication to a minimum. Once I asked her about it - after finally getting to talk to her on the 4th day - she told me it was because of the bad internet and that  she was very busy and had almost no time to herself. I decided to let it be since it wasn't my intention to spoil the mood on her trip (plus it was only a week anyway). 

After she returned home though, things just got worse instead of better. The evening she arrived, she didn't even want to see me since it was already late and she was tired. Once again, that was weird to me because it was really unlike her but I respected it. When we finally did spend some time together and had the time to talk and catch up, she dropped a bombshell. Apparently, among the people she met in france, there was a guy (m/34, let's call him Mark) that she was ""really attracted to"" and she ended up cuddling with him at his place. She also proceeded to tell me that this could be an opportunity to try  something new and that we could have him join in to spice up our bedroom life. 

At that moment it felt like I was hit by a truck - I didn't know how to respond and we more or less  decided to postpone the topic. Eventually I told her that I felt betrayed, even though it was ""just cuddling"" and that I wouldn't be comfortable with an arrangement like she suggested.

The next evening, she went to a game night at one of her new friends' from uni that she met in france. I wasn't too thrilled about this given what she told me before but she insisted that she was only going to stay for one or two hours and that it was important to her (By this point she said that she considered these people their best friends, which was crazy to me since she has friends that she has known for 15 years or more). Long story short, instead of staying there until 10 pm, she stayed until 4 am. Also, the guy she is ""attracted to"" also attended the game night, which I only found out later.

I was upset by this, but for the next couple of days I tried to act as normal as possible. We went out twice and we even had a good time as long as we avoided the topic. For some time, I was able to see her as my bright, lovable girl again. 

So I made up my mind and told her we needed to talk. I wanted to discuss whether we could change things and fix our relationship. I was prepared for what she was going to say (or so I thought) and I was determined to improve some things on my part as well. What I did not see coming was that apparently after she went to a home party with her new college friends the day before, she decided to spend the whole night with Mark. She told me this nonchalantly, as if it was the most normal thing - and after she saw me disturbed, she asked me why I would complain about something like that since she didn't say she had sex with him. That was the moment I decided to break up  with her and I told her there and then. After that, the conversation was fairly short and I got all my things and left.

The thing is though, now I feel miserable. I tried to keep contact with her - still hoping for some possibility to return to our relationship as it was, but she acts extremely cold towards me and she doesn't even want to  speak with me at all. I know I am the one who ended things but that still hurts me even more. I see her posts on social media, going out with her new best friends and Mark, and it completely destroys me. The fact that she is seemingly doing so well, that she is so happy right after the break up when I am crying myself to sleep at night. I know I shouldn't wish for her to be depressed but I just can't wrap my head around her not missing me one bit. 7 years, almost a third of our life... We traveled the world together, lived, laughed and struggled together and there is just... nothing. No emotion, no remorse, no love.

So there it is, now I sit here alone, staring at our pictures, bawling my eyes out like a little boy and drinking while writing all of this down while the love of my life moved on from me like I never even existed.

Since she wasn‚Äôt listening to me i threw up the pills and her disgusting food obviously. i threw up six times today and fainted twice does she know that? No. Does she care? No!

i always look at other girls and think how im not as attractive as them. they're so pretty. their face is perfect, they have the perfect body, perfect personality, perfect everything, and im just nothing. i feel like nothing. i'm so ugly i can't look at myself without wanting to cry. i hate the way i look so much i just wish i was a different person.

i'm a shit girlfriend. and i've been told this in the past. i always get upset over the littlest things, i can never communicate properly, i overreact, i overthink, and everytime i apologize for being that way, i do it again. and i can't stand it. because i don't want to do it. i don't want to hurt him. but i always do because i just fucking suck at everything. i just wish he has someone better to be with. someone who was nice. someone who didn't overreact and just stop talking. i wish he had someone normal.

i want to be normal. i don't want to be fucked up. i want to be happy. i want to be pretty. i don't want to hate myself every day of my life, but yet, i do. everytime i think it's getting better, it goes back to the way it has always been. i HATE myself. and i don't think ill ever stop hating myself.",i hate myself,18o559p,1703214932.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18o559p/i_hate_myself/,
"Single with divorced, emotionally unavailable parents. Siblings have their own families. I have autism, so it's harder for me to make friends. The friends I do have are busy with their friends. 

Sure, my parents have Christmas on the 22nd and 23rd, but it's just not the same as Christmas day. Half the time, I don't even bother going to family functions anymore and no one really seems to notice. The whole experience is really just incredibly lonely. When I try to talk to men I think I'd be interested in, a lot of times it's just about sex without any real meaning to it. I just feel like I want someone to get to know me, ask questions about me. 

it would be nice to receive a Christmas card that's not from my parents, lol, or even a Christmas gift. It's just hard for me because I get every in my family gifts. It's part of the reason why I don't like to go to the Christmas gatherings. To watch everyone else open their gifts and then to have nothing given back.

"This is absolutely killing me. I can't remember the last time I saw a photo of a woman under 30 just standing up straight, with both legs on the ground, without her head cooked to the side. 

Today I saw a photo of a 3yo girl who had posed herself for a photo with one leg bent and her head on the side and it's pushed me over the edge. The fact a 3yo already knows this is a thing is absolutely heartbreaking. Don't we want our girls to feel they can confidently take up space and don't have to work their angles and look cute and whimsical all the time? 

We've come so far with feminism in many respects, but it's infuriating the women feel they can't take a photo without bending a knee in case their legs look fat, ffs.

Thank you for everything you did. Picking up my stuff was something I had put off for months on end. After  5 months of not seeing each other after our breakup I thought I would scream or beg you to come back with me. At first I didn‚Äôt know how I would live without the most important person in my life . But I somehow have I moved on and I keep on going every single time. I did cry and I won‚Äôt lie about that but it made me make peace with myself. I knew I had moved on to some degree but it didn‚Äôt hurt like I thought it would to see you again. We had so many memories and we had so many great plans and ideas we wanted to do. We were bushy eyed teenagers with the world full ahead of us but now we are grown adults facing the real world apart. We went through so much in the span of our three year relationship. We supported each other as best as we could and we did things the way we thought we should. While we may no longer be friends or acquaintances  I want to say thank you for everything. Whether you come across this I want you to know I am forever thankful for you and what we had. We still have the whole world ahead of us and we don‚Äôt know what it will bring.I just wish you the best from the bottom of my heart. I hope you are able to find happiness and peace within yourself. I hope you are able to accomplish every single thing you set your dreams to. I‚Äôll always be your number one supporter. And I hope you always know that you can count on me. It is a hard road and a long process to get there and be okay. But whether it‚Äôs in a couple of months or years I want you to always know that my friendship will always be opened to you if you decide to reach out. We gave each other the world as best as we could. You sacrificed a lot and so did I and I will forever be eternally grateful  for that. I think this isn‚Äôt a goodbye but a see you later. This is the beginning of a new chapter for both of us. We can now be the people we said we would and we will be a lovely memory in our lives. The world is full of surprises and we don‚Äôt know what it holds in stores for us. But I will always cherish what we had all the little arguments and the thoughts of forever. All the moments we shared together and all the sadness and happiness etched in our memories. They are but sweet memories never will any bad intent be held for them because they help  who we are.You will always hold a special and dear part in my head and heart. As you were my first love and my first real relationship. Thank you for everything I believe in you and I am eternally proud of you.

"My Mom passed away on July 13th, 2023 at the age of 47.  I can remember everything vividly. I was laughing and carrying on as normal with my Husband, at home, when I got a few messages to call my Step Dad. I had the thought lingering in my head, asking myself why I couldn't just call my Mom as she was the one I mostly communicated with. I, then, thought that, maybe, my Mom was in the hospital. I called my Step Dad and I could immediately tell by his tone that it wasn't good. He told me, ""It's about your Mom. She's gone!""- those words just keep circling in my head. My first question was whether she had done something to herself because she had been suicidal and hospitalized before. There was no note, or anything- she was just gone. 

Going forward to today, I never knew, for certain, why she passed away. She didn't have an autopsy and she was cremated. In my heart, I knew, but I tried to tell myself that it was due to, one of her many, autoimmune diseases. I got the death certificate today and she did, in fact, commit suicide by overdosing on her prescription medicine. 

I suffer from Mental Health issues myself- Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar II, so I am on Caplyta. I think that it has helped me in my grieving process, tremendously. I just feel numb. I have four boys, so I have to continue on with life, without falling into a pit of despair. I'm mostly left with so many questions that I will never have the closure for.

I recognize the fine line between self pity which most everyone from living in it and letting it consume you. I know I shouldn't feel this way but my problems are meaningless and merely just whiplash to my mistakes. I spend my whole day thinking about how terrible I am when I have loving parents, a safe community, and food on my table.  I am so blessed to have these opportunities but I don't deserve them. I lied cheated and stole my why through my early teenage years and got away with it (despite being sent away a few times). I recently turned 18 and got my license and let partying take over my life because I couldn't find joy in my old interests. I ended up catching two DUIs within the span of exactly two months. Since then I am nothing but a sad sack of shit. I am a very self aware person and I know I have the money and resources to get through this as many other people don't. I spent two days in jail after totaling my moms car and spent those dreadful hours pondering where I went wrong. I have come to the conclusion that all my problems are based of selfishness and impulsiveness with of course a touch of substance abuse to distract me. I lost all of my friends because this crash was posted on my neighborhood Facebook page along with my mugshot.

I cheated on the most loving caring girl multiple times even though she loved me despite all of my problems as many other people don't. We didn't have much in common at all but I truly love her. Maybe it's the fact that she was the only person I would hang out with sober and I could truly talk to her. Now that she is gone I miss her most and it's gut wrenching and brutal because I made all the mistakes never her.

"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I (34M) am frustrated at my ex-wife‚Äôs (34F) decision to re-name our son (9M). To provide some context, we are both Chinese Americans, living in a small town on the West Coast. We met during our sophomore year at college, and we married a few years after graduation. After being together for 5 years, we had our son. For privacy, I can‚Äôt say the actual name, but it is something like Alex Huang ‚Äì American first name (starts with an A), Chinese last name. Both me and my ex-wife have names like this.

I do not want to go into detail, but we separated in 2016. He was 2 years old then. We mutually agreed that she would take full custody. Nevertheless, I still love him like crazy, and have been fortunate enough to have time to hang out with him since our separation.

Something I particularly admired about my ex-wife was her appreciation of history. This was in no small part linked to her father, who was an academic specialising in 19th century European history. While we were still married, I got along pretty well with him. Last year, he unexpectedly passed away. My wife was understandably shaken, especially given their extremely close bond.

Before his passing, my ex-wife and our son would watch a historical drama with him, based around his research area of interest. I think it was great for bonding, especially between my son and his grandfather. Once or twice, I got to join them.  The show was called something like ‚Äòlast emperor‚Äô and it was about an Ottoman Sultan. It was an okay show, maybe a bit too complex for a child.

Anyways, last week, one of my closest friends from high school ran into my ex-wife in town. Obviously, all of my friends are familiar with her and my son. However, something weird happened. My friend told me that my ex-wife made a big point to ‚Äúreintroduce‚Äù our son as Abdul. My friend initially thought she was kidding, but apparently she seemed serious. He thought it was hilarious and called me straight away, asking what was up.

Initially, I thought he was screwing with me, but he insisted this really happened. I ignored at the time, but ended up calling my ex-wife to catch up and to ask how Alex was doing (again, not his actual name for privacy reasons), since it had been a few weeks since we last spoke. She explained to me that our son was now officially ‚ÄòAbdul‚Äô, in honor of her late father. This confused me, as he had a very Chinese name, not an Arabic one. She explained the name was in relation to the historical drama that they spent so much time watching, and the last cherished memories that they shared with her father. She told me that the name comes from Sultan Abdulhamid, the protagonist of the show. Apparently, our son was very excited to adopt this new name.

I could tell she was not joking. I know when she is serious. I was so shocked that all I could do was wish her well, and end the call. After reaching out to some of our other mutual friends, I found out that she hasn‚Äôt just changed the name she refers to him as, but has officially changed his legal name from Alex Huang to ‚ÄòAbdul‚Äô Huang (again, not real names).

Legally speaking, she does have the right to do this, as she has sole legal custody over him. Ethically however, I think that this is messed up. For one, I think I would have liked to be consulted over such a major decision. For two, despite our son‚Äôs enthusiasm, he‚Äôs only nine. I don‚Äôt think either of them understand that this decision will have drastic consequences for Alex‚Äôs future. I know how kids are ‚Äì an Arabic first name next to a Chinese surname will be bullied relentlessly. Plus, despite her father‚Äôs commitment to the relevant history, it kind of seems like cultural appropriation for a Chinese woman to rename her son in this way. I don‚Äôt know. I really just hope that our son doesn‚Äôt grow to hate his mother, just because of a rash decision like this.

I really empathize with her grief. Her father was a kind man, and they shared a very close bond. Losing him must have been devastating for her. Nevertheless, I can‚Äôt help but feel that renaming our son without consulting me is going too far, especially if that name is over some Sultan in a completely different part of the world.

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I cannot accept that I just have to call my son ‚ÄòAbdul‚Äô from now on, but I am powerless to change it. How should I proceed? It‚Äôs a very delicate matter, and I‚Äôm lost for options right now.

**EDIT:** For those eager, I did not want to get into the details of me and my ex-wife's separation, but it seems like that's the point of focus so far. My ex-wife and I met at university doing computer science, and we've been involved in software engineering and cybersecurity since. Although we separated because we lost passion for one another, we still respect and care for each other, and both love our son immensely. When we divorced properly, we came under pressure from her extended family, who are extremely traditional, for her to have full custody of Alex, even though we mutually agreed that joint custody would be best, legally speaking. I contribute to Alex financially, am able to have relatively consistent time with him, and still am on good terms with the whole family.

"I hate this stupid holiday where I‚Äôm made to feel guilty about getting gifts and not being able to return the favor since I have no money or job. It‚Äôs been like this since I was little mom and dad fighting and the classic thinking it‚Äôll be better to stick together. When has that ever worked out.

I hate watching my father threaten everything around me and my sister if we show an ounce of insubordination I hate how he threatens the dogs, cats, himself, us etc.

I hate my mother for being this pathetic being who helped turn my father into this and walk away like she was some domestic victim
Hate how she refused to feed us as kids without my fathers knowledge, socially and mentally isolate me and my sisters and turn us against each other
Hate how she‚Äôs so motherly when she views me as a doll but when I push her away she makes my life hell
When I had walking pneumonia she took me to the doctor but the moment I wouldn‚Äôt let her coddle me (since I‚Äôve been touch starved my whole life I feel uncomfortable with touch)
She then got mad and at the doctors she took it personally I barely remember much because I was so out of it but she was doing something and I kept swaying and she shoved me a bit a yelled at her crying to leave me alone
She didn‚Äôt care
I was curing and crying I was so embarrassed I finally got to sit down on the bed and she was sitting on the chair
She was fucking smirking
She was smirking and watching TikTok 

I just broke down she left the room I think the doctors were trying to separate us

The doctor who treated me just looked so uncaring and annoyed while I was breaking down
I felt even more humiliated 

She treated the dog better than she treated all of us 
I hated that dog
I used to hurt her
Turns out my sister did to
We were so jealous 
She‚Äôs a pitbull 
At our moms house
She still doesn‚Äôt treat her nice but she‚Äôs not abusive to the dog thankfully

I felt so guilty so I give the dog extra love now


I hate how nice and loving my father is because I know he easily he can turn
Hate how I‚Äôm so desperate to view him as a saint because he was the first person to ever tell me he loves me and actually prove it
And yet he only did so when I was a younger teenager

Hate how all my schools from elementary to middle school students and teachers alike looked at me with disgust since I was awkward and ugly with no social experience and in IEP
I‚Äôve only had one childhood friend who‚Äôve I since moved away from

No one showed me an inch of kindness until I turned pretty, grew long blonde (dyed) hair, grew into my body, and had a pretty smile


I remember how annoyed all those kids looked when I was in the front of the class for a game at my turn 
We stuffed our mouth with marshmallows and had to say a tounge twister fast
I got one I was really good at and I was dominating the score

I was having fun, but then I noticed the class looked annoyed and none even looked at me
Even the teacher was slightly titling her head away from me
It was like they were embarrassed of me
I felt humiliated 

I purposely messed up so I could go sit down 
I wanted to cry  


I finally have my sister, my mother used to put each other against the others so I hated her for a while 
Even refused to eat the food her and my other sister liked because I hated them so much
I‚Äôve never had KFC because of that, but turns out that stuff is abusive so we don‚Äôt go there anymore



Wrote this now because my dad forgot to take his medication and he was a bit volatile 
It‚Äôs Christmas in a few days and all I feel is sickness 
He keeps making passive aggressive comments 
When we‚Äôre putting the tree up because he doesn‚Äôt care about it and he‚Äôll just give us the presents since this holiday isn‚Äôt even for him 


He‚Äôs always spent about $3k on Christmas for me and my sisters and each time I feel just as guiltily knowing I‚Äôll have to just smile and be happy




My dad thinks that the reason I‚Äôm so much calmer and quiet is because I‚Äôve matured but it‚Äôs now

Whenever I was ever happy or giddy I was caused problems 
Dad would yell at me I would accidentally break something or something like that so I made myself stay in check cause I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll mess something up


He used to yell at me terribly when I was younger so now I can‚Äôt even do mundane tasks without worrying I‚Äôm doing it wrong and gonna get screamed at

Just the other week I poured boiling water into a glass to make him some tea (I try to overwork myself and be overly useful because he‚Äôs been the only one to care about me and I want to help, my older sisters don‚Äôt talk to him anymore cause he‚Äôs crazy but they also made pretty crappy life decisions and I‚Äôm scared dad thinks I‚Äôm gonna turn out like them so I try to show I won‚Äôt) and it exploded i was crying and distraught apologizing while cleaning it up 

But he wasn‚Äôt even remotely mad with I wasn‚Äôt used to 
He said it was cheap glass that it didn‚Äôt matter but I was so used to the normal him screaming in my face as a child that I couldn‚Äôt help over work my self up




Basically the gist of this is that my life consisted of semi severe child neglect and my father was the only one that ever showed me compassion beside two teachers (im dead serious) but he isn‚Äôt a good man and he even tells us this

I‚Äôm so desperate for any form of love. His love is tough and kinda toxic , he even admits it , but it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got and all I‚Äôve ever gotten




Holidays like this stress him out and make it worse

I hope to never celebrate some holidays ever again but I know he‚Äôll get mad

"This is a long one, sorry if i make you read too much.

**Some background (You can skip this if you want):** 

i'm latin-american, i come from a fairly wealthy family (middle class): one sis, younger brother (me), one father, one mother. i must say, i'm a spoiled brat in a way. i've always been well taken care of by my parents and they always made sure to keep me healthy and productive, but, i've never felt good taking advantage of that, i've just never thought of myself as ""important enough"" to actually deserve most of the things i've gotten so far. i have good friends, although im not an extrovert person (i'll talk about it later on). but the reason im writing this is to make sure that im not just limiting myself from seeing things the way they are. 

As i grew up i realized that i'm really bad at following social dynamics: Never really felt the urgue to find a girlfriend or a group of friends, never cared much about the way i wear, never had that feeling of ""fitting in"", i just tell to myself ""man, you're too stupid to understand people, leave it"". i've always had the idea that there's genuinely something weird in my head, but here's the thing: where i live mental illnesses aren't just something people care much about; You're either""Normal"" or ""Deranged"", at least the way almost everyone sees it, so i never really tried to find a reason. another thing that you should know is that the place where i live has this.. uh, ""Success culture""? i'll explain: our country divides in two types of people: wealthy, working, well educated but most of the times missinformated and (mostly) self-centerd folks, and the not so lucky, not so wealthy, not so well-educated but hard-working  folks. Of course this is just a generalization of the population; not everyone follows this pattern and yes, both sides hate each other. those who make mad money (sometimes dirty money), or come from a wealthy family, or have a good set of ""bussiness pals"" are kinda like novelty here, and those who don't are spit on. to put it simple: ""Image over everything else; if you ain't like the rest or have enough money to validate yourself as a person, you ain't making it far, friend"". but that way of living is related to many cultural, social and political things that'd make this post way longer.

 sorry, that was most of the background. 

**The issue:** i do not know if this life is mine anymore, or if i should even try. My parents have always been really strict and focused on the way i present myself to the world rather than the way i see it, but i don't blame them, they hardly have time trying to put food on the table, but this is quite normal where i live i must say. the thing is that i'm already at university, i'm already skipping a lot of things that for my age i must and should be doing, and whenever i try to start something for myself the name of everyone and everything around me seems to make more noise. my parents ain't no saints, my father is a successfull person, that comes from a lineague of successfull people, and my mother is very well known around too. now, in the personal and parental part.. i'd say they're not the definition of ""kind-hearted people"" , but i dont wanna talk much about them here. the thing is that they always work hard on selling this ""Flawless"" image of a family to everyone. and of course, it comes with the ""model son"" image that everyone has about me. 

i've never done well in university, but after last trimester i came to a conclussion: **i don't have any personal motivations for it**. i get the subjects just fine although i ain't no genius, i don't really like taking a shit on teachers for being teachers and instead figure things out by myself and so on. i try to be a good student but never really care much about not passing with at least a D at the end. and now i don't even know why i can't fight for my own sake. this time i literally did really good on one of my classes, but didn't feel like my final project proposal  was worth it and never showed up to last class so now i'll end up repeating it , but i totally feel that i deserve it. 

in general, i feel that i should do more, that i should be breaking my back and i should be taking risks and achieving things, not to ""make papa and mama proud"" tbh, but because that's the way life works, right? (rigth?). now, here's the part i really don't want to talk about:

my parents have always been in conflict with everything, due to their own personalities. they have trust issues, they think of themselves as above-average members of society and dont interact much with those that they consider ""not convenient"" or ""problematic"" (in their own judgement, that is), and they always think that their way is the only right way; that's how they've raised me and my sister for most of our lives. i know that they just don't want us to waste our lives, but that's not only it: they don't consider anything else as worthy. i don't want to think that way in life, i don't want to just become a prick with a pretty bank account and a family that i don't love, nor i think the way to success in life its just living a life that some others will see for afar and envy of, that's just not what i think life is all about. sorry.

i just feel that no matter what i do, which path i take or what i choose to believe in, i'll always be in the wrong just for not fullfilling that image that everyone (mostly my parents) have made of me throughout the years, and, since i barely do good at every aspect in my own life, i don't have the right to change it, or do something about it.

one last thing i wanted to say is that i ain't no saint either: im really lazy, i smoke, drink, done many shit and been a problematic child and that's something im aware of. but, i've never done any of that to get my parents angry, i hardly ever have permission to go out or genuinely be myself and do things that i like (ironically, i smoke and drink most of the time in my own room) , just because of the constant fear of ""people gossiping about what i do"", or ""what someone saw me doing one day"". they raised me blaming me for giving a damn about my friend's or others judgements , but worry more about what others say about me rather than what i want to say, and that's another thing about them, they blame others for the things they don't care about doing, just because they consider that it's always someone else's fault, and that principle also applies to their own children, i guess.

...

i guess that's most of it, thanks for taking time to hear me out. sorry for filling a book about my problem to whoever is reading this, i just haven't been eating or sleeping well and i hope that maybe this will ease my mind.

have a good day.

"      Yesterday I (26m) was taking a road trip with some friends down to Atlanta for the weekend, Matt, Jake, Jules, Samantha (fake names). Matt, the owner of car, and Samantha sat in the front while me, Jules, Jake sat in the back. I had downed a Gatorade yesterday morning and we had been making stops up until lunch, where we had burgers and beers at some place in Charlotte. 
      Everyone went to the bathroom before we got back on the road and threw away our trash and got back on the highway.  I started feeling like my bladder was filling up around an hour out from the AirB&amp;B, but Matt convinced me to wait until we got there.  And at the time it made sense, I could‚Äôve waited an hour. 
       Then literally standstill traffic. LITERALLY standstill and I was needing a toilet more and more urgently. I was snapping at people, getting anxiety, breathing heavy, sweating. We sat in traffic for two hours before I caved and said I can‚Äôt hold it and we need to find a bottle. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the car because we were just creeping along, but literally could not hold it. There was not a single bottle in the car, which made me so, so mad at the moment. I take wellbutrin so I usually keep a bottle of water with me for dry mouth, I just didn‚Äôt have one at the moment for once. Jake got in the back and rummaged around in the trunk until he found an old Publix plastic bag and I cut my losses and decided this was going to be the best I could do. 
     Mind you, I have a massive crush on Jules. She‚Äôs sitting next to me, I‚Äôm beet red from having to use a GROCERY bag to hold my urine. Everyone assured me not to be embarrassed, but I was near tears. Everyone looked away and I unzipped and put myself into the bag and let it rip. It. Had. A. HOLE. THE BAG HAD A HOLE. Pee started dripping and then trickling and at this point Samantha turned around and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs leaking! Stop!!‚Äù And then everyone turned and looked at me with my fucking dick in a bag peeing. Matt started yelling at me to get out of the car, but I just couldn‚Äôt stop or move. It was the wrong move, but I just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù And dropped the bag and just went full force on the floor of Matt‚Äôs car. Samantha and Matt is yelling at me to stop, Jules is looking the other way with her hand over her mouth, and I‚Äôm just sitting there like an idiot letting it rip for what felt like an eternity. I could not stop I had to get it out. 
      I‚Äôm so angry at myself for not getting out of the car. I don‚Äôt understand why I just sat there peeing. Matt is pissed his car reeks of pee and wants me to buy him new carpet.

"As a guy, I feel like most other men are kind of proud of their sex drive, like it's a sign of their masculinity. They might be mad that they're not getting as much sex as they want, but they're not mad at how horny they get. I'm crazy because I actually hate how horny I get.

Ever since puberty, my sex drive has been sky high. I need to masturbate multiple times a day or I can't function. I mean I can't think or focus on anything. Even sex doesn't slow it. Here's an example of how bad it can be: With my first girlfriend, we used to have sex every day, then immediately after she went back to her place, I would jerk off about the sex we just had, and then that night we'd have phone sex. Every day. And I know honestly that was a lot for her and she was doing it just to try to keep me happy.

The best times in my life are the 15-20 minutes after I orgasm, because that's the only time where my mind is clear and I don't want sex and I feel like me. That's the time where I'm writing this, right now. Soon I won't be like this. My sexuality doesn't feel like part of me, it feels like this thing that is so separate from who I am. I've been drunk, I've been high, being horny is way more mind altering than any other experience I've ever had.  I've tried therapy. I've tried medication. 

I hate that I can't just talk to a girl without thinking about it. I always respect my female friends and I am very respectful of boundaries. I actually try hard to never push girls for anything sexual, which ironically actually sometimes gets girls to want to be more sexual with you, at least in my experience. But I hate that I can't be around a girl without thoughts of sex exploding in my head. I hate that I have had to become an expert in hiding my arousal. I'm the master of hiding a hard dick.

And I hate that I'm whining about this. I know in the grand scheme of the world ""I'm too horny"" is not a big problem. Which is why I'm writing a post here and not telling anyone in my life about it. But I can't tell you the number of hours in my life I've lost to sex, all the things I could've done. All the times I wasn't present for big moments in my life because all I could think about is fucking.

"So I (21F) have a cousin (18F). We grew up basically attached to the hip. We went to school together, went everywhere together, but as children I noticed something. When her friends would come out, she would lie to her friends and tell them that she doesn't know me. That we aren't related, we're just friends, etc. I never understood why she did this, but I thought about it and I was bullied relentlessly around that time. I was ugly, I had eczema, buck teeth, I got bullied mainly for my physical appearance. Some years later, we didn't see each other so often because she had to live with her mother an hour away in a rural city, but my grandma would try take me to see her once a month. Every time I saw her, we were still as close as ever. A year after that, she came back for good to live with my grandma. She had become close friends with her moms step kid who was the same age as me. She referred to this girl as her sister. This girl bullied me so bad. My hair, my skin, my clothes. My cousin never defended me, and again she was trying to convince another person that we weren't related. This girl. Her ""sister"" eventually went to live with her family and that was the end of that. Now fast forward to most recent years. Her 16th birthday she had a big party/sleepover that I was invited to, but AGAIN she told these new friends that she met me somewhere and we weren't related. Years later, I still hadn't earned the title of being her family because I literally am. All these friends are her ""family"" and I can't even be claimed. My self-esteem took a hit because of that. This year, I'm no longer being bullied (thank god that ended a couple years ago). I reach out to her to hang out. We go to the movies, I pay. Out to eat, I pay. I drive, pick her up and drop her off. When SHE had money, she never asked me to go anywhere. Not even to just take a walk or something. But she'll take her ""family"" out. Strangers. She got a car. I still had to drive if we were hanging out. So I stopped. I completely stopped reaching out to her and soon blocked her on everything. I vented to my grandma because I don't understand why she tried so hard all of these years to convince people that she didn't know me and why she won't talk to me now, and my grandma got angry with me and basically implied that I'm a creep for wanting to talk to her. ""She's younger than you, what do you two have to talk about?"" If that were the case, then she should've kept us away from each other as kids. Never let us talk or play with each other because she was younger than me then too. I love my cousin and I miss her when my grandma talks to me about her, which ends up making me feel really sad. So I'm setting a boundary with my grandma and telling her not to mention my cousin to me. I don't want to hear anything about her.

"hiii
so here's the deal. i got a lot of childhood trauma and i'm autistic, yaddah yaddah yaddah. i use age regression to cope with it. age regression is a coping mechanism that involves mentally regressing to a younger age, typically participating in the interests and activities that'd be for a young child, including using items like bottles, pacifiers, etc. 
age regression is COMPLETELY NONSEXUAL, but unfortunately people get it mixed up with age play, that IS a kink. i, in no way, have ever been interested in or associated with age play, and never will be. 

now, after that brief lesson, let's go back to the situation in my title. i have had the same friend group for around 6 years now. two of them (a couple) i am closer to more than the other two in the friend group; i even dated the couple for a few months (things ended fine, i just felt polyamory wasn't for me, but we're all still very close). i want to be able to share with my friends (the couple only, since i'm closest to them) how i cope. yes, that's a VERY emotionally intimate thing to share and it's also a practice that's typically seen as taboo. my reasoning for wanting to share it with them is because i don't like having to hide stuff about me. they're lovely and amazing people that i doubt would ever end our friendship over this, but that doesn't ease the anxiety. it feels like i have some dirty secret that i'm hiding. i feel almost alone when it comes to this, because i feel so alienated from how the media has warped the image of age regression. i want to be able to casually mention something about regression or littlespace or whatever, and no one be weird about it. i wouldn't make it a talking point obviously, but i don't want it to be something i have to hide. i feel like it's normal to want to be able to share deeply emotionality vulnerable things with the people you trust most, right? i dunno ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø i don't know how i'd go about bringing it up or explaining it, if i ever were to. i've been using age regression as a coping mechanism for years, and in this whole time, i've never told anyone about my regression.

"So for some context I am 22 turning 23. I know this girl from a long time (she's 24) and we been chatting a lot lately. She knows im a virgin and she said she'll have sex with me for $1,000 to which I said yah sure. I paid her upfront in advance so she knows I was being serious. I given her money (as a gift) before so its not a big coincidence. I thought it was just that ""one time"" payment thing?

Though she did mention she was looking for a regular partner so we would be having sex regularly after, if she liked the sex, but not for money but she welcomed me to pay her if I wished. Again, no problems for me. I don't mind helping her out since she is struggling a lot and her mom has cancer and she has younger brother too.

Fast forward to tonight we're at the hotel room and we're getting down to business. Midway through me licking her up, she suggests me sending her another $1,000 right there and then as that will make her instantly cum. I kinda fob it with yah haha.Oh she was serious about that one. She's very good at manipulation. She was there stroking my dick saying all the things I needed to hear. 

She's saying I got good job with good money and how she doesn't have enough money etc etc. Basically a complete mood killer for the actual sex but I was so in the moment I didn't see any sense. Well, I did but she sucked all the common sense out of me. I told her I have bills to pay. Below are some of the things she said to me:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Yah you'll have money to pay your bills""  
""You'll just have to be smart about groceries this month""  
""You can cook at home, you don't need to eat out""  
""It's not that much money, you will make it again next month""

Etc etc.

I mean, my dick was completely hard whilst trying to reason with her, with common sense, but at the time she just sucked it all out of me completely. After a lot of back and fourth, I went completely numb with her.

She kinda in a very manipulative way forced me to open my baking app on my phone and send her $1,200 to which I stupidly did. Now the only money I have left is to pay bills. I don't even have gas money anymore, little grocery money and now on constant fear.

Anyway after that, I tried fucking her but I just couldn't get hard anymore. She did try help me get hard but no matter what, I just wouldn't get hard enough. We left it at that and both left.

I drove her home. We made a quick stop to the drive thru on the way back to hers (which she paid lol) and to be honest, if she had gotten out my car when we stopped, I would have just left her there without a single care in the world lol. It would've been 4 hours walk home for her since its basically all highways with no buses XD.

Now I'm sitting here with high emotions. She said she's up for doing this again if I'm still down but after what happened I have no idea!

There were a lot of struggles, feeling like I'm not doing good enough, feeling unmotivated. But I was able to end my term feeling great about my experience and I received an award that is given to a person who embodies all values of our organization, and goes above and beyond.

I always get anxious, and my mental health hasn't always been good enough and I never had the mindset to stay in a job. But I did it this time!
- I've gone to the gym more consistently and I've felt more confident and motivated. I also started eating ""better"" in a way that I no longer starve myself or eat too much. I learned to listen to my body and let it have what it wants in moderation. I used to be struggling with an I'm very proud that I've gone through this semester without any kind of eating episode.

Putting a person in front of your children is just the biggest crock of nonsense I‚Äôve ever seen.","My mom always put men in front of her kids, and it made me never want kids or a relationship",18o185j,1703203188.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18o185j/my_mom_always_put_men_in_front_of_her_kids_and_it/,
"This was years ago, but after doing some self reflecting, I really really hate how I was towards my bf and words can‚Äôt even explain how remorseful and ashamed I feel. 

We‚Äôd been dating for 4 years at this point. We didn‚Äôt have a healthy relationship, but we had a lot of love for each other. At this point though, I started to feel angry at him. I felt so much anger and resentment. I was snappy and mean to him at times. He didn‚Äôt deserve that. All i can remember from that time
period was feeling fed up. I just don‚Äôt know of what, I can‚Äôt remember. I am scared that the cold truth is just I was a total jerk and didn‚Äôt appreciate him.

"After a long battle with addiction, my dad died on my sixteenth birthday.  I wasn't sad though, at first I was angry,  angry at him, at the world, and at myself.  Then maybe for a day or two I was a little sad.  I began to realize that he wouldn't be there for all of the things your dad is supposed to be there for.   My father wouldn't be at my high school graduation, or there to intimidate my senior prom date, he wouldn't walk me down the aisle and there would be no daddy-daughter dance at my wedding.  

But while I was realizing all of that, I realized that he wouldn't be there.  Not for fights and bloody noses or mental manipulation.  I no longer had to wonder which version of my father I would get each day, I  could stop worrying about what he would put my 3 year old brother through if I wasn't there to stop him.   

I felt an overwhelming sense of relief, and it makes me feel like an awful person.   I am not saying I am glad that he died, I'm just saying I wasn't sad when he did.  I don't know what this means, maybe I'm just psychotic but I really had to get this out, it has been 2 years and I've cried maybe once in the very first week.

"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôm (25) and I live with my older sister (26) with my parents. I‚Äôm graduating college next year and hope to move out in 2025 at the earliest. My sister has learning disabilities and has turrets syndrome, adhd and a slew of other mental disorders. All my life I have ignored her very existence to the best of my ability because I don‚Äôt know how to talk to her. I don‚Äôt want to learn.

I feel like such a bad person because of it, and I wish I had the willpower to change but it‚Äôs just easier to cut her off from my life so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it‚Ä¶

"The title matches perfectly my (19M) situation. I‚Äôve been feeling more distracted and always behind everyone else for the entirety of my life.

"Something I‚Äôve noticed lately and that I feel extremely guilty about is that I often feel more comfortable around strangers than I do with my parents, I talk more freely and just in general I feel more relaxed. Around my parents I feel like my mouth has been sewn shut and I tend to talk less and just be unhappy in general. Also I lowkey trust strangers more sometimes, and I‚Äôm constantly subconsciously seeing strangers as potential parents and not just strangers, like I see someone and I think wow they look like they‚Äôd make a good parent, I wish I was their daughter instead. I also feel like I trust random men more than my own dad, since my dad kind of scares me. There are some random men that for some reason look or seek trustworthy to me and even when I‚Äôm alone late at night or smth, I feel less threatened being around them and this kind of weird me out since I don‚Äôt know them and they obvi don‚Äôt know that I see them that way.
