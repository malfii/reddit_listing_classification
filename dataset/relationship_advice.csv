"Wife F38 is a very beautiful woman but has always been some what self conscious. I don’t know if it’s something I’ve just started noticing in the past couple years but most of the time she goes out she has a cameltoe. Work, which is a place with mostly men. I’ve never felt like she would betray me by cheating on me.
I’ve said something to her about it and she kinda thought i was making a big deal out of nothing. I asked her how she would feel if I walked around with a buldge and that someone made her think. But Now my thought process is does she likes the extra attention she gets? even if I’m not looking if someone has a cameltoe it is something I notice. Not to stare it’s just a very noticeable thing.

"TLDR: I love my boyfriend, and he loves me, but when we moved in together he stopped showing me affection and intimacy between us has stopped. I am very attached to him. What can I do about this and any suggestion as to why?

My boyfriend [21M] and I [21F] have been together for over two years, when we first started dating we realized we clicked really well. We understood each other’s styles, music tastes, humour, everything. We are both very ambitious people with goals in our futures. We have gone travelling on adventures together, worked together over the summer, and more. I love him so much, he’s such a unique person and an extremely kind soul. I can see such a bright future for him and I, but especially him. I love this boy. He used to say I look good and how much he loves my hair and outfits, he used to say I’m amazing, I’m his dream girl and that I’m magical, etc. Sometimes we cuddle up, but rarely do we have sex. We used to all the time (a few times a week, a healthy amount,) but then we moved in together. His sex drive has gone way down and mine stayed the same. This doesn’t bug me much, but once it hits the two weeks-then a month+ without him wanting it- I get worried about if he’s still physically attracted to me. We do it once then it’s the same cycle. Since we moved in together, our long talks have minimized to just humorous conversations and comfortable silence. But he doesn’t text or call me- and he no longer says all the nice things he used to say to me. Rarely do I get a kiss, a hug, a “you look good today”. He does not entertain talks of our future and thinks it’s cheesy. When I told him about my concerns he said “well our dynamic has changed.” And about my concerns for our intimacy, he says word-for-word, “I’m just not feeling it”. I also come from more of a rough home than he did, and his parents are not fond of me very much. I can just sense it. I don’t come from a scholarly &amp; proper family like his- but I still try my absolute best to have manners and be as respectful as possible. He shows me love with cuddles and humour, I feel like I’m always waiting for some affection… anything. but I’m starting to think he’s not with me for love, he’s just in his comfort zone. I love him so much and I know he loves me- I just need advice on how to move forward…","My boyfriend (21M) is no longer ‘obsessed’ with me (21F), what can I do?",18o0iy3,1703201282.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o0iy3/my_boyfriend_21m_is_no_longer_obsessed_with_me/,
"
We've been dating for 4 months and we've been getting dinner together every time we've met up so far. Usually we go out or order in, sometimes we even cook together. He's only made a comment twice so far, and tbh i don't feel bothered by them, just slightly confused. 

I've always been self conscious about my weight, I've always been on the lower end of slightly overweight (using the BMI scale which I don't take too seriously) 
and while I'm still not perfectly happy with it, I'm finally within the normal weight percentage and more than happy with that for now. 

Now, again, what he said didn't seem pressuring or judging, which is why it doesn't bother me, but I'm just unsure what to make of it.
He's 6'3"" and pretty much a beanpole himself, he doesn't work out and as he's in college, his eating habits are not the best.
But he can demolish a whole plate of spaghetti pretty well haha

Twice now he's asked me if I was sure if I ordered/made enough food for myself. I do usually only eat dinner, but I also don't exercise and yet rarely get a second plate of food. 
It's just how it's been for me for years so I'm used to it. 

The comments doesn't make me feel fat nor too skinny, I'm just used to feeling overweight (more than I actually was/am) for so long that it's weird to me for someone to ask if I've eaten enough/want more, that  it confuses me to hear it. 

To empathize, he doesn't make me eat more or anything, I just tell him I'm fine with less and that's the end of the conversation. 

I guess I can't really ask for advice per se, I just wanted to see if anyone has dealt with something similar and knows why he might say that.

"I (20F) have been with my bf (20M) for almost three years. I love him so much, his friends, his family, we’ve even moved to a new city together (while living in separate places) and made it work. 

Recently (the past few months) my mental health has taken the worst turn it ever has. As a result, I have become very codependent on him and I have honestly cried to him more times than I can count. He has been nothing but caring and loving and understood the best he could. 

The issue is that I think I need some time away from him to seek better help. I go in and out of extreme depressive/anxious episodes and each time he seems to get the blunt end of it. I have pointed out to him this isn’t right but he doesn’t care. Only I do and I really think some time apart from him would do me some good (to develop better coping mechanisms so I can be the girlfriend he deserves and all round functioning human again). I really don’t want to leave him for good. Our values align well, we have lots of fun together and we have a beautiful flat lined up to move into in August. We talk about a future together a lot. To be honest, I think it would do him some good too just to have a breather.

"\*\*NO IM NOT BREAKING UP WITH HIM BECAUSE HE IS SICK!\*\* Let’s just go ahead and clear that up before the shaming Karen’s crawl out their hole.\*\*  
  
Me(25f) and my boyfriend (25m) have been together for 4 years. We moved in together a year into our relationship. (We were both living with family before moving into together and this was both of our first times, ever signing a lease and living on our own.) Neither of us had gone to college but wanted to pursue alternate ways of increasing our income.   
While I started doing things like learning about personal finance, stocks, crypto, investing, and how to run an online business he just talked about his goals, never taking REAL action to make them happen. After putting in the work and time to learn these things for myself, I started making some extra money. Once he saw the extra money I was making he then started asking me how I did it and to TEACH HIM!  Mind you we live in the same house the months I spent learning this. He could’ve been doing it with me, but whenever I was sending him links or showing him things I was learning about, he didn’t give it any attention. He just wanted to come home after work and play video games. (Yes I worked FT too) He would tell me he knew he wasn’t trying hard enough, being lazy, he knew he could do better, and that he was ready to start acting on his goals. I stupidly believe in him and made the asinine decision to use the money that I started making to help him out on his plans thinking this investment would just grow our income even more in the future. I bought an updated computer and some programs for him to start working on his goal, which was social media advertising and graphic design. Before I made these purchases, I looked at him and said “You know I’m taking a real risk pulling this money out and I am making a big investment in you.”  Just wanted him to understand the sacrifice and weight of what I was doing. He said he understood, that he loved me and appreciated me for believing in him so much and, he was going to work his hardest to make this a success. Soon I figured out the person he got this side hustle idea from was just one of the scamming “get rich quick” gurus on YouTube. I gave him a soft reality check, letting him know that achieving this goal was not going to be as easy as that person was making it seem. They’re just trying to sell him a course and he’s going to have to put in a lot more work than that. He brushed me off confidently saying that he had it and knew what he was doing. A few weeks in he realized the real amount of learning and work he was gonna need to do to make this successful, and gave up. JUST GAVE UP, knowing my sacrifice to give him that chance! He just slowly stopped putting effort into it, and when I try to encourage him to keep going he would have all of the excuses to push off working on it. Then it turned into him going back to playing video games after work, not a thought in his mind about it.   
This is where the cycle started!   
He would see me working on/bettering myself. Admitted, he was being lazy and needed to be better. Find some scamming YouTube guru talking about the next easy money side hustle.  Try it out, realize how much work it actually is to be successful, and quit. He never wanted to put in any real work. He just wanted it to be easy.  
While I learned from that first time to not blindly, trust in him, and risk my hard work for money, he would completely sink our financial health. Continued to make immature, non-thought-out high-risk, “easy money” endeavors and quit when it got hard. On top of that mess at the job he had, he was offered to be sent off for free education so he could move up and make more money… he declined it because that wasn’t what he wanted to do. Although he didn’t know what he wanted to do career-wise and could’ve used that opportunity in the meantime. He just didn’t and still continues to not have that level of maturity to think like that. He is not making these stupid decisions blindly either! Me, his mom, his family, and other successful people in his life are all giving him the same advice, and he just refuses to listen. Says he’s going to carve out his own path while to lazy to do the work it takes to carve out his own path. In his most recent cycle of manipulation and delusion of making a lot of money, no hard work required: After years spent in the lowest-paying position at his job he finally got moved up to a lead position, earning a few more dollars an hour.   
  
CLARIFICATION: I say manipulation because he would always give me a whole speech admitting all of his faults, admitting he hadn’t been doing all that he could. Telling me that THIS time he was ready and motivated, and he was going to put in the hard work and get things done. He used very convincing, heartfelt words just to inevitably give up when he realized it wasn’t going to be as easy as he thought it was and go right back to the couch playing video games. I know some of y’all are probably asking why the hell did you continue to stay with him then if you saw the cycle and knew he wasn’t going to change. Trust me, I’m not that dumb. I usually give a few chances because we’re all human and then make decisions for myself but I’m getting to that part   
Back to the story….  
  
 Not even a year into this new position his friend started working at a car dealership. Telling him it’s so easy to make a lot of money. All you gotta do is sell cars and you can make thousands of dollars a week… music to my bf’s ears. He quits his stable, full of benefits, and good-paying job and runs to work at this car dealership with his friend. Oh, I forgot to mention his friend got a financial bonus, anytime someone he referred was hired. Anyway, he didn’t bother to look into all the strings attached to his pay and what the job actually entailed before jumping ship. Needless to say, it was a lot harder selling cars than he thought. He didn’t even average one car a week. Being on commission-based pay, this is a huge problem for us and the monthly living expenses we have to pay. Not to mention, a huge problem for his job. He was working at a corporate-level car dealership they did not care about him. They’re not seeing performance or money being made, they fired him in less than three months. After losing this job, we are scrambling quickly trying to find him another one. Just because he stopped making money doesn’t mean our bills stopped coming in. Some of his family members and I found him a few options that he could temporarily take until he could get back on his feet and found a job, making as much as he was before. He refused to do any of them. He thought he was too good for those types of jobs.(grocery store, retail etc.) So once again, instead of being a mature adult, and making smart decisions, he goes 2 months with just no job at all financially ruining us…. Instead of working a temp job to have something coming in until he could find something paying what he wanted. He chose to sit and have nothing coming in at all until he found it. Again, he is not making these terrible decisions naïvely. Me and his family are telling him the detriment that he is doing and the mature moves to make. I started working extra hours at my job, along with ramping up selling on my little online store but it was not enough to cover both of us, family was trying to help out too. I was stressed to my core and having mini panic attacks. To make the time he didn’t have a job even more frustrating. Every time I would come home from working 8-9 hours, I would find him sitting around playing video games. The house was an absolute disaster, a giant pile of laundry not even touched, a sink full of dishes, cooking mess around the kitchen. I would simply ask him “Have you looked for or applied to any jobs today?” He would tell me he did that morning but found nothing that paid well. (this is only looking at indeed, y’all. he’s not like going out and actively trying to find a job) then I would ask him “So if you sat in the house all day, why couldn’t you be bothered to clean up anything?” and he would say “Oh I was going to but then I got into this game and time just slipped away from me, but I’ll start working on it now.” Do a half-assed job, not even finish, and go back to playing his game. Once our bill started really piling up on us and extreme damage has been done then he finally realizes he should probably just take a temporary job until he can find what he wants. But at that point, it was too late, all of the opportunities that were literally handed to him other people took, and it was hard for him to even find a temp job now.   
To wrap up this part of the story after a while, he finally got hired at a job doing what he was doing before the car dealership, and they were paying him pretty well. We started paying back some of the debt that was accumulated during the time he hadn’t worked, but before we got halfway through paying it off somehow he got fired. From there he tried another scam commission job that promised a lot of money an hour but then once he got signed on, found out, there were a bunch of contingencies to making that much an hour. He didn’t meet those contingencies and spent about two months basically doing free labor. At this point, we are wayyy behind on rent and have built up credit card debt. Our lease was coming to an end and not being able to fathom how it would ever be possible to get past this financial burden, I made the decision that I would stay with my mom and he would stay with his grandma so that we wouldn’t have to pay rent and could pay back all of this money that we owed.  
Once again, he gives the I’m going to change, I’m going to do better speech and continues to fail miserably. Being irresponsible and refusing to learn to adult. Make the most asinine decisions and completely preventable, almost felt purposeful, mistakes. I am not scared to give numbers so: When we are about $6000 in debt (this is 2 months after I’m at my mom’s and he’s at his grandma's) he parks his car somewhere that he is not authorized to park, and he knows that he could be towed if he stays there past a certain time limit. Childishly, thinking anything was going to happen, and he’s not gonna get towed he does not move his car before that time limit is up. The car gets towed. He doesn’t bother to look into where his car got towed or the extra things that come with that for a week. He was very nonchalant about the car being towed because it was having problems and he was using his grandma’s car anyway. Well once he finally contacted the towing company, he learned that he had racked up daily fees for his car sitting in that towing parking lot of about $2000!! The people who finance his car worked out a deal to pay 1200 and add that to our debt.   
We still owe money to the apartment we had rented from and he was supposed to talk with management and work out a payment plan for us to get that settled he kept telling me he was going to handle it but never even fucking called them. 6 months into staying with my mom I woke up to my credit score dropping tremendously with a collection for $2500 on it. We only owed 1600 but because he never contacted them to set up a plan passed due fees added up and then sent to collections. I lost it that day. (I’ve been trying to save up for a car and ruining my credit score just took everything away) Yelling at him on the phone I asked him why the hell would he do something so dumb and irresponsible and all he had to say was he was sorry and he didn’t know how to set it up, crying like a little kid. This brings us to the present day.  
I am absolutely DONE!  
Along with all that, some other problems in our relationship were him not making an effort or being romantic anymore after we moved in together. I started to feel like I was a mom managing a little kid. Anytime I would bring these things up to him the discussion would always get heated. He would do some generic, low effort, bare minimum thing to “shut me up.” Then when I wasn’t just over the moon with joy over his bare minimum effort that he only did because we argued about it He would tell me that I am ungrateful and don’t appreciate him. This would also be a cycle.  
Now that I’m done with telling the real reason its not working out heres why I've stayed…  
About a year into our relationship before I knew that this was going to be a cycle, believing his empty words and giving him chances he started getting sick. Extreme Migraines, stomach pains, and bloody stool. The doctors didn’t figure out what it was for almost a year. He ended up getting Covid during this time and had a really bad flareup of the migraines, stomach pain, and bloody stool at the same time. It got so bad I was concerned he needed to see a doctor immediately, but he refused. He wanted his mommy to take him to  his normal primary care doctor who was over an hour away and she couldn’t do that until the next day. The night before he kept getting up and going to the bathroom in extreme pain, blood coming out constantly. That morning of the day his mom was supposed to come him he got up went to the bathroom and pushed out a huge amount of blood. He passed out, hitting his head on the wall, and started having a seizure. I immediately called 911. As they were on their way, he came to, and I let him know that the ambulance was on its way. (He asked me why I called, He wanted to wait for his mom😑) He reluctantly went with them, and after they ran tests, they let him know that he came close to dying with the amount of blood he lost. Because this was during Covid, I couldn’t go with him. Shaking, hyperventilating, traumatized from seeing all the blood and seizure I lay balled up on our apartment floor alone, crying hysterically. He almost died.  
Eventually, the doctors figured out what he had and started treatment. He has been doing well since then. Rarely has flareups, for the most part, he’s living normally. While he has a majority of good days on his bad days, they are really bad. Seeing the level of pain he is in on his bad day and being the main person he relies on for comfort makes me feel trapped like I cannot leave him. I feel so guilty for not wanting to be with him anymore because he's sick even though his sickness is not the reason I want to leave.  
I can’t deal with the brainless immature things he does and the way he treats me anymore. He has destroyed my life financially and it’s going to take me years to recover. I’m also in school now really trying to better myself and have a career. I can’t handle the added unnecessary stress he gives me. It makes me feel like managing a little kid, feeling like I’m someone’s mom when I have no kids. Just a grown man who refuses to adult for himself, uses weapon incompetence, pretending he doesn’t know how to do anything responsible or Adulting-wise. He wants me to do it all for him and he can just live carefree instead of ever learning to do it for himself. I care about him but I'm not in love with him anymore. I just want to be single and focused on myself for a while.  
I just feel trapped in guilt like because he is sick I cant leave. I don’t know what to do.

We are in a stable and serious relationship where we’ve been talking about marriage and children in the future. 

I have a turbulent relationship with my family and have always been longing for the time where I’ll be able to create my own family with the person I love. Where we can create an atmosphere where everyone feels save and taken care of. I do to some extend feel that I have this with my boyfriend, but I also got a strong feeling that his family comes above me and what we’re creating together.

But every year he wants to go abroad with his family. It’s a boys holiday with just him, his brothers and their dad, where they drink, eat and play golf. It’s been said that “unless you own a golf-set you’re not invited” as a joke, but I can also feel the seriousness in it as they want a lads trip without girls and before they get children. 

I find all this really difficult and every year it turns out to an argument as he wants to go and I want something completely different in a relationship. He has this really close bond to his dad and brothers, but that bond doesn’t really include me in any way.

"Hi, 

I dated this girl for 9 months, we split up on good terms in Oct 2022 and we stopped speaking January of this year and went full NC. 

She had mental issues and went off work on sick leave from February to June. She came back and initiated contact with me, I made a move three weeks later and she said she had a boyfriend. It hurt but fine. 

She came back to work, this month after another period of sickness. I made first contact for the first time ever after 3 weeks. 

We're now speaking and seem to be on friendly terms which is fine, I still hold feelings for her but I am not invested as I still speak to her under the impression she has a boyfriend (I don't know if she still does). 

Everything is going okay the last week of speaking, I'm not sure if I should be careful as she is being talkative and talking about sensitive topics about her life.

I don't speak to her outside of work and I will keep it like that. 

Have I made the wrong move by initiating? On one hand I would have to see her and speak to her at some point, on the other I feel given she reached out to me a few months ago only to say she had a boyfriend was a rubbish thing to do.

I live by myself and she’s currently staying with her mother. Her living situation isn’t ideal as she’s camped out in her mom’s living room with her 4 year old daughter. She’s going through a rough time and is unemployed and severely depressed. 

I do enjoy spending time with her, but I have to admit it’s extremely exhausting since she’s always in one crisis or another and I’m always having to encourage her and bring her up. I also don’t really like kids and am hesitant about having children in my apartment as I’ve got white furniture and delicate things. 

When they are over, I feed them 3x a day and entertain them and it’s just getting too much. I don’t mind doing so every once in a while, but she’s been asking for more of a routine in which she can come over at least twice a week and for sleepovers, to which I’ve been making excuses. I feel horrible because I know she wants to come over because she’s feeling down and she claims she always feels better when she’s with me and at my place. I do want her to get better but I feel so mentally and physically drained eveytime they are here. 

I spoke to her about this but she still frequently makes very passive hints about coming over. Is there a better way to approach this? And what is the etiquette regarding food? Would it be rude of me to ask her to bring some food for her and her daughter when they visit?

"I (26F) and my best friend (30M) have been best friends for 5 years now. We had our ups and downs but always stuck together. I've had feelings for him the first year, it wasn't mutual, and over time they passed. Earlier this year I was in a relationship but things went south really quick with this guy and my best friend was there to support me while also saying he had feelings for me (this was the second time he said he had feelings for me while I was in a relationship).

So I broke it off with the other guy and after some time my best friend moved in with me. I still thought he had feelings but he didn't act like it and it mostly came from my side while I also didn't know what to do or how to do some things as he would give me the feeling that he was annoyed by it and of course I wouldn't want to force him.

During this I had some hard times with my mental health and would sit in a different room than him to cry and feel like shit while he just stayed on his computer playing video games. Recently, after lots of fights, I was tired of not knowing how things where between us and I got drunk and lashed out at him for his behaviour.

I was so pissed that I yelled at him to leave while I packed his things. Not long after that I caught him jerking off to some pornsite (I heard him moaning while I was two rooms from him which felt for me that he just didn't give a shit about how I felt). When I confronted him he just said ""go back to bed"" I pushed him and he smacked me to the floor, sat on top of me and punched my ribs and head several times.

We've had more verbal fights to the point where we don't talk, but in his eyes it's like always my fault. I'm tired of feeling disrespected and feeling like shit when he's here. I've thought of kicking him out multiple times. My trust in him is just..gone. Everyday I think he's badmouthing me to someone or laughing behind my back.

I know I'm no angel I've done some things too that aren't nice, but with his answers to everything all the time and shit I just feel like going crazy while doubting myself.

"A bit of a back story: My partner is born in Canada, and has Italian parents. His mom is from Venice, his dad is from Calabria, and his first language is Italian. He has been going to Italy since he was a child -- mostly spending the summers in Venice with his family. He completed a year of high school in Venice and has friends there. His parents live there for almost half the year, and he visits frequently. The past two summers, I accompanied him on these long trips. 

When I met him in 2017, we were both in grad school in the city and at first I wasn't sure about committing to him despite him falling for me quickly. He wasn't my usual type; I'm very Canadian, grew up in the suburbs, spent summers camping, canoeing, playing in the dirt, etc. I've lived in Nunavut and the Yukon, and would be happy to settle in a peaceful place, like a big town or small city, where I can access the outdoors quickly. He definitely seemed like a ""city boy"" and a bit Euro-centric, but, he was charming, easy to talk to, playful, open-minded, made me laugh (every damn day), and opened my eyes to a lot of new opportunities.

We spent the second year of our relationship long-distance. He lived in Barcelona, while I stayed back home to finish my MA. This was his first time leaving home and living independently. I had been living independently since I was 18. He flourished there and I saw this when I stayed with him for 2-3 months. I liked Barcelona as a place to visit, but didn't feel I could live there... the city is a concrete jungle (there are literally two parks and they're RAMMED with tourists), and if I lived there, it would be difficult to do the things I love. During this trip, we took a road trip for my 30th through the South of France, and I went to Venice with him for the first time. I learned so much about this other side of him, and because I love and care about him, it was amazing to witness.  I literally cried the first time I saw the view of the Grand Canal from Rialto bridge, after he had described it to me so many times. For the first time, it allowed me to picture my life with a little piece of Europe in it. When I came back to Canada, I missed him, but I was happy to be home. 

He moved back to Canada during the pandemic. We started talking about our future together. He said he wanted to raise kids in Canada, but in a way that they're in touch with their Italian heritage - similar to how he was raised. I agreed - I loved the idea of raising bilingual, culturally Italian *and* Canadian kids, who spent their summers in Italy with us (I'm a teacher, so this would be possible). We've visited Venice the past two summers for long periods - 2 months or so. I love seeing the city through his eyes and I've learned how to look past the crowds of tourists to admire the depth and history of the place, and it started to feel more comfortable, like a place I could spend big chunks of time in... but it never felt like \*home\*, if you know what I mean. I partly attribute this to the fact that I don't have purpose there other than to vacation and spend time together (my job and life are here, etc.) Both of my sisters (who I am super close with) moved to the East Coast and met their partners there. They said it ""felt like coming home"" when they moved there (my great-great-grandmother immigrated to New Brunswick from Ireland, so we are connected to the area). My partner and I have visited Halifax together (for shorter periods) and I've pitched the idea of living there - it's a city of rich history, close to the outdoors, close to my sisters, with an international airport, so we could continue spending summers in Italy with his family, but he is certain he doesn't want to live there. He says he needs to live in a place that inspires him. 

The incompatibilities here are obvious. The conversation of where to settle together has been an on-going since we agreed to be together for the long haul, but we communicate really well, and every time it came up we seemed to always settle on the fact that we'd rather be together and compromise, than be apart. After all, relationships are full of compromises. I moved to the Yukon in 2020 for work, and he spent 90% of the time living there with me. We had a lot of fun exploring this new place together, meeting new people and I would have stayed a third year, but he was growing unhappy, (uninspired) and I was also okay with moving on, so we left in summer of 2022. Now, we're living in a separate apartment in his parent's house (it's not ideal bit it's reciprocally beneficial because they like having someone here when they go to Italy). We've been here over a year, both feeling a little stagnant but knowing it's a temporary living situation, and are invested in our jobs and saving money. We have talked about living in Toronto, Montreal, London (UK) but increasingly he is growing tired of Canada. In March of this year, we went to look at engagement rings and we've been trying to conceive since before we left the Yukon... after deciding that both of us are ready to take that step. After a year and no pregnancy, we sought help at a fertility clinic - I was going through cycle monitoring and some minor treatments typically involving getting blood work and ultrasounds before work regularly, all of which is tiring and emotionally draining, especially when I find out I'm still not pregnant. We decided to take a break from it this month and just relax for the holidays. We have a trip booked to visit Halifax over Christmas. 

On Sunday, I come home from a weekend up north with friends, and he tells me that a) he planned to engage while we were in Nova Scotia but b) he's now scared we want different things, ultimately revealing he would like to move to Italy permanently... alone. He says I don't ""light up"" in the same places he does, but that he's seen me ""light up"" in places like the Yukon and Nova Scotia. He says he generally feels unsatisfied here. When I ask if that is to do with me or where we live, he says it's both. When I offer to try moving to Italy together, he says he's scared I won't be happy and it will only be harder to break up later, and so isn't very willing to try.  


I am still in shock and trying to wrap my head around all of this. I feel betrayed, especially since he didn't come to me sooner, and has apparently been feeling this way since August. I feel angry and find it incredibly irresponsible and immature that he was having doubts for so long all the while trying to start a family with me. I feel sad, of course - like a life and a future I envisioned, wanted and was committed to has been taken away from me. I feel anxious I'll never have kids (again, I'm 34 and I deeply want to be a mother). And I feel alone and kind of stuck... I am in a contract that ends in June, all my friends live with their partners and/or don't have space for me to temporarily move in with them. I dread the thought of moving in with my mom and step-dad (who do NOT have an in-law suite), and commuting to work from that far away. I could just move to Halifax and stay with my sisters, but what do I do for the next 6 months... thoughts?","After commissioning an engagement ring and trying to conceive for 1.5 years, my partner (35M) of six years tells me (34F) he wants to move to Italy without me.",18o09et,1703200554.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o09et/after_commissioning_an_engagement_ring_and_trying/,
"My partner(20F) and I(22M) have been together for almost an year. We don’t have a label but we have been technically dating. She has been very good to me, true to me, honest as well. I had a breakup last year after which I got into a relationship with her in less than a month. 

My problem is “guilt”. My partner is very sensitive and I feel she will be broken, no I don’t need ideas on how to break up, tell me whether I should or not. So the thing is that I don’t like women who party a lot because I’m a little insecure after being cheated on. I don’t like some little things. She knows and she worked on all of them for the last months, my ideas are a little radical I know, I might be wrong as well but that’s fine. The concern here is that we were happy. 

Today she went to meet her friends (both guys and girls), and she said it made her happy, very happy but she felt that I might be offended cuz she went out with her guy friends. I said I’m not, then she said I’m feeling fear from going to clubs (I never told her don’t go explicitly). She further said a relationship where the partner has to ask for something is toxic.

I am re-partnered from a first marriage, and in a new committed relationship. I have kids from my first marriage, and 50/50 custody of the kids with my ex. 

My new partner and I moved in together a few months ago. It was earlier than we had planned, but there is a housing shortage where we live. The kids are at our place every other week. We agreed that we would see how living together worked and reassess if it didn’t. 

Before we moved in together earlier this year, she was living in an apartment and paying rent. It was subsided by a family friend. When we went out, she used to get the bill sometimes. Gradually, I have become the only financial contributor. 

When we started dating, I was not making very much money, and was taking time off from work. I am back to regular work and for about the past two years, have made more money than my  new partner does. She recently, and really suddenly, quit her low-paying job due to burnout and what she characterizes as chronic illness issues, mostly mental health. She has never had a job for longer than about a year, and hasn’t gotten a degree. It’s something she is really self conscious about. I told her I would support the household while she figured out her next moves. She said she would take on more of the housework and kid stuff to compensate for not working. She has, but because of her health issues, it’s not necessarily consistent or reliable. My kids (and I) are also missing the time I used to have with them without my new partner present. We have lost some of those contact opportunities since I am now working more and my partner is doing more childcare. She doesn’t have kids of her own, but she’s really good with mine. 

Currently, I am paying for all of our living expenses—- rent, food, gas, utilities, entertainment, you name it. I give her cash all the time.  I have even paid for us to go on some really nice trips. I am lucky that I have been able to do that, and it’s been a lot of fun. 

With her being out of work for the past few months, we have tried to come up with a joint budget. It has been a really big source of friction between us. I am more financially literate, and already had a financial plan set up for myself and my kids’ education and retirement.  I am starting to think that moving in together was a mistake, and that we need to take a step back. The problem I have is that she is now totally financially dependent on me. 

A few things have happened in our budget discussions that are ringing alarm bells for me:

She compiled a list of her personal expenses and seems to expect me to foot the bill for them in addition to already paying for everything else for myself, the kids, and the household. They are all entertainment and discretionary type expenses for the most part. 
She hasn’t filed a tax return or paid a tax return in years, and can’t seem to be able to figure it out on her own 
She has a past as a sugar baby 
She freaked out when I told her that I thought it would be a good idea for her to earn her own money for her expenses so that she wasn’t totally dependent on me 

She’s not a yeller, but she’s very hard to say no to.  I feel like I no longer have time with my own kids, or time with myself. 

We all have different strengths and weaknesses. I love her so much. I am just wondering if these are red flags indicating that I am being taken advantage of (and not setting boundaries well), even inadvertently, or differences that I can work to overcome. 

I am starting to wonder if I am just her “cash cow.” I get that she’s never going to make as much money as me.

"Personal backstory: I have struggled with depression, anxiety, &amp; suicidal ideation since I was 15. I went to therapy, outpatient programs, tried meds, etc. I’ve had a s*icide attempt before &amp; went to a few programs for it. 
when I was 19 I started to exercise regularly, going to the gym for weight training &amp; yoga, started eating more, taking my vitamins &amp; have been taking amazing care of myself. I have an amazing job, go to acting school, &amp; have a healthy romantic relationship. If anything, I’d say I cured myself. 

My best friend, we’ll call her Annie, &amp; I met through our boyfriends &amp; started going to acting class together, since it was something we both shared an interest in. We became instant best friends. Annie’s fun, lively, outgoing, &amp; we get along better than anyone I’ve met in a long time. 

Not that it’s a big deal, but she doesn’t eat much, if she does it’s really bad processed food or fast food, she doesn’t exercise, &amp; she doesn’t really do anything to keep herself healthy physically &amp; mentally. Habits that I used to have when I was depressed. She’s not obese or super skinny or anything, &amp; she’s a very beautiful girl, not that it matters, but just something to note. 

Her relationship with her bf is my first red flag of hers. Her bf is awesome, super chill golden retriever type, but she doesn’t love him anymore. Which is fine. But She just keeps him around because she loves the attention. She says after they have sex, she feels gross, &amp; she’s always fantasizing about other guys. After a year of me convincing her she needs to be alone, she finally broke up with him. Started talking to a few other guys, went on dates, invited them to her bday, etc. But then she missed the comfortability of him so they got back together (kinda) but she still wants to see other people &amp; she told him that. He didn’t like that but is staying anyway, which is on him at this point.

When she told me this, I got very upset at her &amp; told her she was being selfish &amp; inconsiderate of his feelings. &amp; she’s being detrimental to her own personal growth. I’m always lovingly honest to her, &amp; told her she needs to leave him alone so they can both grow individually. She said “okay I’ll just k*** myself” &amp; laughed. She’s always jokes about that (I started to at once point also) 

I told my boyfriend about this whole interaction &amp; he was very upset that I’m being surrounded by her negativity because I’ve worked so hard to get better. 

I don’t want to disregard her own feelings &amp; mental health. I know she’s going through things &amp; im sure leaving this relationship is causing a lot of anxiety, but I can only do &amp; handle so much. Her saying she’ll just k*** herself as a joke is very triggering to me, since I’ve been putting so much effort to get stronger mentally &amp; emotionally. &amp; yes I told her this. 

Another bother of mine :
The other night we went out with her friend &amp; her friends bf. &amp; she was being very flirty &amp; friendly to her friends boyfriend. Her friend was obviously uncomfortable so I was trying to get in the middle of it &amp; make us all be included in the convos. Then after she said “I don’t think (friend) likes my relationship with (friends bf)” &amp; I said yeah you were being very friendly &amp; flirty. &amp; she just shrugged it off. Like??? (Another trigger for me as I’ve had a friend who’s been very “friendly” around my bf)

I don’t want to drop her, but I’m getting drained. Since September I’ve kinda stopped working out &amp; eating better (which is also my fault) but sometimes I feel I need a best friend who also wants to better themselves so we can encourage eachother, &amp; Annie’s not helping me. I tell her im sad one day &amp; she just says “we can just k*** ourselves together” sometimes I’ll laugh, but looking back it’s really just negative words &amp; energy that I don’t need. I’m starting university again in January &amp; I need to be my best self.

"My (F25) boyfriend (M25) have been in a relationship for 3.5 years. We are both working and generally doing decent for our lives. We have been living together for the past 2 years, we migrated to Canada so it just seemed natural to live together so that we have someone, we both work from home so that helped too. My boyfriend's parents haven't been living together for the past seven years and are going through a divorce so naturally the marriage was always a touchy subject for our relationship and hence I never brought it up and so didn't he. He is not very big on emotions or words so it always was a struggle for me to speculate about the future.

  
Like every other couple, we have had our highs and lows, especially being an immigrant we have seen together a lot. He has always wanted me to focus on my fitness and career. I am in decent figure, not overweight or obese and have always been concerned about my career as well, we both earn equally and have a 50/50 division for everything including dates, travel and basic stuff. I have always wanted him to be more romantic and expressive of his feelings. I would always encourage him to share his feelings about whatever that's going in his family, he never once has shared anything after say about a year from when we started dating, which makes me sad. These always have been a few tension points in our relationship.

  
Recently, when I turned 25 my parents asked if I was seeing anyone since I hadn't spoken to my boyfriend about how we want to handle families I said no to my parents, to which they replied I should start looking because after 30 it can be hard for women to find someone. I spoke to my friends and they had similar opinions. Additionally, I have also been wanting some certainty for the future. I communicated all of this to my partner, to which he said he is not sure if we are ready for marriage, he wants both of us to be more successful in our respective careers, he wants us to be more mature and have 0 points of tension before we decide to marry which I completely understood and agree with however I just needed certainty of when he thinks he is ready, it is me who he would want and an estimation of when he thinks we would be ready, to both of this is he said he is not sure. That broke my heart, and that to me felt like rejection. At this point, I am not sure if he just saying all of this to potentially get rid of the situation.

"Basically what the Title says. 
To understand the situation: I am a very loyal partner and I do not text/ snap with any girls and try to avoid dms and frequent snaps out of respect for my relationship. I kind of expect a similar level of respect back.

My gf loves me very much and I have no worries of her leaving me or cheating on me. I just happen to feel a slight annoyance/bothering when dudes text her or snap her regularily, even when I know they talk about uni.

I feel really immature but cant control my feelings. I don't know if I feel jealousy and if I do, how do I overcome this feeling. We have immaculate communication and I tell her everytime I feel this way. She offers to cut contact and block the people I have a problem with, but I don't want to solve the issue this way, but rather want to know how I can change my thinking.

Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with her being in contact with other dudes but I have some emotional problems when the snaps get frequent or the texts get long. I can't explain it better than this: my rational side is ok with those texts but my emotional side isnt.

How do I accept the texting, even though I expect the same amount of respect to be returned?

"TL;DR:  Do I wait for attraction to grow after two months or end it based on a height-related ick?

We have been dating about two months, hanging out 2-3 times a week, and just made things official. I am looking for a long-term relationship/marriage, and so is he. I absolutely love spending time with him: he's hilarious, so smart, and really sees who I am in a way that most people do not. I could see myself spending every day of the rest of my life with him, happily. Ending things with him would devastate me, and I'm afraid I'd have regrets.  I've rarely enjoyed being around a man this much.

The problem is that I'm not sure of my attraction. He is shorter than me. We met on Tinder, and he had a height in his bio that's \~4-5 inches taller than he really is.  I was so charmed by him, I didn't even mind for the first few weeks.  But now I've started noticing it more and more, and for lack of a better term, it's giving me the ""ick"" sometimes.

I'm still turned on by him, but much less than I was those first few weeks.  The sex is good (not mindblowing), but I feel myself dissociating during it and thinking about other things.  When we walk next to each other or kiss standing up, I'm turned off when I notice I'm taller.  When we're in bed, my feet are below his, and I'm turned off by that too.  I find myself avoiding sexual intimacy, although I still want to touch/cuddle.

Do I give it longer or end it? I know attraction can grow, so I am leaning toward giving it longer.  But I also know everyone deserves a partner who is crazy about them, especially this really amazing guy.

Firstly, I'm sorry about any mistake I'll make in this entry. English is my second language. I'll try explainin myself.

On a regular coffee date night that was 4 months ago from now, I caught my boyfriend's IG dms with his male friend. They send each other half naked girls' photos and wrote some sexual things about it (like ""I wanna eat her pussy""). FYI there wasn't anything missing in our sexual life. 

I was devastated and we had a huge fight. He never tried to make it seem like it was normal, he was terribly sorry about it. He cried and cried(seeing him cry broke my heart into pieces), told me he didn't want to lose me, I'm his everything, he will fix this and build my trust again etc. He said he didn't think about it much and it was just 'guy talk'. 

We somehow fixed our relationship (because I didn't wanna lose him, I am in love with him. Also people told me this isn't cheating, it's something guys do) and we continued dating. He promised he would never do this again and I can look through his phone whenever I want. Looking through bf's phone wasn't something I would do, NEVER. Now, I find myself doing this all the time (I find nothing bad after the incident). He treats me like a princess all the time from the beginning of our relationship. I know he adores me and appreciates me. 

The problem is I'm having a really hard time bonding sexually with him again. Sometimes its easy, nothing about this fight comes on my mind. But sometimes I feel like shit... I used to love dirty talk but it makes me sick now. Some days I trust him completely but the other days I search for a mistake. 

He never gets too close to a woman in any weird way, he doesn't lay eyes on other women. This is my first relationship so I can get upset/anxious easily. I care so much about healthy relationships and always focus on being the best or the most mature version of myself. How can I get this over and bond him sexually again? Please help me.

"I (28f) no longer talk to my sister (30f). It has been a little over a year since I last heard from her. I have moments, like am I right now, when I wonder if I should just move on and reach out. 

My sister and I have been best friends for as long as I can remember. We did everything together and I told her everything. She was always my favourite person. If you told me a year ago that I hadn't talked to her in over a year, I wouldn't believe it. For background, she has always had an explosive personality, but I've just accepted that's just the way she is. She can be really mean, but as my parents say ""you just love her for who she is"" and move on. Theres a lot 

I lived with her and her husband (30m) for a couple years, until I met my now fiancé. My sister married her high school sweetheart so he is basically a brother to me (14 years together). From day one, my sister hated my fiancé. To be honest, I'm not really sure why. He is everything I have ever wanted and more, no one has ever treated me better, we are best friends and always have so much fun together. 

As soon as I moved out and in with my fiancé, about 4 years ago, my relationship with my sister started to suffer. We no longer lived together so we didn't spend every night together. Any time I spent time with other friends, she would try and make me feel bad for not inviting her. For example, a friend invited me to a concert and my sister would get mad at me for not asking her to go. When I look back, I think I did a lot to stay connected with her, I called her almost daily and always invited her over. However, I can acknowledge that I a had a part in our relationship drifting, but we were getting older and I was creating my own life. It felt normal. 

Fast forward to Summer 2022, my relationship with my sister was extremely strained. She convinced herself that she never got her ""wild years"" because she married her high school sweetheart and completely changed. She started drinking like crazy (she's mean when she drinks, always has been), getting tattoos, experimenting with drugs and being rather rude to me and others (she called it ""choosing herself""). I struggled, I missed my sister and spending time together. The times I asked her to spend time with me, she was either busy or asked me to do drugs. I should add, I knew she and her husband were struggling so I wanted to be there for her.

Finally, we connected and I invited her to a sports game with another friend of mine. The plan was to go to the game and then go bar hopping after. My sister was adamant we get drinks before at a specific bar, because her husband never let her go there and he was out of town. We go, get drinks and then head to the game. At the game, my sister tells me that she is cheating on her husband with the bartender at the bar were just at and that she's slept with several other people. 

I basically had a breakdown. That night, I told her I can't keep the secret and she has to tell her husband. She gas lit me, yelled at me, manipulated me and ended up leaving. I ended the night in shambles, on the floor of my bathroom on the phone with a crisis hotline. My fiancé drove 11 hours to come home from work as soon as I told him; he knew I would need him. I talked to her the next morning and told her how the whole situation made me feel. She told me it was ""her situation"" and I shouldn't be so broken up about it. She's the one that's struggling, I have no right to be upset. She also told my parents and they told me its not my place or theirs and we will not be telling her husband.  

I'm so ashamed to say, I didn't tell him. For about three months, I didn't tell him. It makes me sick thinking about it. I barely saw my sister during this time and refused to be around them. My relationship with fiancé suffered, because morally he felt we had to tell her husband. She told me she had stopped cheating and was working on things with her husband. I ended up in therapy because of it.

In November 2022, my sister randomly texted our family group chat and said something along the lines of: I'm a terrible person, I cheated on my husband, we're separating and I'm giving him everything. I assumed she told him and reached out to let her know I was there if she needed anything. Her husband called me and said he was moving to a different city to be back with his family. I met up with him to say goodbye. That is when I learned, she didn't tell him at all. 

While her husband was out of town for work, she invited her ""boyfriend"" over. They have google cameras and her husband could see he was there, even though they tried to be sneaky. She dropped her husband at the airport at 4:00 and her ""boyfriend"" was over by 4:30. There's more details but basically she was blatant about it and horrible to her husband. She lied to me and my family. 

The last time I talked to my sister, she texted me to say she felt horrible and would wait for me to reach out when I was ready. I let her know that at this point, I had so much anger and sadness built up for her lying, manipulating me, and putting her secret on me that it was up to her to rebuild what we had. I no longer trusted her. That was November 2022, and I haven't heard from her since. To be clear, she has not contacted me and I have not contacted her.

She stayed in contact with my parents for a bit. She ended up moving to a town City about 5 hours away with her ""boyfriend."" My mom was and still is a total mess whenever it comes up. She is mad at me for not reaching out, but refuses to talk about it with me. About six months ago, my dad asked that I be receptive if my sister reached out. He said he was going to ask her to reach out for my mom's sake. As far as I know, my dad talked to her and she exploded which turned into a big screaming match. She has since cut off my parents and changed her phone number. 

It's almost Christmas and I've found myself reflecting on the whole situation. I feel like I've done what I've done to protect myself and my life. I couldn't take the stress of our relationship anymore. I've also thrived since she it all happened. I'm now engaged and planning my wedding, I've done so well at work that I got a promotion, I've become closer with a lot of my friends and done a lot of things I don't think I would've for fear of backlash from my sister. But then, I feel like a terrible sister and friend for not being there for her while she was going through a divorce. My mom keeps saying, life is too short, just move on. But isn't life too to keep people in your life when they are terrible to you?

TLDR: I haven't talked to my sister in over a year because she treated me terribly. Sometimes I feel like I'm the bad guy for not being there for her and should reach out for my mom's sake.","I (28f) no longer talk to my sister (30f) because she cheated on her husband, lied to me, manipulated me and treated me terribly.",18nzwpq,1703199631.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nzwpq/i_28f_no_longer_talk_to_my_sister_30f_because_she/,

We have been together for four years, we have had ups and downs to say the least but we are in a real rough patch at the moment. We openly communicate about what we need from the relationship however we both feel like we have lost a spark. I understand this is normal and a relationship is more about commitment once love dissipates.

So we’re working on that, but recently more than ever she has been drinking with her new workfriends. And that’s never really been an issue. However I get this sense something is up with her and a male colleague. He walks her to her Ubers, sometimes is just the two of them who go out or she texts him while out begging him to join her. I know this because we go on each others phones often.

Two weeks ago I told her it upset me, but nothing seems to have changed. Is what I’m doing unfair to her or do I have a leg to stand on. It’s like she doesn’t want me to know about it all.

"Hello,

For our last working day before Christmas, I spent my evening creating little Christmas bags for every single one of my coworkers. I planned for them to be filled with candy, homemade cookies and some lip balm. The issue is I only had enough time tonight to decorate about half of the cookies, and didn't buy enough lip balm at the shop for financial reasons. So in the end, half of the bags have decorated cookies, the other half doesn't. Only plain cookies. And some have lip balm and some don't.

I'm worried I seem like I'm singling out coworkers and shouldn't gift the bags at all from fear of that.

"So I (18M) am in an increasingly weird situation with a friend/talking stage(?) of mine (18F). What do I do? 

—- this is a very long post, but I think pretty much all of it is needed since it’s a very weird situation.—- 

Some basic backstory, we “dated” a couple years ago, but nothing really ever came of it, we broke up a couple months later and didn’t talk at all until a couple of months ago. I didn’t talk to her because I heard that she didn’t want me to, which was apparently wrong.

 Anyways, she unblocks me on stuff and all that and started trying to have small conversations with me. This was mostly on Snapchat so just like commenting on things like what I was doing or whatever. 

We hung out a lot in some classes we have because of some mutual friends in there. Then about 2 months ago at a Halloween party she was really flirty with me (probably because I wasn’t in my right mind if you get what I mean) and my friends all told me about how she was into me and blah blah blah. 

I ignored them until a friend of mine (who’s a good friend of hers) told me that I should ask her to hangout. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to, but did it anyways and we hung out about a month ago. It was chill, we got dinner, went to her house and cuddled. That’s it. 

A week later (2 weeks ago) I was at a party with some friends and she texted me asking about “us” and “what are we”. I didn’t really respond, and she came and long story short she kissed me and we madeout. However, before she did that, I was again not in the greatest mindset at that party (she was) and when I tried to make a move on her she backed up, so I felt bad and left it. She then started saying stuff like “cmon (my name)” and “I know you can do it (referring to me kissing her)”. However, I didn’t want to mess up as I already assumed she didn’t want me to since I tried before and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Which I think was the right thing to do, but I don’t think she liked that. I also wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss her anyways, but she kissed me so whatever, it is what it is. 

The day after that she went to some mutual friends and called me a “coward” (she called me something else that starts with a p, but I apparently couldn’t write that on here) for not making a move on her, even though I did. Pretty sure she did this to get my attention since she told 2 of my best friends.

Over the next couple weeks we tried to make plans but we both were genuinely busy so they fell through. 

A couple days ago I had a friend of mine over and we were just chilling playing video games when a friend of the girl this is about texted him to have us both go over there. When he asked about it she said ”(girl’s name) says definitely come if you bring (my name)”. And a mutual friend of ours (the one from above who told me to ask her to hangout) texted me saying to “make sure not to be late”. 

So we went and there was a decent amount of people there. Maybe like 10. But we didn’t even talk to them pretty much the whole time. They were playing a tournament style sport that we couldn’t get into since we were late, so we just threw a football around with her and her brother. It was just an awkward group and I don’t think my friend or I were expecting a large get together like this, rather than like just 4 or 5 people.  

—-Some important info for this next part is she has a friend that she’s gotten really close with recently (and honestly he’s really good looking), however he has a girlfriend. He’s actually a really friendly and nice guy from when I’ve interacted with him, but one of my really close friends actually told me about a week ago that he saw her talking to him a lot at a party in a “supposedly” flirty way, but I brushed it off since he has a girlfriend, and my friend isn’t the most reliable source of information especially since he probably was bouncing off the ceiling at that point. And he ended up saying he wasn’t sure what he saw and that he left to early. This guy also doesn’t seem like the kind of person to do that, but I could be wrong. Although I’ve been a bit suspicious of that guy for a while. —-

Anyways, about an hour later some people left, leaving just a few of us including that other guy. We went to like a forest area and just messed around. Eventually my friend and this other girl went off to do whatever they were gonna do leaving 4 of us. The girl I am sort of in a thing with was hanging with the other guy (not in a romantic way at all, but like it was sorta strange) it went on for the whole time. So I was stuck with just her brother who likes me a lot. At this point I thought this whole thing was weird, considering she wanted me there but was hardly talking to me. I was also getting really suspicious of the other guy, despite him having a girlfriend. Her brother even thought it was weird and asked me what was going on/happening between us. 

Anyways I basically just hung out with her brother and my friend who I ended up finding for a bit before we left. He was equally bored and we left as quick as we could. He even said “it would’ve been more fun to stay at my house and play COD”.

The whole thing seemed weird. This girl wanted me there, and then didn’t talk to me. She even got her friends to text me. But then, she just talked to this other guy to the point that I thought it’d be awkward for me to join in. 

My friends are split between thinking she’s intimidated by me or that she’s trying to make me jealous in a really stupid way. I kinda feel frustrated by her antics and don’t know if I even want to continue whatever this is. It seems super stupid and overly confusing, because I know the next time I see her at a party or 1 on 1 (probably New Years) she will be all over me and will probably want to kiss me at midnight knowing her. 

What do I do? I haven’t snapped her or contacted her at all since this happened. I just think it’s weird that she’d want me there and have her friends tell me to come all for her to just not talk to me. My friends think she’s really into me but immature or afraid of something. 

I’m going to have classes/be interacting with her for the next year so I want to be chill about whatever I do, and I am genuinely friends with her at school, that’s where this all started. 

My question is- what do I do ? What does she want/what is she doing? She almost definitely  is into me, but then does dumb stuff like this. And what’s my best course of action?

"So I (F, 29) started dating this guy (M, 30) in September. When we first started dating he hid some crucial information from me. Such as he’s married but separated going through divorce next year (2024), living with and sleeping in the same bed as his wife/ex wife/roommate/friend. 

We would have conversations and he’s refer to her as his roommate. I searched his name I found his marriage certificate. Her Facebook says single and 3/4 of her Instagram pages do. The other 1 is a picture of both of them together. Earlier when dating he would try to refer to them as different people. When I asked him if he was living with his wife and roommate at one point in time as in 3 people, he said yes. However the wife and roommate are the same person. Recently he’s been calling her his “friend.” 

After I confronted him about her and what I knew, he told me everything. I went through his phone one day as he was sleeping and saw their messages. She’s aware he has a girlfriend (me) and does the same thing, refers me as his friend to her. 

She was in a car accident last year and has been bumming rides from him to and from work. Here’s the kicker she pays no bills since they live in his childhood home with his siblings and he and his siblings split the bills. 

We talked about the divorce and a lawyer a few weeks ago but nothing recently has been said about it. Recently if she’s needs anything he’s quick to do it for her. We have dates planned but before we can go out he has to either pick her up or drop her off. If he can’t he arranges the rides for her or sends her Uber or Lyft money. For 2 people who are trying to get “divorced” he’s doing an awful lot for her. They also don’t have kids together or anything. 

Because of the whole still being married, I refuse to sleep with him. He’s spent the night on my couch or in my guest room. 

Where do I start? Is it worth the headache? How do I talk to him about her? Should I cut this off and just start anew?

She also really really doesn’t like me despite me really trying to build a relationship with her.
 
It all came to a head in the summer when she found out I was staying with him and his dad and completely lost it with him. His parents are divorced and every member of his family kept it a secret that I was staying there because they were worried about her reaction. She cussed me out to him and blamed me for the lies and it was awful to hear. After I still met up with her and tried to build bridges but I really find it hard. 

I moved back to my home town a few months ago and he is visiting for the first time in a week. I want to be excited for the visit but instead I’m terrified and anxious about how his mother will react. She wants to buy an international phone plan because he’s here for 10 days and wants to talk to him and I feel like my time and experience with him is going to be ruined by her constantly calling. He promises he’ll stand up to her and not allow that but he doesn’t have the best track record. He has been better at setting boundaries with her but it’s still making me ridiculously anxious and I don’t know what to do. How do I approach this situation? Do I set boundaries when he visits? I love him so much but i’m terrified of a future where his mother will constantly be first regardless. I want to travel but can I with his mother breathing down his neck?

"Throwaway account. We have been married for 5 years, together for 10. It has been a bumpy ride. We have 2 children (6,7); one with special needs. We have had our share dose of fights and disagreements but what we lack most is respect. The most recent argument (about a month ago) involved her name calling me first and I retaliated by calling her out of her name. I believe that was the final straw and she decided to say she's giving up. I'm surprised that was her breaking point as we've fought over worse but I believe it's a build up over time.  
We are living in the same home but I rarely get any attention or talking out of her. She works overnights as well so any free time she does have, she's too tired to engage with me or talk about the relationship. All she says is she's tired of trying and doesn't want to be promised anything again that won't happen.  
I let it get to this point partly due to my neglect in the relationship. We also married so our adopted daughter would have my last name. I reflect back and think that our foundation for the relationship was a very weak one and we may have fell in lust first.  
My question is, why am I having a hard time accepting this? I know we probably aren't good for each other but it's so hard for me to let go. I also don't really have anywhere else to go but I feel miserable being here and I work from home, so I'm in my thoughts 24/7. Sadly, I feel like we would accomplish more being separated as well. I don't want the kids to suffer but my (and possibly her) happiness is suffering together.  
Am I afraid to be alone after so long? Did I become so dependent of her that I don't know how to enjoy myself? I fear I am going to digress even though I have a lot to look forward to in 2024.

"For well over 3 years now (since I was 17 and still in highschool) I am with my boyfriend (23M). We have been living together for about 2 years and have adopted 2 cats. So besides sharing an apartment, we also share the responsibility for two living creatures.

I have not been happy in our relationship for over a year now. There are many things that I could list as examples that are going wrong in our relationship, but that's not important because:

I've known for a long time that I want to end the relationship. We are simply no longer happy together.

My problem is money. And my problem is that my boyfriend has been my only constant over the last few years and I feel too young and stupid to know how to handle all of this by myself. I’m simply scared of what’s coming after a breakup. My parents literally kicked me out of my home after I graduated and luckily I moved in with my boyfriend. We now live together in his father's apartment at a very reasonable rent.
I'm currently doing an apprenticeship, so I earn very little money. With tax and all and with my additional payments (like child support) I male it to roughly 1300€ a month. Barely enough to get by in such an expensive city like Berlin. I also still owe my boyfriend over 300€.

The housing market in Berlin is extremely bad and I know very well that moving is very expensive. (New furniture, rental deposit, etc.) and that it’s very difficult to even find an apartment. My question now is: what should I do? Should I stay with him until I save enough money to break up and move with the cats to a new apartment? When do I start looking for a new place? Or should I end the relationship as quickly as possible and hope that he and his father don't throw me out of the apartment? 

I do really feel bad for not ending this as soon as I realized I don’t love him anymore but I kind of did this to protect myself from not financially ruining myself I guess?

PS: Yes, I do have parents myself, but they don't support me financially and it's not possible to move back home.",I (20F) am putting off breaking up with my boyfriend (23M) because I don't have any money and feel like I‘m using him.,18nzdrd,1703198256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nzdrd/i_20f_am_putting_off_breaking_up_with_my/,
"misplaced jealousy

this is going to sound awfully silly, but i’m just searching for any way to remedy this and keep it from affecting me so heavily.

i (18F) am the oldest child in my family, so most first ventures into hobbies were met with praise since nobody had ever done these things before. i spent most my childhood focused on schoolwork, and, because of the curriculum, excelled at my work in school. i loved art, i played piano. my younger sister (15F) was always trying to copy me, typical younger sibling stuff, and i didn’t mind too much—i found it endearing and it made me happy to have so much in common with me! i quickly realized, though, that my family always saw her achievements as more noteworthy than mine. if i drew something that got put in a gallery, her drawings would be praised to the high heavens for hanging in a family member’s house while maybe two family members would go to see my work in the gallery. i was a great pianist, but when she started playing, all of a sudden it was mozart-level.

i discovered that my true love is performance onstage during my eighth grade year. i struggled socially, and felt incredible anxiety in auditions and such. this led to me getting relatively small parts, but when i finally came out of my shell sophomore year i began to get almost exclusively leads. my theater journey encouraged my little sister to do the same, in hopes it would help her confidence. it worked. she’s a natural, just like me, and started in a much better spot than me since i introduced her to many of my own theater friends. 

since she started, i’ve always felt a little odd. my family says in front of me that she’s going to broadway and such, the typical stuff you say to kids after performances, but they’d never say that to me. ever. i ignored it.

this past week, she landed the role of ariel in the little mermaid. i’m so, so proud of her. i’m her number one cheerleader. unfortunately, this has brought on extreme jealousy. not because she gets to be ariel (i didn’t even audition, i don’t have a right to be upset about not getting a part i didn’t try for), but because my family has been relentless. in my theater “career”, i have been leads in all but 2 shows i’ve ever done. i’ve won multiple “best in show” awards. in show choir, i’ve won best performer twice. i know that i’m good, risking sounding full of myself. i have never, ever felt the support my sister is getting. cards from family members across the US, special interviews with her school, a bunch of gifts. every time we’re around family, it’s all “you’re going to broadway”. even when she’s not around, they tell ME she’s incredible and going places. i take it with grace and a smile, because i am so proud of her. but she’s always been the baby of the family, they’ve always cared more for her than me. 

my own mother told me yesterday “she gets to be a disney princess! you never got to be a disney princess, this is so exciting”. important to note, i’m healthily midsized. i’m not thin enough to be considered for princess parts, nor am i conventionally attractive enough or short enough. hearing that hurts, because all i’ve ever wanted is to be good enough for a princess role.

the only person who seems to get that hearing this constantly hurts is my other sister (16F), who tries to tell me she thinks i’m talented, too, whenever it starts happening.

my sister is incredibly talented. none of this is her fault at all and i am so, SO excited to see her in her show in a few months: she’s going to kill it. i just don’t know how to keep it from getting to me.

how do i ignore the jealousy and keep it from affecting me?

EDIT: important to note, my family can be very sarcastic and judgmental, which makes for funny family gatherings and not-so-fun conversations about insecurity. whenever i mention anything akin to this or even seem jealous, i get laughed at and made into the butt of a joke. i hear “stop being dramatic” and “you’re not the only one who’s allowed to like theater”, which hurts because it feels like diminishing the fact that they’re constantly ignoring me and what i do. i don’t think my parents are bad, i love them dearly, but i think they have an image of me in their heads as very emotionally guarded and mature so they don’t think i need the support.

"Please remove if this is not allowed. 

Basically what the title says. Last year, I got him something that I thought he would love. I was excited about it all month and tried so hard to keep the secret. When he opened it, he was kind of like “I like it but… where will I put it?” 

Looking back, he had a point. But I think that it was still shitty of him to not even pretend to be happy in front of my whole family. It was quite embarrassing. We returned the gift and he chose something more practical, and I have moved past it. We’ve even joked about it this year. 

This year, I have been feeling anxious. I got one small thing that he had mentioned to me, but for his “big gift”, I got him something very personal and thoughtful. I do want to explain what it is for context. 

His favorite NFL team is across the country from us. I remember that I once asked him why he chose the team, and he told me that they won the first Super Bowl he remembers watching as a child. It was a bonding moment between him and his dad, and he’s loved the team ever since. So I bought him an official Wilson game ball personalized for that Super Bowl. It has the Super Bowl logo, the teams, date, and location. I plan to let him choose a stand or display case for it. 

I have been so excited about this gift since I ordered it. It came in today and as I was looking at it, I got a wave of anxiety. What if he doesn’t like it? It’s technically not something that he can *use*, and after last year I just feel so nervous.

I don’t know what I’m looking for here. Maybe for someone to tell me that it’s a good gift? Or validation that even if he doesn’t like it, it’s not my fault. I just feel so anxious after being disappointed last year. Earlier I was on the verge of calling him and spoiling the gift just to see if he likes it, before he opens it in front of everyone.

"my boyfriend (25m) doesn’t stick up for me (24f)

my boyfriend (25m) and I (24f) love each other very much but there is one key thing that makes me feel like he is not the one for me. His loyalty. I work at a restaurant and my coworkers are assholes. They call me “lady” instead of my name touch me, slap the back of my head, massage my shoulders all without my consent. My boyfriend has recently started working for us and had stood up for me when I got slapped on the back of the head a couple of weeks ago which I did really appreciate. But today that same coworker who slapped me on the back of the head was ranting at me for making such a big deal about it when it happened and poked me in the shoulder while saying it. I yelled at him that he doesn’t know how to respect women and stormed to the back of the restaurant where my boyfriend was peeling potatoes. He heard my shouting and asked what had happened. I told him the full story and while he did hug me and say he was sorry that it had happened he did not go out to my coworker and defend me like he did last time. I asked him why he wasn’t doing anything. He told me he didn’t want to start things back up again and make things tense. I got angry and called him a spineless coward who will bend over no matter how anyone treats his girlfriend. He stormed out the restaurant after I said that. All the meanwhile my coworker was bad mouthing me to the others saying he is touchy with everyone and that i’m too serious to take a joke. My boyfriend is someone who avoids conflict at almost all costs and it genuinely makes me see him as a spineless creature and this lessens almost all my attraction towards him which I know is an awful thing to admit.

"We are in a relationship for more than a month. We perform sexual acts almost every day. She seems more enthusiastic than me. I am shy due to my social anxiety issue. To be honest, I just like to cuddle, nothing more than that. Because, I have been lonely for a long long time. But she gets the wrong idea and starts kissing and being a nice guy I can't say no. Then I perform boob play, fingering and oral sex if she gives me signals. But she almost never wants to touch my penis. She would like me to penetrate her with my penis. But there are some issues from both of us and we can't perform it. She had put my penis into her mouth once and held it using her hand twice to please me, but I was not in the mood then. But what strikes odd to me is, when I lead her hand on my penis to give her signal, she ignores it. Other day, I was performing oral sex and suggested her to do the same to me, but she denied. I don't understand the reason. Is this because she is repulsed by the male genital? But she is a virgin as she claims. Why would she not be interested? Maybe she actually had a boyfriend and she doesn't want to reveal it? I saw she has vaginal boils. I don't know if it is a STI. She is not that expert in sex play. But she is emotionally more matured than me. I don't know if I actually love her, maybe I am just doing it just to satisfy my kink of pleasing her. I shouldn't have let her know my masochism kinks which includes slapping and spitting. That might have contributed to her disliking me. But she never acts like she dislikes me.

"Hi Reddit, just looking for some advice on interpretting my ex gf's behaviours recently.  
  
For background info, we split up 6 months ago after two years together. It was a messy breakup, she moved on quickly with another man, and i was upset and began working on myself and going no contact. Couple months later we saw each other again and slept with each other breifly before I then initated another period of no contact moving foward for 3 months.  
  
Fast foward to a month ago. I had her blocked on all social media as well as phone number, I have met other women and dated around, and have now improved my mental health, physical appearance and have moved on from breakup, though I still hear through friends she is sort of depressed and now addicted to weed and alcohal while away at school.  
  
After awhile of no contact (she was blocked and I did not reach out) I began receiving calls from a burner instagram account? Turns out it was her, this was her only way of physically contacting me. I answered and we spoke for about a half hour catching up, being very friendly and laughing. I then ended the call. For the next week I got a call every 48 hours on the instagram account, and we spoke breifly over and over again, always her initiating.  
  
I then realized my feelings were flooding back, and decided it would be healthy to block the burner account and yet again start no contact. While this was fine for me about 2 weeks later I started recieving no caller Id calls. I finally picked one up it was her, she told me she missed me and it still felt like we were together, she asked when im coming home from school (back to our hometown) and i told her.  
  
Now 2 days ago, I went to the bar she works at with her friends for my friends birthday. He suggested the bar and I knew she worked there but based on our recent friendly convos i assumed this would be ok. We said hello, had a couple friendly conversations in person while she was working and I went home.  
  
Yesterday I get a no caller Id message. It's her. She is crying. She says she talked to her mom and is distraught and needs to move on. She says it feels like I am trying to manipulate her. Her friends keep brining me up and my gym progress, she sees me all happy at the bar without her, and us talking has made her go crazy. She is now yelling at me saying it needs to be over and she needs to finally be free of me. To which i reply, she has initiated contact every single time over the last two month, and I thought we could see each other at her bar because we are on good terms. She then cut me off and continued to yell, if you ever come to the bar we will kick you out and ban you.  
  
Today, I wake up with two missed calls from a no caller id number, obviously her, and I did not pick up nor call back. I am so confused. Mutual friends say she has lost it and is obssessed with me, but yet she claims she never wants to talk or see me again? I am confused. Deep down I still care about her and long for feeling love again. How do I continue to move on in a healthy fashion as I have?

"Bit of a weird one tbh, my partner never had a serious relationship and she usually just ended up in ""situationships"" + hooks ups / flings. Which is cool with me and I never really felt any sort of jealousy. Everyone has a past and that's okay with me..I am old enough to be mature about things.My partner slept with around 15 people before we met and I slept with 3 (we talked about our experiences at the beginning of the relationship).

I noticed recently (by watching a film actually) that I get this trigger when I hear people talk about hooking up / flings etc. I get this feeling of ""did I miss out?"" or ""Should I have done more of that?""it's a little annoying because I am in a stable relationship, I do love my partner a lot and we are proper soulmates, so getting those thoughts and triggers is just a bit confusing.

It's weird because, people would be jealous of their partner doing all that, however, with me I feel like this is some sort of competition? I feel like if I did the same thing as her (before our relationship) I wouldn't get those thoughts.

Overall, this doesn't bother me on a daily basis, it only triggers if I hear people speak about hooking up etc. I don't project things either, when I get those triggers I just keep it inside because for me it's a little embarrassing to feel this way. I wouldn't be able to talk about that with her because she might think that ""I want to hook up"" all of a sudden with other women, which isn't the case.

I just get these weird competitive thoughts of wanting to do the same before our relationship. Our relationship isn't competitive at all, we vibe and it's the best relationship ever. I just wanted to ask on how to maybe heal these triggers. How to get over this and move on? I want to have distance towards this subject but for some reason it triggers my emotions.

I tend to think along these lines:""oh you had a lot of fun, did I miss out on the fun? why didn't I have this sort of fun, what if I did the same?""

"So I (18F) been dating my bf(19M) for 2 years. He’s so sweet, respectful and over all just an amazing person. 
We were friends for a year before dating and his personality really has nothing to do with the attraction problem, which kinda makes me feel even more shallow and worse about it. When we first started dating he didn’t do much with his appearance which didn’t bother me in the slightest, I knew what I was getting into lol. But about 7 months into the relationship he started making small changes. He worked out more, took care of his eating, skincare, shaved. But the biggest change was his hair, he got a perm which suited him extremely well. Something that made me even more attracted to him, and now I kinda have a thing for curly hair because of him. But after another 6 months he had slowly been stopping with all the changes. 

And the working out and eating wasn’t to big of a deal, I mean I’m no slim supermodel by any means either lol. But he didn’t take care of his skin as much and stopped shaving as regularly (honestly he has a patchy beard and it doesn’t look good). And he grew out his hair and now it’s down to his shoulders and it kinda looks like a bad wolfcut - a style I honestly don’t like on guys in general. And that mixed with not shaving and his clothing choices kinda makes him look homeless (best word I could use, sorry if I offended anyone).

Once again this is pretty much what he looked like before we started dating difference is he has longer hair. But I think my standards went up as he slowly put more effort in, made changes I liked but now he just looks completely different. I don’t wanna make him change but I’m also no longer attracted to him with the lack of effort. I truly do love him, he’s my best friend and he makes me feel so safe and loved. I just don’t know how to handle the change in lifestyle and appearance. 
Idk if this is something I should bring up, if I should wait for him to make some new changes, maybe encourage him to do things differently?

"First of all, im completing my degree and recently I was asked out by a guy, an Indian, who is a different ethnicity than me in college. After some time, he took me out on a date, we studied at the library together, and he walked me to my dorm after studying several times. Honestly, I'm starting to like him. Now, during break, I went home after finals, but my mom has noticed I have been texting a lot and asked who it is. I  told her it is a guy. Afterwards, I can tell she has not been happy. She questioned me and asked ""How many people on campus thinks i am pretty?"" ""Why did he approach me?"" ""Do you think he is serious"" ""Why you?"" etc. She even went into a rabbit hole online to search all the negatives about indian culture and how he could just be ""pretending"". 

Her comments and thoughts has definitely plagued my thoughts about the relationship and myself. Sometimes, in moments of silence between my boyfriend and I, I go into a whole spiral thinking the worst might happen ie he might not text me back, he's texting other girls etc. Also, this is not the first time this has happened. Before when I was little, she broke up a relationship between my cousins (who are girls) and their boyfriends. 

There are even times when I am texting him, she tells me to stop. It is to the point where I am scared to even text or call him at home. I am even thinking of ending the relationship.

Afterwards she was still being romantic and kissing me, when we spent time afterwards shopping she was acting as her normal self, talking and laughing.

"He's on a trip currently. I don't expect constant communication or even a conversation, and I want him to enjoy his time.

We spoke on the phone at night and I got a weird vibe so after we got off the phone, I asked him if he's upset with me. He didn't respond, so I figured he went to bed. The next day, I didn't hear from him until about 9pm that night, but he posted twice on his story during the day. I spent the entire day thinking he might actually be upset with me. 

When I asked him about it, he said he didn't check his messages all day. I said he posted on Instagram, and I messaged him on Instagram, so how hard would it have been to swipe on the screen and see my message? 

I feel like I'm not really a priority for him if he could go all day without thinking to message me or check it I had messaged him.

I only ever message once or twice a day, and I don't expect or enjoy being in a constant conversation over messages. But, it feels nice to know he's thinking of me and I don't think one message is too much of an inconvenience. 

I did offer to stop messaging in the future and just call when we both get the chance, to save me the stress of waiting all day to hear back from him despite knowing that he is active on his phone.

"A little bit of context, I’ve been at my job for about almost two years and she had recently started a couple months ago. We have different job titles so we would interact at work but not as much just enough to say hi and what not. I thought she was really pretty did my thing and asked for her number, she agreed and started texting although I must mention right after that I went on vacation and didn’t text her for like 3 days not because I didn’t want to or any particular reason I was just busy. When I get back to work she starts asking me why I haven’t been texting her I told her I was busy and I was unable to see whether she believed me or not. 
For the first couple of weeks she’s urgently asking me to hang out, would reply to my messages quick, and would ask me to call her every night. Everything was going smoothly we would hang out have a couple of drinks and go home I lived about 45 minutes from work so most times than not I would have to leave pretty early. One night about 2 weeks ago I ask her to hang out but this time I wanted it to be different I wanted us to have fun without having to drink so she agreed we hung out it looked like she was having fun or i don’t know if she was faking it and the reason I say that is because everything changed after that night. She eventually started telling me she couldn’t hang out because she had plans. Stopped asking me to call and stopped at texting me every single day after work we get off at 7pm. 
The next day she would act like nothing happened, eventually one day her car had broken down and asked me to take her home so I did so I asked her about the change during that trip and she told me she liked me and that at times she would simply forget to text back but that she would work on it. To this day nothing has changed and I’m becoming frustrated because i don’t know if I should just move on? (Note: I don’t know if this is allowed but we never had any sexual relations.

"I met a guy over the summer. Our relationship started off strictly platonic. We have great conversations and whenever we spend time with each other, it’s always a good time. As we gotten closer and spent more time with one another, attraction and feelings came into play. I realized my attraction for him as I laid my head across his chest with his arms wrapped around me as I listened to the rhythm of his heartbeat. 


He has a girlfriend and their relationship is an open one. He shared that with me the first time we talked.  I’ve met her. She is a very sweet. 

Last night, he and I decided to take that leap and have sex together. In middle of us sexing, he stopped and told me he couldn’t continue because having sex with someone outside of his girlfriend didn’t sit right with him. Immediately broke down and began crying. I was shattered. I felt rejected. He is the first person I actually felt something for since my breakup 3 years ago. He’s the first person in 3 years I gave my body to. I feel completely foolish for having opening my heart to someone who already has someone they want to spend their life with.

He began to tear and reassured me that I did nothing wrong. He told me he appreciated me for having being vulnerable with him and sharing my body with him and he isn’t taking that moment for granted, but he didn’t have the heart to go on.

"Yesterday my bf and I were having a conversation about penis size and intercourse. He has a penis on the slightly bigger size but not extremely large. When we first started having sex after meeting, I bled after intercourse quite frequently (it stopped eventually and I got it checked out by a doctor). He mentioned that he felt like it was a slight flex at times, like it’s a sign that his penis was big. I mentioned that may have been caused by lack of lubrication during sex, and it’s a good sign that I stopped bleeding because you don’t want your delicate parts to bleed (even if they’re resilient!). Then he said he recently started not fingering me before sex and only focuses on foreplay on the clitoris (e.g., with his tongue) - and since he made this change, it feels “different” for him during sex. I asked what he meant by different and he said that it feels tighter, and he prefers it that way.

This left me feeling weird, like he’s focused more on his own pleasure and it felt like I wasn’t good enough for him to have sex with me when I was fully aroused (which IMO is the only way people should be having sex). Previously, he has said on multiple occasions that sex with me is the best sex he’s ever had. We are only 5 months or so into being in a relationship, and he said this in the first few months of being together. I have heard from most of my partners in the past that I have a fairly tight feel, so was a bit taken aback. Of course, people can have their own preferences and feelings can evolve, but being told this after he told me that we have the best sex ever felt weird, like it stung.

He said sex is still good, but now I’m feeling a little inadequate. I guess what I would’ve liked to hear is something like “even if it feels less tight when I finger you, sex with you is amazing and it’s important for me to make sure you’re fully aroused.” Now I’m feeling like he somehow doesn’t enjoy having sex with me as much and, in turn, I’m dreading having sex with him when I’m going to be in my head about it.

"I’ve been with my (31f) for 4 months. We met on a dating app, and were pretty much immediately exclusive and official since we met (with him driving those conversations). He lives 1.5 hours away but has been staying with me in my house for long periods of time looking for a job in my area. For background, I was in a 9-year relationship and got cheated on (by a 34 yo with an 18 yo) and this is my first real relationship since. Got into a “exclusive but no labels” situation for two months in between and have been on lots of dates but that’s it.

He hasn’t been in a relationship in 6 years. He struggled with addiction but went to rehab and has been clean for 2. He had a serious gf who suddenly ended it 6 years ago and didn’t date while using.

To today’s point: I argue with him quite a bit because I believe sleep has become his new addiction. He frequently sleeps until 2pm+ unless I wake him up (and even that is met with a lot of resistance.) It was especially frustrating for a while while he was job hunting, and I was working hard (I work remotely making 6 figures) and he was just sleeping literally all day and night…There have been times he’s tried to bail on plans cause he “doesn’t feel well” but really just wants to keep sleeping. It takes a lot of back and forth and walking on eggshells to get him to actually do things and it makes me feel really sad and lonely. I believe he loves me like he says but I also want someone to be excited to go out and explore and do things with me... I started keeping track of his sleep schedule when it’s extreme like that, or if he tries to bail, since I’m a very data-driven person and I thought seeing it laid out would be a wake up call but he just says I look crazy.

He has a regular doctor who gave him hydroxyzine which I’ve been on myself for anxiety and it’s not working. He suffers from depression and is on multiple medications for it (I have cyclothymia so I’m sympathetic to depressive episodes to an extent but I also refuse to let it affect my life negatively). Nothing is changing the behavior!!

Well he finally got a job last Friday in his field, with great hours (rather than overnights or 5am shifts) at a local company. It was the job we both wanted for him out of all the jobs he applied for. Everything was going great, he was getting up and going (he’ll be getting his own place as soon as he saves up and is established) and I have been packing lunches and making dinner every day to make the transition easier. 

I understand he’s probably exhausted since it starts at 7:30am, that’s early even for me, but he also just doesn’t seem super affectionate lately either. Im worried it’s from me “nagging” him about the sleep, and it’s putting fears in my  head that he could already be cheating since he’s on his phone a lot (I know that’s logically on me and my past but sometimes the anxiety is overwhelming.) When I ask if something’s up (never cheating accusations, just general concern about change in behavior towards me), he reassures me he loves me and he’s just tired from work and didn’t realize it was affecting me and says he’ll try harder. It just hurts that I’m putting in so much effort and he just…doesn’t. I pay for almost everything because I understand he doesn’t have a lot of money yet and I’m happy to do that because gift giving is one of my love languages but sometimes the discrepancy is a bit too blatant.

That brings us to today - he overslept. Five days into the job. The alarm went off and he just ignored it. My alarm went off an hour later and I noticed he was still here so I was like ???! Why aren’t you at work?? He said it’s nbd, he just wanted to sleep in, but I saw his boss texted him asking where he is. By some miracle he’s still employed, but when I tried to talk about it this evening he insisted it’s not a big deal, I’m high-strung, and his environment is more relaxed than mine. When I pointed out that when he lied to his boss that his alarm never went off, he’s basically acknowledging that it ISNT relaxed otherwise he would have been comfortable telling the truth, he just repeated it’s not a big deal. He said he’s never been fired from a job before.

I think deep down I’m worried I’m wasting my time, and that this might not be the person for me. I KNOW as I’m doing it the constant challenging of his behavior isn’t doing me favors, but at the same time I just want reassurance I’m not being taken advantage of and that he does actually have a good work ethic and was just a bit down on his luck for a while.

Am I destroying this relationship by constantly staying on top of him, or am I correctly reading the signs here? Or maybe a blend of both? I’m in a tough spot right now because he just got a job here so I’d feel bad just ending it but if I’m being taken advantage of…

"My boyfriend and I (f), have been dating for 3 years. In general, we have a great, healthy relationship. I’m not breaking up with him, so if that’s your advice don’t bother. I also know he’s not cheating on me.

The issue I’ve been having (if you can even call it that), is that over the past two years our sex life has drastically decreased. Two years ago he got a new job, which obviously meant he’s more tired, which I could understand. So around that time our sex life took a dip, but it was still decent and I could deal with it. 

The past year it’s been decreasing a lot more, to the point where we have sex around once a month, if that. If I initiate sex he’s generally keen, but I feel like I’m always the one initiating, and even when he does it’s because I really have to tease him into it (don’t know if that makes sense, lol). He does make an effort when we do have sex, but it’s getting to the point of actually having sex that’s the issue I suppose. 

I’m just tired of having to take the initiative and at this stage I’m starting to feel unattractive and as if he’s uninterested in me. I know this isn’t true, and it’s in my head, because he still puts in effort with cuddling, hugging etc., but I’m an over-thinker and it’s wearing on me.

I struggle with communication, but I’ve really been trying to be more open this year, so I guess the advice I want is how do I bring it up and what do I say without being accusatory.

"So in this instance I realize I’ve been a bad friend so I already know this and I feel guilty. This is solely to ask for advice on what I should do next 

So my friend who i’ll call Jade (fake name) and I were part of a club on our campus. She would come around and eventually she joined and I took her under my wing along with another girl (Celeste, also fake name) who happened to join that same semester.

I ended up having a closer relationship with the second girl even though both I considered my “kids” since they joined the club after me. Despite that I would still hang out with both as a group whenever I could. At meetings we’d all sit together and go to campus events together. It was fun. Celeste and I would end up hanging out more because Jade would be busy or wouldn’t want to go to certain stuff with us like parties. 

That was last semester and this semester has been way busier. I got an apartment in the same complex as Celeste, I got a new job, and a new romantic partner, on top of my club obligations I had. It was getting harder to hang out with Jade since our free time never really aligned. I also began to feel like we actually didn’t have as much as I thought in common, when we did hang out. It became more of her initiating hang outs more than me. 

Jade had a huge fight with our club organizers where basically she was either going to have to quit or get officially kicked out. Celeste and I were there for when she needed but it was pretty clear to both of us that she was trying to scorch earth when a lot of what got her in trouble ended up being her own fault. One of the last times I hung out with her I told her this and she agreed with me, although will still mad at our club organizers and seemed bitter about it. Since then, we haven’t seen Jade much at all since she doesn’t come around to the club anymore, and with finals i’ve basically been trying to lock in. 

Recently I got a message from her, basically saying not to reach out at all unless I’m ready to be her friend again. This felt like a wake up call and I even noticed she blocked me. I’ve been so busy with college life stuff I didn’t realize how badly our friendship had suffered.

I (18F) have been with my boyfriend(19M) for nearly a year, and before that we were best friends for about 6 months, and friends for a few years before that. 

Whilst we were best friends he would constantly brag about his sex life and previous partners and it wouldn’t bother me but I was a virgin before we got together so I didn’t know really anything about it apart from what i’d seen online, which I knew wasn’t an accurate representation of what would actually happen. 

So when we got together, to start with he was more forward sexually, and would “touch me” and try and get me off, but I found it just painful and uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all, I tried to express this at the time to him as he seemed to be very rough, and tried to go through with him what I thought I liked personally and how we could both improve and make it a more enjoyable experience. 

It seems to have effected his self esteem as recently when we have been having sex, he’s just been lying there whilst i do everything, which i don’t have a problem with every now and then, but constantly it can get tiring and not enjoyable for me as im just always doing things to him, and I don’t find actual sex enjoyable.

months after he confessed for the first time, he brought up his feelings again and i rejected him - again. same thing again months later. he confessed his feelings for me 4-5 times, but only after i have talked about mine. i would mention how i have crushes on fictional characters and joke about failed relationships in the past, which then he would always tell me he had feelings for me and wanted to be in a relationship.

"I have a long history of ignoring red flags and engaging in really fucked up, toxic relationships. I just started a new relationship now and it seems to me like it's the best I've had so far. I don't feel that weird bad gut feeling that I usually felt and ignored with some previous boyfriends but, given my history, I'm really afraid I'm missing on something or that my judgement is just really bad. I made a list of his good and bad aspects and I'd love to hear your opinions on that.

I was the most honest I could on creating this list:

Good aspects

* I feel really at ease with him and don't feel like I have to be constantly justifying his actions or the relationship itself for myself.
* Treats people, animals and children really well.
* Doesn’t say mean things about others.
* Has never been disrespectful to me (or to anyone, as far as I know).
* Truthfully apologizes when he does something wrong and doesn’t create excuses.- Pays a lot of attention to what I say, remembers most of it.
* Is extremely chill, we can have a good laugh even when things don't go as planned.
* Is very easy and fun to have a conversation with.
* Is very adventurous and meets my rhythm on that (always up for the things I suggest).
* Truthful and loyal.
* Extremely loving and really willing to make an effort to be with me.
* Very hard-working.
* Gets really excited about my accomplishments, roots for me.
* Understands and respects what’s important to me, even if it’s not important for him.
* Good with money (always pays his share immediately, never forces or even asks me to pay for anything for him).
* Always keeps his promises (not only for me but for others as well).
* Isn't jealous.
* Had a very reasonable take on every complicated emotional situation I presented him with.

Not ideal/bad aspects

* Tends to make big promises really quick, I don’t know how much is because he means or wants to to them or because he’s a people pleaser.
* Is a little slow.
* There’s a bit of a cultural gap between us.
* Is 3.5 years younger than me (it's my first time dating someone younger than me and that worries me a bit for some reason, even though the age gap isn't that big).
* Is a little accommodated, not very curious or ambitious.
* Doesn't have any sort of hobbies or try to learn new abilities.

"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years and living together for 1 year. We live together in a 40m² apartment and we usually get along fine. But Ive had this feeling for many months now that i need more space for myself. IMO we spend too much time together.

I never get to be completely alone at home since she has no hobbies or interests. Ive made many efforts to set her up with friends of mine and suggested many hobbies. But she doesnt seem to be interested, just finds excuses. It seems to me like she completely relies on me for any activities in her life outside of work. 

Ive expressed to her that i want more time with us apart and she didnt take it too well. She will complain about how i ""dont want to hang out with her"" etc.

I dont feel excited to see her after work and sometimes just wished that she wouldnt be home.

"My dad tends to be really insensitive and apathetic in conversations with me and my mom. When I try to talk about something I learned that interested me, or something positive that happened, he just says ""good"" with no emotion and changes the subject. I notice he is way more engaged in conversation with my brother since they are in the same career field. He almost never cares to listen about my day. He'll do things like ask me the same question 5 times in one night because he doesn't process what I say and not even acknowledge that he's asked it before.  

I told him that  I am being considered for a promotion to manager and he just said a flat 'good' and immediately started talking to my brother. I was upset and tried to explain to him why it was hurtful. In response, he said it was my fault because I didn't give him context. But when my brother had the same news a few months back, he was overjoyed, laughing. smiling, reminiscing about when he started his career, etc. I do have a lot of resentment over hurtful things he has told me over the past several years.

My mom got upset at his response and started telling him I was very hurt and wanted an apology. I lost my temper and brought up a time that he negatively compared me to my brother (saying that my brother is not an idiot like I am) and he first denied saying that at all, then switched to saying that he said it because I didn't understand a basic concept everyone should. 

He then asked if I wanted him to jump off the balcony (my later mom said he uses this line in arguments frequently) and I said if he genuinely doesn't understand why I want him to apologize, then yes. 

We ended up apologizing to each other and tried to laugh things off, but went to bed immediately after and the next morning he was very distant and emotionless. My mom told me that she understands why I was so angry but to be nice to him since he's under a lot of stress at work now. 

I've apologized to him before when this and always try to have an open discussion, but he never opens up and instead deflects and things go back to normal shortly, but I can tell he is hurt.

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I’m really struggling. My (F22) boyfriend (M20) was diagnosed with depression this summer and at the time he started taking anti depressants and things were getting better. But he didn’t like being on meds so he stopped taking them and now things are as bad as they were before. He is having suicidal thoughts and he refuses to see a therapist. He relies on me to help him because his parents aren’t very supportive but I’m struggling to do this alone. I feel selfish to even feel that way but it’s taking a toll on my mental health and I don’t know how long I can take this. I feel like things won’t get better if he doesn’t get therapy but he thinks that it won’t help. I’m constantly afraid that he’s going to hurt himself. I also feel like I’m dating two different people : when he’s happy he’s the best boyfriend but when he’s sad he is tough with me. I love him very much but I’m been thinking of breaking with him for a while because of how much it’s hurting me. But I know that if I break up with him I will be heartbroken and he will have no one and I will be afraid of him hurting himself. I’m seeing a therapist myself to deal with this situation but I don’t know what do. I feel like I’m stuck in an impossible situation. I’m a bit desperate and looking for any advice or if anyone has ever been in this situation. Do I try to get him to see a therapist and how ?

"Not just “other attractive” women, not “as attractive as” me. But more attractive than me. And he’s saying it doesn’t take a whole lot for that to occur, in fact it happens pretty frequently. We have been together 2.5 years. Really healthy relationship in all aspects other than communication about sexual interest, communication about sex, attraction. Those are the pitfalls of the relationship. Everything else, even including the sex itself is great. However, to have a thriving sex life wasnt for without me begging him to open up to me, connect with me, do what he wants with me, etc. 

There was a lot of doubt in my mind shortly after we started dating if he even wanted a sexual relationship with me. There wasn’t a lot of initiation on his part in the beginning, and if there was, it felt on routine… not necessarily because he felt urges for me or desire, or spur of the moment “must have you.” 
Through multiple conversations about what do you like what are you into, it became clear there are specific features he’s rather into that, even at my best, I’m simply just not built that way. I am very very petite in weight, I have decent sized breasts for my light weight, not too many curves elsewhere, 5’7”. Even worse, it has become clear through conversation with him that in addition to me not having the build or shape that gets him going or that catches his eye, I’ve become even smaller than when we first started dating (stress at work, medications, etc). I’m not skin and bones… but people often comment about how small I am. 

This has evidently deterred any feelings he might have had merely about my looks since we initially met. He has made it very clear his type is “small, blonde, petit but nice curves in the right places.” Through some conversations what he shares somewhat ends up becoming, “you fit that mold close enough” and it’s like he had settled for my looks to have everything else that’s good. Of course I love that he loves me for more than my looks… that is important. 

But this is what bothers me. For everything that he is able to describe as liking about my looks now, there is always a reminder “it took me time to notice this looked good on you” or “I’ve had the time to come to appreciate this about you.” Whereas for plenty of other women, it could be a second and a half glance, and he feels excited, even if for a fleeting moment. 

Through our most recent conversation about this, it ended up being someone could have literally even slightly better anything, and he would be more attracted to them. Slightly better chest (not breasts, specifically chest think area above breast’s, collar bone, yadda yadda) …. They’re better looking than me. Slightly better hips… they’re better than me. Slightly better ass… doesn’t even have to be amazing, so long as it is a little more than mine…. Better than me. 

As we’re talking he validated that yes, indeed if any of these things look even slightly different than how I look now, they’re better looking to him than me. It hurts I suppose that I’m not even towards the top of what he finds attractive. It’s not anything like…. “Well it doesn’t get much better than you’re XXX” nothing. Nothing about me approaches what would look really good to him. 

He accidentally admitted through both an example and then a brief anecdotal story during our last conversation that he often checks other women out. Well duh…. Of course men check out other  women. But the frequency and ease of his capacity to find these people more attractive than me concerned me. Basically, if they’re a woman, and they would fall into the ballpark of what he finds attractive…. He is going to find them better looking than me. It’s like I’m at the bottom of what would be considered attractive… 

I feel embarrassed. 
I feel like I have been so open and vulnerable with this person, as I should be in a healthy relationship. And yet…. I feel I’ve been lead on to believe my boyfriend admires everything about me…. Not that it would take time for him to start to consider if I even measure up to other people who are winning in a particular category. I feel like I’ve been lead on to believe that nothing could come close to me.. sure, I could’ve picked up on the lack of compliments or endearing statements about my appearance, unless they were prompted. But it is a nice thought that maybe the person who is asking you to be exclusive to them and is claiming they want to be exclusive to you, maybe had even an ounce of feeling like “of course there are other attractive women out there… but not a whole lot comes close to what I have” 

That’s apparently not the case for how he feels about me. At all. And it really feels like I’ve walked into a room with a ton of people, and they all know something about me that I don’t. 

I feel lost, and embarrassed. And just really unsure. 
Also, he’s totally annoyed when I let on even a little bit that this makes me uncomfortable. 
I think I am just really lost… 

I’m curious to hear literally any thoughts on this. More specifically… men…. For the men who are in living healthy relationships with women you truly find attractive.. how often are you finding that women are more attractive to you than your own partner? Not just seeing other attractive women, but how often is it that they’re more so to you? Similarly… does it take much for you to feel more about another’s looks? Is it like finding the diamond in the rough to view them as “more”?

"I met my bf about 2 years ago, when he was 3 months out of an unhappy engagement with another woman that he broke off. He &amp; his ex lived together right away, got engaged after a few months, shared a dog, and had each other's names tattooed. Pretty much all in right away. After they broke up, she moved out of the house they shared and he stayed living there. As soon as I met him, we started spending a lot of time together and became official after a few months of seeing each other. We have amazing chemistry, both physically &amp; emotionally unlike anything else I've ever felt.  Everything was pretty much perfect, until six months in I had to beg him to cover up her name that was tattooed on him, because I resented seeing it daily. It still bothers me a lot that he didn't do it on his own accord. His ex left a lot of personal belongings in their house &amp; my bf never threw them away, even after I asked him many times to do so because it made me feel insecure finding them. Each time I'd find something of hers, I'd point it out to him and ask him to throw it away, oftentimes leading to a fight about why he hadn't done so already. Eventually, I started throwing things away myself &amp; pretending nothing had happened. Typically items like mail, photos, jewelry, clothing, etc. After we were together about a year, I discovered that my bf still had the wedding ring that his ex had bought for him to wear and I lost it. I told him how hurtful it was to me that he kept it and he swore that he had forgotten about it all together. I demanded that he throw it away, and he obliged, even though I again resented that I had to ask. He is a very disorganized person so I truly believed that he didn't know that he still had it. A few months ago, we made the decision to move in together and even though I was thrilled, I knew it would mean moving into the house that he shared with her. Moving into my place wasn't an option as I had a tiny apartment &amp; his house is rent controlled, meaning it would be significantly more expensive for us to move somewhere new. I accepted this until it came time to clear space for my belongings, upon which I discovered even more of his ex fiancé's items that he had still yet to get rid of, leading to a fight. At this point, she hasn't lived in his house for years but still gets mail delivered here. I can hardly check the mail without coming across something with her name on it &amp; getting triggered. Everything else about our relationship is amazing, he is truly the most kind &amp; caring partner and maintains that he wants to be with me forever and yet it seems like I can't escape his past.

However, recently, things took a turn when he expressed a desire for us to have more common ground. I attempted to join a DND campaign in the past, but my busy schedule made it hard to commit, and I found myself easily distracted and uninvolved during the game.

He suggested I join as an occasional NPC player, which I'm okay with, but I wonder if he secretly wishes I'd fully engage and commit to the game.

"Alright everyone here we go.

So in 2021, I dated this guy in college for around 6 months. A pretty short lived relationship all things considered, but definitely my most significant because we had been really close friends for about 3 years before we started dating. While we were together, he introduced me to his home friends, and one of them (lets call him R) and I got along pretty well. R was kind of awkward and weird at the time, and sometimes he would do/say things that came across as just mildly flirty. Of course I never cheated or did anything to warrant or reciprocate that attention, and I made my boyfriend at the time aware immediately. He didn’t seem to think much of it, but we did start having this running joke that if we ever broke up, it would take R two minutes to make a move on me.

Well we broke up. And of course, nothing happened between me and R. I was so in love with my ex, I was unable to feel that way about anyone at the time. After the breakup, most of his friends still stayed friends with me and were pretty supportive of my “side” of things. I talked to R for a bit after the breakup and he was really encouraging and sweet. It helped.

Fast forward to two years later, and now I would consider us pretty close friends. Our friendship now has nothing to do with my ex, it’s more of an origin story than anything else. We talk almost every day, though it’s online because he lives in a different state ~300 miles away. We’ve only seen each other in person a handful of times, and all of them were when me and his friend were still dating. A couple of months ago, we had made plans on the phone (while I was slightly drunk) for me to visit him in his city for a weekend. Drunk me thought that was a fantastic idea and looked up the flights and booked right away.

The trip happened a couple of weeks ago, and completely changed how I view R. First of all, the dude has had a MAJOR glowup in the past couple of years. While nothing explicitly happened, the sexual tension was palpable and I felt as though he was being so flirty with me the whole weekend. He was constantly touching me (e.g. brushing my shoulder/arm, piggyback ride, reaching inside my jacket pocket to hold my hand, etc.) and complementing me. I read it all as very flirty and I was definitely leaning into it. The most explicit thing that happened was that after a night of drinking, I fell asleep on R’s bed and he carried me back to the couch and gave me a kiss on the forehead, which I reciprocated with a kiss on the cheek when he put me down.

After the weekend, I talked to him and basically said I kind of had a crush on him and I was leaning into it because I thought we were having a moment, but wasn’t sure how he felt and I never want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Apparently, I dreamt the forehead kiss but the cheek kiss was real. Well anyway, he got back to me and said we were fine and he also thought we had a moment but was (paraphrasing but he did make this list in this order): 1) unsure of what I was feeling, 2) struggling with the fact that I dated his best friend, and 3) still has feeling for his ex. We’ve agreed to be friends and have continued to talk every day and whatnot, but I kind of feel like a bad person. I think I’m having real feelings for him and I’m just really not sure what to do.

Then there was a situation with another guy. It wasn't really cheating, but we had our discussion with that. ( she attached to him really fast as a
""friend"" and cried her eyes out to me when he didn't want to be friends with her anymore, even though they were friends for like a week?? It was also obvious that he wanted her but she didn't listen to me or believed it because he had a girltriend, even though EVERYONE would have seen what he was up to- she still thought he only wanted to be friends with her. She explained her crying that she gets attached to people extremely fast, I mean I kind of believe that because she got attached to me really fast too. but in a romantic way).

 After all, I set my boundaries and told her what requirements she should meet to continue the relationship with me, because I mentioned a breakup there too, because of some things she also hide from me with that guy friend (those suspicious compliments that clearly stated he wanted her. Her explanation for that: She thought that I would hate her for this (?)).

She agreed with that requirements and I could see that she really tried.

But then I have tested her with a fake account to see if she would cheat, and she replied to my DM from the fake account with ""yes, I am single"" and even sent a pic of her when I asked.

When I immediately confronted her, she told me things like ""I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT WAS YOU"" and ""| WANTED TO TEST YOUUU"", ""IT WAS A TEST"" (she spammed me those messages on sms because I already blocked her on WhatsApp, Instagram etc.).

As I said, I immediately blocked her everywhere after I sent her the breaking up message without letting her talk, because in this moment, it was clear for me.

I know I could be the asshole too because I tested her, but because of that situation with her ""ex-guy friend"" I didn't really trusted her anymore. One time, when she was able to check my phone, I was not allowed at all to check hers, so I had extreme trust issues. 

Also sometimes when we wanted to have a phone call, she let me wait really long and didn't call me at all ( sometimes there wasn't even an apologise or didn't even mention that she is gone).
Meanwhile her snapscore went up, so it was obvious she was on her phone.

I just can't believe that she would ever cheat on me you know? She is the last person I would ever expect it from and now I feel extremely bad, because she is also in a deep depressed state and kind of want her back really bad. But at the same time, I believe that her mental health doesn't justify her action, you know?

Please be brutally honest guys and give me advice on what to do. Should I take her back or leave it like that?

Sorry for the weird structure btw, but I'm desperate.

"My gf loves dogs and values the idea of having one in the future because, ""she wants our kids to grow up with a dog."" She made it clear when I was first pursuing her that in the future she would want a dog eventually. My response to this was along the lines of ""that should be fine"" (she knows that I'm not the biggest dog fan) On my end, I have not been quite fond of dogs as I do not have much experience with them. However, since she has a dog I figured that I would kind of get over my dislike of them as time went on. I find them cute, happy and loyal but I cannot seem to get over their smell, how loud they are, and the responsibility. In essence the pros don't outweigh the cons for me compared to something like a cat. 

We have now been dating for over a year and things have been great and we have experienced a lot of new and great things together. I also love her very much (she is my world). Anything dog related comes up regarding the future, I would state how I would want my future dog to act, these would derive from learning from the mistakes of her family's training of theirs. For example: no feeding the dog when we are eating, no dog in my bed, training them to relieve themselves in like a litter box (or something) if they cannot get outside. 

I'm not sure if I have some sort of mental disorder but I seem to have a fear of germs. So this means that a dog licking me makes me uncomfortable. (I mean a human licking me would make me uncomfortable and they brush their teeth) The thought of having an animal that doesn't shower, and wear shoes outside on my bed that I don't even enter with my outside clothes doesn't sit well with me. 

Anyways, this brings us to the incident: after a great day her dog comes up to us in the washroom and decided shake him self off (he was outside not log ago, I associated it with ridding himself of dirt and debris) my instinctual reaction was to step backward a little to which my gf explained that I should have ""gotten over it by now."" This hurt me as I feel like its not my choice that I reacted this way and I found it insensitive. I explain this to her and she begins to convince herself that I am putting my foot down about getting a dog in the future even though there were no ultimatums mentioned. She gets emotional and says that she feels betrayed so I apologize for making her feel that way and I ask her to forgive me for my tendencies. She goes to assume that I have been misleading her for the duration of our relationship and that ""I should have told her in the beginning"" and begins to mutter and reflect on how long we have been dating saying that I have wasted her time. 

This is very hurtful to hear, I understand that she feels betrayed but hearing that this value of hers (the concept of owning a dog in the future) is more valuable to her than I am leads me to believe that I am not as important as I thought and she doesn't love me as much as I would expect.

This leads me to ask what love is. I was under the impression that, ""I don't care where I'm going, as long as its with you"" was the definition of love that couples share (this is my first relationship) ",I (25M) believe that I value my (25F) gf tremendously more than she does I.

I (31F) have been together with my bf (38M) for 5 years. 
When we had been dating for 6 months, I discovered that he lived with his x/gf. He left her and I stayed. We moved in together 6 months after that, and all was good. For a while. But for the last 4 years it has been very up and down. His love and attention for me, compliments and such decreased a lot. S*x was amazing at first, but when we moved in together he got kinda self centered and stopped going down on me on a regular basis. 
In the spring we decided to move apart, and continue to be a couple. He bought a house that he is renovating, so he has been staying with me for the most time, when he is not working. He work 24/h shifts. 
Shortly after moving apart I discovered that he had an affair with a coworker, and that they had been sleeping together at the job and meeting in hotels. When I found out, they were not longer seeing each other and he promised me, that he wanted me and we decided to work on things. 
I have had a hard time trusting him and we have been fighting a lot. 

For the last month I have had a gut feeling of something.. Off. 
He was here on Tuesday and I waited for him to fall asleep, so I could check his phone. 
And my gut feeling was correct. He now has an affair with another co worker. They have just been kissing and texting. He speaks of me as his x girlfriend, and say we are not together and he really likes her. I can see that he has been texting her before and after he and I slept together. It makes me sick. He is love bombing her, the exact same way as he did to me. 
After they kissed she feels bad and guilty.. Because she is engaged and PREGANT with her fiance. My boyfriend wrote her, that he can be a part of that, and it is not a problem. 
He doesn't want kids - besides his stepdaughter, who is my daughter. I haven't confronted him with my knowledge. We are supposed to celebrate Christmas with his family and my daughter. I don't want to ruin Christmas for her, but looking at him makes me sad and sick to my stomach. 
I want the breakup to be gentle for my child. Her bio dad is not a part of her life. 
She is attached to my bf but he has never been very parenting of her, as I have been the one doing all of the practical stuff. 

How do I confront him, what do I say? 

Should I contact her and tell her the ugly truth? That I infact I am (was) his girlfriend and that he is repeating his toxic pattern.. And that she should run and focus on her baby on the way? Or do I just not say anything? I'm kinda afraid of what my bf will do, if I do so..

Tldr: My boyfriend is cheating with his pregnant coworker, he doesn't know, that I know. Should I wait till after Christmas to confront him, for the sake of my child? And how do I confront him?

"So me and my boyfriend have been dating for a year and a half now and everything is going pretty well. However. He has some cleaning habits that drive me absolutely nuts. 

I like my place relatively tidy, I’m not the best at putting clothes away in a time i would like, but I have lists of cleaning tasks i get done on a weekly, monthly, and seasonal basis to make sure I’m taking good care of myself and my environment. My boyfriend not so much. We currently live in separate apartments, and lately when I’ve gone over to stay at his place it has been really getting to me. 

He smokes weed pretty regularly which doesn’t bother me, but this means that all the dust that his gathered on his walls, ceiling, and literal mats on his fan blades is coated in a thick gray color, making it look even worse. I like to take care of my skin and when i used his bathroom last night i literally wiped it down with cleaner and toilet paper because the sink was scattered with ash and resin and i did not want to put my skincare or toothbrush on it. The toilet and shower are also in the same questionable shape. He also has two cats, and one will pee on his clothes that he leaves near the door, which are left there for like days sometimes weeks at a time. His clothes are also ALWAYS in massive piles all over the floor. 

Now to explain a little bit of his side, he skates every day, sometimes twice. We’re pretty sure he has hyperhydrosis because when he does any intense physical activity he can literally wring a concerning amount of sweat from his clothes and it will be constantly dripping off his body, so this means he goes through a LOT of clothing. He has also been in therapy for several months now to help with some insecurities that he has in our relationship and other self esteem problems and is on lexapro which has really helped him a lot. On top of that, his mom was pretty hard on him as a kid and when they had cleaning days in the house, she had them cleaning everything to the point where he cried, so I have really tried to be patient with this issue. I’ve offered to do a big clean for him just so he can have it to a point where he feels like it’s manageable, but he always declines because he says it makes him feel even worse, because he knows he should be doing it himself. 

But it just seems like i’ve gotten to a point where I feel I need to say something because it’s giving me a gross factor every time I go over now. It’s also just genuinely concerning to me that he’s okay with living like that.

"Advice for how to handle my (21M) first date with (21F)

I could really use advice on how to approach this situation, it’s really beating me up. In the below situation does it look like I did anything wrong?

Anyways I (21m) had a really good first date with this one girl (21F). It lasted about 24 hours, since she convinced me to sleep with her on the first date even tho I was pretty heavily reluctant. It was definitely enjoyable for both of us and I felt like we clicked. Overall, I really thought we clicked but when I hit her up later that night to say I enjoyed the date she was very withdrawn. Eventually she ended up canceling the second date we had a few hours before it was supposed to happen for a medical reason. Anyways, we agreed to reschedule and that is her up later that week but I said we’d probably be better off waiting until finals were over (they ended this week) and she agreed. 

Anyways, I hit a new mental low during that week and up through finals and really didn’t want to add anything to my plate, especially considering I didn’t know how she felt anymore. I ended up messaging her the day after my final exam (this Tuesday), being completely honest about not knowing if she wanted space and that I myself wasn’t in the best head space and to my surprise I think I’m being ghosted. 

Honestly I’m just looking for some quick thoughts on what to do, or how to approach the situation; maybe even what I could have done wrong because it feels like I did something wrong in some way and it’s kind eating at me. All help is appreciated

Hi guys new here, I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice, I'll keep as short as I can.

I've been with my Gf 3 years now and since the beginning the sex wasn't great, it's not that it's bad but she is just very conservative where as I'm the total opposite. She tick all the other boxes and is an amazing human being.

Now I've always said sex isn't the most important thing but even since the beginning of our relationship we only ever used to have sex 1time a month if that.

I've tried to talk to her about it on multiple times buy once she hears something she doesn't like she says she's done talking and we can never have a adult conversation.

 I've basically told her that after Christmas(I don't want to ruin Christmas) we need to have a talk. Where I'm going to express how I feel. 

Now I'm a guy that gets female attention, not trying to toot my own horn, just wanted to state this. 

What I'm trying to say is I feel like there is more to life and the passion from out relationship is missing( it wasn't really there) I basically feel bad for sometimes feeling like I need to move on when I have someone so amazing at my side where everything is great but sex sucks. 

Am I giving to much importance to sex? Or should I follow the feeling of connecting sexually  with a partner? 

This is the internal battle I've been going through.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months now, and we argued a lot in the beginning. The relationship has progressed but I'm not sure how to move forward. 

Cons - I asked him to use a condom when we had sex, and he said ok but kept on trying without it. When wanted to have sex but I wasn't in the mood and said no, he got out of my bed and left. I confronted him about it and he said he felt rejected because his love language is physical touch. 

Whenever I bought food, it's shared between us, I'd put the plate in the middle or put it onto 2 separate plates. However, whenever he paid for food, he would not consider what I wanted and put the food plate in front of him and eat from it like it was his plate. 

He made promises about letting me set up his apartment to make me feel comfortable but when it happened, he hesitated. 

Whenever I told him how I felt, he would be silent or if I showed I was upset, he let me be upset until I came to talk to him about it. 

We have had many discussions about the above issue and after a few months, he made some improvements. He brought me to the restaurants I wanted to go to and was more considerate of sharing food. He accepts it when I'm not in the mood for sex. He takes care of me when I'm sick and spends lots of time with me. 

However, yesterday we had an argument. I told him I wanted more attention and he called me and gave me some attention. But then he seemed uninterested and unengaged. Then he went on to run some errands knowing that I was sad/upset. He saw that but didn't check on how I felt, until an hour later. I responded briefly and didn't want to answer his messages. He didn't ask what was wrong but let it drag on for hours. Then he came to my house uninvited and I asked why he came, he said he wanted to spend the night with me. We slept until this morning when he asked what was wrong and I didn't answer him. He got up and left.

I feel like he's a selfish person. Even though he changed after our fights and made me feel loved, sometimes his toxic traits still show. Whenever that happens, I feel extremely hurt for days because he made me fall for him.

"Dating for just over a year. This is probably a classic case of anxious-avoidant partnership. I say probably bc, other than what I'm about to write about, my partner is very emotionally aware, open, and expressive - a quality not common with avoidant attachment and one I highly value about him.

Basically, when an issue comes up, I try to talk to my boyfriend about it, but I'm usually met with radio silence - sometimes for days. In turn, I usually go down an anxious spiral that ends with me breaking up with him - all before he responds to the original text; I acknowledge that this isn't healthy.

The past few days have been rough between us. Last night, we got into a disagreement in-person, and I texted him later that night breaking up with him. Come 3:30 today, and I haven't heard anything from him. So, I texted him this: ""Open to talking if you'd like, but I will be blocking your number after tmr bc l'd like to start moving on. Your aptitude for silence and avoidance has always been difficult to deal w but I'm taking it as confirmation that I've made the right decision.""

I then called him, and he surprisingly answered (he usually doesn't when he's doing the silent treatment). I asked him if he thinks we should break up... he said he doesn't know, but he thinks I shouldn't block him and ""close the door like that."" I said that that was only serving him, and I prefer to come to a consensus (regardless of what it is) as opposed to sitting in uncertainty and limbo. He responded that sitting with your feelings can be insightful and isn't a bad thing. I asked if we could compromise, since he prefers to ""sit"" indefinitely while I prefer to figure things out immediately. He, again, ""didn't know.""

And that was the end of the conversation. Once again, I'm left waiting in limbo. I'm feeling anxious, annoyed, and disempowered, which makes me tempted to end the relationship for the sake of having some semblance of control.

Other than this difference in communication styles, we get along great and he treats me amazing. I truly don't want to break up.

How do I empower myself to better navigate this dynamic?

TL;DR: In a year-long relationship, facing challenges with a potential anxious-avoidant dynamic. Communication issues lead to radio silence from my bf and an anxious spiral from me, often resulting in me initiating breakups. After a recent disagreement, I texted him about breaking up and plan to block his number. He answered my phone call, and when asked if he thinks we should break up, he ""didn't know."" I'm left in limbo, feeling anxious and disempowered, contemplating ending the relationship for control. Despite communication differences, I value the relationship and seek advice on empowering myself to navigate this dynamic more effectively.","I (23F) like to solve issues immediately, but my boyfriend (30M) prefers a... slower (?) approach.",18nxbre,1703192771.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nxbre/i_23f_like_to_solve_issues_immediately_but_my/,
"I posted this last night and since thinking a lot about it today, I am wondering if just being straightforward would be wise or if it would backfire and put too much pressure on him. I feel like it’s tacky just to straight up tell him I want a ring but I’m reading that a lot of people are recommending to just come out and ask. Based on my post below, should I just hold off and be patient, see where it goes in the next year or so? When he asks me what I want for such and such holiday, is it in bad taste to ask for one? Sorry for posting again, I just have this follow up question to see what is best/acceptable.

Post: We have been together 5 years, both have young children from a previous marriage. We don’t live together but have concrete plans of buying a home in a town we both want to end up retiring in. Currently we live about 50 miles apart but see each other frequently. Our kids and families have all been meshed together and everyone is happy.

Although we’ve spoken about the future, marriage has not come up as in the beginning of our relationship, we both sort of mentioned in passing that it was not really important since we were both married before and it didn’t work out. Since 5 years have passed though, we know we are spending our lives together and have established a plan of where we are going to live, including all of the details once our kids are older.

I am still not set of marriage and feel indifferent, however I’m not completely opposed either. As of late though, I’ve developed this desire to at least have a ring- engagement or not (without a proposal), just another form of commitment that I can wear and have it a part of me every day. I’m not wanting anything extravagant and not one of those girls who will ask him to take me shopping and I would choose exactly what I want. 

His friend just got engaged and he told me about it and he mentioned she had a large diamond. He asked me how much I think it cost and I looked up something similar and that sort of brought up a conversation. I told him a few of the rings online were beautiful and I would be ecstatic if I had something even half that size. Then he asked me what type of style I like (round, square, etc.). After I told him I love the round cuts, he asked “what size diamond do you think you’d like?” Then I continued to look and show him a few and he said “I’ll keep that in mind.”

Is that something that guys will just usually say, just to go with the flow of the conversation, or does this mean he may be thinking about in the distant future? I’m not one to strait up ask and badger him so I thought I would ask here. He does know I love absolutely love one because I did tell him I would be so happy to have it one day and joked that I would probably faint lol.","(46F) (41M) Straight up ask BF for a ring, or is that a bad move?",18nxagf,1703192675.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nxagf/46f_41m_straight_up_ask_bf_for_a_ring_or_is_that/,
"I'm(30F) looking for advice because I realized I am starting to feel a little burnt out in my personal life. Recently my fiancé (29M) got a new network engineering job that he was really excited about. We had a rough summer and he told me it was because his old job was stressing him out. At his old job, he had a lot on his plate and did not like the company culture as they were implementing the rule of 40. I think he also didn't find his projects interesting anymore. During this time I was putting more effort into taking care of the dog and everyday chores like dishes and cleaning. He also stopped going to the gym and I could tell he was not in a great place. It got to a point where he started seeing a therapist to deal with his stress management and that was really positive. This is what lead him to look for a new job and also admit he needed to do more around the house. He also stopped stressing me out by taking about moving to Colorado. 

At this new company, he is the first in his position as the company is moving from startup to established. This could be a role that can lead to management opportunities for him. There was supposedly work- life balance. He is also making more money and likes the mission. I was so excited for this role as well! However at this new job he is working more than he was at the old job (10-12 hours a day). Right now he is working on his day off which is also his birthday. He has already has had to travel to three sites in different parts of the country in less than a month. He is remote, but needs to travel to setup the corporate WiFi in places. 

I work full-time and go into the office 2x a week. It is a job I work 40 hours a week and I would say it is great work life balance. As a result I know I have to step up and do more around the house because of his schedule. I have been getting frustrated with him saying that he is going to clean the house and then not doing it because of work or that he's tired from work. If I'm going to do the majority of the chores, I rather do it on my schedule and not after he doesn't do something he told me he would do. Would be fair to ask him to do the trash and leave the rest of the chores up to me? Also is there a way to encourage better balance at work? Could he start his day a little later or at least take more breaks? I would like to go in dates again! Right now the place is not as clean as it should be. He feels guilty and like he is not pulling his weight.  Him saying this while the situation doesn't change is frustrating me. Any advice on how to navigate living with a partner with a busy schedule would be appreciated.

I really want to make this work, but it seems like a really long wait until he can settle down, and even once he does, 30% of his income seems like a big amount if we ever get married.

I know finance isn't everything to a relationship, but I feel like he won't be able to provide the financial stability I need and contribute to our potential family as he will be late in starting his career and will be giving up a chucnk of his income.

I’m a hopeless romantic I love gift giving and surprises and small cute gestures to let me know you’re thinking of me so i didn’t like that idea but he’s never been the kind of guy to be that romantic so I gave him some options and was jokingly stating a promise ring, he kept dodging this so I got serious and asked I’m ready and we’ve been dating for a while(note we’ve known each other for a year and a half in total) and he said “we’re still young and have our whole life ahead of us” this comment threw me off a bit and I commented that concern when we just changed the conversation.

"Me and my S/O don’t really discuss sex or sex toys. I accidentally left my vibrator on the side of the sink(was going to wash it) and he saw it. That night he  was fine but next morning he was pretty upset and wouldn’t talk to me. I figure he was late for work or stressed. He gets home again is still mad about something, refused to eat dinner(he doesn’t eat at work so is always starving when he gets home) and he worked more when he got home. I asked 3x what was wrong and he wouldn’t answer. 

I fell asleep watching tv and awoke to him asleep on the other couch his phones plugged into an outlet nearby which signified he wasn’t planning on coming to bed. I still asked him and he told me he was staying there. Next morning he’s acting the same. We live a few hours from our hometown were coming home that night to celebrate my birthday, a Christmas party and Christmas. He gets home and is very upset/angry but still wouldn’t talk to me. I’m still unaware of what he’s upset about but can only assume it’s the vibrator. He still won’t respond about what he’s upset about. 

After like 2 hours he snaps out of it and tells me there’s no use being angry so he won’t be. He’s done a complete 180 but I’m really bothered by his silent treatment for 2.5 days and not telling me what’s the matter.

"TL;DR: My husband's stepmother insulted his family and tore strips off his brother-in-law, reducing him to tears. Should I maintain a relationship with her?

My husband \[28M\] (Jack) is not in contact with his mother \[60F\] because she is toxic as hell. His younger sister \[25F\] (Beth) is not in contact with her either but his eldest sister \[30F\] (Laura) is, but the relationship is stilted and dysfunctional - they do not get on well and Laura agrees that their mother is toxic.

Jack's parents divorced when he was very young and both remarried. His dad remarried when he was 12 - his stepmother \[60F\] (Wendy) had a child of her own from her first marriage (Haley \[31F\]). Over the years, it has been made clear that Wendy does not want to play a motherly role to Jack, Beth or Laura but my husband's father \[60M\] (Alex) plays a fatherly role to Haley. Jack, Beth and Laura have been encouraged to send Haley birthday and Christmas cards and to maintain contact through letters but have only met her in person very rarely. I have never met Haley. Jack, Beth and Laura are not allowed to spend special occasions with Alex because Alex spends them with Wendy and Haley - and they cannot join. 

Recently, Laura's husband \[32M\] (David) sent an email to a large group of their friends and relatives to see whether they were available over the Christmas period and when to try and organise visits. Both have busy jobs and their main time off is over Christmas, and their friends have spread across the country, so they tend to do a tour each year ticking off as many as they can. This year, for the first time, David included Haley on the mailing list and she responded that it was kind of them to think of her but she's busy over the Christmas period so cannot meet up.

Subsequently, a few weeks later, Laura was being honoured at a ceremony and invited Alex and Wendy to join - and they said that they would try but couldn't commit. Beth is not very organised (very much a free spirit) and doesn't stay in touch much - she is actively not in contact with Alex and Wendy after an argument a few years ago but is on good but infrequent terms with Laura and David. Laura and David, at short notice, met with Beth the day of the ceremony for lunch and then invited Beth to join at the ceremony - she accepted. Alex and Wendy then said, with an hour's notice, they would also be attending so Laura said that to Beth and Beth said she was still happy to attend and would be civil for Laura's sake. Laura, at this point, is really worried that something may kick-off between Beth and Wendy.

Anyway, as they're all seated (with Laura separated and backstage), Wendy pulls aside David and tells him to never contact Haley again, telling him that ""Laura's family are toxic"". The berating goes on for some time and David slips out and is in tears. Laura cannot find him at an intermission in the ceremony and no one knows where he has gone. Eventually she finds him and he says he'll discuss the issue with her after because he knows the award is more important - she initially thinks there has been an issue between Beth/Wendy. At the end of the ceremony, he briefly explains to Laura what happened and the conversation between Wendy and David was also overheard by Beth and by a friend of Laura's. 

David and Laura are both still very upset and spoke to Alex to say that they aren't currently comfortable having a relationship with Wendy. Alex told them that they must have a relationship with Wendy if they are going to have a relationship with him. We were all (Wendy, Alex, Laura, David, Jack and I) due to meet up over the Christmas period and now Laura and David have been uninvited. I feel very reluctant to go. In my view (and in the culture that I was raised) family are family - and who is considered to be ""family"" is broadly applied. I feel that Wendy and Alex were in the wrong and that Laura and David were not so that we shouldn't be supporting Wendy/Alex by meeting up with them when Laura/David have been excluded.

On the other hand, it's not my family, it's Jack's and I don't want to cause a wedge between him and anyone else or discourage any relationship. I know it isn't my place to push my culture onto his family dynamic and I don't want to cause animosity for Jack by him stepping into an argument that isn't his. Having said that, they said Laura's family are toxic and that would surely extend to Jack, to me and to our children?

Should I meet up with Alex/Wendy over Christmas or should I skip out on the invite? If I don't go, should I say why or stay silent? Should I encourage Jack not to go?

"So, me and this girl met at my friends’ engagement dinner around October of this year. Walking into the venue, I immediately caught her glance — she was sitting at the end of the bar with her newly-wed sister. We hardly spoke but we exchanged a lot of eye contact. 

I couldn’t quite read her, she had one of those genial expressions on her face — I had no idea whether she was inviting me in for conversation, or just naturally had that look to her. She was super attractive, I thought. 

After the dinner, we would all go out to this club — we were a pretty large group so we split several taxis and were on our way to the destination. I told my friend (the groom) that I thought she was pretty. He turned to me and gave me this frown of approval — I’m not sure if it somehow it made it down the grapevine later that night but the moment we arrived she was closer to me, almost hugging up on me and i’d always catch her stare in my peripheral. 

Fast forward 2 months later, out of nowhere she’s just added me on Instagram and Snapchat. We have another big gathering with the same group of people next week, and she’s messaged me privately saying she wants to get to know me that night. 


If I’m being honest, I’ve always avoided relationships and get sickly nervous every time someone’s attracted to me — I don’t know what it is about me. I’ve never been in a serious relationship because of it, I want a partner but my brain does everything in its power to stray far away from it when the opportunity presents itself.

My cousin has been like my big brother all my life but recently he has been acting in a way I don’t like so I have been calling him out. 

I had noticed that whenever we are around women he behaves differently. 

I had a better upbringing than him financially because my parents lived abroad but they left me in Africa with his family. He lives in Spain now and I live in Germany. As we got older he told me how envious he was me when we were children. In front of some new girls He told them that when I was a kid he was  so envious that he made me drink kerosine in the hopes that I would die. I actually did drink kerosine as a child but no one in my family seems to know how I actually ingested it. I found his comment to be oddly specific. I told him that whether what he said was true or not it wasn’t cool and he said he was joking. This was the first strike. 

Second strike was that he kept slapping the back of my head in front of women when I would make jokes. I’m usually a chill guy but It got to a point where I had to shout at him to stop. I felt like he was trying to ‘lil bro’ me. 

The final straw for me was when he spoke to my girlfriend on the car loudspeaker for the first time and he told her that he loves to hear her voice. I just thought this was crossing a line and he said he was only being polite and that I should know he has no ill intention because I’ve known him for so long. The truth is I don’t really trust him. 

I came back home to Africa this month and I told him that I would be coming. Normally he would tell me if he would be coming too and we would meet up however he said nothing. I’ve heard through family that he is also in the country but he hasn’t reached out to me to tell me. 

I find this very sad because I didn’t expect him to act this way and I think that if he has a problem with me he should come and tell me instead of being passive aggressive about it. Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise.

Was it wrong for me to call him out?

"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years.
We live with my parents (we have our own small apartment but it's in the same house as my parents).
My mother and my boyfriend don't get along very well, which ends in him constantly avoiding my family and getting upset about everything.
I talked to him about it because I know my mom can be difficult but at the end of the day she is still my family.  I don't expect him to be with my family all the time, but the fact that he avoids them like the plague hurts me.

My boyfriend and I were sick a few days ago.  I had covid.  He was negative.

I'm now negative again, but because I still had covid until recently, there are a few positive tests in our apartment.

This evening I talked to him about Christmas.  He spends Christmas Eve with his family and I with my family.

But since he lives with me, I told him that we'll probably do a little gift opening with my family when he gets back.
I also told him that if we do it like that, I would like to spend the entire New Year with his family.
While we were talking he took a covid test (he had told me beforehand that he had already done one and that it was negative).

I obviously wasn't watching him do it and suddenly he had a positive test in his hand.

Then he said that opening presents with my family probably won't work now because my family is afraid of Covid.
Afterwards he mumbled to himself that he preferred it that way.

Idk...I've caught him lying about other things in the past.
So it feels strange that he suddenly had a positive test just after I told him that he would probably be spending time with my family.
And also because he had told me shortly before that he had already taken a test that was negative.

But this resulted in her getting really hurt and basically just insulting my entire existence. She insulted my body, my personality, the food I have made for her and even said things about my family.

But yesterday she went out drinking with a friend of hers and this guy knowing that she was emotionally vulnerable and really drunk, took advantage of her and told her stuff like he loves her and how amazing she is etc. This made her feel better and she told me that when he tried to kiss her she kissed him back for maybe 5 seconds and then pulled away. 

She told me about this today begging for forgiveness. Now I know that she loves me a lot and I love her too, and that she will probably never do this again.

"We (19F, 20M) broke up a year ago, and started seeing/talking to other people after ending things. Now, it seems like we’re both missing each other.  

We were together for almost 5 years, and broke up out of FOMO/fear of hurting one another (it was almost entirely mutual. We were both thinking of doing so, but the timing was not great, so I ended up feeling a bit hurt initially). We both ended up talking to and seeing a few different people. Near the end of our relationship, he reconnected with an old friend who ended up introducing him to harmful drugs. I wasn’t aware of this until we ended things, and afterwards he spiralled and fell into a heavy addiction—during this spiral, he hooked up with someone (we live in a small town and these things circulate pretty quickly). His family helped him get back in the right path, and I believe he’s clean again.

He’s tried to reach out a few times, but I haven’t responded—although I’ve missed him dearly once several months of NC had passed and I realized that the connection that we had built is incredibly rare and not something that is shared between most people.

I need advice

I  have been with my Fiancé ) for three years. We met during Covid. He was my first boyfriend. It was long distance to begin with but then his parents kicked him out and he came to stay with me and my family. This was about 7 months in. I’ve been having doubts since but have felt stuck, like I was thrown into this relationship prematurely, like I was already In too deep.

Fast forward to us getting our own place, getting engaged, a dog and now I am pregnant. It wasn’t planned. And now I am having doubts again and I feel awful for it.

He is a nice guy, and I really think he loves me, and I love him. Just somethings worry me. Aside from work all he does is play his pc. I feel I have to ask him to do things around the house all the time to save myself doing it all, and then it isn’t done half well.

I know about weaponised incompetence, and I am honestly not sure if it is that or genuine. I am tired of asking if he did something like the washing up (that I asked to be done while I was working and he was not) only for him to say no he forgot then beat himself up and in turn make me feel guilty for asking at all. 

And now I am worried, being pregnant, that I am still going to have to be the one on top of everything. It feels unfair. I don’t want a life like this forever. 

I don’t know what to say to him to help. I e have him advice, soothed him, babied him, but I can’t now. I am out of answers for him.

How much more kind and understanding he was. That spiraled into me looking at other messages from guys I was talking to before meeting my husband.  I began to feel..sad.

"To start off, I know I’m not innocent or a good person in this situation. I know there’s no excuse for my actions and how shitty they are so do not take me explaining why me and my boyfriend’s relationship is so strained as me making excuses for my actions. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years, we were high school sweethearts and we’ve been on and off the whole time. We’ve broken up more time than I can count. He cheated on me multiple times throughout the relationship with several different women, sometimes even sleeping with me and another woman without a condom in the same day without my knowledge, resulting in me getting BV and yeast infections. I forgave him each time because for a long time he was all I had, I had a lot of issues going on in my family life and personal life and he was always there for me, even if he was not treating me well. And of course I do love him, maybe I’m not in love with him but I love him and I don’t want anything bad to happen to him. Every time we’ve broken up in the past it has resulted in a suicide attempt from him and me needing to call his family, he’s also harmed himself multiple times by throwing himself off of things and cutting himself when i try to end things over the phone or in person. Each time is very scary and each time he makes sure to tell me it’s my fault because I should know better than to leave him. There’s times I wonder if it would just be easier to kill myself because sometimes I wonder if that’s the only way to be free from the relationship without him getting harmed and without having to deal with the months and months of torture I know I would have to endure if we broke up. When we’ve broken up in the past he’s showed up to my house and threatened my family with violence. Hes also showed up to my work place crying. He’s overall not very nice to me, I get screamed at a lot and got called stupid and r*tarded more often than I would like to admit. When I’m out with my friends he calls me 50-60 times and texts me hundreds of times, and he has my location so he’s constantly looking to see where I am and if plans change slightly and I go to a different restaurant or something that I said I was going to he will call me and accuse me of cheating. Lately though I think he’s sensed me pulling away because of what I’m about to mention, and has been very sweet, caring, attentive and basically the perfect boyfriend I could want. But I know it’s only because I’m pulling away. I met the 21 year old guy at a bar and instantly got butterflies in my stomach meeting him for the first time. It felt like a movie, the room stopped and all I could think to myself was “I’m in trouble.” Me and him exchanged numbers, which know is terrible of me but I did it. The next day he asked me when he could see me and we hung out, he took me to dinner and paid for the whole thing, I usually pay for dinner with my boyfriend. And then he made plans for the next date as we were hanging out, then it turned into us hanging out every other day and seeing each other constantly. He was super romantic and swept me off my feet, if I said I was craving something or wanted to go somewhere he would either take me to get the thing i was craving or would take me to the place I wanted to go the very next day. He has tons of friends who all adore him and has introduced me to all of them, and he has met all my friends as well and blends into my friend group perfectly they’re all obsessed with him. I lied to my boyfriend every time I went out saying I was with my mom or my siblings or my friends. I started texting and seeing my boyfriend less and less. This new guy is genuinely one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. He’s caring and attentive and everyone in my life I’ve introduced him to so far loves him, a luxury I do not have with my boyfriend. All my friends and family hate my boyfriend and he is not allowed inside my house or allowed to come to any events or outings, he hasn’t even seen my family in a year. I know it seems obvious to just break up with my boyfriend, and I know how bad of a person I am for cheating on him in every way and basically replacing him with this new guy. I feel guilty for breaking up with him because he is finally trying to get his life together like for example he’s finally getting a job which he didn’t have before. And I don’t want to be the reason he decided to back track on all of that which I know will happen if we break up. And he’s been so sweet lately he keeps saying how now that he’s finally trying that’s when I decide to pull away. I just don’t know what to do, I feel so trapped. This new guy is everything I could have ever dreamed, it’s like I wrote down on a piece of paper my dream boy and he just walked right off the paper. The guilt is eating me alive, I’m so stressed everyday especially now that the relationship with this new guy has gotten physical I feel so terrible. On top of that I haven’t had sex with my boyfriend in over a month where as this new guy it’s become every time I see him.

"Ok here is the deal i don’t want to make this too long and english is not my first language so sorry for that.

 i don’t know if i’m overreacting or what, but I (31M) bought my wife (29F) a gift for her birthday. We have been married for 5 years now and we have a little daughter.

It was a Fendi ring and CH bracelet, both are made of gold finished metals and costed around 600$ ,anyway I bought it from a highly rated third party website, that is known for selling famous luxury brands that are 100%, many people i know also bought from the same website and it was 100% authentic with plated stamp and all of that stuff.

So when the gifts arrived it was shipped with authentic wrapped box and bags, I didn’t open it of course i let her see it for herself, but i noticed that the bracelet gold color is mismatched from the sides, like one side is darker than the other and also it was a bit oversized on my wife hands and it couldn’t fit perfectly. She was upset about the size at first so i told her it’s ok i will return it as they offer a refund or exchange policy. And she can choose whatever she likes.

Her reaction is what really shocked me, as I’m going through a bit of financial problems lately and i saved for this occasion to make her happy, i was looking for that big smile on her face that mean the world to me, but instead she was upset and when I pointed out that it also seems to have manufacturer defect and i would’ve suggested to return it either way so nothing to worry about, then she asked me “where did you buy it from? Was it from the original store or some website?” I told her its was from a known website, then she replied “it looks fake? Are you sure it’s authentic?” I told her yes I’m sure 100%, she said “ Look even the brand paper bag has dents and imprints”

I didn’t know what to reply to her, like seriously?!! So authentic bags doesn’t get dents or what? I was speechless and disappointed 

I told her we can bring to the original store and verify its authenticity.

But I’m sure its authentic. I made a detailed research beforehand and I know what I’m doing.
 
She didn’t stop at that, she said “nobody buys luxury jewellery that are not made of real gold anymore, Why didn’t buy real gold instead of these brands even if its authentic ?”

I just was really disappointed and frustrated because me myself would never doubt the authenticity of any gift I receive, even if i’m sure its fake or i didn’t like i would just be happy that someone took the time and effort to think about me, i would love it no matter what, and would not ever say anything from the things she said to me.

After that I couldn’t help my self but to get mad, I silently left the room kept quiet and now she is asking why I’m mad and not talking, i told her exactly what bothered me, and she responded with “It’s ok you are my husband and i can say whatever and there no boundaries between wife and husband”

I told her there at least should some degree of respect between us, it really hurt my feelings, she told me that she is sorry but it was for my own good and she didn’t want me to get scammed, now she is demanding me to go back to normal me just because she apologise.

me (31m) and my wife (27f) lets call her Jade for the sake of this post.

We’ve been together since 2012, we have 2 little girls together who are both 100% mine. Born in 2013 and 2015. 
In September 2016 My wife went through abit if past natal depression and ended up becoming good friends with a friend of mine, James. James was a nice enough guy. Didn’t work but was always there when you needed him and trustworthy, or so i thought.. 

my wife started going out on long walks with the dog etc and I started to get suspicious when she started becoming super protective over her phone.

She said it was to clear her mind and just have some time alone and away from the kids. Which i completely respected. Then one day she mentioned that James was going with her. I played it cool but my heart was racing with anxiety.

A couple days later i woke up at around 4am and curiosity got the better of me and i noticed she left her phone on charge on the worktop instead of under her pillow like she had been doing the last few weeks.

So i started reading through the messages between them. I found out they had been having an affair behind my back, but the messages clearly stated that they had only kissed/made out and hadn’t had sex etc. i was sat there for 3-4 hours reading through them and screenshotting them to send to myself.

I confronted my wife with the evidence and eventually she broke down and admitted everything. I moved out after having a heated debate with James outside his house at 7am with him refusing to open his front door.

I went to stay at my mums, heart broken thinking i had lost my wife and my kids.

But after only 2-3 hours Jade rang me, crying and asked me to go for a chat. I accepted. She apologised and we made up.

Fast forward to December 2023 and we are still together, married etc and our 2 girls are growing up.

But the whole situation still sometimes plays on my mind? We no longer speak to James since i chased him off but everytime i hear that name i get flashbacks. I trust my wife again. To the point where i never question what shes doing or who she is with. But am i over it? I honestly don’t know.

I wouldn’t have forgiven her if they had sex together. Is kissing cheating? Is it bad i still think about it 7 years later? Please help.",My (27f) Wife cheated on me (31m) 7 years ago.. am i over it?

Hi Reddit,   
  
Currently in a very strange situation. I’ve been in a relationship with G for just over a year, everything has been going good and she’s amazing. However the last month or so i have been having conflicting feelings. Basically i have been having feelings for my Ex K. Recently have been wanting to try get back with her but i have no idea if she would even take me back if I chose that path. I feel horrible because G has never done anything wrong and she’s a wonderful person inside and out.   
  
The only thing i can think of for this train of thought is that with K we were much more explorative in the bedroom and satisfying each other well. G is great in bed however i just feel that its too vanilla for me. She isn’t into much of the same stuff i like. Again no fault on her end it’s just the way it is. I would never impose anything on her she wouldn’t want to take part in, hence i feel i’m starting to become resentful.   
  
I know i need to have a conversation with G but i feel horrible because I don’t want to hurt her over nothing of her own fault. Its an issue on my side solely and i’m just tearing myself up inside especially at Christmas time….   
  
So reddit, how can i navigate this situation?

"My partner and I play a card game called Magic the gathering from time to time. As she does not really make her own decks we sometimes talk about what she wants to play next. After we have done that I decided to buy her the important stuff of the deck she decided on playing next.   


Her reaction was that she got extremely mad at me for buying her the cards. Claiming that she did not in fact want me to buy them. The cards were about 35€. I am a bit more frugal recently, because I am not making a lot of money at the moment, but I still like to surprise her with something that we can do together as a couple  (playing the game with her new cards).   


This is not the first time this has happened although she has never been this mad before. The first time this happened I bought her a different design (but a similar design)  of a game matt that you can use for the game, because they did not have the one she wanted to before.   


What did I do wrong and where to go next?

"For context me and gf have been together for 10 months as of today. We met at work and we hung out and slowly worked our way into a committed relationship. We don’t fight and if one has issues we seem to come to some sort of understanding most of the time. There are issues I haven’t voiced my concerns on but am planning to soon.

Point of this post however is that she for the past month or so has been getting more and more into god and religion. I’ve never really been a Christian I prayed at the dinner table with everyone else but I’ve never really cared for god or being religious to any degree. She texted me today saying she wants to start being a better person and building her relationship with god which is fine by me go you but she also said she wants to now wait till marriage. She then said after her text “Does this change anything for you?” I said “I mean yeah kinda it’s pretty major and it’s outta left field” she then said “ I mean I don’t want to do anything sexual, you can do what you want” We just had a talk over the phone as I was writing this, I asked about it and she seemed to say it the same way that she doesn’t want to do anything sexual due to her recovered relationship with god. I ended up saying over the phone I’d have to think about it here I am texting you guys and I kinda hinted torwards the fact that I’m not ok with it. Also she said after I hinted towards my answer that she didn’t mean it that way and that she was just asking on my opinion. Was that a mistake on my end or was this also her changing the situation based on my answer? Anyways she seemed to backtrack on her point about sexual activity by saying that she’d change that if I wasn’t ok with it but now I feel like I’m coming between her and god. I don’t care for the big guy and I’m sure he don’t care for me almost like an agreement. HOWEVER I would never step in front of another’s relationship simply out of respect for everyone’s own beliefs. I do love her but this has put quite the strain on my brain. On one hand I in no way want to wait till marriage. On the other hand I don’t want to stand between her that relationship that she is willing to change just because of my answer.

"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.  
I do not have a lot of experience having sex and I think I might be doing something wrong. She is the 2nd person I have ever had sex with in my life. I am very fond of her and do not want to loose her.  
She recently confided that when we have sex, it hurts her too much. She was not a virgin when we started and I am not her first partner, so we find this strange as her former bf did not cause her any pain. she says that she feels that I am going too deep. She is like 5'5"" medium built, I'm 5'11""very skinny.  
We tried again with her on top but so she could control everything, to no avail. She went to the clinic because she thought it might be something wrong with her but the nurse said everything should be ok, stds discarded. She prescribed a cream for her and recommended the use of lube. We have played with a dildo that is about 6"" and that does not seem to bother her. I got tested for std too and came back clear.  
There is long foreplay before any penetration happens. She seems naturally lubed, we add more from the tube, and still she think it hurts. I always start super slow. We have done a few times anal, but now she says she prefers not to be vaginally penetrated. My size is completely average (5.5 in when erect). I do not think that sticking to anal sex is the way to go on the long run.  
There are times where we can have penetrative sex for 10 minutes and there are some other times where she jumps as soon as I put my tip inside.   
I suggested we go to the sex clinic at campus to see a therapist but she refuses.  
I have started avoiding having sex altogether and she feels resentful. Whenever we are having sex I cant stop thinking I might cause her pain. Sometimes I go soft quickly.

"So me and my bf have been dating for a couple months now, but we've been friends for two years. He lives in the UK, and I live in the States, and it's been fine so far. But the problem comes in where I want to join the Army, and he knows this, says it's fine, but doesn't understand what we have to sacrifice to keep the relationship. He doesn't have anyone who's been in the service that's affected his life, while my family has three active duty members at any given time. The military is pretty much a part of our family, and I was going to join next. The job I want will require me to be away for nearly 6 months, and in dividing up the remaining time between my U.S. Family and him, I'd only get to be around him for 3 months in total, a quarter of the year, and then the rest of the year I wouldn't be able to contact him. He's a bit clingy, and I know the distance in communication will affect him greatly, but I don't know if breaking up is entirely the solution. I don't want to break his heart, but I want to give him a chance to find other people and not feel tethered to a person who's pretty much Non-existent for an overwhelming half of the year. Another thing I should mention is that I would technically have a ton of things to do if I stayed in the relationship. He's from the UK, and I'm a U.S. Citizen, but that causes problems for my possibilities of getting a Security Clearance for the job I want, and make the process longer.

me and him live about an hour ish apart, and most of the time he’s the one who travels to me on the weekends. I think he’s starting to dislike that he’s the main one traveling back and forth, and truthfully I wouldn’t mind making the trip; it’s not the drive that bothers me. 

he just has an extremely exhausting family. he lives with his parents and two brothers (both also in 20s); and they are all very extroverted. they constantly have people visiting, or are out visiting. everytime I visit I feel like I have to visit with /all/ of them. it’s not a big house so there’s no avoiding them. they come to his room to talk to him/ask him stuff. they call him constantly, or they’ll call him to come visit. we’re expected to always eat with them (their meals are also all proper like- I was never taught proper table manors like how to hold a knife and they all knew it and he said his mom gave him a look the first time we ate together…) I just get so burnt out fast and I can’t hide anywhere. they’re mostly nice people, just a lot

it’s basically all that I would expect on holidays but it’s every. single. time. i’m a very shy person, very socially anxious and introverted- my family when he comes are all introverted as well so we’ll chat at most for a few minutes and usually eat just us two and stick to ourselves.

I, 21F, dating my current bf almost 5 months ago. We met on a dating app, but quickly hit it off since we knew of each other’s existence before and we go to the same school. Personality wise, he’s everything I want in a partner. He’s kind, loving, sensitive, and knows how to make me laugh. I don’t doubt that he’s an amazing guy.

"I (19F), have been dating my partner (19NB) for almost 11 months now, and knew each other for a year before we started dating. A little background context is that my partner’s mom is very controlling: What I meant by that is my partner was not allowed to have electronic device when they used to study oversea, and even till now, my partner’s mom supervise every steps of their move, such as wanting to know every location they’re at, or not allowed to leave the house unless it’s with the mom and even scoop around messages when my partner is asleep.

My partner used to date someone in the past and when the mom found out she went online and found the information of the family, which is scary for me.

Usually I would not care about other people’s lifestyle or family matters, but this has greatly impacted my mental health. I am unable to be in peace with the recent incident of my partner’s mother finding out our relationship by scooping around my partner’s phone when they are asleep, and taking a hatred on me for dating her baby child. My partner eventually lied to the mom and said that we broke up, however, the mom still tries to ask about me almost whenever she can and shit talk about me, and to some extent lied about my “rudeness”, stating that I am a bad influence as I did not say hello when I see her, which is untrue as whenever I encounter her, I am with my friends and they can vouch that we said hello together. My partner said the mom probably just did not hear me, although I know I am very soft spoken due to being introverted and socially anxious, I wave when I say hello. It feels like my partner is just constantly finding excuses for their mom. She even supervise the purchase and purchase’s location to make sure me and my partner are actually not together anymore. I feel that I am unable to be at peace being constantly scared of my personal information potentially found and leaked. I’ve tried communicating this with my partner before and my partner always said that’s my mother still what do you want me to do??? All I want was for my partner to set clear boundaries with the parents, but apparently if my partner tries to do it the mom will cry about it and my partner will be all apologetic and back to listening to everything the mom says. And my partner’s dad is all support on the mom, as stated with “happy wife happy life”.

I know that my partner is trying their best to make up for this relationship in other aspect, however all these have been mentally draining to me, as me and my partner have several fight about this, which does not help my depression and anxiety. I am unsure of what to do with this relationship as I still love my partner deeply, however I do not think I can live on with this constant fight that causes me to overthink a lot.

Throughout the years, there's been a back and forth battle where Gabe will block her, disconnect and then feel guilty and let her back into his life for her to inevitably turn on him and abuse him more. Julie's told him things like she wished she never had him (and his sister), go to hell, you're a terrible rotten person, brings up his ex girlfriends from decades ago, literally anything - she'll use as ammo against him. 

The last straw was this past year. At the beginning of the year, we lost our 13yo Labrador after a botched exploratory surgery with a terrible vet. Long story short -It was traumatic, especially how it happened. A month later, Gabe's cousin died, and then a month after that, his dad died. His dad passed away peacefully asleep in the hot tub due to heart issues. Gabe has since inherited some of his dad's funds and this is when it gets gross. 

Julie of course LOATHS her ex husband (Gabe's dad) and at first, sobbed and said she wanted to come to the funeral (even tho she hates him and hasn't had contact with him in 38years and has badmouthed him every day since). But whenever Gabe puts up boundaries like, hey mom - I need some time and space to mourn my dad - she loses her shit because SHE is not the center of attention. 

She started saying things like she was entitled to all ""his riches"" and would ask Gabe to send her money while simultaneously insulting his dead dad and him in the same breath. She got mad one day and told him he was going to end up ""just like your dead dad rotting in the hot tub"". And that our dogs death was all his fault and he ""gutted her like a fish"". I could literally go on for DAYS with the amount of disgusting and toxic abuse she dumps on him. 

***YET*** ...

He sees her for what she is, mentally ill, but I think he still holds onto this person he wishes she was. She is 68 years old, and gets fired from every job or quits because of.. well her personality. She recently got fired from Walgreens and apparently the cops were called on her. She is a miserable insufferable person and her life is her own doing. But my husband is worried she will be old and homeless and alone and he'll send her checks. She'll call him crying begging for money and still turn around and say ""fuck you I don't need your dad's money"" bla bla. And he'll still send her a check. 

So here we are Christmas approaching and hes conflicted about sending Julie money. Just two weeks ago she told Gabe ""he was dead to her"", and don't contact her, get mental help, your a POS etc. 

From my perspective I know he needs to keep ""no contact"" but he is still an abused child at heart and feel this guilt and obligation to his abuser. No one wants their mom to be a homeless old woman, but she makes it impossible to have any relationship at all and she seemingly feels entitled to his money (and his deceased fathers). He asked me tonight if he should send her a check. I told him I didn't know. 

I feel like sending her money always comes at a price. I have even suggested in the past maybe we buy her a trailer or a small mobile home for cheap and she can have house security and he won't have to keep her in his life anymore. It'd be for him, not for her, and give him peace of mind knowing he didn't ""abandon"" his aging (and very abusive narcissistic mentally ill) mother. Part of me wants to be super Zen and say yes, love everyone even your ""enemies"", be good always. Take care of those who cannot care for themselves, she's ill - but the other part of me feels like, um NO SHES ABUSIVE and hurtful and only brings him pain over and over again and only breaks him down as a child and now as a man. And bad behavior should not be rewarded, she is not entitled to his money or attention and he owes her nothing after the lifetime of verbal, physical and mental abuse she's subjected him to. But no one deserves to be old and alone and struggling? Even horrible people? Idk ..

"Me (22M) and - for lack of a better word ‐  possible-bf (23M) have known each other for over three years. We met during Covid, through a gay dating app. For context, I was really struggling with a lot of stuff in life: school, family, mental health, etc. I was fully prepared to end my life in June of 2020, but there were some things I still wanted to do before I died, one of them being lose my virginity. When I messaged him he seem very nice and rather energetic, we connected over our love for anime and video games. It took a few weeks for me to actually meet him because it was my first time hooking-up with someone and I didn't want to accidentally let a psycho into my home. That day I met him everything seemed to be going well, we ordered pizza, watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, and did the deed. He seemed so nice back then and very attentive as well, I think that's when I decided to give life another chance. I instantly had a crush on him and I thought he liked me too; he would sometimes message me saying stuff like ""You hate me"" to which I responded saying that I didn't, that I really enjoy his company. He'd often tease me about my crush on him which I honestly liked too. It got to the point where he would come over whenever my parents weren't around and we'd spend time together, one of those times he's asked me why I like him and I tried to answer honestly, but looking back I must've sounded like an idiot. But despite that he started crying and I held him, I admit it was awkward and I felt guilty for making him cry, but my feelings for him never faded even now. Fast forward a few months and I start playing games online with his friends, they're really nice people, but they would often make jokes that I didn't like. His male cousin would, and still does, often make pedophilia jokes which I don't like, I asked him to stop and even explained the reason why I hate jokes like that. I was SA'd at an early age and ever since then I've felt nothing but disgust for people like my abuser, and the same goes for people who make light of a situation like it. I tried talking to my ""bf"" about it but he didn't really care, I guess he just didn't want to force his cousin into doing something he didn't want to do. Another incident happened when the group was discussing about trauma, everyone's trauma was taken seriously except for mine for some reason. I told them how I had attempted to take my life a handful of times and how I hurt myself as well, I even mentioned my diagnosed depression. What my ""partner"" said next shook me to my core; he said ""just because you tried to kill yourself doesn't mean you have depression."" It hurt so much to hear him say that because he too self-harmed, he even cried into my arms twice by that point, but my situation wasn't bad enough to him and I don't know why.
He's not consistent with his ""love"" either; one moment he'll tease me like he used to and we'll tease each other back and forth, but then he'll say something along the lines of ""okay the joke ended a while ago."" There were multiple times where he told me to just shut up while we were playing games with his friends too, all because I was talking about how I feel. He'd get upset if I left the party early and sleep the rest of the night, he gets upset if I don't want to send him nude pictures of myself, he gets angry if I tell him how I feel down and how he makes me feel sometimes. In November of 2022 I was diagnosed with a rare subtype of liver cancer, 1 in 500 million apparently. Because of this cancer I have a tendency to vomit a lot, no matter what I eat or drink it would not stay down and so I ended up losing a lot of weight. As I started immunotherapy I started getting better and I was able to eat more with the help of medications, all that and I honestly feel like I look way better than I did before. It was a silver lining for me that I could finally fit in a 2XL, but not for him. There are times where he reminds me of how I used to be chubby and how he misses it. He'd even send me pictures I took where I was fatter. I don't like sending him pictures, I've always felt ugly all my life, even more so back when I weighed more, so the fact that he often tells me to gain more weight hurts me so much. 
He's nice yes, but he's also very mean. I sometimes worry about playing games with him because he's a perfectionist and if I don't do something right he just yells at me even though he claims he didn't. I grew up with a father, mother, and brother who would yell at me for any mistake I would make as a kid so I know what angry yelling sounds like. He took me to go see Beyoncé and Doja Cat, I didn't have to pay for my ticket because I don't have a job at the moment, bit after the Beyoncé show I started having a panic attack because it was dark and there were so many people around, people that could potentially hurt us. Whenever I'm having a panic attack I tend to go nonverbal, mostly because it's hard for me to form sentences and I stutter lots. But my panic attacks always make him mad, he thinks I'm upset with him even though I've explained to him that I'm not. I'm scared that I won't make it home even though I finally want to live again, but he doesn't see it that way. I've had many panic attacks, one of tge worst ones was when we went to the state fair and we were having difficulty getting home, I kept asking him how are we going to get home, I guess I got on his nerves because at some point he just stopped talking to me entirely. He didn't tell me the plan at all, I just followed him stressed out of my mind. When I saw him get on a bus I followed, I asked if he knows where the bus is going but he didn't answer, nor the bus after that.
I'm a crybaby, I'm too sensitive, I get emotional easily and that makes him upset. But it also makes me upset when he talks about other guys and how he wants to have sex with them, fictional and celebrity crushes I get but straight up saying that one of his straight friends is so hot that he'd do anything for him while I'm in the party just hurts, especially since I know that if I talked like that about one of my friends or if someone talked like that about me he would get angry. 
I'm not good enough for him and I see that now, he needs someone with tough skin who doesn't freak out at public events, he needs someone who doesn't bother him with their depression or emotions.

She hasn't made any real effort. She was working out on 15min videos on ytube and after a few months of that was the first time she mentioned affirmation to me. She said I didn't notice or compliment so she just quit. The thing is I didn't notice or say anything because it didn't do anything.

"We’ve been married a few years and have a child together. When I came across this by accident, I felt like my world was shattered. I found that she had searched his name, questions like: should I get in touch with him if I miss him and so on.

I asked her about it and she was very apologetic, she said that I wasn’t being a good husband recently and she just felt resentful.

 Keep in mind we had an infant at the time, and I was very busy juggling between work and taking care of the child.

"We started seeing each other 5 years ago but took a year break when he had to move to complete his masters degree. We’re now finally living in the same city again and have been seeing each other for 8 months. He told me right away that he wants exclusivity and does not want me seeing anyone else. 

We go on trips together, cook dinner together, have really great intimacy together, workout together and do lots of relationship things. 

But he has never told me he loves me, has never formally asked me to be his girlfriend and didn’t even get me a Christmas present. I got him a present but just kept it hidden in my bag when I realized he didn’t do anything for me. The things I got him were sentimental and special but I never ended up giving it to him because I was embarrassed. 

He technically hasn’t done anything wrong but I just want someone to reciprocate what I do and offer. I always plan nice things to cook together, plan activities and dates etc. I also do all the driving and I’m starting to feel like I’m maybe being used for rides, fun, sex and companionship.

"I don't know where to start. I've been wanting to post for a while, I don't even know how many times I deleted my drafts.

We've been together for almost a year now, due to some circumstances we moved in together almost immediately. It's been great, we match so well and it really felt like I found my person. However, there is something that is destroying our relationship.

I had a promiscuous past, I slept with 10+ people and most of them happened when I was underage. I am not proud about it, I wish I could take it back. I do not try to hide it though, because I feel that it's not right for the other person and for myself either, I want them to know who I am/was and accept me. 

This is the root of our problem. He just simply cannot accept that. It hurts him. And he hurts me back because of it. He insisted that I should have lied about this and hid it from him. We had multiple arguments about this, some of them were really bad. He went through my phone a few times and tried looking for old conversations with exes. One of them, from 5 years ago, had graphic stuff. 

He insulted me, called me a b*tch and wanted to break up with me multiple times. I don't really respond well to these things, I either fight back or bawl my eyes out. This resulted in me insulting him back, which was not the right move, because it made it seem like it's okay to insult each other. We somehow managed to talk and make up after every single fight, and everytime it's bright and sunny until it's not.

"I don't even know where to begin. We've had a complicated situation for the last year (we split up about 10 months ago and got back together around 4-5 months after that). There was a multidude of reasons for our initial split (I have some other posts about it that give more detail if you really wanted to look) but the main takeaway was it was mutual. 

We tried living together and things were really difficult, but over time things changed and she wanted to give it another shot and work through the issues. I agreed to it and, while still really strained in some ways, it felt comforting to be together again. It felt really great actually. I never stopped loving her, I just didn't think we could be in a relationship anymore, even though that doesn't sound like it makes any sense.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I start feeling really uncomfortable with the relationship again and start being distant. She could clearly tell I was being distant but she was giving me space. I'm completely the person at fault, I'm 1000% the bad partner and I didn't work on myself at all (where as she really put a lot of work in) I let her down and I've toyed with her heart like an absolute monster.

Yesterday, I received a call from my sister-in-law saying that my wife was arrested for theft at a clothing store. I was surprised and didn't believe it initially, but she had gone to pick up our kids who were in the store. My wife chose her sister because she didn't want me to ""see her like that."" I left work and went to the police station. There, I called a lawyer who had helped me in the past and managed to release my wife. In my country, since she had no prior criminal record and the value of what she stole was low, it was relatively easy to do so. But now her reputation is tarnished, and she will have to face legal proceedings, likely resulting in community service or similar penalties.

I asked her why she did it. She said she didn't know, that it was an impulse, that she saw a blouse she liked and couldn't resist. She apologized and said it's been a habit since childhood. I also start to suspect that she might have been responsible for taking some things of mine that disappeared over the years. Things like watches, wallets, money, and other personal items. I never thought it was her, but now I'm not sure.

I currently own a home. I used to have a previous home with an abusive ex and my current home is literally my safe place. I never was in a safe home before where I didn't feel like I'm walking on eggshells so I just don't feel stressed out anymore or scared and just now comfortable.

However, my boyfriends lease is up next month and his roomates (a couple) are moving into another apartment but they want to live alone. He just learned about it last week. He's currently out of the country until a week prior to the lease being up so he doesn't have time to visit apartments other than looking at listings online. We've been together for less than a year and even though I told him I love him and he says he does too but is unable to tell me the words yet. 

We have argued three times in the relationship so far and I've noticed that everytime I push to communicate about it (either suggest to do it in the moment or later) but I've noticed he's always saying that he's okay and nothings wrong but he'll give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment (even if I'm emotional about the situation). He's told me before he'll never tell anyone if he's got an issue with them but he'll make sure to can feel it and then just shrug off the issue with time... so I feel like that's what he's doing with me. 

Mind you that the first time I told him I wasn't ready for him to move in yet was mainly for the fact that I realize it was too soon considering I had told him I loved him and he wasn't ready yet then once he knew about it, he said he does, he just feel too scared saying it so that's why he used that excuse. He knows his timing his supscious but he means it. But to this day, he's still unable to say it.

On one side, my parents are telling me that I shouldn't be in this relationship if I'm not willing for him to move in and that he'll probably eventually tell me he loves me or there's people that just don't way it to each other at all. And that we can keep working on our communication. 

I'm just confused. Anyone has tips? What can be done?

TLDR ; my boyfriend is out of the county and he's coming back a week before his lease's up and he just learned that his roomates are moving out and he can't afford the rent himself. We've been together for less than a year but I still don't feel comfortable with him moving yet since he's unable. I told him a few  months ago that I loved him and he said he wasn't there yet, but when I told him I wasn't ready for him to move in yet (one of the reason was because of this), he then said he does feel the same way but used that excuse cause he was too scared to say it. But he's still unable to say it to this day. Another reason is because Ive noticed a pattern when he's angry, he'll say he's fine but he'll give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment until he's moved on from it (I keep trying over and over to communicate but it's like talking to a wall). I've never had a safe home and now that I own my house, I'm also scared to lose that or having a hard time kicking him out if shit hits the fan.

"I’d like to start by asking that if you’re strongly opposed to monogamy or polyamory, please consider this bias when deciding whether to comment. I respect the merits of both and want advice beyond “x style of relationship is bad.”

When my husband and I first started dating 6 years ago, he made it clear that he was poly and seeing multiple other people of multiple genders. He’s been bi and poly most of his adult life. I’ve never been great at non-monogamous setups, but I was so into him that I wanted to see where it would go. 

We fell hard and fast. The truth is, I still didn’t like being poly. I hated sharing his time and romantic attention, and knowing that others got to know him the way that I did.

Shortly after we became official non-monogamous boyfriends, I didn’t expect to last much longer. About a month or two in, his other relationships started to fade, and eventually he asked if I’d be up for being monogamous. I of course said yes and, trying to be realistic and open-minded, said that we should talk if this feeling ever changes. 

Time went on and he would talk about how poorly the poly relationships in his life had gone.  I mentioned here or there that I didn’t like the idea of seeing other people. It just came up in conversation. About a year into our relationship, it came up again, in a very intangible “Well what if someday I want to be poly again?”

I didn’t really know how to handle the question. I brushed it off and said that we could talk about it if he ever wants to, but also said that at the time I didn’t like the idea and had a hard time talking about a “what-if.”

It came up again just before the pandemic, and I was starting to wear down and considered trying it. Then COVID happened and we went years without talking about it. 

We got married this year, 7 months ago. 

About 2 months ago, he asked me how I felt about opening things up. It did not go well. I cried a lot and was really hurt by the timing for a few reasons, the primary being that we’ve barely been married and now he wants to add other people to the mix. 

We instead worked in our sex life, which was getting stale, partially my fault, and has since improved drastically. 

But opening up just came up again this week. He claims that he feels trapped, and that most of our friends are poly (I don’t think this is true), and that he wants to be able to date and have casual sex. I know that he has crushes on specific friends of ours. 

It’s starting to feel like my only options are to be unhappy by staying and seeing him with other people while we’re together, or to be unhappy by leaving and seeing him with other people anyway. 

We’re in a very tight-knit and interconnected community of friends, and would absolutely still see each other all the time.

There are some things I’m deeply insecure about that aren’t his fault, but I know would be exacerbated by opening up. My body and general appearance, our sex life, whether or not I’m any fun to be around. 

I do a lot to keep us afloat - I make significantly more money (I’m not rich) and handle a lot of the life logistics like planning meals, groceries, vacations, etc. We keep separate bedrooms and I made sure he got the bigger room and nicer bed.

We broke up because we were both unhappy. It has been about a week now and we will have a good day or two before she starts something.

She's miserable, i get it. The situation sucks and she has said shes uncomfortable with me being here. She has gone to the landlord to try and get me removed because i am unemployed (only week 3, 2 interviews already). She has barred me from touching any of her things while sleeping on MY mattress. Its devolved into levels of petty that i didnt think possible.

I brought back extra food from a family christmas, said she could have some. She said ""dont touch my silverware"". She insisted that she send her secret santa gifts by mail instead of letting me take them to christmas. Theyre still sitting on the living room floor.

"So I (18M) am in an increasingly weird situation with a friend/talking stage(?) of mine (18F). What do I do? 

—- this is a very long post, but I think pretty much all of it is needed since it’s a very weird situation.—- 

Some basic backstory, we “dated” a couple years ago, but nothing really ever came of it, we broke up a couple months later and didn’t talk at all until a couple of months ago. I didn’t talk to her because I heard that she didn’t want me to, which was apparently wrong.

 Anyways, she unblocks me on stuff and all that and started trying to have small conversations with me. This was mostly on Snapchat so just like commenting on things like what I was doing or whatever. 

We hung out a lot in some classes we have because of some mutual friends in there. Then about 2 months ago at a Halloween party she was really flirty with me (probably because I wasn’t in my right mind if you get what I mean) and my friends all told me about how she was into me and blah blah blah. 

I ignored them until a friend of mine (who’s a good friend of hers) told me that I should ask her to hangout. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to, but did it anyways and we hung out about a month ago. It was chill, we got dinner, went to her house and cuddled. That’s it. 

A week later (2 weeks ago) I was at a party with some friends and she texted me asking about “us” and “what are we”. I didn’t really respond, and she came and long story short she kissed me and we madeout. However, before she did that, I was again not in the greatest mindset at that party (she was) and when I tried to make a move on her she backed up, so I felt bad and left it. She then started saying stuff like “cmon (my name)” and “I know you can do it (referring to me kissing her)”. However, I didn’t want to mess up as I already assumed she didn’t want me to since I tried before and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Which I think was the right thing to do, but I don’t think she liked that. I also wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss her anyways, but she kissed me so whatever, it is what it is. 

The day after that she went to some mutual friends and called me a “coward” (she called me something else that starts with a p, but I apparently couldn’t write that on here) for not making a move on her, even though I did. Pretty sure she did this to get my attention since she told 2 of my best friends.

Over the next couple weeks we tried to make plans but we both were genuinely busy so they fell through. 

A couple days ago I had a friend of mine over and we were just chilling playing video games when a friend of the girl this is about texted him to have us both go over there. When he asked about it she said ”(girl’s name) says definitely come if you bring (my name)”. And a mutual friend of ours (the one from above who told me to ask her to hangout) texted me saying to “make sure not to be late”. 

So we went and there was a decent amount of people there. Maybe like 10. But we didn’t even talk to them pretty much the whole time. They were playing a tournament style sport that we couldn’t get into since we were late, so we just threw a football around with her and her brother. It was just an awkward group and I don’t think my friend or I were expecting a large get together like this, rather than like just 4 or 5 people.  

—-Some important info for this next part is she has a friend that she’s gotten really close with recently (and honestly he’s really good looking), however he has a girlfriend. He’s actually a really friendly and nice guy from when I’ve interacted with him, but one of my really close friends actually told me about a week ago that he saw her talking to him a lot at a party in a “supposedly” flirty way, but I brushed it off since he has a girlfriend, and my friend isn’t the most reliable source of information especially since he probably was bouncing off the ceiling at that point. And he ended up saying he wasn’t sure what he saw and that he left to early. This guy also doesn’t seem like the kind of person to do that, but I could be wrong. Although I’ve been a bit suspicious of that guy for a while. —-

Anyways, about an hour later some people left, leaving just a few of us including that other guy. We went to like a forest area and just messed around. Eventually my friend and this other girl went off to do whatever they were gonna do leaving 4 of us. The girl I am sort of in a thing with was hanging with the other guy (not in a romantic way at all, but like it was sorta strange) it went on for the whole time. So I was stuck with just her brother who likes me a lot. At this point I thought this whole thing was weird, considering she wanted me there but was hardly talking to me. I was also getting really suspicious of the other guy, despite him having a girlfriend. Her brother even thought it was weird and asked me what was going on/happening between us. 

Anyways I basically just hung out with her brother and my friend who I ended up finding for a bit before we left. He was equally bored and we left as quick as we could. He even said “it would’ve been more fun to stay at my house and play COD”.

The whole thing seemed weird. This girl wanted me there, and then didn’t talk to me. She even got her friends to text me. But then, she just talked to this other guy to the point that I thought it’d be awkward for me to join in. 

My friends are split between thinking she’s intimidated by me or that she’s trying to make me jealous in a really stupid way. I kinda feel frustrated by her antics and don’t know if I even want to continue whatever this is. It seems super stupid and overly confusing, because I know the next time I see her at a party or 1 on 1 (probably New Years) she will be all over me and will probably want to kiss me at midnight knowing her. 

What do I do? I haven’t snapped her or contacted her at all since this happened. I just think it’s weird that she’d want me there and have her friends tell me to come all for her to just not talk to me. My friends think she’s really into me but immature or afraid of something. 

I’m going to have classes/be interacting with her for the next year so I want to be chill about whatever I do, and I am genuinely friends with her at school, that’s where this all started. 

My question is- what do I do ? What does she want/what is she doing? She almost definitely  is into me, but then does dumb stuff like this. And what’s my best course of action?

I (23m) have been in a very good friend group that includes my friend (22f) I can call friend X and bestfriend (22m) I can call friend Y. We have been friends for years throughout college and recently graduated. 

Friend X has slowly started to avoid spending time with me since we graduated in May. I continually ask to hangout and she always says she is busy. She does have a very large friend group and has posts which confirms she is usually doing something. 

It gets very frustrating with the time she makes for friend Y and not me. For example, I asked several times this month to do something together and each time she was busy or said we could if I help her pack to move apartments but she hopefully could in a few weeks. Just 2 days later she asked friend Y to hangout in our shared group chat and I am not certain if I was invited. 

The 1 time I saw her in the last 2 months or so was when she joined my girlfriend and I to a store so she could return some items then had to get back. She has seen friend Y several times within that timeframe. I don’t see what to do about that situation with her? Should I try to keep the friendship going or start to distance myself as well? I don’t believe anyone is “too busy” because they will make time for the people they want to see.

"Annie (24f) and I (24F) have been friends since college, so that's around 7 years, and we share the same friend group. To sum things up, she stopped hanging out with my friend group bc she didn’t like that we brought our bfs to everything. We're 6, and 5 of us have bfs, including her. She didn’t say much, she just stopped hanging out with us, but remained friends with all of us. I realize I was in the wrong too.

At the same time, she became very good friends with people from work, and has a new work best friend. I kind of started feeling jealous, especially because she never attended anything I invited her to, but did go out with work friends.

In my birthday party this year, she came 2 hours late, drunk (she was with work friends), didn’t say hi and left after 30 min without saying goodbye. That made me feel really bad, and I started crying there. She found out and apologized saying she wasn’t changing me, tough it still felt like that. We went for coffee to smooth things out.

Going to the point, I found out that for NY, she’s going on a trip with other friends. We have always spent NY together with my friend group. When we started organizing our trip, she didn’t say she wasn’t going and never told us about this other plan. We found out through other people. That made me feel bad again and upset.

There have been other instances where smth like that has happened. We also don’t spend time together anymore. That hurts me a lot and stresses me. Some of my other friends also feel like that. I’ve been thinking about taking a break from our friendship. I don’t know how to do so though. I don’t think that talking about it would save our friendship at this point. I appreciate our good moments, and I realize I have also made mistakes.

"My girlfriend's family (dating for a year) has a patriarchal world view. Saying ""patriarchaly"" I don't meant they're okay with hurting women or something like that. On the contrary, in their family it is customary to carry women in their arms. Her father (M53) has a big business in the country we live and my girlfriend says if her father likes me he will let me work for him and get good pay.

A couple of days ago she said her parents finally decided they wanted to meet me. Until this day, they ignored me, did not allow me to be at their family holidays and never wished me a happy birthday or X-mas. 

My girlfriend said there a tradition in her family when parents meets with her boyfriends. I asked what's the tradition and her answer made me uncomfortable. She said I would have to kneel in front of her father and take a slap from him. At first I thought she's just joking, but she was extremely serious and kept saying about kneeling and being slapped. She even showed me a recording of her ex following this ""tradition"" to make me take it seriously. In the recording, her father slapped the guy in the face so hard his head jerked to the side, and someone laughed off-screen. She said all her exes took it without any complaint. 

I was terrified. 

I told her it's crazy and she said her father wouldn't accept a man with too big ego and never let disobedient one to work for him. She also mentioned her father slapped her exes when their was screwed up and they are never had any right to defend themselves. 

I really don't want to work for her father and I also don't want to kneel in front of him or have him slap me. But I love his daughter and I want to be with her. 

I also wrote this story in another sub asked if I'm an a-hole because I don't want to be part of these ""traditions"". There they told me I am not. 

But I still have questions 

1. What kind of crazy tradition is it? I've never heard of this one before.

This is a throwaway account because I don’t want her knowing I made a post on this and it’s also my first post and English isn’t easy for me so bear with me. 

So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. During the course of our relationship we of course had a bunch of little fights here and there. Normally we are pretty good with cutting out people we don’t like but this one seems to be an issue. She’s been friends with this guy, let’s call him Alan. Alan has been her friend for 2-3 years and they were somewhat close. During the start of our relationship she would go over to his house and lie about it (I know she wasn’t cheating because I was somewhat close with Alan’s sister so I knew what they where doing) about a month ago she started lying about whenever he would come over and would cancel our plans just to hangout with him. I told her to just tell me when he wanted to come over and if it didn’t mess up our plans I didn’t care though she kept lying about it. After about a month of her just lying to me I told her she needs to cut contact with him because I’m not going to sit here and be lied to. She blocked him on snap chat and I could see that she blocked him. I looked through their chat and she deleted a message upon being confronted about it she said it was just a typo. Earlier this morning I got messaged by one of my friends who have Alan’s location telling me he was at her house. When I called her and confronted her about it she didn’t hide it and I told her that was the last time she’d see him and he needs to leave immediately. I found out from the same friend that he stayed there for an hour more and then left (I was sent screenshot proof) and she wasn’t answering her phone while he was there this morning and told me he left earlier then he did. I have more storys about him if you guys wanna hear more but what do I do from now on? I’ve lost my trust in her but I don’t want to end things with her because I finally feel safe and comfortable whenever I’m around her. So what do I do? Is there a way that I can see her messages?

"We’re both 19 (m/f). We’ve been together for almost 2 years. She’s begun realizing that she’s asexual. We haven’t had sex in the past. She wasn’t ready and at the time it seemed like it was due to trauma, which is what she thought too.

After going to a psychiatrist she started realizing that she is most likely asexual. I’m not, and I don’t know how to adjust to that.

I know that logically this can’t work and it’s best for us to breakup. But I love her so much and she’s been my main source of happiness for so long.

She’s told me that she believes we need to break up because of this, but she can’t bring herself to break it up herself. She doesn’t want to let go of our relationship and I don’t either but we know it can’t work like this. I don’t know how I’m supposed to break up with someone when we both still love each other and we both still want to be together.

"For context, I have been dating my high school boyfriend for around a year now and we haven't had any issues, but now that we have graduated and are on our way to college I feel like maybe I am too ahead in things that he has never even had to think about.

 I come from a difficult environment where my dad hasn't been the best and I've had several situations where I've had to defend myself, especially as a young kid, so I just grew to be a mature kid, in contrast my boyfriend has never had to deal with anything wrong in his life so he is just kind of sheltered and can't approach diffifult situations that he will have to face once he tells his parents that he is gay and has a boyfriend. 

He is a very kind guy with no true meaning of himself and I feel like he is a very very big people pleaser and that has led him to be babied and he has never had to stand up for himself so he isn't good at communicating his feelings like he wants to. He is fully aware that he lives in a bubble because of his monetary status and his lack of issues in life, but to me he also feels like he needs to mature in so many things before we are able to be equals because I often find myself being kind of a teacher to him.

not gonna lie, we are doing SO great so far right now, but there are some problems when it comes in terms of personality and my personal taste on that (from now on i will be referring to her personality only)

"Hey guys,
I decided last christmas to spend this year’s christmas with my gfs family in a different country. I told my parents a year in advance and they seemed okay with it, but now that christmas is just around the corner and we are about to travel to her family, my parents have been acting up. 

They say stuff like “you are too young”, “christmas is supposed to be a family holiday” which are okay, I guess, but they also tell me how dissapointed they are with the situation, that they feel unloved by my gf because she doesnt visit (she was on a different continent for the last 4 months…) and because she doesnt gift them anything or texts them from time to time. I have 5 other siblings in relationships and none of their SOs text my mother or gift her something if they arent spending christmas with them. 

Now I can kind of live with those things and pass them off as my mothers sadness and frustration that I wont be there this year (heat of the moment kinda thing) but she also says stuff like “you are like a slave to your gf” and that she has “complete control over me” and that I supposedly care for her parents more than for them. She even said “… your shitty parents in law…” at some point.

 I dont think she means it that way but it makes me uncomfortable to ever let my gf get close to her again. I love my mom and she loves me and always has, which is why this whole situation is getting under my skin even more…

How can I deal wirh this situation? I usually would tell my gf if something would bother me, but i dont want her to feel bad…

"Good morning everyone. So I do have a situation I’m dealing with for a while my boyfriend 27M and I 31F we are together 17 months and also live in the same apartment. He got a new job 6 months ago, but since then we just have more problems it’s because of his manager 52F or around that age, for some reason I had off feelings about her from day one. Then I started to see she is way too close to him with questionable messages , like ❤️ or babe and stuff like that. She works with her half age of people mostly young guys and she does that yo others too. She calling my boyfriend late nights for some work stuff or just to gossip about someone. I met her on her bday which was places in a restaurant after work hours on Friday evening, next Monday she told my boyfriend she never wanna see me because she just don’t like me. 

We never got why. Since then she is very harsh on him ,means she says he needs to show up on every gathering or trips but without me, means like if they go out drinking to a bar or restaurant after work , or for example they are planning skiing for a weekend but he cannot bring me , she also talks to him vulgar way and there was a situation when she told him to go her place to work together from there when her husband wasn’t home , all the gathering or trips are planned not with the company’s money and only few of them included , just her small team so it’s nothing to do with work. 

Also many times he needs to pay lunch or thank you gifts for her .  I have a voice to it that I don’t like that he said I may insecure but I said no, I just have morals and principals. I wouldn’t put my partner thru this , I would just look for a new job. 

He said he needs to do what she say or she gonna fire him, I’m  from Europe we have different culture , even work events people respect each others partner, families .. I had a talk with him to find a new job , he asking me to try to talk to my boss , I did but I asked him what if they don’t hire you , then he said he needs to stay with this work for a while and do what she says even on weekends and after work hours. I told him it will going to ruin our connection, but he said I should support him how the First Lady supports the president. I’m just feeling overwhelmed and very confusing way.

"Hello all.
We're together for 5.5 years.
Last year she came home with a tattoo. She mentioned that she would like one, I mentioned that I wouldn't like that. One day she just came home with one, yes it is pretty, but that doesn't change the fact that I didn't like she'd get one.

She mentioned here and there that she would like a nipple piercing. I said I wouldn't like that because I like her boobs natural, and I don't want them to be ruined because of a piercing.
Now today she came home with a nipple piercing and I don't know what I should think of it or how I should react properly. I have the feeling things I say don't matter and she just does whatever she wants because it is HER body and not mine. I think we're with 2 in a relationship and my opinion matters as well.

Am I wrong here for thinking my opinion doesn't matter?

"Hi all,

This Christmas, my girlfriend (27F) and myself (28M) are visiting my parents (59M and 58F) and my brother (20M). 

My parents are very right wing and spend too much time listening to Alex Jones et. al, while my girlfriend is pretty center to left. They make racist and anti-LGBT comments in passing, and while I have asked them to tone it down before, it never seems to really stick. We are all white if it matters.

I understand this is how my family is and am not willing to cut contact with them over this. I do love them and I always have fun spending time with them.

At the same time, I wish they were more considerate around guests and could stop with the conspiracy theory bullshit for the couple days we are out there.

I wish they understood how unwelcome it makes my girlfriend feel.

Aside from just not visiting, what can I do to keep the peace and keep things comfortable for my girlfriend?

We are staying at their house this year but I think next year we may get a hotel to distance ourselves from some of it.","Dealing with Racist Parents (59M, 58F) and my SO (27F)",18nubfg,1703184976.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nubfg/dealing_with_racist_parents_59m_58f_and_my_so_27f/,
"We’ve been together 5 years. We have a 2 year old, 9 month old and I am newly pregnant with our 3rd. I have been a SAHM since our first was born. Prior to that, I was a nurse and worked 12 hour night shifts for 7 years including the COVID pandemic. I was a very hard worker and saved up a hefty down payment for a house even before I met him (which went towards the house we bought together 50-50). He now pays the mortgage and groceries with his income and I pay the utilities with what is left of my savings. 

Since I have been home with the kids, my husband has a lot of resentment towards me. He often makes comments that he pays for everything, he’s the only one with a job and that I haven’t worked a day in my life. My husband’s job is WFH in the IT field and currently it is a very slow time for them. He’s often able to take naps or run errands in the middle of the work day. I’m glad he doesn’t have a super stressful job, but that makes his statements even more bothersome. There are many time where he is in the bedroom with the door locked while I am outside tending to the kids and house. 

Taking care of two kids, one still breastfeeding and waking multiple times a night, plus being newly pregnant is exhausting. I’m responsible for almost all of the housework- dishes, laundry, vacuuming, mopping. My husband refuses to acknowledge that this can be considered work. He said I should never consider the privilege of staying home with kids to be a “job”.

 While I am grateful to stay home with them, that doesn’t mean it is not physically and mentally demanding. He also makes me feel like I am mooching off his money because I am not bringing in an income currently. I feel unappreciated and very resentful towards him because I have always been considered a hard worker from my school years to my nursing job. These statements hurt me to my core and severely tarnish our relationship. How can I help him understand my point of view?

Some backstory my boyfriend has been working night shifts for a majority of the time we've been dating. It was a big sacrifice since I would only see him for 30 minutes or less most days and we never had a full day off together. Anyways he is now on day shifts again which I'm excited for him because he wasn't getting enough sleep and it was really messing with his mental health. We share one car and he starts work at 7am and gets off at 4pm where I worked at 9am and finished at 5pm. This wasn't working because if I took the car he would be left standing in the cold for who knows how long until I could come pick him up. Luckily I was able to change my schedule at work so that he can have the car and just come pick me up. I'm very fortunate that my work has a gym and coffee shop that I can hangout out at nearby from 6:30am until I start work at 8am. I'm not sure if he's just hyper/tired because he's actually getting sleep again but he's been acting really different since starting. It could also be because we don't know how to act around one another anymore because we've never had this much time together for a minute. I'm actively being treated for blood clots and I have to get blood tests every other week to make sure the blood thinners are working. I re-arranged my appointments so that they would work with our new schedule and he lost his mind and started freaking out at me like I was asking him to give me his kidney. He also had really bad low libido when we first started dating so I was just used to it and understanding. Now when we're intimate with one another it's happening more often which is great if he's feeling better but I'm just not used to it if that makes sense? He just acts different and weird with me and suddenly wants to start drinking every weekend? I'm just so confused and I don't know if it's because his coworkers are closer to his age that he's trying to be cool and impress them. His old coworkers were all old men so I dunno.

"tl;dr my husband doesn't and never has contributed, I'm incredibly burned out but don't know if I should keep waiting for things to improve 

When my husband (31M) and I (30F) fell in love and got married (roughly eight years ago) I was aware that he had some minor issues. I had my insecurities too and I was eager to support him. I guess I didn't expect his infrequent illness &amp; insomnia to grow into anxiety, depression, and PTSD over the years. And he's getting worse, not better. I thought that we were going to be able to build a life together and I feel like that has been robbed from me boiling frog style.

He doesn't work and he has never held a job for longer than a couple of months. He went years unemployed because he would not apply to jobs due to anxiety. He did not have a career plan or aspiration for a certain kind of work, beyond the nebulous idea of being a writer. He is a college dropout.

When he quit his last job, it was part of an agreement between us that he was going to take some time off to recuperate, attend therapy, and take care of housework. To his credit, he is still in therapy (which took years of pressure from me, and continued pressure to stop him from quitting). He has tried a few different antidepressants, all of which have made him worse.

When it comes to household work, he does what he can and I do everything else. I estimate it's roughly 80% me to 20% him. We don't have kids and I work full-time in tech making enough for us to live comfortably.

He feels such incredible guilt about all of this. He feels worthless. He is afraid that he is ruining my life, that I will leave him, that I resent him, and he is constantly seeking validation that this isn't true. Basically, I have to lie. It's these exact insecurities that are making him ill so how can I not reassure him?

But in reality I am fucking drowning. My job is not an easy one and I struggle daily in the workplace. I have a history of depression too, which is well-managed at the moment. But I had health complications this year that make physical labour truly agonising for me, so it's harder than ever to pull his weight around the home. As a result I have to live in a mess because nothing gets done if I'm not the one to do it and I very often push through the pain just to do what needs doing. I had a death in the family this year which was slow, traumatic and grueling and I don't think I can go on being the rock for both my husband and my mom without having anybody that I myself can lean on. My body aches and I'm depleted in every way.

He is incredibly needy. I'm trying to juggle all of this work to provide for us and he just... lies on the couch and tells me 19 times a day that his tummy hurts and asking to hang out. He needs 4-6 hours of one on one quality time with me every day. He has online friends but I'm his main companion and sometimes it honestly feels like all he does is lie around and wait for attention from me. I can try to be productive during our time together but watching me do housework often makes him feel guilty so more often than not we're playing videogames or watching a movie that I'm not into. I feel like such an asshole saying this, but sometimes I just want to be alone during my free time. I want him to find ways to entertain himself.

He immigrated to be with me. It's this detail that makes everything just so much harder. He's completely dependent on me - without me, he would have nobody. He gave up so much to be here. If we separated I'm not sure how he'd get by.

In some sick way I kind of feel cheated, like this isn't what I signed up for. I had aspirations. I wanted a career, I wanted a child, I wanted a garden I could be proud of, I wanted to save for retirement, I wanted a life partner who I could rely on to be as independent and driven and competent as I am. But I can't have any of those things because of this dead weight hanging off me. I feel like I'm just spinning wheels in life and never getting any closer to my goals. But I am getting older.

I feel bitter that nobody has ever and nobody will ever treat me the way that I treat my husband. I will never have a rock. I will never have a kind and understanding partner say ""it's okay baby, take a 12 month career break until you feel less stressed"". Nobody will ever buy me thousands of dollars of tech toys and streaming equipment. Nobody will go around cleaning all the shit that I don't feel like cleaning that day. Nobody will do all my paperwork for me. Nobody will fix my shoddy bathroom repair job.

And I'm afraid. Separation is such a messy thought. How would he survive? How much would that set me back financially? Being the perfect couple has been such a core part of my identity for so long, through 8 years of marriage, so how could I begin to explain to friends and family that I suddenly changed my mind? How could I explain it to him after putting all my heart and soul into reassuring him that would never happen? To me, this isn't some Reddit post. This is my life. There is no undo button. There are no do-overs. If I did that, could I live with the consequences?

Even now, reading some of the things I've written I wonder if I'm being too mean. Calling him dead weight and feeling as though he should ""push through"" his pain like I do mine.

It isn't all bad. I love him and he loves me, and he genuinely wants to make me happy. We don't argue or yell. He's a feminist, and opposed to bigotry. I'm not the most attractive person out there but he insists I'm beautiful at every opportunity. He'll happily make me a coffee or rub my feet because they are relatively quick and easy tasks that alleviate his guilt. Once I was attracted to him, back when I viewed him as my equal and not as this helpless dependant.

I don't know. Writing this has been a little therapeutic, like my feelings weren't even real until I recorded them. I'm just sad and imagining what life might be like with a partner who helps me rather than hinders me. I don't know what to do about it.","Husband (31M) is depressed, but I'm (30F) drowning too",18nu8km,1703184779.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nu8km/husband_31m_is_depressed_but_im_30f_drowning_too/,
"I have never made a reddit post but I of course seen many posts like this on tiktok with subway surfers and other shit playing on a parallel screen so I thought I'd give it a try since I don't know what else to do. My gf and I have been together for 5 years. In the name of not making a novel about it I won't go super into detail about our relationship but it's safe to say we have had our ups and downs, between neither of us never seeing what a healthy, happy relationship looks like from either of our families (or anywhere outside of movies and shows), between the challenges of moving in together at my families house, and between the many, many, many mistakes we have made along the way, we are in a weird spot where I am so lost on how to go forward. The spark feels extinguished, I feel I'm not getting what I need, she's feeling she's not getting what she needs, and there's a lot of insecurities and trust issues now well established on both of our ends. We have talked about marriage, children, and a future together for a good while and also both had the same goal of being in a successful, happy, and healthy relationship since we have not seen it happen in our own lives, in a way to show the world it can work. With that creates a determination to make this work and solve problems but also creates a spot where we are not sure if it can work or be fixed. We had a huge fight this summer where she broke my heart but we said to each other wed work through it and try to come out strong but it's been 6 months and we have made little progress. We haven't been fighting persay but we do bicker and I feel there's been little effort on her end. She says she's scared that I will revert back to my toxic traits that I am ashamed of but I have been working really hard to get rid of and become a better person. I still have much to learn and more character growth to go through but I am just not feeling seen or heard in this relationship anymore. We still hangout a lot and spend time with each other. We have been playing a lot of baldurs gate 3 together along with binge watching our shows together like our recent surge of watching studio Ghibli movies. In terms of dates, we are both in college on winter break so our options in terms of inexpensive dates are limited but we still manage to go out and have a good time. It feels like our parents put a darkness within us from watching their toxic relationships and when things need to be addressed and problems need solved in our relationship, we don't know how to go about it and we start to get stressed and I feel we revert to what we know. I hate the feeling of seeing my own darkness infecting her and who it's turned her into and vice versa. It's no excuse for my bad deads along with hers but I love this girl with all my heart. I think of her everyday, I picture my future together with her, and she's my best friend. I don't want to lose her and I want nothing more than to say we made it, through all the bad and good, all the judgement and trust issues, all the hell we put ourselves through that we learned what it really means to love someone and to succeed in a relationship, but I am scared of the option that it's impossible and we are wasting our times and creating a worse situation.

"Hi, I am currently working in a snowboard rental shop in Japan. I’m still quite young and recently a girl has visited our shop and rented some snowboards with her family.

"Hi everyone, I normally wouldn’t do this, but I’m tired of being gaslit. My bf (24m) invited me (26f) to his company Christmas dinner last night. 

For context, we had just gotten back together after breaking up for a little more than two months. We’ve been on and off for 4 years because every few months he claims he’s depressed and treats me like dirt. Never wanting to see me, annoyed at any interaction I have with him,being downright mean, and even keeping things from me and lying about them for seemingly no reason, torturing me for months until he eventually breaks up with me. This has happened 3 or 4 times and he has come back each time after some weeks, sweet and perfect like he was when we first dated. I fall for it every time. 

This time was different. In the time we broke up, these two sisters started working at his shop. He became very close personal friends with the one girl and lucky for me it happened to be someone I disliked in the past due to history of her flirting with one of my boyfriends in high school. Nothing ever came of that, it just rubbed me the wrong way at the time. I already was put off by this, but I dropped the subject after we argued about it for a day or two after getting back together. I knew he was friends with her, but I didn’t think he was friends with the sister. Well, the sister is a 20 yo sorority girl that my bf has always described as “cool”. I assumed it was a coworker type relationship and I never asked about it further. Until last night. 

We were having a great time until the two of them arrived. I could tell from the start they were closer than I had thought based on their interactions. His demeanor changes and he starts acting nervous and texting constantly with his phone close to his chest. He kept going to the bathroom and I could tell something was going on. He seemed to be really focused on her the whole night. 

Afterwards, we get in the car and I ask about it. He immediately gets defensive saying “you wanna be cucked so bad”. I asked him if they had been texting and he said she only texts him at work for work related stuff. Finally after arguing for 20 minutes, I had enough of the lies and manipulation. 

Reddit, I know you guys are not a fan of this kind of thing, and normally I would not recommend it as a practice, but I had reached my breaking point with the lies. I had exactly enough. It was the only time in our relationship that I have ever done this: I asked to see their text conversation. He of course lashed out at me, cursing, saying horrible things, but eventually showed me. They had been texting the whole entire night while he was sitting right next to me. Based on the timestamps on the texts, they have been texting back and forth every other minute for days. I only got to see 2 or 3 days before he ripped the phone out of my hands. What I saw wasn’t overtly sexual, but it was fairly flirtatious. Smiley faces, constant banter, sending each other games back and forth. I didn’t even know they were friends before that night. This hurts especially because he has a habit of ignoring my texts. He was texting this girl literally every other minute. He also has a habit of lying to me often using the excuse that he would be scared of my reaction if he were honest. I never understood this because I have never done anything to make him scared? I am not a violent person, I’ve never put hands on anyone in my life, never thrown things, threatened things, I’ve never done anything out of anger except cry and plead my case and then eventually storm out and not speak to him. I’ve never even contacted him after a break up. 

He is in no way remorseful or concerned about my feelings at all. He didn’t speak to me for a day until I texted him. He is angry at me for “sexualizing” him and not feeling comfortable with this. He is not willing to compromise at all. He has turned on me completely and whatever love he had for me is clearly not there. 

Would you feel comfortable with your partner suddenly texting someone of the opposite sex constantly? Especially one that he just met while being separated? Is it weird that they sat on opposites sides of the room texting each other secretly? I’m pretty sure we are breaking up over this, but I’m tired of being gaslit and hurt. I have mattered so little in this relationship and lost so, SO much. I’m pretty much unrecognizable from when we got together.

I have a good job, have built own house and don't rely on parents money anymore since I started working. Unfortunately, I don't have the Greek-god like looks as I wasn't lucky with the genes.

I have been nice to everyone irrespective of their personalities and situations, not going out of control and managing situations calmly and helping out when required. I'm also open to suggestions and improvements and I believe communication is vital in a relationship. But in the end when the time comes to take the next step, all I get to hear is that ""You are a nice person, you will get/deserve someone better. I don't deserve you."" I don't annoy or bother them once they have decided to move on after making their decision final.

Now at this point I'm really confused and disheartened. It was fine initially but over time this pattern has repeated and it now makes me feel that I'm not enough. It has started to affect my mental health and make me depressed. I'm really tired of hearing this over the years and I really don't know from where this 'someone better' is going to come into my life.

"I, almost 23 F, have been with my partner 23 M for over four years now. He just proposed a few days ago and I’m beyond excited to get to marry my best friend 

My parents are where the problem comes in. I don’t exactly have the healthiest relationship with them. For background, I still live with my parents because they were insistent I stay home through college. I grew up very sheltered and was always encouraged to stay home. I feel like they have prevented me from growing up in every way they could but I still have gotten my drivers license (mostly thanks to my now fiancé), a job despite them discouraging me from it, and now I have a Bachelor’s degree in nursing and have been working as a nurse at a hospital for six months now. I always hoped the dynamic would change as I grew up, but it has stayed mostly the same with a few slight improvements.

I have been dating my boyfriend for four years and they have never let me stay at his house overnight. I still currently have a 10pm curfew because my father doesn’t want me out past dark. I have fought them on many occasions in the past but have been following these rules to keep the peace. Every argument I have, no matter how politely it starts, turns vicious and never changes anything.

Now my boyfriend has proposed, and I said yes, but apparently nothing will change. I want to move out with him and start our lives together. All of our friends have lived on their own for years now. But when he asked my dad for his blessing, my dad told him that nothing would change until we’re married. My dad gave him his blessing with the conditions that he tells me “no” about moving out together and that things have to stay the way that they are. My dad essentially wants my fiancé to take his side and force his rules on me. Of course, my fiancé would never do this and told me everything that was said.

We are both beyond discouraged and don’t know what to do. My parents are suggesting that if we really want to live together that we have a wedding in 6 months. Me and my fiancé don’t want to rush planning a wedding but we also really want to live together. We want to enjoy being engaged and plan our wedding at our own pace so we both get our dream wedding. We are both at a loss for what to do. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated 🥲

The way we see it, we have three options. We could either be compliant with my parents demands and continue to live separate our entire engagement and almost spend our entire 20s living with our parents. Option two, we be maliciously compliant and elope and wave the marriage certificate in their face and move out and have a wedding later (but then we kind of ruin the magic of our wedding 🥲). Or option three, we simply move out against their wishes and hope the backlash isn’t so bad that they never speak to me again. If you were in my position, what would you do?

"For most of my life I (20F) had crushes on unavailable boys. There were a few guys that liked me but I always rejected them because I didnt like them back. I’ve always dreamed about falling in love and had high expectations for a relationship, however I’ve never really experienced mutual feelings. Either they liked me or I liked them - never both. I’ve also been dealing with fear of intimacy and relationships, I’ve always wanted to keep distance from people and got really scared when they showed affection. 

2 months ago I’ve met this guy. From the beginning he made it very clear that he liked me. I didnt feel attracted to him but we started going on dates. I feel like he’s a guy a lot of girls are dreaming of. He is very caring, very romantic, goes out of his way to spend time with me or compliment me. And I really wanted a relationship for a long time. 

However, sometimes I think that we are too different. Our humor is different, I never find his jokes funny, our hobbies are different, we like different movies, different music. I find myself being bored with him or not having anything to talk about. I also don’t find him very attractive and don’t want him to meet my friends. I never get excited when he texts me. I would never ask for his advice and sometimes feel like I’m talking to a boy thats younger than me (we’re the same age). I hate using this phrase, but a lot of things he’s doing are giving me the ick. So it looks like I should end this talking stage and not waste his time. But that thought makes me really sad. 

There have been moments where I’ve found so much comfort with him. He would drive me home after a long day at work and we would hold hands and I would feel safe. Or I would go to his place, we’d watch a movie and i’d fall asleep on his shoulder. Its rare to feel so safe with someone. Whenever I think about ending things, I remember those moments of comfort and get really frustrated. 

I’ve asked my friends for advice (they’re all 20, what do they know about relationships?). Some of them said, that I should end things, because it seems that I don’t want him, I want a relationship. Others said, that I should stay because love is those quiet moments when you can fall asleep on someones shoulder and all the “icks” will go away eventually. But if I like him, shouldn’t I feel like he’s perfect, at least at the start of dating? Shouldn’t I feel butterflies and want to hang out with him always, not only when I’m tired after work?

"So this issue is really a whole cluster of issues and I’m going to try my best to organize my thoughts effectively… The main problem is as stated in the title. That incompatibility seems to be primarily rooted in differences in frequency of desire (at least I believe so) and approach/initiation.

I am the person in the relationship (to my knowledge anyways) that experiences desire most frequently and feels the most sexually frustrated. Physical touch is my primary love language, but I’m a little particular about it in that it “doesn’t count” if I have to overtly initiate it or ask for it. I don’t feel loved when I don’t feel pursued/desired. It’s a big turn off for me to be the initiator when the scales feel unbalanced and I don’t feel frequently and consistently pursued as well…which results in me initiating only when absolutely desperate for it and often satisfying myself as I’m left alone most of the time in the evenings anyways while he plays video games across the house and upstairs. 

I’ve brought this up with him frequently and he always says that it shouldn’t all be on him and he never wants to initiate because I always seem annoyed with him. And I’ve told him that I’m annoyed with him because I’m freaking sexually frustrated all the time! I’ve told him I would initiate more if I felt desired and pursued more often to begin with… I’ve told him I’d like to have sex multiple times a week and I can’t live my entire life in a sexless marriage. I tried suggesting that he come to bed every night between 10:30 and 11pm so that we have low pressure time together to connect, cuddle, and maybe do more if it progresses that way. He agreed to this and stuck to it for less than a week before consistently finding excuses not to and never doing it again. We go MONTHS without sex and hardly any physical contact outside of that. He tells me he’s trying, but I truly don’t see it and he says that makes him not even want to try. I feel like I’ve told him time and time again what I want/need and it’s disregarded and he just repeats that it shouldn’t all be his responsibility. At the same time…I feel like I’m doing my part by bringing it up periodically and trying to explain how I feel, what I want/need, and propose solutions that take some of the pressure off of him and nothing changes. He says he finds me extremely attractive and wants to have more sex too, but I honestly have a hard time believing that at this point and now there’s hurt and a sense of rejection there too because I’ve opened up about this so many times and he still doesn’t initiate or make any effort that’s apparent to me. 

At this point, I’m constantly thinking about my ex and the incredible sex life we had, struggling with the thought that I’m wasting some of my prime time in life without having a fulfilled sex life, and I’m entertaining thoughts of getting what I need outside of our marriage. I’ve hinted at potentially moving toward an open marriage to him before during a conversation and he just completely shut down and it became very apparent that he wouldn’t be able to handle it and it would destroy our marriage… I still value our marriage and everything else besides our sex life is good. I don’t want to leave him over this or cheat, but what am I supposed to do when nothing changes?? 

We’ve been married 5 years and I feel like this started right around the time we got engaged when I was taking a medication that killed my libido, so I didn’t notice it right away, but I’ve been off the medication since right after we got married. The frequency has never been a lot by my standards, but it wasn’t like this before. When we do have sex, it’s usually really good and we’re both satisfied and have a great time (I think)! That was not always the case and I did have to “coach” him on pleasing me early on. We had the most sex when it was all about him and I never climaxed… So is it just too much effort for him? Easier to jerk off?? I’ve asked how often he does please himself and he says he does a lot, so I don’t know that a lack of drive on his end is the problem. I just feel like crap about it all and am tired of living like this. 

If you actually read all of this, thank you!! I know it was long… I’m open to any and all advice.

"So I (19 NB) have been with my partner since July, and I proposed back in November because I love him so much. But I'm exhausted right now. We're on winter break, and I have to be calling him constantly and paying attention to him all the time or I don't love him. It was even worse when we were in person because he needed attention all the time or I didn't love him. I wasn't even allowed to hang out with our best friend without him because that meant we didn't like him and we wanted to leave him. 

I promised him that I would never leave him, that I love him, and that we are endgame, so would I be wrong if I were to break up with him? I've managed to put myself in a shitty position because I now share a dorm with him and we were starting plans to move in together this summer, but I'm not ready to move out of home and I don't think I could handle living with him all summer.

"Hello people, I bring you a little gossip in exchange for advice:
 I am currently in a relationship (M28 and M24) for almost a year and everything has been going well, but lately I found out that his best friend (Franco) is very close to my bf's ex (Jairo).  So far there is no problem, the thing is, yesterday I went to visit my boyfriend to his work in another city and we were going to have dinner somewhere and then I would return home.  (We do not have a long-distance relationship, he only travels a few days and returns to the same city as mine).  Franco didn't know that I was with him at the moment and he made a video call in which he was with Jairo having drinks and told him ""look who's with me.""  Basically the intention of the call was to show him that his ex had returned to the city to visit and be a bridge of contact (which I don't see as being well-intentioned).  My boyfriend got a little nervous and he told him that he was with me now and we were going to have dinner and the call ended.  In the end I spoke to my boyfriend about how I felt and what I thought about the intention of that call, to which he told me that I was absolutely right and that he was going to talk to Franco about it.
 People, I want to know your opinion on how you would handle that situation, what limits should my boyfriend set with his friend and what else should I do in situations like that.

"I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would love some perspective from the community. I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend (26F) for over a year and we've had a generally happy relationship. However, I'm struggling with something from the early days of our relationship that I can't seem to move past.  
We met while she was on a year abroad in my country, and our connection was immediate. Although from different countries, we both felt a strong desire to pursue a serious relationship. In the first few weeks, we spent a lot of time together and communicated daily. We both had other casual connections at the time, and we talked about ending those as things progressed between us. Though not officially dating, it felt like we were heading towards exclusivity.  
About 2.5 weeks in, I had to travel back home for a short period. We stayed in contact, and one night she mentioned going out with new friends she met at a park, which didn't bother me initially. However, a month into our official relationship, she showed me a Snapchat from a guy, Ryan, she met that night. This raised some doubts for me as I thought it was strange to be snapchatting someone in front of me and also made me wonder if there was more between them? But it was less than a month of officially dating so I was still figuring her out.  
Later, I learned from her friend, Michelle, that Ryan had approached my girlfriend because he was interested in her. This information, combined with the Snapchat incident, led me to question if something more had happened between them. After bringing it up a few times, my girlfriend eventually admitted a month ago to making out with Ryan that night. She explained that she wasn't as invested in our relationship at that early stage and was enjoying the attention she received since everything was new to her while traveling.  
Although I understand we weren't officially dating then, I had already started to invest emotionally in our relationship. Learning about this incident has left me feeling hurt and uncertain. It's been challenging to reconcile this with the otherwise positive aspects of our relationship, as it's been really great beyond that. I'm seeking advice on how to process these feelings and whether it's possible to build trust moving forward. What are your thoughts and experiences in similar situations?

"My bf is a really nervous and a highly-strung person, on the other hand I'm the compelet opposite.

He has diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. So I'm always on edge since I met him, always nervous that something dangerous happened to him and always texting and calling with no answer. Yesterday, he disappeared for 8 hours and called me at 12:30 am, ofc I was awake waiting for him to open his phone and he said: I was asleep. Idk why but all the worry turned to anger.. if you slept why you didn't tell me when you 100% know that I'll be worried that something had happened to you. A small message won't hurt. So I told him f*ck you. Do you know how worried I was and you were just asleep? He responded with a disbelief that I cursed him. (Even though we curse each other all the time joking or not) and I have a habit that I can't talk when I'm angry. So I told him I'm going to sleep and stopped responding.

"So, I'm 23 (m) and have lived in my current living situation for a little under a year and a half now. After graduating college in May 2022, two guy friends from school &amp; I decided to rent a small house together in a quiet suburb due to cheap(ish) rent, it is a nice area, and is centrally located to our jobs. The three of us were in the same fraternity in college and I've been good friends with both of them since meeting several years ago. 

  
I first started noticing something was a bit 'off' about a year ago when our one roommate (we'll call him Ben) started displaying rather selfish behavior when he was around a girl he started dating at the time. It felt like he'd purposely make my other roommate &amp; I look 'beneath him' somehow by pointing to anything wrong around the house and blaming us. It evolved into him trying to control almost everything, from the thermostat to how we setup Christmas lights, and I am growing quite sick of it. It feels like he always has to prove something to someone, and he is oftentimes complaining. As soon as he gets home the energy in the house completely shifts, because we know Ben is about to b\*tch about something, whether it's work (he complains a LOT about his job to the point I feel I'm more familiar with his coworkers than mine) or someone didn't clean something the way he likes, it's pretty much something everyday. Another example is a few weeks ago I took the initiative to decorate the exterior of our house with Christmas lights, got out on the roof and everything. When he got home that day, he decided he didn't like how I coordinated the extension cords and started re-doing everything, only to have it end up the same way I originally had it. I was furious I spent hours trying to do something nice and it felt like because he didn't do it, it was invalid &amp; wrong, and then had to spend another 1-2 hours fixing the mess he made trying to redo it. Just yesterday Ben came home and immediately started complaining about how my other roommate's friend left leftovers in our fridge for a week. They turned out to be Ben's! Negative energy for nothing. It's to the point where it's affecting my mental health and I find myself closing myself in my bedroom after he arrives home because it's more pleasant than trying to navigate whatever negativity he's spewing downstairs. These are just a few examples but you get the point, Ben acts like the head of household (even though the rent/most of the bills run through my account, lol) and we're his peasants and should listen to whatever he does.  
I don't think he's a narcissist or a bad person, as I've dealt with those before and this is different. I don't think he knows he's acting this way, I think he feels as though he constantly has to prove something for whatever reason. I brought it up to my other roommate and he feels the exact same way. I've had in general, the worst year of my life with several deaths &amp; other misfortunes and I feel as though as I'm starting to try and improve my mental health &amp; recover from those events, this situation is setting me back significantly. I am a very patient person, but I can feel the tension building inside of me and eventually, it's going to overflow and I'll probably say some pretty nasty things if that happens. Obviously, the best solution is to talk to Ben\*, but I feel as though no matter how gently we bring this up he'll see it as us attacking him and trying to 'undermine' him. 

  
Another dynamic to this is our lease ends in April, and we have to decide if we're re-signing or not soon. It would make financial sense to stay for another year, but I'm not sure staying in this situation is best for me, even though I like my other roommate and don't want to leave him in a tough spot. However, a part of me wants to get the HELL out of here and move to the city and find myself like I sorta feel like I should do deep down. 

  
One last thing I'll say is I am far from the perfect roommate, but I will admit when I do something wrong or leave something out, which is fairly rare. Due to the constant scrutinization, I obsessively clean every day as I'm able, and subconsciously I've realized it's anxiety cleaning due to not wanting to deal with being nagged about the house appearing slightly lived in when Ben gets home. The more I think about the whole situation the more unhealthy I realize it is.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: As I try to improve myself and my mental health, I realize my roommate is contributing to many of the lingering mental issues I've had and am unsure what to do next.

"We’ve been dating for six months and we are official. We just came back from a weekend getaway (our very first) and I need some advice. 

The vacation didn’t quite go quite as planned for many reasons. During our first day at our destination, we went to a restaurant and the service was terrible. We eventually got up and found somewhere else to eat at my suggestion. But afterwards he couldn’t stop complaining about how people were so rude to him.  After leaving we got stuck in a traffic jam due to a Christmas parade and the uber fares were way too high. We ended up walking several miles until we found another taxi that could take us. When we arrived at the hotel, he complained about how much we had spent on transportation.

 With this in mind, I carefully planned public transportation routes for our tour the next day. When we were waiting for the bus, I commented that this was the first time I took a bus in this particular city. He asked me if I usually traveled the city by car, I said I did, but clarified that I only use the subway and bus in the big city we both live in, as he knows. Out of nowhere, he said that I should know by now that he doesn’t own a car and doesn’t want one. I said, calmly, that I understood that and that I didn’t want a car. I also clarified that I loved him just the way he is. He went on and asked if my ex-partners had cars. I said some did and some didn’t, but again, I told him I was more than happy to be with him.  He seemed upset. 

After our second vacation day ended, when we got back to the hotel, he said that we should’ve gone from place to place using Uber instead and that way we would have had more time to appreciate the sights. I told him I thought he was right, but that at least I enjoyed using transportation and getting to know a new city that way. He didn’t reply. We were tired, hungry, and stressed throughout, so maybe that played a part in his bad mood. 

 I feel like he is easily stuck in the “should’ve done this, should’ve done that” loop. I told him that whenever he feels like my plans don’t accommodate him, he can always pitch in and I won’t be bothered at all. I only ever take charge of some of the planning because he asks me to. 

When we said goodbye, he was sweet and loving. He even bought me a couple of presents.

But when she’s going to school, it’s like pulling teeth to get her to do little chores. She has gained so much weight in the last 10 years because of her physical activity being a 1, on a scale of 0-10. 

I come home from work, take care of the lawn, take care of the house, pay all the bills, laundry, and many other chores. And I don’t consider myself a busy person. I have a simple life, and that’s the way I like it. 

This is a typical day for her while she’s not going to school. Wake up around 1:00pm, let the dogs out, clean the litter boxes, put water in the water bowls, clean up any cat vomit (f@&amp;$ing cats), vacuums up a couple times a week, and I have a 50% chance of her making me dinner. I try to get her to clean windows, or mop the floors, and she won’t do it. She leaves that for me. 

If she’s going to school at the time, I’m lucky if she puts water in the bowls for the animals. 

She has a room FULL of stuff. I’ve been trying for years to get her to clean it, and she always has a bull shit excuse the just makes me angry. 

I don’t expect a spotless house. But getting her to do chores around the house is near impossible. 

How can I get her more motivated?

"I have been with a multitude of women but never have I met a woman so amazing. I truly am mesmerized by her intelligence and beauty. We speak and get along so effortlessly. 

I planned our second date to go out near her place and grab some drinks and play pool. She called me and told me to go to her house instead which I agreed to. I showed up with wine and dessert and we kissed and cooked together for a bit. We sat on the couch and drank a bit. I drank two cups of wine. I typically don’t drink as I’m a football player and I find that drinking even the slightest bit can leave me groggy for a few days. I let this slide and ate the food and had some wine. It was a great night. 

I came prepared with condoms but forgot the lube.. we were making out and she was telling me how much she thought highly of me and how much she likes me. She also was saying that she would love to get to know me more. I undressed and helped her do the same and I just admired her beauty and began to kiss her and rub her etc. she enjoyed it all but I noticed that I couldn’t get it up. 

This has NEVER happened before. I have slept with at least 15 women. I was not nervous with her but it was our first time getting to that point. She was begging for me to fuck her but  my friend wasn’t cooperating. Finally after 15 minutes of role play I told her I couldn’t get it up and she rubbed me and tried and I was shocked. Then I realized and googled… the alcohol did it.apparently alcohol consumption can act as a blood thinner and prevent things from working properly.  I apologized to her and she acted very sweet and didn’t judge me but I could tell she was disappointed as I talk a big game! 

I texted when I got home and she hearted the messages. I really like this girl and I’m putting in immense effort to get to know.

"I [22M] am having jealous thoughts toward my girlfriend [21F]. 

I was circumcised as a baby. FYI this removes a massive part of the penis, a part with 5000-10,000 nerve endings, and the thing that protects the tip from drying out and losing sensitivity. My girlfriend is fully intact and has no problem having mind blowing orgasms literally whenever she wants. Sexy time with her usually ends with her feeling amazing and describing feelings I can’t even fathom. Also seeing her and knowing she has not been mutilated is very good obviously, but it makes me sad knowing I have been. 

Obviously I do not want everyone else to be at my level of genital mutilation, especially not my partner, but there’s a horrible feeling of jealousy that I absolutely hate. She gets to feel amazing while I struggle with ED and difficulty during sex at 22 years old. She has an orgasm almost every time we have sexy time, whereas I ejaculate about 80% of the time, but only orgasm less than 5% of the time. I can count the amount of times I’ve actually had an orgasm this year on my hands and feet. Weird analogy I know, just saying it’s less than 20 times haha.

Another thing is when she has a small orgasm, I’ll ask her how it was, and she will describe it to me. Even her tiny orgasms sound better than my biggest orgasm I’ve ever had. Then she’ll be a little sad and like, “yeah, it was alright I guess..” and in my head I’m thinking, well I didn’t even orgasm at all this week, and what you just described sounds better than any orgasm I’ve had in my life! Also I worked super hard to give you a good orgasm, so it feels a little bad.

She’s super supportive of me, but sometimes it feels like she doesn’t understand. it seems a lot of women don’t fully understand what it’s like not being able to truly orgasm most of the time. I know a lot of men don’t satisfy their partners, which is quite sad! However women can still have big orgasms if they want to, it seems a lot of women don’t fully understand what it’s like not being able to truly orgasm most of the time. I know a lot of men don’t satisfy their partners, which is quite sad! However women can still have big orgasms if they want to, using devices or their hand. Even with devices or my hand, I RARELY orgasm. 

Also I know that women have to deal with safety issues and periods and some women have trouble orgasming as well! Right now I’m just trying to share my personal feelings, since everyone’s feelings are valid.

How do I communicate that I don’t feel understood, but also get rid of the horrible jealousy thoughts, I feel so guilty. 

Side note. I know that most female genital mutilation is technically worse, more akin to removing the tip along with the foreskin on a guy. But remember, the foreskin is an extremely important part of the penis, removing it causes lots of complications for many men. Also I heard it told to me like this. How much of a little girls vag do you think it’s OK to cut off to make it similar in invasiveness to a circumcision? None you say? You don’t think you should cut any part of a little girls vag?

I’m [F21] a bisexual who is currently in a 10 month relationship with my first girlfriend [F22]. 

I am the sort of person who values alone time massively as I grew up with many siblings. I also struggle with mental health and have been in a few toxic relationships.

My gf is a lesbian and has also been in many toxic relationships. She’s a huge people pleaser and very clingy. She’s very overprotective, paranoid and gets jealous easily. She’s obviously very insecure which I can’t seem to understand why, I blame society. None of these things have been issues for me as in the beginning I was very closed off so it helped me relax around her as it was reassuring that she was not going to hurt me. 

A few months ago, I made a friend[27M] at a new job. Which would text from time to time but nothing crazy. I lost my best friend [F21] at the beginning of the year so it was nice to form another friendship. My gf got very jealous of this guy and would basically fall into a pit of extreme overthinking whenever he was mentioned. I would then have to spend an evening reassuring her that he was just a friend. At first it was fine as I get that sometimes we can’t help where our brain goes, but it’s starting to get exhausting. Around the time this started she said she gets like this because you doesn’t trust me. As someone who finds it very difficult to open up to people, and opened up my heart completely to her, it broke my heart to hear this. It constantly is going around my head. It’s extremely exhausting to feel like I’m constantly fighting her own thoughts for her trust. She’s with me all weekend every weekend, and I’m working 12 hour days during the week so don’t do anything.   

Now I don’t know what to do. I love her and we’ve talked about our future together but I don’t think I’m in love with her anymore. I just don’t know how to speak to her about it because the last thing I want is to hurt her.  I’ve been though a lot this year and she has been there for me through everything. I just don’t think either of us are ready for commitment like this, both of us have a lot going on and our minds are all over the place. We never truly discussed what we want before getting involved with one another. We both clearly have a lot of stuff we need to sort out before getting into a long term relationship. We’re coming up to our 1 year in February and I don’t want to pass a milestone if it won’t last. 

Do I speak to her about this? What can I say?

"I M22 have recently found out that my F20 ex girlfriend lives at the same apartment complex I do. We both live at the same student apartment complex as we go to the same state college (quite popular place where we're from so it isn't too coincidental). We dated during high school and I was a total dick during our split, which happened to coincide with Lockdown. I broke up with her, citing that we were incompatible i.e., conflicting sex drives (my high vs. her low), different career goals, and different interests. However, after seeing her again I feel quite undecided.

I see her on campus and around the apartment complex a few times per month, and I was only able to speak to her once. I told her that I was sorry for being an asshole and leaving her so suddenly all those years ago, and she forgave me.  Since then, we haven't really spoken to each other, and she seems to avoid eye contact when we cross paths. But i catch her looking at me on the bus or when we happen to cross paths on campus (she was and still seems to be quite shy). Every time I her I feel a massive pit in my stomach that I can only eliminate via distraction. However, I'm not sure whether this feeling is due to regret or longing. 

Most of me believes this feeling of longing is born out of loneliness, but when I feel that way I begin to think about her and our previous relationship. It takes a considerable amount of effort to forget about our paths crossing; this is often accompanied by a series of associated thoughts, dreams, and fantasies about our still being together. So, I was hoping to get an outside perspective on the situation. Do I seem motivated by loneliness, or a want to reconnect with a partner from the past? Would it be irresponsible of me to reach out even though they haven't expressed any interest in doing the same?

"Apologies. English is not my first language.

When I was 12 years old, my dad left me and my mum for his mistress. I was the one who discovered the cheating and encouraged my mum to to fight for the divorce. It was a messy divorce and unfortunately as a child I was involved to an unhealthy degree. I was severely depressed and my dad and his side of the family did not care much about it. I was very hurt. Ever since my family was torn apart, I stopped interacting with my dad and his side of the family. I left my home country (China) at the age of 17 and have been living in Australasia for the past 8 years. 

6 years ago I have learnt from my cousin that my dad had a new daughter with the mistress. As I grew up as the single child, I have a strong desire to get to know my half sister, despite my complicated feeling towards her parents.

This Christmas I will be travelling home. I feel that I am emotionally mature enough to face my dad and his side of family, and to meet my half sister. I have prepared presents for all of them. I messaged my dad and told him I will be in our hometown and he said he wanted to arrange a family get together. I want to go and I want to build a good relationship with them, especially with my half sister (6F). I want to get my family back. My mum and my partner have been telling me that these are the people who didn't care enough about me.  They are worried if I would get hurt and disappointed. To be honest I don't care much about the rest people other than my half sister. I never had a sister nor do my friends (single child generation). I have decided to protect her from the ugliness of her parents history until she's 18.I feel excited and nervous. How do I be a good elder sister and build a positive relationship with my half sister? I just want to be a part of her life.

"For context we live a few hours away from each other and only see each other a few times a month due to schedules not lining up. 

This is the fourth time we've decided to try our relationship again and it's not working out. I won't go into details but we dated for 2 years in high school and it was the toxic, manipulative, and traumatic relationship I've had. I'm still dealing with trauma and attachment issues from that time period. I didn't understand that's where my issues originated from until we started trying again and my fight or flight kicked in. That hasn't happened with any other partners. If I had known, I wouldn't have agreed to try this again. I know some people are going to think I'm an idiot (I agree) for pursuing a relationship with someone who hurt me so much, but I naively thought I had healed and we both had grown enough as people since then to try again. He's a good friend, but a horrible romantic partner, and I allowed our good friendship to cloud my judgment.

Anyway, it's obviously not working. We're clearly not compatible in most ways. The only compatibility we have is we like the same videogames and have similar humor.

"How to ask my ex for my money back??

About almost 2 years ago after me and my ex-boyfriend had broken up about 2 years had gone by, we were still cool. We are kicking it a little bit and one day he asked me to borrow some money. He said he needed $400 to pay off some of his rent and car payment. I know he was going through a lot because at that time his grandma’s was very sick so I took out the $400 the next day and gave it to him. He said he would pay me back.
I have asked him once almost 1 1/2 year ago. During the other half of the year I moved away and just moved back ti my home town this year. When u let him borrow the money he said he would get it altogether and try his best to give it back to me. Well now it’s about to be 2024 and he still hasn’t paid me my $400 back Mind you he thinks it’s all sweet rainbows and butterflies. Last time I saw him in person, *about a month ago* I didn’t approach him because it was my best friends sons birthday party, and he was there because his nephew is basically married to my best friend and he was with his girlfriend, so it was not the right time, but I have him as a friend on Facebook for about two years now.

"2 years ago, I [23F] met the love of my life [27M]. We made time to spend almost every other weekend together even though we were long distance. It was an unexpected relationship, I never expected to fall as deeply in love with him as I did.

We spent a year and a half together, everyone from my end knew we were together. However, his family was not accepting of our relationship the whole time because of a difference of culture. (We are the same religion.)

I begged him for a over a year to make progress with his parents coming around, and every time I mentioned it he would freak out and only mention me to his parents once a month. This went on for a year and a half, it got to the point where my dad sat down with him and told him that if his parents don't get involved and want to meet me, then we can't be together anymore.

I gave the relationship another few months and there was no progress...so me being so young at the time (22), I left him. I told him I couldn't do it anymore because marrying into a family and moving to a different state where I'm not welcomed is too big of a decision to make by myself.

I spent the next few months working on myself and he begged and begged for me for months. He told me that if I came back, he was going to marry me with or without his parents approval. I was scared to say yes because I didn't know what was coming for me, I didn't know if it was going to work or if I was going to break my own heart trying to make his family happy.

I came back for a few weeks only to realize that I wasn't in the mindset to go against everyone to make this relationship work. My parents were terrified of losing their daughter to another state, hundreds of miles away - to a family that doesn't recognize me as their own.

He continued begging for me for months on end. I was lost, I knew I loved him but there was so much risk. 

One morning, I impulsively went to go see him. I drove 3 hours each way, in one day. Just to spend 4 hours with him.

When I saw him, it's like my stomach felt to my knees. I just wanted to be in his arms and never let him go. I told him how much I loved him and how I'll do anything to be with him, no matter what it takes.

He told me that he's been seeing someone now for 3 weeks and he doesn't feel right ghosting this person without giving it a chance. He basically told me that he wants to pursue this relationship with this other girl (same culture as him) before he decides to hop back into giving us a chance because of the uncertainty.

I don't know how to feel. I feel like the whole world was against our relationship and I feel like I failed to realize how much he was willing to give up for our relationship before it was too late.

Now I'm left alone, watching someone I love, fall in love with someone else.

"Okay so my bf and I were work colleagues and started dating soon after meeting up. We’d been together about 3 years and were living together when I suggested we take a break as I had been noticing him being distant w me and continously watching his ex fwb’s stories. I was also going through some personal and family issues and my mental health wasn’t very good either, so I suggested we take a break from each other and went on a 2 month long healing/yoga retreat with some of my friends in a different city. Even though it was supposed to be a break, my bf and I continued to talk and text here and there. However, I did notice he would not answer his calls or texts that quickly (as he did before) and was also often “busy on another call” when I’d try to call him late at night sometimes. However, since we were on a break after all, I decided to not think too much of it. A month and half into the retreat, a sudden realization hit me one day that he really was the love of my life and I’d been foolishly pushing him away. I cried a lot once I realized this and immediately called him and poured my heart out to him. Apologized a lot for breaking up/ suggesting a break and told him I loved him. I also asked him if he could join me on the remaining days of my retreat and we’d fly home together after that. He asked me for some time to think things over but after a few days basically said he loved and missed me too and booked tickets to come see me. Once he was here, we had a ton of fun and I fell in love with him much more than ever before. However, once we got back home, was when things started taking a turn. After a few days of him being distant and acting weird, I asked him what was going on. He then told me that he had something he wanted to tell me and basically told me that during the time I was at this retreat, he hooked up his ex fwb (the one whose stories he used to regularly watch) a couple times. He didn’t give more details than that and told me that he had ended that dalliance and blocked her number, and was sorry. I know I was the one who asked for a break so I probably don’t have the right to get mad at him, but I can’t stop thinking about it now. It’s all I can imagine now, and I admit I now have major trust issues with my bf. I am wondering how I can ever trust him after this.

the problem is that, 1. i felt like i would end up cheating, but after some self reflection i realised i felt that way because i’ve always gone behind guys who played hard to get and i enjoyed it. she on the other hand accepts me and loves me. 2. i was cooking today (which i don’t do usually) and i thought to myself “my husband and his parents would be so lucky to have me, i could get any guy” (also note im an indian living in america). and i shut that thought and told myself i can’t wait to do this for her. 

but these thoughts really affect me. i don’t think im a good person and i feel like i will hurt her someday and let these thoughts get to me. but i’m v happy. letting her go ever will be the biggest mistake i make. and i want to shut these thoughts. pls help me in stopping these intrusive thoughts or letting me know if this is normal?",i (20F) am having intrusive thoughts in my relationship with my girlfriend (21F),18nswf8,1703181300.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nswf8/i_20f_am_having_intrusive_thoughts_in_my/,

"Sorry for the long post! Hope my formatting is okay, I’m on mobile (aren’t we all?). 

For a little context, we’ve been friends for a long time but started dating about 5 months ago. I knew getting into the relationship that he has a problem with alcohol, but that had never been an issue up until recently. I hadn’t seen him act this way during the time we were just friends. He’s been staying at my place more often than not because his living situation is less than ideal, and we’ve been talking about moving in together since we were friends but the talks have gotten more serious once we started our relationship (we would have separate bedrooms). 

Yesterday, I went out to lunch with a friend while he was at work. I got a larger version of my sandwich so that I could bring him some leftovers. This man is ALWAYS hungry and I wanted to show him that I was thinking about him. I didn’t end up eating my half and put the whole thing in the fridge thinking we would just eat them together later. When he got home from work, he ate his part of the sandwich while I took a nap. Probably important to add that he is a bartender and when he got home I could tell he had been drinking. 

When I woke up, I took a shower and put on a movie while he went to bed. I knew he was drinking while I was in the shower because I could taste it when he kissed me. He fell asleep and about halfway through my movie he came out of the bedroom while I was eating my sandwich. He asked for a bite and I held it out to him, and jokingly pulled it back when he moved forward. This isn’t out of the ordinary for us, he also has a habit of taking gargantuan bites any time I offer him food. After that, I handed it to him and he took it out of my hand and threw it on the floor. Hard. I was shocked and didn’t move for a second, just sat there staring at it. He went back into the bedroom. 

I cleaned up the mess and then just sat on the couch in silence for a bit staring into the void. This time of year is especially hard for me and he knows this, today (yes, today) is the two year anniversary of my mom’s passing and I told him that I might need a little extra support. I had been crying a little bit throughout the night and he had seen that; he was being sweet up until the sandwich debacle. I texted him that he was being mean, and when he texted me back he essentially told me that he didn’t care. I ended up sleeping on the couch while he slept in my bed. 

Is this something worth breaking up over? If I do, what do I tell him? I do love him but this was so wildly mean and inconsiderate, I feel like he’s showing me his true colors and based on my floor sandwich, the future is looking bleak. If we do break up, should I keep the friendship that we had before?

"My (33M) girlfriend (30F) and I have been together for 2 years. She is, in my opinion gorgeous and I love her very much despite the fact that we have occasional arguments as any couple does. She mentioned months ago that she was thinking about getting Botox done on her face and I communicated to her that i don't think it's something a fit 30 year old needs. She's now going ahead and getting it anyways.

I understand that it's her body and she can do whatever she wants with it but let me explain further. I have always been a rough looking guy, when I met her I actually had a blond mullet lol. Since, as per her request, I have cleaned up, cut my hair, I wear different clothes, I try to look handsome and I've moved out of the construction industry to stop ruining my body and take pride in the way I look. I work out 5 days a week as I now work as a sales person at a gym,l. None of these changes involve needles in my face. 

I have and always will appreciate natural beauty. It's one of the reasons why I fell in love with her, she's ""natural this""  and ""don't buy that, it has harmful chemicals"" that. Now she wants to fill her face with expensive treatments she seriously doesn't need. We are also saving for a house and now she's going to shell out thousands of dollars a year to get this done. 

I've tried to ask her to reconsider, but it appears that my opinion doesn't matter at all. Am I just tripping or is this something that I am justified in feeling? Should I care this much about her body? I could use any advice I could get here, I'm trying to have an open mind, but I'm honestly scared to see what she looks like when she comes home today.",My(33M) girlfriend(30F) is getting Botox,18nsob3,1703180713.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nsob3/my33m_girlfriend30f_is_getting_botox/,
"I’ve posted on here before because I’m in a relationship that is most likely headed for its demise. That’s fine. At this point, calling it off completely is more appealing than trying to feel important or seen in the eyes of my boyfriend. The advice I need now concerns how I should conduct myself over the next few weeks.

Over the past two months, we’ve experienced some really stressful and bizarre moments that are heavily centered around bureaucracy. First, I had a storage unit mysteriously auctioned off (along with several other units &amp; everyone who lost units collectively hired an amazing attorney who is working on compensation and locating personal items) and then when my boyfriend and I were at a performance of The Nutcracker earlier this month, I placed my handbag under my seat and at the end of the performance it was nowhere to be seen (meaning I had to cancel all of my cards, go to the DMV for a new license, etc). We split our time between NYC and Florida, and about a week ago our home in Florida had a leak that wasn’t shut off in time and mold has accumulated (the home was affected by hurricane Ian and there was existing water damage undergoing repairs, so the recent leak has been the final straw for the property &amp; we’re now vacating it completely and trying to decide how to proceed)

Actually, “we” are not vacating the Florida home. I am vacating the Florida home. My boyfriend is in another country right now for his brother’s Christmas Eve wedding. Because water damage and wet walls can’t be ignored and we don’t want for our belongings to be damaged by mold growth, I am now at the Florida property alone trying to pack belongings and move furniture while my boyfriend is abroad. Obviously, I’d never even suggest he miss his brother’s wedding, so me staying behind was the clear choice. 

Last night, someone broke into the property while I was in an upstairs bedroom. I called the police and when I heard the person begin to come upstairs, I threw a pair of scissors that landed perfectly in the wall (the responding LEO complimented my aim and said I should try axe throwing). The intruder ran off and I spent the evening installing extra locks on all windows and doors. When I called my boyfriend, he was reasonably receptive for about two minutes but then began telling me that he “can’t deal with all of the drama in (my) life.” What drama?! To me, drama would be petty and these are serious issues. And most of these issues affect both of us, I’m just the one who stayed back to deal with the mold and now a break in. 

After about five minutes on the phone, he got annoyed and said “I can’t talk right now, my family is all eating dinner and it’s rude for me to be outside on the phone when they’re waiting for me. First you call me because the drywall isn’t drying out and it’s starting to crumble, and now you’re calling me because you’ve had another bad evening dealing with the house. This is the only time I get to see my extended family and you aren’t respecting that. I need to go. You have too much drama in your life and I don’t want to deal with it.”

I was stunned!! Eventually the adrenaline and shock from the break in wore off and I cried for hours. I tried explaining to my boyfriend how scared I was being alone during the break in, and he said that if he’d been there then he’d have just yelled at the person instead of throwing things.

1. Obviously this relationship needs to end

2. I’m here alone for two more weeks while he’s abroad. Given the urgency of the situation with mold growth, I’ll be here solo over Christmas since my family lives in Texas 

3. I’m packing up his clothing and belongings as part of packing up this house and it is taking everything in me to pack his items with care instead of throwing everything out

4. I told him that his family would likely understand his need to take a phone call about a break in, even if they were eating dinner

5. I tried to explain how these situations are neither typical, exclusive to just me, nor in any way “drama.” His response was “It isn’t your fault, I know you say you want a peaceful life but your life just has a lot of drama in it.” My attempts to explain the gravity and severity of recent situations have all been futile. 

6. He never asked me if I was okay after the break in. This has really gotten to me over the past several hours (remember, the break in just happened…)

I’m here solo for two more weeks. Do I refrain from talking to him while he’s abroad? Yes, I’m considering logistics of exiting this relationship, but in the meantime how do I compose myself?? In regards to my boyfriend and his nonchalance, how do I conduct myself??

"I am a 28F who is fat (5'2 ft and 190 lbs). I met my partner (5'10 ft and 209 lbs) on a matrimonial site (common in India where people date with the intent of getting married) in July 2023.

While both of us have been focusing on losing weight, he has a better metabolism and loses weight quicker. Additionally, I have certain medical conditions that make it difficult for me to lose weight as fast as one would normally expect. (for context, I have managed to lose around 10 lbs in the last six months despite leading an active lifestyle and with moderate changes to my diet). I told my partner about my medical conditions a month after we started dating. We were planning to introduce each other to our families in the last week of December.

Sometime in September 2023, my partner complimented me saying how I had all the qualities he was looking for in his SO, and that with time ""I would lose the weight as well"". This did not sit comfortably with me as I felt he was assuming that I would lose the weight eventually, which might not be true. I have dealt with body-image issues my entire life so I told him again about my medical conditions (I did not want him to operate with false hopes). He assured me that he did not care about my weight as long as I was healthy. A similar conversation happened one more time.

Last week, he told me that he did not want to get into a marriage where he or his wife would live an unhealthy lifestyle, and was not happy with how I was not losing weight quickly. I mentioned to him again about my medical conditions and he told me that he would think about it and let me know what he felt. He also asked me what I would do (in addition to what I was currently doing), to ensure I reached the healthier weight faster.

My avoidant personality got triggered by this and we had an ugly fight. I was keen on breaking up with him. By the end of it, he was quite apologetic and told me that he would accept me with my current weight and would like to proceed with the relationship. He also said that he never intended to break-up with me and I had cooked that up in my head. I told him to think about his decision properly before committing and he said he'd like to take some time to think about it.

I love all parts of him (both good and bad), and I was expecting that it would be reciprocated similarly. In that moment, I was frustrated that he would bring up something that I thought had been cleared between the two of us months ago. But now that I am in a calmer headspace, I'm unsure whether I was right to ask for a break-up or not.","My (28 F) partner (28 M) told me he did not want to commit to someone with an ""unhealthy"" lifestyle despite knowing about my medical conditions?!",18nso2n,1703180696.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nso2n/my_28_f_partner_28_m_told_me_he_did_not_want_to/,

Mobile sorry

I [f28] and my fiance [42]  go into an argument early this morning. For context we rent with 2 other roommates S and Y both male. Long story short because im a terrible story teller, I was woken up this morning at 5 am by all three of them in our room. I told them to leave and they did and then I blew up on him telling him how upset I was that i woke up to 2 essential strangers in our room while i slept. I yelled im not going to lie and his response pissed me off even more. He didn't understand why I was upset because he was there too and when I said I was getting a motel for a few days (said out of anger but still said)  he then said he would leave instead and has his bag packed and ready to go but I'm regretting everything I said and begged for another chance but he is set on leaving because apparently there is not coming back from this. 

Pretty cut and dry im the bad guy I won't deny that but he has also pulled the im going to leave card many times before so I don't understand how me threatening to do it was the final straw. I just want to understand where I went wrong, I'm sure it's obvious but I'm emotionally spinning right now and can't think straight. I just want him to stay. So how do I fix this? How do I turn back the clock?

"For context, I 41f wrote to a guy 46m that I’ve been seeing for several weeks that I noticed he was pulling away and expressed curiosity about where his heart is at. He had pursued me hard in the beginning, and now that our schedules have aligned, all the talk of fun holiday plans have disappeared. 

This morning, he writes:

“I understand. I’m sorry. I find myself feeling pretty withdrawn. And I appreciate you offering to create space. I didn’t know if I wanted space, or what. In general, I find myself a bit stalled on dating. I’ve really enjoyed spending time together, but as we talk more and more, cuddle more and more, it feels like a lot. I think maybe I had mentally prepared for occasional dinners or activities as we did our own things much of the time.

I don’t know that I was expecting to meet someone that I was close to so quickly. And I think that gives me pause. And that, combined with the holidays, makes me just want to crawl under a blanket and disengage. And it’s not just dating. It’s just sort of everything. I feel stretched.”

I get that this is him trying to be nice and even if he isn’t saying as much, he’s pulling the brakes on whatever we had. 

How do I bow out of this gracefully? I adore him, but I know that if I continue with someone with this kind of ambivalence, it’s going to devastate future me. I want to convey that I don’t want to go on occasional casual dates, and also that I don’t want to continue being a “friend,” holding out hope that he’ll have a change of heart. At the same time, I want to leave open the possibility of dating more intentionally in the future if he gets his head together. I just don’t want to be his emotional crutch in the process, does that make sense?

"Hey Reddit, I would love to get your insight on this situation I have. My husband (21m) and I (23nb) have been married for 1 year and together for nearly 4 years. To make a long story short, I got home from visiting my mom on her birthday and found him with one of his friends in our bedroom naked just getting done fucking. 

Now for context: We’ve been on and off with the concept of an open relationship. We dabble with the idea whenever one of us brings it up until somebody gets uncomfortable and decides to close the relationship. Wash and repeat that same cycle. This latest time, he proposed to open relationship and I was down as that’s something I’ve usually been down for, with him being the one who typically gets uncomfortable and wants to close the relationship, which I’m totally fine with. When it comes to open relationships for us, it’s not a free-for-all. We’ve had multiple in-depth conversations about how to proceed when situations come up, levels of comfortability, and creating equal boundaries we establish for one another. 

So the other day while I was at work he texted me that his friend was gonna be coming over to hang out at the apartment. Now this friend is someone who we have both messed around with together, but never separately. We typically let each other know if there are intentions of something more happening than hanging out before having the person come to the house. When I get home from work they are watching Netflix and just lying down, but as the night progresses my husband insinuates that I should kiss the friend and tease of kissing the friend too. I’m not much in the mood so I dismiss it. When the friend leaves a time later, my husband communicated that he felt like I didn’t like him and felt like a brick wall had been between us lately. Now, call me oblivious, but I thought things were going fine. Like we didn’t spend much time together, but that’s because we both work a lot to afford our apartment and pay off bills while still trying to spend as much time as we can together. Trying to make the best out of a rough situation kind of deal.

Well, the next morning, the friend came over again at my husband's invitation and as I was getting ready to visit my mom for her birthday, my husband came into the bedroom and asked if he could do “things“ with his friend while I am gone. That’s when I expressed to him in reference to the conversation from the previous night that it wasn’t that “I didn’t like him” but that I was just annoyed at him because he didn’t tell me that he had intentions of being romantic/sexual when he invited his friend over last night and I didn’t like that he waited until the friend was already at our place if they could do stuff, instead of asking before the friend gets there, as it puts me in an awkward position to be in. He said he understood and I said that since he waited till now to ask me about doing stuff with his friends, I was not comfortable with them doing anything romantic or sexual and again he agreed. 

Well as y’all have already read from the beginning, y’all know what happened next. I open the front door expecting them to be watching TV., when I don’t see them in the living room I check the bedroom thinking it’s a joke. As I go to grab the doorknob to open the bedroom door, I don’t just find that it’s locked but also that there was lube on it. He says “Really, hun?” in a laughing joking way that makes me think that maybe the friend had left and that he was just masturbating in there. He takes a second to put on shorts and then opens the door. He says how I am, but I burst through the door to find the friend naked wiping their junk off with a towel. Obviously in shock, I simply walk out and drive out without listening to whatever my husband has to say. 

I tell him to not text me, but after a few hours I text him and we have the following text conversation: 

Me: Why?

H: Why what?

Me: Why did you do sexual things with [friend]?

H: I don’t really know. Something inside me just kinda, gave way. I’m still trying to process it all myself. The only thing I know is that I hurt you. And I know it won’t be an easy thing to deal with. 
All I can say at the moment is I’m truly sorry. 

Me: You literally just cheated on me 

H: I know. I have nothing to say for myself. 

Me: Me neither

H: I love you. And will respect with however you would like to deal with this moving forward. I don’t know how this will turn out, and it scares me. But I also don’t want you to feel like you’re stuck with me, should it come to that. 

Me: Do you want to stay married?
Be honest with yourself, and be honest with me

H: Of course I do. That was never a question in my mind. I do feel like at times we should work on our romances a bit. But I could never see myself leaving you unless it causes us too much pain to be together. I’m sorry I went and fucked it all up. And if I could I would undo it. The biggest regret I have in my life. 

Me: Do you want to keep on fucking [friend]? Again, be honest

H: I would like to be his friend. The fucking was never a real part of the dynamic. He just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I’m trying to find the right way to phrase everything. But I can’t.

Me: You’ve broken me.

H: And I cannot apologize enough to make up for it.
I know this was a colossal fuck up. 
Do you still want to stay married?

Me: Not sure anymore

H: Fair

My question to you Reddit, is this something I can get passed and we can work on together? I have already scheduled a couples therapy session (which is something we do regularly for better communication in the relationship) for later today to try and see how I’m feeling. There’s just a mixture of things that I am feeling like disappointment, anger, numbness, tiredness, and sadness for the future that I thought we would have together 😢 Is there any good advice y’all have for me?

Also quick note: this isn’t the first time he has done this. With the same friend, he told me they did oral without my consent, but I decided to forgive him as I understand the feeling of getting swept away by lust in the past, but nothing to this extreme and definitely not while being married.

"My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 and 1/2 years, and a few months into the relationship she and her ex reconnected as friends. I was fine with it at first because I've done the same thing in the past. But then they started talking all the time, like almost everyday, and then hanging out just the two of them every once in a while. But when they hung out it would be for almost the entire day and well into the night. They would go hang out at coffee shops together, go shopping together, and watch movies late at night together (just the two of them). They even get gifts for each other around birthdays and holidays, and he has even had gifts doordashed to her while I was with her at her house, which I did not react very well to.

I've expressed my concern many times and I'm now to the point where I fully express my dislike for him because I don't trust his intentions. Before she and I met, he fully admitted to her that he had feelings for her still, and she turned him down. She tells me I have no reason to worry and that even if he has those feelings he won't act on them out of respect to her and our relationship. But that doesn't make me feel much better because she's acknowledging that he still might have feelings for her and she still choosing to be close to him despite how I feel.

I've tried to see if the three of us could hang out so I could get to know him better and alleviate some anxiety that I've been having about him. But every time I've tried to get us all to hang out, my girlfriend is very reluctant about it and expresses how she wants to just have her own friends without her partner needing to be friends with them. And she eventually admitted that he has no interest in getting to know me and would be uncomfortable being around me. Which to me is a huge red flag to me, because I've been nothing but nice to him the few times I've met him.

He recently moved far away to Maryland which I thought would make things better for me. But they still talk everyday and now have even started regularly video chatting on Discord together, and for hours at a time (in fact, last night they watched a movie together on Discord).

"I’m reaching out for advice following posting on AITA regarding an argument with a friend that took place about a year and a half ago. I hadn’t written anything about it online due to my belief that I was in the right, with all of my friends backing me up. I started to worry that maybe I was just being a giant asshole, so I posted on AITA, where I was voted Not the Asshole. However, many people discussed their opinion that I should go no contact with my friend. This isn’t super feasible, so I’m hoping that others can help with suggestions on where I could go from here. I feel trapped and am building up so much resentment.

Here is the AITA thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lbg5s/aita_for_not_cutting_my_single_mother_friend_more/

I assume most people aren’t going to read it there, so I’m going to give a very brief summary here. My friend purposefully chose to be a single mother. After having her child, she refused to go anywhere without her (which is totally understandable), but she also did not want to miss out on events, so she has regularly brought her child to inappropriate events. I became frustrated on one occasion in which she snapped at me, telling me not to talk to her in a restaurant because she was trying to get her baby to sleep (with a sound machine). I responded, feeling hurt and frustrated, with something along the lines of “you brought your baby into a crowded restaurant.” She called me a few days later telling me that she needed me to not criticize her parenting as she’s having a hard enough time as it is. I told her I didn’t think it was fair to tell me I couldn’t respond after she’s rude to me. She responded with “you’re breaking my heart right now.” Her point of view is that I should just assume that she knew she did something wrong and would self-correct. We eventually agreed to disagree.

Since that time, she has not demonstrated any self-correction. She regularly brings her child to places that the rest of my friend group and I think are inappropriate. She doesn’t want to miss out on things, which I understand, but I really really miss being able to spend time with my friend without her child. I have only seen her without her child on one occasion in the past 2 years, which was a bachelorette party (luckily she realized on this one occasion that she shouldn’t bring a baby). It should be noted that her parents are available to babysit often and love spending time with her (she has told me she doesn’t love leaving the baby with them because she feels like her child loves her grandma more than her). When she brings her child, naturally her full attention is on the child. I don’t begrudge her that. But it’s really hard to have a conversation with her. She interrupts any sentences that anyone says by talking to her child, even when it seems unnecessary. Or she starts playing with loud children’s toys (think a xylophone) early in the morning after she knows we’ve been drinking. Or she gets unnecessarily upset that I don’t want to change seats so she can sit next to her child even when there’s like 5 other people who would be happy to move (I didn’t want to move because I have hearing problems and wanted to be able to hear everything – not that I was trying to be difficult). There are absolutely occasions in which I would rather her not come if she doesn’t want to have someone babysit.

We have a very close knit friend group dating back to 2008 when we met in college. Most of my friends are very conflict avoidant. They all agree that she is doing things that are not appropriate and are problematic for the child. They won’t say anything to her because of being conflict avoidant and also how our friend treated me when I dared to say something against her.  Everyone is scared of her.

A little backstory – she has always been very controlling. I cut her a lot of slack when we were younger because I didn’t think she knew how to handle difficult situations. I remember the first time I noticed this was when she was very rude to an employee at a fast food restaurant for getting her order wrong. She also has regularly had panic attacks when anyone spills anything on her furniture despite insisting that most events in our friend group are held at her house. She values her belongings far more than she values being nice to us when accidents happen. I have social anxiety that has absolutely been exacerbated by her controllingness. On one occasion someone else spilled something on a piece of her furniture and I was paralyzed with indecision on how to help, since she used to get angry when we used her paper towels instead of rags, but I couldn’t figure out which one she wanted me to get her in the moment without her getting angry. After how upset she wasat me about that I ended up lying catatonic on the floor for hours. (I’ve gotten therapy and medications, I handle situations much better now. I’m still bitter about it though). She is also controlling in that we can’t say or do certain things near her. We can’t talk about ants. We can’t gently toss items to her. She was told by her therapist to set boundaries, but apparently never learned what a real boundary looks like instead of trying to control everyone around her. I have been trying to work on dealing with this, and it was absolutely getting better before she had her baby. But the baby reverted everything.

At the moment, my friendship with her is extremely strained. We used to talk everyday on the phone, now we only talk for logistics for events with our friends. I would be willing to go non-contact for a while for my own sanity, if not for my other friends. It’s not possible to stop engaging with her without losing all of the good things about the friend group. We get together for major holidays and birthdays every year. We also go on a weekend trip every labor day. We are each other’s support system and I want them all to be in my bridal party when I get married soon.

I would love to tell her that I want to spend at least some time with her without her child, but she has made it extremely clear that she does not want my opinion about where and when she chooses to bring her child. She has occasionally asked my other friends if her child is welcome at certain events, but she either specifically chooses the friends that she knows will always say yes, or asks in ways that make it very awkward to say no (example, “It’s okay that I bring [child] right?”). I think she thinks she’s making an effort (and I guess she is in a way), but I am never consulted about whether I think it’s a good idea to bring her. I feel like I don’t have any choice in the matter if I want to spend time with my friends. I live a couple hours away from the rest of them, so it’s hard for me to schedule time to see friends and leave her out entirely. I also feel really rude intentionally leaving her out of things rather than giving her the benefit of the doubt that she might realize she should ask to bring her child. The only thing I feel I can control is my birthday event, which last year I made very clear that it was a child-free event.

I should also make it clear that I do very much love her child and there are many instances in which I want to spend time with her. I have spent time with the two of them by myself and it’s always a lot easier in those instances. I just don’t want a child around in the instances where I know we’ll be drinking and trying to relax, or in situations where we end up needing to babysit (she brought her child while we tried on bridesmaid dresses and let her crawl away into another area – I felt like I had to go chase her). I don’t want to feel resentment every time I see the child because I have to be on pins and needles anytime I interact with my friend.

So the advice I need – Do I just suck it up and recognize that she’s a single mother who’s anxious and probably not sleeping, hoping that this will get better in a few years? Is there something I could say to her without her exploding at me and guilt tripping me again? Is there any way that someone has handled a similar situation that has worked out?



TLDR: I feel trapped in a friendship group where a friend regularly brings her child to inappropriate events, is controlling and rude about it, and none of my other friends will say something to her. The one time I said something to her, she told me I was breaking her heart by daring to criticize her.

"I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for close to two years and it’s been really great. However, I’ve recently been looking back on my life with a particular focus on my sexuality and realised that I’m extremely attracted to women (I thought it was just me looking at women through a sexualised male-gaze of sorts, developed because of my surroundings growing up). It’s something that I’d really like to explore, but a similar thing came up for a female friend of mine a while back and when I brought it up to my partner he said “but they’re in a monogamous relationship, she should either break up with him or let go of wanting to actively pursue the thought”. 
I’m nervous that I’ll slowly start to resent him for no good reason if I can’t explore this part of me, and I obviously don’t want to do it without his knowledge. But I can’t shake the feeling that if I bring it up, he’ll give me two similar options.

"Hello Strangers,
I'll try to be as short as possible, my girlfriend of two years broke up with me a month ago. 
The conversation about the breakup started because we were losing intimacy in the bedroom and it lead to her saying some pretty horrible things. 

She said she doesn't feel alive with me, she doesn't feel attraction or love, but she thinks of me more as a friend than anything else. I could see from her body language that she really meant it, she said all this like we were talking about the weather while i was trying to keep it together.
I know it's gonna sound made up, but while she was breaking up with me, her first priority was to find somewhere to buy cigarettes because she just lit up the last one in her packet.

What really hurts is that she didn't say that her love for me dwindled over time, but she specifically expressed that 
 it was never there, same with the physical attraction. 

Keep in mind that this girl threw herself at me when we met, and i mean it almost literally. Like, she started to take billiards lessons in order to come play where i go with my friends, She texted me 24/7, i'm pretty shy and dense with girls, so in a last hail mary she also told me she dreamt of us having sex to make me get the hint.

It's been two years and there have been no signals of anything that could make me suspect of this situation, we had discussions about her declining sex libido a few times in the past 6 months, but she just shrugged it off and gave the justification that it was a particulary stressfull period of her life. (an aunt that she was particularly affectionate with died of cancer in april).

I tried to give her space and time but the situation didn't improve, hence the discussion last month. 
I booked an appointment with a psychologist to try and unravel the trauma that she gave me, i feel worthless, unloveable, angry. 


So, people of relationship advice that already went through something similar. How did you start your path to get over it? How do you stop thinking that you wasted your life for two years to live in a lie? How do you start trusting potential partners again after this?

Hey everyone, so basically, I [19M] started staying at my [24M] friends house for the past 2 months, he has a girlfriend, and she has a [18F] sister, let's call her Amy.

Until about a month ago, Amy and I didn't really speak much, until one night, we both just started breaking the ice with eachother, we spoke in the lounge until about 2 in the morning even though she had finals at 8 the next morning.
From there, we'd been starting to speak more gradually, we'd basically speak in the lounge while watching movies or whatever until 12-2 in the morning, we realised we both have quite a lot in common, we have the same personality type, have a fair amount of interest in common, I've started teaching her how to cook, she even started watching football with me and seems really into it. 

At the time, I had been a month out of my 3 year relationship, so I wasn't really looking to getting into anything as I was still quite hurt from everything. 

While speaking in the lounge until late, I've noticed her body language is really towards me if that makes sense, she faces my way and brushes her hair a lot, not sure if that means anything though. She asked me why I stayed up so late, I told her it's nice speaking to her, she said it's mutual.

Shortly after, I found her Instagram account and saw she has a boyfriend, so I was a bit confused to be honest. She did bring him up not too long after that, so it's not like she was planning on hiding him from me. She saw him for that weekend, and before, she mentioned she didn't really feel like seeing him, since they hadn't seen eachother for 3 months, and their texts were one worded. 

Fast forward to last week, I went out to a club with my friend, his gf and Amy. When we got just above tipsy I noticed she started having more physical contact, such as playfully hitting me and things like that, which she doesn't normally do. This is where things started becoming really confusing to me, so my friend and his sister decided to go home, with the car, so we stayed there a bit longer. When we did decide to leave I asked Amy if she wanted to Uber, she said she would prefer walking (which was a 30 minute walk at 2). We started walking and we randomly started holding hands, she asked if it's weird, I just said no it's all good. Maybe it was because she was drunkish or scared I'm not sure, but the fact that she has a long distance relationship boyfriend and did that started making me ask questions. 

And what makes me question it more, she has a male friend who likes her, and especially recently he has been seeing her more and visiting, he admitted to liking her 2 weeks ago, she told him she doesn't like him and has a boyfriend, they agreed to continuing being friends, and shortly he came over and we were watching a movie with the family, and he was sitting next to her, and was holding her leg, I saw she was uncomfortable. She told me the next day that she didn't know what to do in that situation, and she was very uncomfortable with everything, which makes me wonder why she wasn't uncomfortable with holding my hands for 30 minutes, maybe just the alcohol?

We've still been speaking for the past week, and didn't bring up anything about holding hands, so I'm not sure what to do with that, because I feel like I want to know from her why she did that, but I don't want to ask her directly because it might make things awkward between us, so I'm trying asking her if how her boyfriend would feel about the situation by starting the conversation.

My ex did a lot of bad things to me, I don't want to go into detail because that's not the issue now. Just imagine them as a very toxic and manipulative boyfriend. Well at my graduation he decided to come and apologize to me crying. He cried and I gave him a hug, I told him if he needed to talk that we should unblock each other to talk (a mistake). We have been talking, since I have already overcome a large part of what happened to me with him, I think I spoke to him like another friend, he told me that he wanted to give me a gift. I told him that a gift wouldn't make me forget anything, but after so much insistence,I accepted it, he said giving me a gift would mean a lot to him.I don't know when he will give it to me but I told him that starting in January I didn't want to talk to him anymore because I wanted to start my life again, since this year I fell into a lot of depression and anxiety and finally after breaking up with him I was healing.
We recently spoke one early morning and he confessed to me that he had a suicide letter that he lost and wrote it recently. I was shocked, I got nervous, I cried. I wish I had never known that... now my thoughts revolve around where he will be and if he will actually do it. It scares me a lot because he already tried it 1 year ago. He told me it would be after January and give me the gift because he really wanted to do that and it would make him feel better...but what about me?

It’s a long story, but we have known each other for 18 months give or take, never had a label, we go from dating, to FWB, to just friends, to FWB. 

I moved into his this year - spare room - so I could save money and help with a business that we run together. 

Every time we have this conversation about us; he makes it very clear that he doesn’t want to be with me. 

We sleep together now and then, but always go to bed in separate beds unless drunk. 

Every time I come to terms with everything and start dating, he does something to pull me back, whether that’s taking me out somewhere nice, being really intimate in the house, or just sex. 

I did two boudoir shoots this year, which I got on my own accord. But he went and got me another for Christmas and then proceed to send me lingerie options. 

We definitely have a complicated relationship, and there’s been some things we’ve both done that aren’t OK in any level. 

I’m just very confused as his family members say they think he’s changing his mind about us (as in wants us to be a thing), and then he goes and buys me something so intimate. I wouldn’t even buy that for my girl friends. They’re quite pricey too!

My background is a little complicated, growing up my mom had passed away when I was very young and my dad was an abuser for years.

It doesn't stop me from having my meltdowns that I have in secret and being in a bad mood for no reason (well, I do take hormones now so it might be the cause) but I don't unleash on people unless they bother me first.

Today was one of those days, I was a little moody but more anxious than anything and as we were on the car she needed help finding a parking spot, I was panicking inside and I didn't hear her talking to me, as she parked the car she called me selfish and that I only look after myself when she knows it's not true at all.
I told her she hurt my feelings, could've said more but I kept it short since I didn't want to have an anxiety attack on someone I love and respect dearly... this only happens when I do 1 thing she didn't enjoy, dismissing everything good I have ever done.

She proceeded to tell me that I'm not a bad person too but that I was very selfish still. Is that a thing?

"I (25F) still think my boyfriend (28M) is cheating


Some info are edited but are not relevant. I don't live in the US as well so please keep that in mind when reading this. 

I'm (25F) in a relationship with my bf (28M ) over a year now. And it was fairly perfect for the most part, except for the past month. 

Last month, boyfriend's ex got added to their team at work. I believe they had no contact after we got together and I had no reason to believe otherwise. Their relationship ended badly hence, no contact. However, due to their unavoidable situation, they need to talk to each other. And I understand that. 

However, my boyfriend had an free time from work and informed me that he wil go somewhere. No information on where to go or who he was with. Of course this bothered me, but I let it go at first. Until I still receive no updates and no replies for the whole day and night. So this is where I'm wrong, I snooped around and learned that he went with his ex. 

We fought, I almost broke up with him until he tried to explain that he only went there with her but did  not spent it with her. At the time when we were talking I see the sincerity with him. That he feels nothing but guilt. 

After that I tried to move on. But I don't feel comfortable with them still talking (his ex called him once in the middle of the night, he says it's because of work). I can't stop asking to see his social media (which doesn't want to show me to which he reasoned as it might cause a fight) but I don't know what to do, or how to stop thinking about it. 

When we talk about it (believe me, we still talk about it because I can't stop), I see his sincerity about it. But I still feel that he's hiding something. Every sweet thing he does now feel like compensating for what he's hiding.

"For context, my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now. We only knew each other for six days before we started dating, which to me, was a little nerve wracking. I’ve never jumped into a relationship so fast, but everything sort of “clicked” and I felt very comfortable right from the start.

The first few months of us dating, we would spend all of our time together, even if we would only have enough time to see each other for half an hour, we’d still make the effort to spend time with each other. We would go on dates, watch movies together, go for long drives together, and did almost everything together. The relationship was amazing, I never once questioned that he loved me. I put in so much effort and received so much in return. 

After 3 or so months went by, he started to change. He would become distant. He seemed less interested in me, didn’t seem to want nearly as much to do with me. He started to get worries that I was going to leave him for someone else, even though he himself stated that he had no reason for thinking so. He started making fun of me for things I’m insecure about, for example, my appearance. I’ve always had horrible bags under my eyes that make me feel ugly, and one day he commented on it saying that I “look like I got punched in the face.” I started going back to the gym because I’m looking to build some muscle and feel healthier. He was more concerned with and worried about the fact that my “ass and tits will go away” if I lose any weight. I’ll put on music in the car, and he will turn it off and say, “this is the shittiest song I’ve ever heard.” I’m also looking for a new car, and I’ll get excited about a car I’m interested in purchasing, and I’ll show him the pictures, and he will usually say something along the lines of, “you like the ugliest shit ever.” 

He makes me feel so bad about myself sometimes. And I know that I deserve better. I give him all of my love and respect. I always make sure to support him, compliment him, and make sure he never feels how I feel. 

It seems like he doesn’t care at all sometimes. I had to BEG him to buy me a bouquet of flowers after we had been dating for 7 months and I had never received flowers from him. He’s never texted me a paragraph about how much he loves me, only has ever bought me chocolate on Valentine’s day, and so on. However, it’s not even these things that bother me, it’s mostly the way he talks to me and expresses that he doesn’t want to spend time with me. 

Yet, he’s so nice sometimes. Sometimes he will do small favors, say nice things, or offer to do an activity I like. Unfortunately, it’s usually only when he’s trying to cheer me up after he’s ruined my mood. 

Why did he change? Is there any way to salvage the relationship and get it back to the way it once was? 

Any advice would be appreciated!","my (21f) boyfriend (21m) is so mean to me, yet so nice at the same time.",18nr6c3,1703176757.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nr6c3/my_21f_boyfriend_21m_is_so_mean_to_me_yet_so_nice/,

Hi guys I am a 22(F) and been seeing a 23(M) for about a year. We met while in South America, and live in opposite ends of the US. We have basically never stopped talking since meeting. It was such a great connection, and we’ve flown to see each other in our respective homes whenever we have the time/money. These visits are usually two week long intense periods of being super in love. We have a wonderful super healthy, communicative, and loving relationship. 

The real issue is our connection is SO different in person than on the phone (which is the majority of the time). We don’t talk as much as I’d like, but I don’t want to ask him to be more attentive because it feels needy. I know I’m young, but I think he’s the most special person I’ve ever dated. I don’t think he’s my PERFECT match, but it’s by far the happiest and safest relationship I’ve ever had. 

What should I do? I want a relationship like this that exists in person (obviously) but don’t want to end things with him and don’t feel ready to drop everything and move to the opposite side of the country for him. I worry that if we continue what we are doing, someone will end up getting hurt or it will turn sour.

"Back in March, I had met my now girlfriend at the store. I asked for her number, and she invited me to a club that Saturday night. When I went, she had brought another guy with her who had driven her there. Pretty much the whole time we were there, she was all over this dude. There were multiple times where I was left alone at our booth for up to an hour while they were nowhere to be found. They'd just keep leaving the booth together and coming back all night. Naturally I was pretty pissed. I felt led on and felt like my one night off was completely wasted. I had no idea why she even invited me out when she was clearly into this guy. I told her I was really tired and left.

I didn't hear much from her after that, until about a month later. She invited me out to that same club again, but told me we'd be alone. So I went. To my surprise, she was now all over me, touching me and kissing me like crazy. The next day she asked me to be her boyfriend, and I said yes, because I really did like her, and I hadn't had a girlfriend in 7 years. But I did ask her about the other guy. She claimed that he was just a friend who got way too clingy, and she stopped talking to him because he kept begging her to date him. She has talked about him a lot since then, but always said he was a whiny bitch who couldn't handle rejection. I didn't think much of it, but she did bring it up fairly often. I just assumed the guy made her feel so smothered that she had to keep venting about it.

We've been dating for almost a year, and everything seemed to go great. Until last night. We were out to dinner with one of her sisters who I had never met before (she lives in a different state and is visiting for Christmas), and she was commenting about what a good couple we made. Then she asked my GF, ""See? Aren't you glad things with the other guy didn't work out?"" My gf snapped a nasty look at her sister, who realized her mistake and quickly tried to change the subject. I tried to shake it off, but couldn't stop thinking about it. After we got home, I hate to say it, but I went through her phone because I couldn't sleep. I saw that she had never deleted her messages with this other guy, and I went through them from beginning to end.

According to the texts, this is the actual story. Her and this guy met at work, and started a friends with benefits situation. But after a few weeks, she was asking him out on dates, and texting him more and more often. She then asked him to be her boyfriend, but he gave her the runaround about how he wasn't looking for that right now. They kept talking after that, but it was always my GF texting him like crazy and him giving one or two word responses. She also bombarded him with nude pics and videos, quite a few he didn't even respond to. And she'd text him Goodnight with a kiss emoji every night, which he never replied to.

The week leading up to the time we all went to the club, she was basically begging him to date her. Sending him essay long texts about why they should be together, and how great of a partner she'd be. He said he'd think about it. A few weeks after the night we were at the club, she asked him what he thought about dating. He said he still wasn't sure, and he thought it was weird I invited that other guy (being me) to come with us. And this is the part where my heart broke.

She told him that it was a stupid idea, but her whole reason for inviting me out was to make him jealous, and send him a message of, ""You better snatch me up, because if not, I've got other guys interested in me, as you can see."" He just went off on her after that. He said the fact that she'd use some poor guy that liked her as bait to try and get him interested just proved that she was shitty and selfish, and only cared about what she wanted. They went back and forth, until he told her he didn't want to talk to her or see her anymore.

She actually left him alone, until about two months ago. I thought it wouldn't get any worse, but she started texting him again, talking about how much she missed him, and how she was really bored being with me. She said she wanted to meet up with him to sleep together, but he said no. She asked if he'd at least let her give him a bj, and he said, ""Look, I told you I didn't want to talk to you anymore, but you obviously can't respect that, so I'm blocking you."" That was their last interaction.

"So my boyfriend and I have been together for six years and we are looking at moving in together in January. We are pretty young so this will be our first time living together as a couple but we both have lived away from home due to college. We're very excited to start our lives together.

However, without going to detail, my boyfriend experienced minor neglect. His family is wealthy and he was always monetarily provided for but his parents were very hands off and did not teach him basic life skills.  His parents, especially his mom, also have a history of mental illness and hoarding disorders specifically. When my boyfriend was 15, his childhood home burned down in a freak accident which compounded the already existing hoarding and disorganization tendencies in his family. 

He also went undiagnosed with ADHD until a few years ago which is now treated with medication and therapy but still acts up, especially around organization and cleaning. He struggles with object permanence and executive dysfunction.

My boyfriend is amazing and wants to get help to deal with organization and hoarding. He is working through the emotional part in therapy but we are trying to figure out some practical tools to keep our apartment organized and to break those habits.

"Me and her are long distance. Together 18 months. Had a wobbly patch a few months back but that seems very much past us now. 

However, I have noticed little things in her social media attitude towards me are different. For one, she removed 3 photos related to me in her Instagram highlights bubbles. 2 of us together from when she was slightly heavier in weight, but also one of a teddy bear I bought her for valentines. There still remains one photo of us together smiling, so I don't know if there's anything wrong there. 

Also, however, she stopped liking my Instagram stories. She used to like 90% of them, now she hasn't like 4 of the last 5. Again I don't know if this is a sign of anything or just dumb social media noise I shouldn't read into, but I can't tell.

"Hello, I (23F) currently have a partner (22F) who is courting me. Though I haven't said ""yes"" to her, we have agreed to remain mutually exclusive thus the term partner. The past few months have been very good, though one thing I noticed about her is that, she can be very sensitive when it comes what I say.  
  
One time, we were talking about how she doesn't like being treated or given stuff because it would be used against her that someone bought her this or that and I understand where she's coming from. However, sometimes she would also point out the amount of money she spends on me (I think she doesn't realize or her intention to point it out), saying that she hope what she spent doesn't go to waste or ends up in the losing side.  
  
Now here's the problem, she asked once to borrow money from me to pay her doctor and I was really hesitant because I have a sensitive side when it comes to money (stems from trauma and anxiety from past experiences) and said just please pay it. She said of course she'll pay and asked when did she ever ask money from me without paying. I said there was this one time that she asked money to pay for food for her younger relatives (we hanged out). She got really offended and said that I insisted that she shouldn't pay anymore. To be honest, I don't remember saying that because I remember that I was waiting for her at the back of my mind to send money for two weeks and eventually forgot to get it back. I honestly don't mind that she doesn't pay it back anymore because she also treats me but I also only answered her question honestly. And now she's saying she doesn't want to receive anything from me.  
  
This isn't the first time that she got offended from what I said. There are many times that we would get into an argument because I merely answered her question honestly and straight-forwardly and sometimes, I have a hard time saying how I feel because I'm afraid of getting into an argument and would rather just not comment or saying anything. She's also easily triggered due to her past relationships and I really understand that but sometimes, I don't have the capacity to handle how she acts out when triggered.  
  
Can anyone give advice on how to handle this better? I really want to be a better partner for her but I'm afraid that there is a limit to what I know and what I am doing at the moment.

"I saw Hinge pop up on my girlfriend’s phone last night and naturally I got concerned. She’s claiming she’s only on there for friends and showed that her feed is only searching for other women, but she is bisexual so that doesn’t put me at ease. She has 5 current matches with girls and 163 “hidden” ones that I do not know the time they’re from nor the gender of those matches. Also, after looking at her profile, none of the prompts were in any way indicative that she is strictly looking for friends. There was a period of a couple months where we had broken up but were still living together, so if those matches are from that period then it’s still weird to me but at least I can understand that easier, but I asked her to prove that they were all from when we weren’t together and she’s declining to do so.

My reaction is to break up with her over this and a myriad of other factors, such as her screaming at me at the top of her lungs the day before all this. In this scenario she had a bad day and I didn’t do exactly what she wanted with the groceries when she brought them home. That’s not the first time that’s happened and she’s claiming that I should cut her some slack when she has a bad day, but I don’t think a bad day warrants talking to me like that and screaming at me. 

When I mentioned wanting to break up last night, she tried to swallow all of her prescription pills and now I’m feeling guilty and getting worried about what she’ll do if I follow through with this. But at the end of the day I think still need to do what is best and healthy for me, and if she needs additional help I can aid her in finding it.

Do you consider being on hinge and hiding it from a significant other to be cheating or grounds for breaking up? She claims she never did anything with the people she’s matched with, but that’s something that someone can easily lie about as well, and the fact that she’s not showing me other times/types of matches is making me suspicious.

"I’m getting serious with this man but it is very early on though we’ve been in conversation since early October of this year, so a few months. He happened to speak on his past relationships about his most recent ex and how she was the closest thing he ever had to a best friend they were super close then tried to be in a relationship but it didn’t work out for them she then got pregnant by her ex so they took a break and once the baby was a little older they talked things out and tried for a relationship again but that time it didn’t work out again and she said it was best they weren’t in a relationship. The last time he had seen her was in August for her son’s birthday party he was there and has a good relationship with her family and all. Mind you her son is currently 3 years old.

So he went to the game they exchanged gifts at her parents house the gifts were there I guess and he talked with her parents for a bit and headed home. He said no flirting or anything happened between him and the ex. It was all just for the kid and to exchange gifts.

"I have a crush on a guy I met at the uni library. I saw him almost everyday in the past month but other than some occasional smiles, greetings and sharing some snacks we never had a full conversation because of the library setting. We always sat at the same table, he either sat right in front of me or the place next to that in a way that we are facing each other. 

One day I realized he was wearing a ring on his left ring finger, a basic silver ring that really looks like a wedding band and he continued wearing that ring everytime I saw him after that. I don’t know whether he’s married or not. I can’t find the courage to talk with him to get to know him more because of this. I also don’t want myself getting attached to a married person. But there is one thing that confuses me. He’s always at the library. He comes around 4-5 pm and stays past 11 pm everyday, including fridays.

"Context: I was told of his friend’s bowling birthday party and I asked if it was an all guy’s thing, to which I was told my partner would ask. It was mentioned multiple times he would be asked, whether it was me or him bringing it up. This is the second time I was told of a friend’s birthday and then refused to not be asked if I can accompany him. The first time was more out of the blue so I tried to not be so hurt. This time I still tried to not be hurt because I was trying to be grateful they could spend guy time since I think his friend craved that with him honestly, or at least highly values it. It’s weird because I’ll hear crude remarks from my partner that “all guy” is “g*y” and a “sausage fest” before, I get told he would want me there obviously since I’m his girlfriend, and then get told I’m not wanted there by him (which hurts the more I think about it).

"I have been feeling for a long time there have been issues, mainly communication, issues in our relationship but whenever I try to talk to her about this it always just ends in a fight. I've been feeling a distance growing between us because of this, but these past six months have really been driving it to a point where I've been having trouble functioning day to day.

Communication has never been easy between us, in the beginning of the relationship, back in 2020, we were both coming fresh out of some pretty horrible situations, and I think the moment we found each other we saw a way to get out of what was hurting us. I know this isn't a good foundation for a relationship, but in the beginning I think I let the excitement cloud my judgment and I pushed to the back of my head a lot of the signs of problems that were present. Back then I had learned really quickly that when something hurt me, it was best not to bring it up, because it would just cause a fight, it was better to just let things go how she wanted and when I did that everything was smooth sailing. The pattern was always the same, I bring up some issue that was bothering me, she would bring up something I had done, or some behavior of mine she didn't like, then would start crying and leave the room. After about 15 minutes she'd come back out just as happy or fine as she was before the argument, and I needed to be too because if I showed signs I was still hurt by it she'd accuse me of ruining our time together over nothing.

This last fall I was in the unfortunate position of having to work 20-30 hrs a week, go to school full time, and also be a full time math tutor for my wife (often 4+ hours a night). This led to a lot of conflict as, whenever I would try to do one of my own papers or projects she would accuse me of ignoring her, or not wanting to help her, and would storm out of the room crying, and the cycle would repeat itself. This became an almost daily occurrence, and when I would try to talk to her about it she would bring up something, like say my tone sounded irritated during tutoring and that triggered her ""but she didn't think it was worth bringing up"", or something to avoid the conversation entirely.

The semester ended a few weeks ago and I was so happy, I was hoping things could go back to normal but my first night of work after school was out I ended up having to stay 15 minutes overtime, since I was closing the store I work at. When I called her when I left work she sounded completely broken apart, told me she threw the dinner she made for me in the fridge and to not talk to her since I clearly didn't want to and hung up. When I got home I tried to give her some snacks I had gotten her, and she seemed ok at first until I told her I was going to go eat then come to bed, when she completely melted down again. the next day she texted me and said she was taking me out to dinner and was sorry she acted like that, but when we tried to talk she just said ""I feel I deserve all of your time, it should all be with me, and it upset me that time was being stolen""

I have been feeling really distant from all of this, and the day before yesterday I tried one more time to talk to her about this, in the most gentle way I could but still it ended the same as normal. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I've never felt as empty or distant from everything around me as I do right now, and I have no idea what to do now. she was more affectionate than usual toward me yesterday, and clearly knew something was wrong, but seeing her seem so fine, as if nothing was wrong has me feeling like I must be crazy for thinking there's a problem.

"Its not like she doesn't want to pay, its just she doesn't even know that we should split it or that she should pay sometimes since we are just uni students and live off on parents money. I just don't wanna talk about this w/ her directly but i wanna convey my message to her that she should split.

Even at times i had my card declined on purpose because i could've got broke for the month. So she pays. It's not like she doesn't get money from her parents or something like this, but she just doesn't know. She is not a bad person at all, I love her a lot and i wanna marry her. She also gave me a birthday party, her birthday, and i freaking paid for it. But when she goes out with her friends, she's the one paying most times, even if i'm accompanying them.

I don't know what to do. But also I don't wanna straight up tell her that i go broke every month because of us eating out. I've tried a lot of things like "" my parents reduced my pocket money"" and "" my card is not working

"Is this cheating? And am I being a bad person to her for saying it is when it isn't if it isn't? I genuinely cannot tell right now because of the things she has been saying to me.

Context is I knew they were flirting and I said it had to stop because I was not comfortable with it. I told both of them individually.

I caught my GF last night because I had her phone in my hand and the notification appeared. 

She had told me that she would delete Snapchat a long time ago but continued to keep it apparently behind my back. 

Last night I talked about it with her and said I understand she is upset but I set a boundary and she broke it and I don't know what to do.

This morning she has been angry *at me* saying ""you're making me cut my friends out of my life.""
I said don't get mad at me get mad at her I'm not your punching bag. You and your friend made you cut them out of your life because you promised me you'd stop. 

So I don't know genuinely if I'm in the wrong here what the fuck am I supposed to do? What do I even do now? Do I apologize to her am I wrong about this being cheating?

(also, I got yelled at for gaming with a ""girl"" (ftm), while she has been (""not"") cheating on me. That is the context in this image and naturally she provides none of it to this person. I told her she was being sexist because she wouldn't have cared if I was playing with a guy. It only mattered to her because of a gender, which this person doesn't even identify as female and has a boyfriend. She flipped out on me and I responded back equally because I wasn't prepared to be yelled at for gaming with someone of the ""wrong gender."" It genuinely disgusted me.) 
I find it particularly wild because I was being treated like a cheater for gaming with someone of the opposite sex, while she was receiving flirtatious (or not?) messages the very same day. It hurts a lot

"My bf (30M) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years. He’s thinking about marriage and wanting multiple kid(s) right after getting married but I do not want kids yet. 

Reason is because I am not financially or emotionally stable enough to raise child(ren) and even though he makes enough to support us + 1 kid, I want to be financially independent/establish my career before thinking about wanting kids. 

I love him though, I’m just not ready. He told me if we should end the relationship if I don’t want children, he said he’s not getting younger and doesn’t want to wait any longer to have children. I know he loves me a lot, he shows it to me everyday and we get along so well, but i don’t feel like putting my time and energy on raising kids just yet. 

If we breakup, I’m afraid I’ll never be able to find someone who knows how to love me the way he does. Will I regret having kids this young or will I regret not having kids this young?

I feel stuck because on one hand I don’t want him to feel uncomfortable however on the other hand I do not really want to give up on my friends. Most of my friends are ex-colleagues from my previous workplaces (who don’t know each other). I somehow end up having male friends because my industry is male dominated.

"36M BF still texting a girl 35F

Long story short because I literally just found out 5 min ago. 
Me and my baby daddy have been off and on for years call it 8 yrs 
We’re in the process of working things out for good. Things have been going well. He spends the night, we go on family trips etc. still won’t call me his gf but that’s another story 
Since the beginning of our relationship/friendship there has been this friend let’s call her Karen (35F). In the beginning I had absolutely no problem with her… I knew they would talk once in a while but that was pretty much about it to my knowledge. Turns out that at some point he started to lie to me about talking to her and hanging out with her…. Turns out they were actually a couple in HS. And whatever it was so long ago. 
I eventually found out and he told me I was being crazy and that’s she’s just a friend blah blah (she supposedly is Married) 😑
So anyways she’s always been a thorn in my side.. at one point I decided to make peace with her and that was that. Still I found out he was lying about her…. By then we were off. 
Fast forward to now 2023 I decided to just go through his messages found nothing then I looked in the “recently deleted” hello and behold 
Karen was still there…. 
So now I’m debating rn as I’m taking OUR son to school, after I spent the whole night taking care of 36M BF because he’s been deathly sick, 
Whether or not to say something…..
Because furious is an understatement 
How do I approach this in a calm way without loosing my cool?

We became close friends after meeting at college a month ago, but I believe I fell in love. We had been hanging out almost every day since then. Every time we had dinner together, we could spend the entire day at the library. She laughs and always has a smile on her face. She also tries to touch my shoulders or arm. She told me about the most traumatic experiences and instantly began to trust me with all of her life's secrets. She always says that I am trustworthy. After working out, she lets me smack her booty and shows it off to me 😂. She lets me do that, but I am not sure why. She constantly tries to touch me physically, I have noticed. She also has a large number of friends, but she simply replies, ""I will be with you,"" whenever they call to go out to eat. 

However, there are a few factors that make me unsure. She and I recently broke up, about a month ago, and she used to constantly tell me about her ex and how much she missed him. However, she has not done that in ten days. She constantly made an effort to help me when I needed it. She also frequently says that she does not mind having a lot of physical contact with me because I am like a brother to her. She frequently makes predictions about my future relationships, such as ""You will have a great girlfriend next time"" and ""I hope your future partner will be just as wonderful as me."" She also claims that I am her very best friend. The most significant thing is that we will graduate in 39 days. She is from Korea, and I am from Kazakhstan, but despite the difficulties, I still want to try. After five years of dating, she has suddenly become my savior. I immediately forgot about my ex after meeting her. I feel like I may have met the right person at the wrong time, but I truly want to be with her and am prepared to give this relationship my all. Please ask me any more questions in the comments section if you need any clarification; perhaps from your inquiries, I will learn more. In summary, I want to be with her and I have not told her yet because I feel like I will be rejected if I do. Will she reject me? What’s the probability of success?

"We have been together close to 20 years and have 3 small children all under the age of 8. 

At the start of our relationship, I noticed that this relationship didn't have the same sparks my previous relationships had. I was wary of this but I got along with her so well and loved being in a relationship that I stayed. We got together very young and were each others firsts. 

About three years into our relationship, I had a female friend visit. She was someone I had a longtime crush on and we had kept in touch. She stayed over the weekend and we ended up sharing a bed together. Things got a little heated and I could have easily cheated but the most we did was a little cuddling. But, I sensed that I felt for her more than I felt for my then gf/wife and I considered ending my relationship. I told my then gf what had happened and explained that I had feelings for this other person and that I was considering breaking up with her but in the end I couldn't bring myself to do it. I did love my then gf/wife so much and I ended up staying.

A few years later, a similar situation took place. I was away for work and another friend happened to be in the same area also for work. We ended up sharing a hotel room (different beds) but in the night, we did end up in the same bed. Again, some cuddling but nothing beyond that. 

Fast forward next 8 years and we've gotten married and had our children. Things are going alright but we do have a repeated argument over our dead bedroom situation. 

A friend of ours move to the area nearby, she's someone we've known for years and she becomes a frequent visitor. About a year of us becoming reacquainted, I realise I have fallen for her. I am just happier when she's around. I continue to love for her for the next three years, a secret I am comfortable with. I never for a moment expected to act on those feelings but about a year ago she confessed to having developed feelings for me. I was in complete turmoil over what to do and I resisted for as long as I could but then began an affair with her. As soon as it began, I started having conversations with my wife about how unhappy I was in my marriage. But these arguments didn't go anywhere, there was never any resolution to them. 

About three months into the affair, I began seriously considering leaving and figuring out if logistically it was possible. But the emotional heartache of hurting so many meant I couldn't go through with it and I ended the affair about 5 months in. My affair partner (AP) kept her distance but we did try to remain friends for a while but it was too difficult as we still had feelings for one another. AP then asked to have NC for 6 weeks to try and lose feelings for one another. That period of time was incredibly challenging and I began instantly regretting my decision. Here was somebody I truly loved and I was sacrificing my own happiness for others. I decided then to seek therapy to help me work through the many emotions I was going through. I found a therapist who specialised in relationships and through therapy I came to the conclusion that I have been miserable for years, even before children. My love was for my AP and I wanted a life with her. 

I got back in touch with my AP and explained I wanted to be with her, I found a place, I took out a loan to pay for it for a year and furnished the place. I spent close to $50k on this. I told my wife I was leaving and explained I have a place but she was reluctant on letting me go. I then confessed to the affair and who it was with. She was completely heartbroken especially as it was someone who we have both known for many years but still she did not want to let me go. She begged and pleaded for me to stay but I explained that I was still leaving. 

We began getting support from a counsellor on how to amicably separate and how to best support the children. At this time, I was told I could no longer see my counsellor and my AP had also decided that she wanted to give me space while we worked through it all. My wife explained that if I were to pursue a life with AP, coparenting would essentially be hell. There would be no civilities at all. We would have no civil relationship. Our counsellor agreed with this, told us that it was not realistic to expect a good coparenting relationship if I was to leave for AP. Now, I was back to feeling conflicted. A poor coparenting relationship would impact children and I then decided I would stay for my kids. My wife also said, she is primarily staying for the children.

I am however at peace with my decision. I get to undo my wrongs and make it up to my wife. No longer being deceitful towards her. The marriage counselling and the open communication is something I am feeling positive about. The main issue is that I still have feelings for my AP. We are NC for 8 weeks now and I think of her everyday, all the time. My wife understands this as I tell her about this and I am open about this in our counselling sessions. Our counsellor has said if those feelings are still there in a years time, may have to reevaluate whether the marriage can work.

My wife is doing everything she can to help, even making so much effort with our dead bedroom situation. It's been 8 weeks and we both feel good about things. Is it normal to feel so good after so much deceit? Is it sustainable?

Husband (m) and I (f) were in a martial arts class he did a wrong move to win and ended up injuring me seriously enough to need a surgery (now learning how to walk again). As much as I understand it was an accident i know it was very much avoidable if he didn’t always treat me as a threat/competition. He was able to go back the next day to his normal active happy life while I couldn’t move or get out of the house for months and had to leave my job. At this point all my feelings towards him are negative. I can’t stand him talking about anything exciting in his life. He doesn’t show empathy or feel any guilt and talks about the whole thing as if he wasn’t even there. AITA and should just let it go?

For context my bf(25m) &amp; I have had a rocky start(which he blames me for) and we’ve been together for a few years and it hasn’t stopped. I thought it was a temporary thing &amp; maybe he’ll grow out if it &amp; learn accountability or realize his faults but no. Fast forward to 3+ years later and I still get blamed or scapegoated or just plain disrespected if something doesn’t go his way.This past week we were carrying some objects (not heavy at all) and I accidentally dropped MY cup on the gravel &amp; he called me a “stupid bitch” loud enough that if someone were to walk by they could hear it. He’s done this in stores, he’s done this in restaurants and in multiple places. People look at us. Yes there’s 2 sides to every story but if my partner makes a mistake I SUPPORT him and don’t make him feel stupid. I don’t get that in return. Yesterday as I got off of work at 10pm not even a second after i clock out i get paragraphs of constant belittling and saying “he’s the man of the house and things will go his way” mind you this “man” cant pay a bill or be a respectful partner. I was nothing but kind, and respectful all day mind you I was working and can barely be on my phone. He’s not working right now for the past few months and has nothing better to do than send me paragraphs about how “we” need to be better and how I’m a piece of shit , how my parents should’ve raised me better etc, he used to say worse things and etc.I almost cried this morning looking at the texts from last night because he knows what to say to get under my skin plus i’m going through some bs at work right now so i just wanted to be held and be told it’ll be okay and reassured i’ll be okay but nope i’m told i’m a pos and i should’ve been raised better.  When I got home from my not long enough drive, he continues to corner me off in the kitchen and doesn’t let me walk to the room or change out of my scrubs after a 12.5 hour shift so since im cornered and trapped i start making food(as he’s criticizing everything down to the butter i’m using to marinate the steak) because I’m starving, as we don’t a lot of money for my lunch right now as my check covers everything with barely anything for dinner left,dinner is my, if not first, 2nd meal. He’s been sitting and scrolling twitter and playing games all day when I’m at work doing applications for him when i’m able to be on my phone(because he won’t and i need my partner to help me and he just won’t apply whatsoever he has the app downloaded and he’s signed in he just won’t apply) I’m drowning and unless he starts applying we are going to fall behind. I get texts like “IM THE MAN OF THE HOUSE THINGS WILL GO AS I SAY” &amp; “silly of you think i’m disrespectful and rude when that’s all you are ”  but all i asked him is if he’s going to do this interview i set up for him virtually. I called him disrespectful and rude because he was cussing at me and catching attitude over the phone when I can’t defend myself because i’m there to WORK. I’ve tried telling him please don’t fight with me at work please it makes me anxious and you get really so i cry and i don’t like crying in front of others sometimes . He also says ,without me ever saying anything because i’m just scared of being homeless atp &amp; losing my dog, “I’m not lazy, i’m so much better than you, i’m smarter than you, you’re a piece of shit and i’m not, you were raised shittty like your parents, im better than you” mind you i was sitting there in silence. We could’ve been talking about bills and this comes up.  Its always a comparison with him and he always has to come out on top even with his friends unless he’s blaming someone else then the attention shifts to the blamee(i,e me) These thoughts are all rushing back to my head bc our anniversary is coming up, It’s a new year and i’m bout to be 25 that frontal love is crazy‼️‼️😔. Anyway, He never says happy anniversary first I always do and when i try to say “hey today was our anniversary you didn’t say anything in the morning or texted it at all” he says “I was waiting for you”. You’re telling me in the past 4+ years every year he waited for me to say smth first🤨 ?? He couldn’t say “hey babe happy anniversary ilysm!” first for once to even show he thought of me?  It makes me sad because I’ve let him use my new car he didn’t help me pay, I bought him what he wanted, I was respectful, I missed so much because he would get mad. I’m tired of him holding me back and being so mean to me when he swears he’s the best bf.  I initiate everything I ask him on dates, I try to plan stuff FOR him, I tell him i’m gonna do these nice things, I even planned my own xmas gift. he gets mad at plans and he finds a way to pivot that idea i had that he was “okay” with over text  then  go with something he wants when in reality my first suggestion was what he wanted all along&amp; he’s such an I TOLD YOU OR I KNEW THAT OMG he’ll say that for anything when in reality he was as lost as you were and didn’t tell you shit just let’s you stay lost , He steals my jokes I tell him that he doesn’t laugh at and tells them to his friends he lies about his employment to his mom but I know she knows.

We’ve lived together for 4 years. When we first got together, we had sex a few times a week and it was very good. About 6 months in, he told me he needed a break from it bc it was “distracting” so we changed to once per weekend - then it became once every two weeks and now it’s once every three or so. I have a higher sex drive and he’s often rejected me if I initiated saying the timing was inappropriate. For example, during a movie at home or earlier in the evening when we still had to do the dishes. I finally began to take care of myself when he wasn’t around and it’s been like that for about a year. When we do have sex it’s good but not great - much more focused on him because I don’t really count on him for my satisfaction anymore. He says he is upset about it and we are in therapy, but it hasn’t helped much. This weekend, we went out of town and I was laying on the bed in a robe - I gently suggested he take a look and he said he didn’t really find that area of the body (labia) visually appealing. I feel really stupid for doing that, I guess being on vacation made me feel carefree but looking back it was a very weird and innapropriate thing to do. I just don’t know where to go from here. He did mention that one problem with our sex life is that I’m not succeeding as much as I could be, which makes me less confident and therefore less attractive to him. I think I’m doing pretty well but its true that I’ve also had a few disappointments in my career. However his ex is an extremely successful woman so by comparison I’m sure I am disappointing. I have brought this up and he says he doesn’t expect that of me, he just knows I “thwart myself”.

As I type this out right now it already sounds pretty stupid but yeah, my girlfriend is an anxious person and has OCD about many things like liquids, textures etc. She really hates jerking me off it completely turns her off. I was discussing this with her the other day, as I try my best to make her feel comfortable with and we communicate very well. Honestly our relationship is basically perfect, can’t think of anything wrong with it. But when we were talking about this it came up that her ex used to cum in her mouth… fuck. I should not have asked, I don’t know why the fuck I asked but damn. I cannot imagine another guy, especially that bum, blowing his load into my gf’s mouth. God… makes me feel awful. 

Our sex life and personal life is amazing, it’s like our bodies were made for each other. But in those moments where she gets completely turned off, I feel horrible it makes me feel like a horny piece of shit and I tell her to stop and it makes me feel like she doesn’t want me. In those moments I can’t help but think of how she let that asshole cum in her mouth, but jerking me off turns her off.

Realistically, it’s just all in my head. Intimacy was complicated for us at first because of my religion and her medical condition that made sex painful, but sex with me is the first time she’s ever enjoyed sex and it didn’t hurt and it doesn’t make her feel awful. Sex is so hot every time and we’re so attracted to each other and she feels so safe with me. Her previous relationship was horrible, but what we have with each other is so mature and everything we could have asked for. We have such a perfect chemistry that’s so much more than the superficial honeymoon shit. But I can’t get this image out of my head sometimes when I look at her.

She would tell me to dry my hair (which I put products in) in the living room with the window open. I couldn't have any blankets or anything with non-natural fibres, in case it set her allergies off. When we went to gigs and shows with a lot of artificial fog, she would have to wear a mask and go to the hallway for breaks, etc. It was just a lot to deal with. We did argue a bit about this, and I told her a few times to go to counselling about it, because I sincerely do not think the irritants are that big of an issue - her anxiety probably makes it worse.

Anyway, I make big accommodations for her now.

Last week, we went to dinner with my long-time friend and her partner. It's the first time my girlfriend was meeting my friend. My girlfriend asked where we were going beforehand, but my friends and I like to keep things spontaneous, so I told her that we'll just decide when we meet up. We weren't sure if my friend wanted dinner or anything. When we all met up, it turns out my friend did want dinner, so we walked around a bit, got rejected from a few places since it was saturday evening, and eventually all settled on a chinese BBQ place.

The ventilation in the restaurant wasn't great, but my friends were hungry, so we waited 5 minutes for a table and went in. I didn't even register that this would be an issue. About 30 minutes in, my girlfriend said she needed to leave, and left - it was a little awkward for the group, but she explained her health issues, and left.

Afterwards, I met up with my girlfriend, and she told me I didn't care about her lung issues. She was having some severe breathing issues at this point, and didn't have her inhaler. She told me that she felt it'd be really strange to just leave immediately, especially since everyone else wanted BBQ and not her. She gave it a shot, but couldn't handle it and left.

She made me feel really bad, and told me that I could have helped her, suggesting we go somewhere else, or voicing that she could go if she wanted, since she was meeting my friends.

I don't know. I feel like she's just taking this out on me. I'm unsure how to approach this, or how to cope with the situation, to be honest. Would it be okay if I just told her that her health is her responsibility and not mine? I didn't even think about her lungs, to be honest. 

I do agree the restaurant was pretty smoky.",My (31M) girlfriend (27F) is upset at me for not bearing in mind her asthma?,18nq68b,1703174128.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nq68b/my_31m_girlfriend_27f_is_upset_at_me_for_not/,
"the other day, it happened again and it is seriously making me want to end things for both our sakes. but i love him so much and that thought makes me so sad.

for context, my boyfriend of 1.5 years is upset by my past. i won’t go into too much detail on this, but he sees any sex outside of a serious relationship as a woman being a ‘ho3’ no matter the context. this is important because my story all comes back to this mindset he has.

the other day, after having sex, he mentioned that it had felt really good because he had finished deep inside. 

i was curious and tried to ask him why that felt better as opposed to not as deep and what did coming inside feel like for him in general like why is it good for guys.

so i was standing at the foot of the bed cleaning up and he was on his phone and half listening to me. i was trying to get my words out. first i asked: ‘why do guys like to come inside girls’ - by guys i obviously meant in general, as part of asking why it feels good for him. then i asked: ‘what does it feel like for you and  what was the difference when it was deeper’ (since he just said it felt good). i was kind of stumbling over my words trying to ask the question but he was hardly listening anyway.

he looks up from his phone and goes “careful, you just caught yourself”. I was like WHAT are you talking about.

he then proceeds to get mad at me, saying i said “why do guys like coming—“ then caught myself and essentially said “why do you like coming deep inside”. he said i was asking why guys liked coming deep inside because i’d experienced that before but then caught myself because i had told him otherwise. i tried to explain that i meant “guys” in a general way and was first asking in general what does it feel like for men to finish inside a girl as a way to understand what it feels like for him and why he likes it. 

he started his lowkey gaslighting that makes me feel absolutely insane. he was like “mhm sure”, “i know what you meant”, “you’re always going to be wrong when it comes to this topic.” 

i became hysterical. at first i actually thought he was joking because the way he interpreted what i was saying hadn’t even crossed my mind. i felt crazy because how did he even interpret it in that way when it is so far from what i meant. not to mention, he KNOWS he is the only person i’ve had unprotected sex with-but he seems to think that i slipped up and revealed i’d actually done it a lot. 

i was sobbing at this point out of frustration. i told him i don’t lie to him and do not lie about any part of my past-if i wanted to lie i would have started by saying i was a virgin saint. i don’t see why i would lie about something like protected vs unprotected sex especially because it’s a matter of safety. my boyfriend also knows i didn’t go on birth control until right before i met him for my debilitating periods, so i just don’t understand why he thinks it’s even logical that i was getting mf creampied as a sexually inexperienced 20-something with no means of protection. he knows i am paranoid and very careful/safe. even with a condom, i made my previous partners pull out. 

still, he always assumes the worst of me. like i said earlier, it all goes back to his perception that i was a h03 and therefore anything i say about my past is untrustworthy. he thinks i was so experienced before i met him when really id only had sex a handful of times. he gets mad at me when i struggle to voice my preferences because i’m “not innocent and know what i like”. then when i do voice my preferences, he brings it back to me being promiscuous and being taught to like that by other guys.

the reality is that i didn’t enjoy sex before him, thought i was asexual, and didn’t do it enough to experience a lot of different things, so i truly only discovered my preferences with him. he scoffs at this and doesn’t believe me which leads to situations like the one i just described.

anyway, i got really upset which he said made me seem even more guilty, but i felt like he was gaslighting me because he knows what i’ve done and what i haven’t done. i know my reality and my truths and he makes me question myself. i also was upset that he is always assuming the worst of me and essentially painting me to be a lying wh0r3. it hurts. 

i know his mind will never change about me. i am honest with him about everything, what more can i do? is there anything? 

i’m starting to think there isn’t, and i know i should probably just leave and let him find someone he will not feel like this with. i’m just so distraught at the thought of it. if we break up, he can find someone better suited to him and i can stop feeling upset that the person i love sees me in such an awful way and gaslights me. at the same time, we will both be sad and i love him so much and can’t bear to do it. 

what do i do? is there anything i can say to him to make this stop or is leaving the only option at this point? please help",my (23f) boyfriend (23m) gets mad at me for things that aren’t true and makes me question my reality. should I leave?,18nq3uh,1703173953.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nq3uh/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_gets_mad_at_me_for_things/,

He was upset and told me not to talk to him and I apologized to him but my love language is physical touch and I felt bad about not listening so I tried to make him feel better and he got more upset and started yelling and cursing at me I wouldn’t stop after he asked me to leave him alone.

"On mobile sorry for the format.

Exactly one week ago my girlfriend (F21) didn't come home till extremely late after hanging out with her sister, and didn't join me (M22) in our bed. The next morning Friday morning I had the day off work and she was just getting ready to go to work when I woke up to her grabbing her work clothes. She comes over to me and tells me that she is done with our relationship. I went numb and didn't know what to do. She said that we don't have anything in common and at that time that was all that I knew. At first I couldn't accept it, she told me it wasn't my fault. Somewhere deep down I knew that wasn't the truth. 

I offered to her her a coffee and bring it to her that morning as she was running late for work. She told me no thank you, it felt weird because she never declines a coffee. After that I broke. I didn't know what to do, I tried calling my sister (F19) since she is my closest sibling both in age and in our familial relationship. She didn't pick up. I was on my way to go off myself and my heart dropped even more. Somehow I got to where I wanted to end it, I wasn't able to do it so I just unloaded bullets into a nearby stump till I felt numb again. On my drive back home my sister got in touch with me and we talked a bit about what happened. I told her that every once in a while my girlfriend would bring up going on dates or spending a little more time together, whether that be going out and doing something or hang out and watch a show or movie. 

I had no idea that she even felt unhappy. I know I'm not perfect, I hopped on my computer and played video games for a few hours and I have times where all I want to do is play and others where my pc won't be turned on for weeks or even months. 

I spent that weekend mostly hanging our with my dad. I told him that we were going through a rough patch, not that she was leaving me. At this point my sister would call me every day to check up on me. I told my roommates (I live with my friends one male one female they are married and have been together for over 4 years now.) that she wanted to leave me. They didn't even know our relationship was that strained. I told them that since all four of us live in the same house they have a right to know. I moved all of my girlfriends stuff into a spare room in the house we are renting since she told meshe didn't want to stay with me anymore. Saturday my girlfriend and I talked and she still said that we just didn't have anything in common. I told her that a good team shouldn't be the exact same. That we have to be different inorder to succeed. That night ended in tears. She asked if I could wait for her and give her time. I told her I couldn't do that because she couldn't garuntuee that we would still be together. She kept telling me that she loved me and wanted me to be safe. I couldn't believe her because of all the pain I was feeling. She wanted a hug and I couldn't do it because it didn't feel right at the time. 

Sunday evening my roommates pulled me aside and told me that she talked to them. My roommates said that she didn't appreciate that I brought up her that her sister was having loud sex one night that my girlfriend was over to her. (We went to Vegas with her sister and her aunt and I thought that because we were open with eachother it was ok to bring up).

 That she didn't like whenever she brought something up I would go quiet. I was raised if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all. I also came to the realization that I couldn't say yes or ok to things she brought up because I was scared that I was committing to something that I couldn't follow through on. 

I told my roommates that I wanted to ask her about therapy and they said that was a good starting point. I went up to what is now her room and knocked. I don't thing she thought it was me because the door opened. I pulled her in for a hug and apologized for not spending enough time with her. I told her that since money has been tight I haven't felt like I can take her out places. We were both crying. I asked her about therapy together and she said ok. I broke down and ugly cried in relief. We spent that night together in her room cuddling and talking, me more than her. I spilled my guts to her. I told her I've been trying to do more around the house over the past couple weeks. I got my hobby room cleaned up, cleaned up a spot in the house when I saw that it was needing attention. I'd done every dish that got dirtied since Friday. And told her that I'm going to try and get my head out of my ass and spend more time with her. 

She told me that she's been thinking about this for a month. She kept saying we don't do anything together but I kept bringing up examples. Like us sitting on the end of the bed eating chips and dip while watching a show not even 5 days prior. That we went on walks together around the neighborhood. That we have gone on double dates with our roommates. She seemed happier that I brought all that up.

We spent Sunday and Monday nights together. I cooked tacos for dinner for everyone on Monday. 
Tuesday evening she said that she was going to go hang out with her sister since she told my girlfriend that she should come over. That brings us to yesterday. 

I cooked spaghetti for dinner for the two of us. I found a therapist that my dad knew and they offered to do it free of cost other than purchasing the program that they were going to coach us too. I had a weird feeling in my gut that just kept coming back all day Wednesday. When she got home I told her all this. She told me that I didn't have to do all this. I told her I finally went and got some of her Christmas presents now that I had a little money. Then she dropped the bomb on me that she couldn't do it. That she was tired of giving everything. That she couldn't do us anymore. That she never felt heard. That she still loved me. I fell to my knees. I asked why she couldn't give us, give me one more chance. She told me she can't do it. She doesn't want to be the couple that breaks up then gets back together over and over. I swore to her that I can and will be a better man. That I saw my flaws that I am working on fixing them. That she doesn't have to give. That it's my turn to give everything and she just has to be willing to put in a little time. That she opened my eyes, I didn't know that she needed all this till last Friday. That she never told me. The last thing she said before I left the house was ""I'm sorry but I can't do this anymore.""

Something broke, shattered. I left. I drove around for a while. I don't know how I didn't end up around a pole or tree or in someone's living room. I went back to the house and grabbed a few shirts socks and underwear. I grabbed all he presents. A huge blanket needs gummy clusters her favorite candy and an assortment of lindor dark chocolates because she loves dark chocolate. I gave set them on the counter infront of her and said here's all your gifts. As I left she told me I should return them. I didn't listen I said I'm moving out. I'm leaving this depressing hell hole. Then I went to my dad's and stayed the night there. 

That brings us to today. I just wanna fix what I did wrong. She was my person. The one I wanted to be with forever. What did I do wrong? What could I do to maybe fix this?

"I understand this is very shallow of me. In all honesty, other than the physical part of things, I believe she is truly a wonderful person. We have been together for 3 years and our communication skills are on point. We have debates but we hardly ever fight. I can maybe count 2 times where we had arguments but they were all very controlled. She is extremely emotionally intelligent and has a lot going for her. I feel bad as, even though everything else is good, I find it hard to find her sexually appealing with her weight gain and unwillingness to do anything about it.
At the start of our relationship she was healthy 125lbs, however now she is about 160lb and has told me that her physical health is not important to her and can't see herself doing anything to change it. I have tried helping her by taking her to the gym with me, playing sports, cooking healthier meals, which led her to be more healthy. But lately I feel she has given up and refuses to do any sort of physical activity. She promises me that so is not depressed but rather it's not important to her. I have always felt that physical exercise is important as so many of my family members have health problems and so does hers. I feel lost as I still love her, but this has taken a toll on my physical attraction toward her and find myself thinking about breaking up from time to time.

"I dont full know how to form this, so ill try to make this short without excluding the details. 

Me and my gf have been going strong for 2.5 years, we had our ups and downs, once she went out on the girls night out, and under heavey influence of alcohol and cocaine, kissed another guy, she was quick and honest about telling what has happened.
that was at the beginning of our relationship, it took a toll on me for awhile, but eventually things got better, and even recently it became great, me and her live a routine life, everyday is pretty much the same, all the time we spend, we spend together. We recently went away on vacation, and it respaked our love for each, honestly it felt great, and any doubt that i had about us going forward was gone. 

Until she wanted to go out to see her old mates, the same mates that the first situation has happened with. I didn't want to put a strain on our relationship, so I was bothered that much about it, she told me she wants to see me after and will take the last luas(tram) at 0:40 am to my house. She didnt, so i texted, and she said she will take a taxi when the pub closes at 2:30am, i was skeptical, she ended getting a taxi at around 5am to a local luas stop instead. I tried reaching her in that time, but her phone was turned off, I stayed up that night, and decided to meet her, I could see that she was once again under the influence, I later found out where she was, and that after the pub closed at 2:30 am, she and her mates went to a hotel room with a bunch of lads from the UK, for context we live in Ireland. She claimed she was only their for a shot while to charge her phone so that she can get a taxi to mine. And thaf she spend alot of time after the pub looking for her mates, and that it was her mates idea to go the hotel room, obviously her mates had the intention of doing something with the UK lads.

I wasnt happy with that, I think she has crossed the boundaries, even though i believe her, and think that it was a plausible outcome, and i would think she would throw away what we have build. I wasn't ok with it. I ended it with her that night, we have still retained contact with each other, but i have lost all feeling of respect for myself because of it. 

In an attempt to get a better understanding of why someone would do things like that, i contacted an old friend of mine (F21), me and this girl know each other for years, (yet we havent spoke to each other for 2years) and she is my previous ex's best friend. me and my ex were in a relationship for 3 years back then and we ended it on fairly bad terms. 
Going back to my friend, i went out to seek some advice, this about two weeks from the incident, she wanted to go drink, so we went , we both had places to be, and things to do, but the buzz was great, we both had fun, and we left it at that. 
I seen that as sort of an unofficial date, this will relevent in a min.

Now my here where i screw up, after that meeting, i wanted to see her again, so I asked her if she wants to do it again, and she said yes, however, i also felt a bit quilt from the fact that im going to see another girl, while im still not quite over my gf, aswell as I suggested to my friend that this is going to be a date. And she reposnded that it can't be because of her friendship with my old ex, ( me and that ex ended on fairly bad terms). So she called it off.

I think she might be weary that im trying to use her as a rebound, or that it will effect her friendship with my old ex. Or potentially she doesn't see me in that way, and im just a friend?
Im not sure how to feel about her myself, i always liked her, i doubt i would want to be in a relationship with her anytime soon, but was looking forward to getting to know her again.

"I have been spending time with someone since April. She’s become one of my favorite people in my life. Started as a mutual friend, became a close friend, and lately I had been feeling like it could turn into more than that. We see each other at least once a week, sometimes more frequently. Most often in our small friend group but recently the two of us have been doing things together separately. We never labeled these meetings as a dates but I think she knows I’m interested in her that way, without me coming right out and saying it. I’ve dropped hints. And I feel like she’s also hinting. Maybe she doesn’t see it that way. But the incoming texts are getting more frequent and have been getting a little flirty. I really thought that things between us were picking up, still kinda do. I was planning on telling her how I feel, casually. I care about her.

Well, over the weekend while we were out, she told me something that caught me off guard. She’s planning on moving out of state next summer (so like six months from now). Nothing official yet, but she’s been applying for internships to further her career. And those career opportunities are more plentiful elsewhere. And she wants to see more of the country other than where she’s lived most her life. She mentioned me visiting, she mentioned the possibility of this not even happening if things don’t go her way.

I tried to play cool about this information. Told her that I’d miss her but that I’m excited for her. And that’s true, she deserves good things. If she can realize a dream, that’d be amazing. But as the week goes on, I’ve been feeling sad about the idea of her leaving. Heartbroken, even. Selfishly, I wish she could stay. I would miss her too much. She’s inspired me to step out my comfort zone, even away from her. She’s a good friend and I’ve developed feelings for her.

"    Hello everyone, to preface, my boyfriend (of 2 years) is an amazing guy, he’s very funny and sweet as well as very supportive, we hardly ever argue however there’s one thing that’s been bothering me. 

   He has a strong preference towards bigger breasts like DD and above however I am not that, I’m an A cup on a good day so this causes me to have a ton of insecurities. He’s brought it up more than once in the last few weeks and it’s really gotten into my head.

   I understand that everyone has preferences but this is something I was already insecure about. Any advice on how to handle this?","My (F18) boyfriend (M18) told me he prefers big boobs, mine aren’t.",18npjep,1703172416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18npjep/my_f18_boyfriend_m18_told_me_he_prefers_big_boobs/,
"My fiance and I are in a huge fight . It started with the fact I saw his business page following an ex girlfriend’s business page . This page has her face all over it and I’m just not okay with that . I had said something to him about unfollowing it because I think it’s disrespectful and he blew up. I leaned into the argument stating the fact that him liking other gym girls photos is so disrespectful and embarrassing to me , also. 

I feel so fucking annoyed to be posting this because I know the saying that social media really kills relationships and here I am ….

Generally , I am not a jealous person . I may be somewhat insecure at times but I don’t consider that a huge issue of mine . I’m in decent shape and consider myself to be above average. My fiance is 40, very fit and spends about 5 days a week (3.5 hours daily) at the gym . 

I suppose I lost it when I saw he was following the ex girlfriend’s account and demanded that he unfollowed it . He blew up at me and acted as if it were no big deal that his “business account was following another business account” . Bullshit. 

He has been liking photos throughout our entire 4 year relationship . I suppose I have never had a sit down with him stating how I truly feel about it other than making comments along the way like “oh yeah I saw you were in her likes” or something along those lines . 

After discovery of the following of the ex account I suppose I got true with myself and realized how much it really DID bother me that he likes these photos of other women. I mean, he spends so much time at the gym ( normal for him and there’s a lot more to that story that I won’t get into right now) and he sees these women quite possibly more than he sees me at times . I think it’s so disrespectful to our relationship and ultimately, it’s embarrassing to me . These women probably think “wow this creep is engaged but he’s liking my provocative photo” but idk , I can’t speak for them . 

If I go through the photos it’s not as if he’s liking a picture of them and their dog but rather the ones where their ass is facing the mirror and they are looking back at it or bikini photos . 

He says that he cannot believe we are arguing over something so immature and pathetic as this but he’s not seeing the big picture in that it’s hurting me and I feel disrespected . 

I also can’t get over the fact that he is following the ex girlfriend’s account . What other reason would there be other than he is curious what’s she’s up to? 

I stayed away from home last night and he didn’t bother asking me where I was and we haven’t had any contact for over 24 hours now . I love him and would like to see it work and I’ll be honest, I’ll probably be in shambles if it doesn’t. I’ve put a lot of time and effort into him and us .  Aside from this issue  we have a nice relationship but I can’t allow myself to continue feeling disrespected . I owe myself more than that …. I’m not sure how I should proceed or if I am in fact, overreacting .",My fiance 40/M and I 30/F are in a huge argument over him liking fellow gym girls pictures,18npjdy,1703172415.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18npjdy/my_fiance_40m_and_i_30f_are_in_a_huge_argument/,
"lol first time posting things on Reddit, just wonder people’s thoughts on this.

So here it is.

I met this guy (who lives in US) in Feb in London (where I live) this year on dating app and we hanged out once, had a lot of good chemistry between us. Then he went back to US saying he would come visit me some time and he will eventually move to London. So I think it’s actually a good idea to keep in touch if he is moving here sooner. Then we kept texting and calling each other almost non stop till May he said he won’t move any more.

At that time we stopped talking for a while but we still had feelings about each other. Till later we decided to do a trip together, so we went away for 3 weeks.

During these 3 weeks, we didn’t travel too much like a couple, no holding hands, no intimacy, and he kept pushing me away saying we are just friends. But I have clearly communicated my feelings to him that I was really into him. But if he doesn’t feel the same way, then let’s forget about it. So we reached a mutual agreement of cutting off and went back home.

Two weeks later, he started to text me again with all the banters and teasing, so we started this texting calling pattern again, on a daily basis. He then one day told me he is gonna come to London this Christmas till New year. Any thoughts? I think I’m not mistaking whatsoever if someone has to come visit you around those sensitive time of the year right?

But now guess what? After living in my place for 4 days, he is behaving the same as like when we were traveling, he keeps pushing me away again saying we are not on the same page. He continues to refuse intimacy as usual. Let me make it more clear here. It’s not just me trying to push things forward, he made it ambiguous af, I asked him to sleep on sofa but he said bed is warmer, but nothing further than sleeping on the same bed. So I eventually burnt out and asked him to leave. This is such a weird situation that I have never handled before, I’m really keen to know what people’s thoughts are🤣",Please tell me what he (M 26) actually want from me (F 28)?

"I sent this text to my boyfriend. As it explains I have been feeling really stressed out and it came to a boiling point. He lives 1 hour away and we have busy jobs and don't see each other much, mostly we talk over the phone. I just feel distrustful of him and don't feel safe. 

For context I am in a very busy program that also involves a busy and stressful job. We are both in this program although mine is busier right now. He will be in the same program next year but in a different city. 

We both are on shifts right now. I sent this text yesterday (Wednesday) at 8:40. His work starts at at 11pm and he lives 5 minutes away from his workplace (usually he leaves 15min before work starts). I did know he wanted to arrive at work by 10:30 to call IT before starting. Today I have a shift starting at 2pm. I just feel confused and dreading talking to him and having feelings of ""what's the point it's going in circles nothing changes"". And also having feelings of wanting to talk to other boys.

TEXT CONVO:

Me
Hi Xxx, I've been feeling kind of stressed and sometimes feeling confused about things
I am so scared to bring it up I just want to be positive but I notice I'm thinking about it all the time and trying to compensate by being extra positive
I keep going in these extreme sine waves of gratitude and anxiety
I know you have a shift today and I have shifts too coming up.
I just feel so disconnected and feel I have no idea or clarity about what's happening
I figured maybe we should have regular scheduled check ins to combat this
I hope whenever you have a chance you can let me know
I feel so anxious and stressed bringing this up and feel overwhelmed but I don't want it to bubble into an explosion hence why I'm just trying to bring it up now
Hope you have a great shift and thanks for prepping with me today-- I appreciate all the effort you are putting in and I notice it

Him
Thank you so much for messaging about this and bringing it up ❤️ I have been feeling kind of similar to how you described and also trying to be positive but you’re right maybe scheduling regular check ins and communicating more to support each other and grow together

Me
Are you having second thoughts about pursuing something? Or feeling unsure?

Him
I was just thinking with my shift tn starting pretty soon - do you think it makes sense to set aside more time and check in properly with more time noon Friday? Or would you rather talk now

Me
No worries yeah we can talk on friday

Him
I love you and I want to be with you and I want to make you happy. I am sorry it is stressful but we will get through it
I just feel like it might not be the best time to dive in if I have to leave soon for a shift is all I’m not trying to deflect your concerns!
I really appreciate you checking in

Me
Thanks, have a great shift
Although I have to say I thought you were planning to leave for your shift at 10:15?
Or maybe I misunderstood?

Him
Well yah 10 or 10:15. I was gonna do a short run beforehand to wake me up but I can skip that

Me
Nw

Him
Do u want to call and chat until 10ish?

Me
It's ok!
We already talked enough today you should get ur run in
Have a good shift xxx!

Him
Are you ok though? You don’t have to be brave if you’re not we can chat I can skip a run

Hey its cool please don't worry!
Have a good run and shift!
Thanks for calling :)

I sent this text yesterday (Wednesday) and for some reason it just made me feel really crappy and I feel like I don't trust him and want to avoid him now. I just feel so sad and stressed out and feel confused why. I didn't even  feel safe sending the text in the first place and I don't believe what he says. I just feel overwhelmed.  

Tldr: why does this text convo make me feel so sad and distant",This text conversation with my (29f) bf (27m) really hurt my feelings and for the life of me I cannot figure out why.

"

I (18f) and my bf (20m) recently started having sex. It’s been about a month since we started and we’ve been safe besides one time. 
    One thing about me is that my cycle is always on time. I am never late and I never have bad periods.
      I was three days late but yesterday I thought I got it. The strange thing was that I was in so much pain, then I noticed huge blood clots. They started about the size of my fingers then progressed to larger. I went to the doctor and found out it was a miscarriage.
     I told him and he was like “ that’s good!”. I know I didn’t want this baby but that was an awful thing to say. This all happened yesterday. I just couldn’t he said that. Then I told him when I was in the shower I had a huge blood clot and it was painful. He asked me if I took a picture and uploaded it to Reddit…
       I yelled at him, calling him insensitive. I know I shouldn’t have yelled but I couldn’t believe he said that. I just sat in my car for a few hours.

"They asked for this title, but this isn't only about my sister. I'm burnt out and seriously considering cutting off everyone in my life. but my issue is, I have to be surrounded by them for at least 2 more years. 
I'll be brief because I don't want anyone to know it's me. I have been having issues with most of the relationships in my life since I entered uni. 
I'm always fighting with my sister, while our arguments are over silly things, either her or I find a way to escalate it and get the rest of the family involved. they usually take my side, but this time they took hers. I was wrong, I know. but it was her fault we even had this fight. I asked her to do something at home and she swore she wouldn't do it even though it's her chore. so I swore I wouldn't either. it's silly, I know. but things just kept escalating. I won't give more details, but I'm currently not talking to her or mom because of this. I never talked much with my dad, but to be fair he has been calling me these past 2 days. so I'll talk to him normally.
my friends in uni feel like fake friends. it's almost as if I don't exsist beyond uni for them. they keep giving me mixed signals, sometimes I feel like they're my friends, other times it's almost as if they don't even know me.
I tried really hard to be closer to them. I'm naturally an introvert, yet I tried to open up to them
honestly, they aren't the best people to be around, mostly in the part where they talk shit about alot of people. it makes me wonder if they talk shit about me behind their back, but when I think about it, I never wronged them so that shouldn't be the case. but I don't like feeling so insecure in a friendship. like friendships aren't supposed to be like that. I'm supposed to be comfortable showing my real personality infront of them. They shouldn't be giving me mixed signals. I've already known them for two years, so it shouldn't be like this. and I know they're closer to each other than they are to me.
I don't want to say i did something wrong, because I genuinely believe I've been good to all of them. maybe they just don't like me just because. and I wouldn't mind that. it would hurt a little, but I'd rather they be clear about not wanting to be my friends instead of stringing me along like this. 
I can't confront them as well, because a part of me thinks I could be overthinking it. I don't want them to get closer to me because I asked them to, it wouldn't be a genuine friendship and I'd hate that. that's why if I confront them about it, I should be ready to break off the friendship even if its a misunderstanding from my side.
what should I do with my family? should I give them another chance or should I just stay low contact with them until I'm financially able to live on my own then cut them off? And my friends, should I try again? should I tell them how I feel? should I leave things as they are to have company in uni and cut them off when I leave? or should I just cut them off now and make other friends or go through the next two years alone?",I [19F] have been constantly fighting with my sister [21F],18np5dg,1703171319.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18np5dg/i_19f_have_been_constantly_fighting_with_my/,
"So a few weeks ago after a get together with friends, we went out on the town to some bars. During this get together I was drinking straight from a whiskey bottle. By the time we went out, I had already finished the bottle of whiskey by myself. So safe to say I was drunk, in fact, I don’t remember actually leaving the house. What I was told from friends was that we went to a couple bars and I started off by stumbling into a table of 4-5 dudes and completely knocked their drinks down. I followed this by acting like a douchebag. I was shouting that I wanted to fuck my crush (30F) who was also there with me. I ended up screaming at one of her friends who was trying to get me to sit and calm down but I wouldn’t stop. Finally, my crush dragged me out of the bars to head back to the house. The whole time I guess I was saying how I could beat her ass (she is also a violent person(not an excuse but thought it is noteworthy to the story)). I then turned and put my hands on her throat and pushed her back. So she threw me down and started to punch me. So Reddit, I’m asking, how can I fix this relationship even if it means we just go back to being friends. She is an invaluable person to me and I don’t want to lose her.

"TLDR ! We’ve been together for almost 7 years and I proposed a few months back in august, and she said yes! but we haven’t had any intimate moments since then. This isn’t the first time I’ve gone months without it. she’s very business oriented. I try to make moves on her almost every day. Been hitting the gym got a good new job and working on myself. Payed for her beauty school and am housing her mother for no charge. But none of it seems to turn her on.. I just feel kinda used. I know that it’s not cool to just be the “I need sex” guy but I low key kinda do.. and I don’t think that’s outa pocket?  I’ve had serious conversations with her about it as well. Told her it feels like I’m just a roommate she’s gotta share a bed with. She’ll get defensive when i attempt to touch her and uses self deprecation as an excuse for not wanting to do “it”. She convinces me every time that she genuinely cares and is listening but nothing changes. Female advice would be greatly appreciated.

Am I just overthinking?

Should I call of the proposal and let her do her thing? And I’ll do mine.

"I have been seeing my current boyfriend since March and we have been officially together since April time. He can be a little bit weird sometimes and will occasionally say cringey stuff but it was never too bad.

I introduced him to all of my friends at a birthday party in August and things seemed to go okay however they were doing a roast of the host of the party since it was his birthday and my partner decided to get involved despite not knowing anyone there. I suggested he go with the other roasters to run his jokes by them and make sure they knew he was joining in too but he just insisted it would be fine. Sole of his jokes got laughs but some just got some awkward chuckles which I thought was fair enough since he hadn't met anyone before and didn't know their humour.

Since then he has spent a lot of time playing games with my friends online which seems to go okay, we were all planning to meet up for Christmas which I was looking forward to but I now cringe to think about it. My boyfriend has a habit of jumping into conversations and trying to make funny one liners or jokes but a lot of the time they're just awkward and unfunny. He did this so much over the weekend I began to dread what was going to come out of his mouth, during a game of truth or dare someone dared him to not jump in with an attempt at a joke for the next half an hour. Instead of cutting the awkward jokes out and getting involved in the conversation he set a timer on his phone and just didn't speak until it was done. 

In addition to this while shopping I pointed out a very expensive item and asked if he'd be willing to go halves on it. He said he would think about it but instead snuck away and bought the item without consulting me. This is something he does often, he refuses to let me pay for things and he buys me expensive things just because Ive mentioned I like them, my friend has compared it to love bombing and I'm not sure if that's what's going on or if that's just him thinking expensive gifts will make me happy.

I messaged one of my friends about it afterwards and asked if I was overthinking or if things really were off over the weekend and she agreed that his jokes were cringey and made things awkward. However he sees no issues with his behaviour this weekend and keeps saying what a fun time he had. Usually he is very kind and caring and doesn't act like that with me or with his friends so I don't know if he's still trying to fit in with the group but it's really made me rethink my whole relationship and if I truly want to be with someone who makes my friends feel uncomfortable and awkward because eventually we'll stop getting invited to stuff and I don't want to lose my friends because of his actions.

Should I break up with him over this?

"Basically I share shoes with my dad. Recently my parents went away and I was wearing these shoes. I usually wear sheos just by shoving my foot in them then adjust them. When I had to take them off I saw wrapper of an opened condom, I was stunned.

Anyways very suspicious my parents did go somewhere else before but it makes no sense at all to do this, that rules only one possibility.

My dad did cheat on my mother (50M)  confirmed in 2020, there was quite a big fight after my mum checked his phone, lasting 2 months of not talking to each other. It was only Infront of my elder sister (29F) he admitted and everything was better and he did apologise.

Anyways we're here now. I have no idea who to tell, my mum is likely on stage 1 cancer and is trying her best to stay in health awaiting treatment, my dad and brother (26M) both have a shop in business and always stay in contact. Back in 2020 my brother and mum hardly talked to him during those months. My sister is currently pregnant, although I think it's best to tell her in secret.

I can't reveal any of this in the open, otherwise my sister in law finds out and it's best to keep it private (we stay in one house). I did have an argument with my dad recently so not in the best of terms of that either.

I could not tell anyone and that's deffo the most easiest thing, I could easily forget this (I've just given up on changing people) and just let God take care of it (we believe in strict punishment in the after life and in karma)

I haven't chucked the wrapping, it's still in the shoe under my foot as we speak. With my brother helping with shop right now, even taking this off and putting in the bin will risk conversation.

"I’m giving it my all and I feel like I am moving in the right direction but I need your opinions. Should I try to pursue in making this girl my girlfriend?

I have this girl that I met her in August, for the sake of privacy, let’s call her Addison. Me and Addison have been pretty close friends at the start of the semester and bonded over the fact that there aren’t a lot of Hispanics at our college (her being Mexican and me being Honduran/columbian on my dads side and black on my moms side for curious ones)

I invited her over to watch movies in my dorm and we were just enjoying time together. After about a month, we were close to the point where I would invite her to drink when my roommates were gone. One night I invited her to drink with me and my other friends, we were laying down and ended up kissing after I had gotten drunk. We went to her room and kissed from 12am till the sun came up. 

Then it became weird. She felt ashamed or something because she said that she was sinning and needed to repent and wanted to focus on herself

Key note: we are both virgins (Christian, I know) and only kissed that night.

She started avoiding me and I caught feelings for her. I wanted to start off slower and be with her but it was strained. So I said that it would be better if we grew separate.

She agreed until November when she called me to “break my promise” to come ride with her to get her charger late at night. I couldn’t because I wasn’t near the campus. But when she got back, she went to sleep on the phone with me. 

I came back and said we should hang out again and she said “sure”. Fast forward a little bit we would watch movies, she would let me give her topless back rubs and cuddle with each other but she didn’t play with the idea of me sleeping in her room. I respected that. 

I wanted to be around her. I loved her company so when the semester ended I laid out my feelings to her. I lost my car due to the motor blowing up and it was in the shop for a good while getting repaired so I mentioned that it will be done soon.

Here is her response:

“This is so sweet thank you for being so understanding and patient I know I’ve been all over the place this semester but I want so much for myself and for you too I think we can turn out two amazing people as for now I still want to be friends I’ve had a lot of feelings about us but I think I still have some growing to do before I’m comfortable in a relationship. And as far as not having your car that never bothered me we could’ve took mine I should’ve offered. I catch myself thinking about us sometimes though and I think you deserve to know that. I’m also just super cautious so I’m trying to make sure I know what I want but regardless of all that confusing stuff I hope you have the best break and that we keep in touch till spring.”

I said ok. Then she got on the phone with me and her friend and her friend explained I should give her time and she likes me while she was on the other end of the phone call. Saying things like “yall are so cute” and “she was waiting on you to call her”.

"Just as a disclaimer, I am a advocate for mental health and in no way minimizing mental health. All of this is through my own observations and feelings. I would like some advice on how to help my husband and setting healthy boundaries. 

Background: My husband and I have been married for 2 years now. When I first met my husband, he was a very calm and collected person. A year ago, he got diagnoised with PTSD, OCD, depression, and anxiety. This was after this dad passed away from cancer and he was having a hard time accepting that he's gone since his dad was in the hospital in South Korea which is in a completely different country (we're in the US). Ever since he got diagnoised with OCD and anxiety, he has now developed tendencies to double check, triple check, everything. 

But the thing that's been affecting me the most is his anxiety thats mixed with his OCD. If he's worried about anything at all, he'll say ""so can i 100% completely trust you, forget about it, not think about or worry about anything at all no matter what. There wont be any issues at all no matter what?"" 

Then I have to repeat WORD FOR WORD what he said back to him ""Yes, you can 100% completely trust me, forget about it, not think about or worry about anything at all no matter what. There wont be any issues at all no matter what."" If I mess up one word, we start over and he would just get more and more aggitated. This is a daily saying that is now engrained into my head to say to him to make his help with his anxiety. Sometimes I'll even say it 5-6 times a day for him. But for the past 6 months, i found myself having insomnia and it just feels like I laid in bed, then woke up. Sometimes when im about to fall asleep, he'll ask me to recite his sayings. If I don't say it back with a ""nice tone"" he'll make me repeat it or blame me for not being sincere enough and that I want his anxiety to become worse. Recently he's been ending it with ""love you"" and I would respond with ""love you too"" and we would repeat it 5 times due to his OCD. 

I've grown to just hate saying it. In the beginning, it was from a good place in my heart, but because of all the poking and proding and all these repeated actions, it makes me feel like im going insane. None the less, i still say it so it can help him in anyway I can. 

I understand his anxiety is pretty severe, so I try to help him in anyway I can. But now it's coming to the point where I'm starting to resent it and I don't want it to come to this point. I'm afraid that if I'm not careful with my words in setting boundaries, he'll just blame me for not caring. I understand I'm not in his shoes so I wouldn't understand what he's going through,

"Throwaway account for obvious reasons 

I'm 29M currently dating a 26F for the last 1.5 years 
We met via a dating app, and hit things of pretty quick. Her parents love me and mine love her. We're due to be married in the second half of next year

Off late though, I've been having doubts about whether I've rushed into this too quick

Little backgrounds of us relationships wise:
She's the first girlfriend I've ever had. I've had crushes and close friends that almost turned into something more but never did, but never a gf. She's my first kiss, and my first everything 
My SO on the other hand, has had her fair share of relationships before this, and props to her for that

Before we went official, we sat down and decided to come clean about out pasts as we really wanted to make this work. It was her idea and we did that. I told her whatever I had where she asked for details (and sometimes still brings up questions)and she told me hers. I really appreciated how open she was and was all up at having my first gf (yay me!)

It was all great until a couple of months ago

I was scrolling through her phone one morning and I happened to see some adult gifs in one of her folders. I confronted her that evening and she said that it was sent to her by some other guy she met on the same dating app before she met me. It was all good because this was before she met me, except that when she told me about this guy she explicitly said that they spoke a little bit and it died down when she met me.
Her defence was that it all happened before me, and that they never met, so it's all good. I was hurt because she mentioned this guy, and didn't tell me the whole truth when we agreed that we would.

This kept on playing out in my mind and a month later I told her that I still haven't forgotten about it and that it still bothers me a bit and that I would go in for therapy 
We argued a bit that night.. there was quite some crying (from both sides. Not that it matters)
She too agreed that she'd go in for therapy

A few days later she said that she wants to tell me about her past in detail.
There were details there that makes me really sad and just made me want to wrap her in a blanket and give her a hug
But there was also a lot that she didn't mention. There were people she was involved in that she didn't mention when she should have. Even the ones that she told me were not the whole story. There's a lot unpack for me

When pushed about why she didn't tell me about it, her defence varies between ""It kind of slipped my mind"" to ""you would have never dated me if I told you""
And the second part is true, and eats me up

There was one clear instance before (about smoking) where she told me she quit, but it slipped out that she smoked with her friends once after me telling me that smoking would be a dealbreaker for me


Sometimes it's gets too much to me and I regret getting into this relationship 
Other times, I remember that she's a really awesome gf and all this should not matter. She's loyal, sexy as hell, had a good sense of humor, smart. It's just that somewhere inside me, something is broken when I look at her


There also the fact that she was my first. I feel like I owe her that to stay with her comes what may (religion also plays a part in this)
Our parents are also involved

"(Long Story) (I'm going to call my current GF ""A"" to be clear in every possible way).

  
Me and A are in an official relationship from June of this year, before we used to be like a couple but didn't officialize it because of my rejects since I didn't want to suffer for a relationship again and just turn down ""the offer"" every time she would try to get in a relationship with me. I admit that in all the time I was rejecting her I used to be pretty of an asshole, I was playing video games often, sort of ""living"" on discord while making money off of it, so I wasn't a real human being now I'd say but at the end in that specific period of time I wasn't the type of guy to get a relationship with (This will be important later).  


  
To explain the whole story, I start from the first time we met. We first met in 2020 when I went to her house after a ""trip"" of about 2 to 3 hours where we only kissed. After that we really obsessed with each other but nothing grew between us, I found a relationship with another girl little time later and stayed with her for some months (08/2020 to 01/2021) just to feel a little less lonely like I did for the other relationship I got. In March after other little stories, A wanted to see me, she asked a friend we had in common who was her girl best friend to meet me, both wanted to see me so it was perfect to meet. After we met (me and A) in March we started to talk more, even if we used to talk much before, after 1 week during our fourth ""date"" she gave me her virginity.  


  
From that point we had a sort of GF/BF relationship but with me declining the idea of officializing the thing telling her repeatedly that I didn't want a relationship. We continued having the same relationship, I was in love with her since the first moment, being there for her in every moment and helping her in everything but still didn't want a relationship with being scared It'd be a painful one for me. She used to do 1/2 hours trip in bus every week to come to my house and stay there with me from a single day to max 3/4 days, I loved everything except the fact that she would always insist on having a relationship, so I was just closing in myself the love I was feeling for her being more a dad for her providing everything but being pretty neutral and cold talking about feelings.  


  
After some time another girl would come to my house, this girl was a friend of some years before who has always been the girl who I spoke about my problems to, she lived pretty far away from where I lived so she asked me to let her take just 2 trains for about 4 hours in total and came to my house to ""help me"" and be there for me while I was lonely and I agreed, at that phase of my life I was feeling again lonely and sick about my life, so I made a mistake accepting in her coming to my house 2 times (12/2021 and 03/2022). We had intimate moments and I regret doing something just because my old weak ass was feeling lonely at the time and couldn't make it through, without even feeling something for this girl knowing it could have made A feeling bad even if I didn't think about it.  


  
Me and A talked about it and with suffer and pain made it through, the reason why I'm writing this is that A got interested on a guy during summer of 2022 to ""revenge"", to make me jealous, but at the time they met, they met 2 times, and during the second time she had an intimate moment with this guy. She told me back in the summer because she was feeling bad about it and couldn't let me not knowing about it even tho we weren't in a relationship, but she did tell me that he only did to her sexual foreplay and only a few months ago I discovered that they had something more. I'm completely aware that she didn't really want anything from anyone than me, but I still suffered from it. Summer of this year they met again and she rejected him, for the fact that they met this year I argued with her like no way similar before, and after she opened herself about her feelings I finally started accepting her for the person I love.  


  
But now I'm here, me and A live together, and I feel something I've never felt in general and for her, but still I suffer for the ""story"" she had, I suffer for everything about that story, I even suffer for what I did, and I suffer since I have real trust issues about her and often when we have intimate moments I keep thinking about her with another guy. I have no real reasons to feel bad about what happened in the past but in this scenario I'm very negative emotional even if as a person I'm not an emotive person, I'm asking all of you some opinions, help, tips in regard to my story. And how can i overcome this situation mentally? Thanks

@ maybegabrielerossato (I don't really use Reddit and probably won't be able to continue a conversation on DMs, if there are)",I'm (18 M 2004) having some mental/doubt based issues in my relationship with my girlfriend (19 F 2004),18nogdo,1703169412.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nogdo/im_18_m_2004_having_some_mentaldoubt_based_issues/,
"My bf (19M) is keeping me (21F) a secret and I don’t know what to do.

So for some context, my current bf is my ex’s best friend. So understandably, there is some discord in whether or not he should reveal that we are together. We have been together for 7 months, and the secrecy is killing me on the inside. 

My ex bf was a terrible guy, always putting me down in front of other people and breaking up with me multiple times because he felt like he was bored and didn’t love me anymore. Or he would pull the “if you want to leave, just leave” card when I would bring up a concern. He also got with another girl 2 weeks after we broke up. So yeah, all around not a great guy.

He always wanted to spend time with his best friend, so I ended up knowing his best friend and being acquaintances because he would bring me along.

After we broke up for the last time, I ended up talking to his best friend casually because he sent me a random Instagram reel. We then just kept talking after that as friends, and that went on for 3 months until I developed feelings and confessed that I liked him.

He said that he liked me too, and we’ve been dating for 7 months now. The only problem is, none of his friends or family know about me. This is partially due to the fact that we are long distance at the moment. 

The reason why this affects me so much is because we NEVER get to spend time together, 1) because we are currently long distance and 2) he can never call me since he lives with his friends and they will hear him talking to me and question him.

For more context, his friends are also friends with my ex, so if they knew he was with me, they might react negatively.

I just don’t know what to do because I love him, but only being able to call him maybe once a month is terrible. I tried to talk to him about it, and all he says is “I’m sorry” and “I will talk to you more” only to never try. Every time I ask him if he can call, he’s always busy with friends or he can’t because his friends live with him. 

I try to text him a lot because we have no other method of communication, but I think he’s starting to get bored of me or annoyed. He’s not the type to communicate his emotions though, so I can never really know and can only assume (which is also not great since I’m an overthinker). 

But I love him a lot since he doesn’t get mad when I talk about my problems like a lot of guys do. He also is really a nice person deep down, and I really do believe he cares. This whole situation of me being his best friend’s ex just makes things so complicated, so I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to make him talk about it because it could risk his friends being upset with him, but I also can’t take this much longer, so I just feel lost.

I guess my question really is how do I navigate this?

"Okay so I wanna know people's opinions on the matter. This is a really rocky story so bear with me. Me and My boyfriend met last year in May 2022 and we didn't really start talking to each other until July of 2022. Anyways this man would tell me he loved me and that he wanted to be with me but wanted to make sure he wasn't making a mistake because a few months prior at the beginning of 2022 he just got out of a really horrible relationship. I took it slow with him because I really really like him. All of our friends considered us a couple and we were inseparable ever since the day we met. He was very drunk one night and even cried to me one night in October telling me he was just using me and that he can't be with me. My heart genuinely broke because I thought I was finally getting him to open up. I told him I respect his decision and I stayed with him that night because we both were intoxicated and we decided this would be our last night together and we would make it a good one. We cried together and just slept in each others arms and I woke up the next morning and went home. We didn't talk we had mutual friends so of course we would see each other again a few days after that, He had some people over at his house and I went with my girlfriends the whole night he was trying to talk to me and touch me and I told him no like you're not playing these games and when everyone left we had another conversation about how he didn't mean what he said and he missed me. And I thought we both wanted to be together. At the end of October he took a job 2 1/2 hrs away so he moved down there for work. I would visit him VERY frequently for MONTHS. I would see him almost every weekend very rarely he would drive up to his apartment and stay with me. I would be the one making the trip usually. I would do this trip a lot because I missed him and wanted to be with him. He was down there until April 2023 we decided to move in together in March of 2023. He didn't ask me out officially until February 2023. We talked about it multiple times too how we were official just with out the title to make it easier on both of us to really feel the relationship out. Well last night I found on his email that the whole beginning of our relationship where I was putting in so much effort he was on Tinder CONSTANTLY. Until the month he officially asked me out and I remember even deleting Tinder off his phone but i never looked through it idk why...... But he lied to me for months and months when i would ask him about it and he said no he just never used it but he was paying for it i told him that doesn't make any sense and it would always be an argument of how he was never on it. Well last night I found the receipts. And i confronted him about it and he admitted to doing it the whole time while we were together because he didnt know what he wanted. this broke my heart i told him you wanted options and he said no and i told him you wanted options but you didn't want to let me go either and i told him he couldn't have both. This was a huge thing for me because not only did h lie to me whenever i asked about it. He basically used me until he realized that I was the best thing that's ever happened to him (his words) I told him he wanted to mess around with other girls and talk to them and he wanted me as well and that just doesn't work. I devoted myself to him and was loyal to him. Even though technically we weren't dating yet we were still together if that makes sense. he said he never had sex with anyone or anything. but this happened all almost a year ago. He hasn't done anything since weve officially been together But i'm just finding out about it now. He was doing it since we before we met May 2022 to February 2023 and he was paying for it as well. He hasn't done anything since but Can I just have some advice ? Also to clarify he knew I wouldn't be okay with this and I wouldn't be with him now if I had known but things are a lot different now.

"For context: we're long distance

I'd been with this girl for 2 years, we were going to get married (I don't believe in marriage, she does. So I told her Id marry her because it means growing old together, but I want to be financially secure first)
Everytime we were together, I showered her in hugs and kisses, she was glued to my hip. she has inside joke with her mom about how, she'd do her hair and makeup and I'd ruin by kissing her whole face and head non stop. I always made sure she was fed, even if she said she wasn't hungry, I got her food anyway. If she'd like my order better, I'd just swap plates. I took her on vacation over the summer. I never broke a promise, I only promised what I knew I could follow through on. I bought her gifts. I introduced her to my parents (I'm Brown so I was putting my life on the line by doing this, she knows that)

But, I'm a pretty blunt guy. I always take things at face value, so I'm not very patient with hints. I always just tell her to say what she's trying to say and stop beating around the bush, so I can be hard to talk to. I'm not really a romantic in a hallmark type way either. I prefer to show rather than tell.I also say a lot of stupid things, e.g I told her that I don't get any pleasure from kissing and asked if she did (it wasn't a dig at her, I was just curious what sensations she got when she kissed) she said this was her last straw, even though it had nothing to do with her. I've told her before that I didn't kiss any of the girls I hooked up with because it was an intimate thing for me. I told her I kiss her all the time, non stop, so it's nothing to do with her, it's just how my body is. I told her I love kissing her, otherwise I wouldn't do it. 


It was a pretty stupid thing to say in hindsight, I could have just googled it. But, why did she say she never felt loved? She said she felt like she was always chasing me? How? Did everything I did not mean anything to her? I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm an ass, but I never made her chase me, so I don't understand.  I'm not asking for a mind reading or anything, just looking for women's perspective.

I want nothing more than to work things out. We broke up 10 days ago, 3 days ago i sent her a message saying that I want to work things out, I want to make her feel secure and loved and when she's ready all she has to do is reach out. I'll be waiting.

I told him it’s in January but he commented that is too long from today which was weird. Then he suggested how about I work until the end of December.

"Hello everyone. I’m typing here because I don’t know what else to do. We have been together for about 3 years. I’m 24 and she’s 21. When we first started dating, I caught her texting and saying some borderline stuff to one of our coworkers. We ended up making up back then and haven’t had a problem until recently. I want you to also keep in mind we have a 1 year old daughter and a house together now. The other night, I see a text come up from a dude I’ve never seen before and I ended up seeing she’s sent him over 3000 texts in the past month. The conversation consists of her flirting with this guy and mocking me to him. We got into a huge fight about it and she said it was wrong and would never happen again. Well, I come home the next day and I literally see a text from the dude the second I walk into the bedroom. She’s asleep so I open her phone and sure enough she literally texted him from the moment I left for work until she fell asleep. We had just talked all morning about fixing things and really had a heartfelt conversation, that made it hurt so much more. Now here’s the real kicker, I see in her deleted pics she had an account on a sugardaddymeet website.

If I kicked her out she would take my daughter with her. She would end up staying with her grandma, my 1 year old daughter would not have a room of her own and would be living in a crowded house until she can get an apartment of her own. I hate the idea of this, even if she got her own apartment my daughter would grow up bouncing from house to house. My daughter deserves a place to call home.

"It just happened this morning. I was being playful and tickled him (something we do sometimes) and he said ""no!"" And got up and walked to the bedroom and closed the door and got ready for work. He was in there a while. When he came out he didn't say anything but I could tell he was upset. I said ""are you mad?"" He said ""little bit."" I apologized for tickling him and he said he was in pain and it hurt him. I didn't realize he was in so much pain. I apologized again. I tried to hold back tears but they came out. He said ""I'm sorry I'm just in a lot of pain.""

He gets really angry sometimes. Instead of saying, ""hey I don't want to be tickled right now, I'm actually feeling some pain"" he just got up and stormed off. And then wasn't going to say anything about it, I had to ask him if he was upset. 

It reminds me of childhood. Both my mom and dad had a bad temper and I was always hypervigilant of their mood changing and making sure not to do anything that might upset them. 

Things like this happen with my boyfriend from time to time. He gets frustrated (about anything, not usually pain related) and all of a sudden his temper comes out. I'm not sure if it's something I can get past. We have been dating almost 2 years. I love him so much. But I have talked with him about this a number of times.

A week ago before going to sleep he told me (i don’t remember how we got talking about it) that he feels like the relationship feels has started to feel “normal, mundane, usual” and that this feeling has lasted only 2 days. I was of course a bit hurt by this comment but as we have been together for 4 months i understand that these feelings may arise as it’s not as new and you are more used to the person. He did say that he didn’t mean that in a bad way and that maybe he worded it wrong. He also said that it may be because in his previous relationships he was long distance (one for 2 years, other also 2 years) and that he didn’t really know how “usual relationships” are.

Skip to a few days later (I work in another city and am away 3 days a week) we facetimed and i asked how he was doing. He told me that he felt really bad about the comment he made. Then told me that he has been thinking about it a bit and that he is just confused about the relationship. That he loves me, our sex is super great (that is very much true) and that we don’t have any problems communicating etc. But that sometimes he wonders what he is doing and why. I told him that maybe he is getting cold feet because in a sense this relationship is getting more serious. He then also told me that he worries that he may too feminine. For context- he likes taking care of himself (hair, nails and stuff), likes theatre a lot, a bit time ago made himself a croptop which he only sometimes wears at home, is in a very good way an emotional man, likes when i do his nails (just clean them up, no polish). All of which i find to be normal stuff. I asked him if he was attracted to men or if that what he is trying to tell me. He told me that sure he finds men attractive- but has never been attracted to men in that way nor has had any want to explore before. We talked and he told me he still wants to be with me, so thats why these feelings are confusing him.

Fast forward to today. I came to his apartment yesterday (while i am in the city i usually stay with him) and he acted like nothing happened. He was sweet, gentle, we had sex (i was worried the whole time- but the sex was good). I asked him how he felt and he told me that this feeling has been blowing over and that he is very happy to see me.

Now i am left very paranoid. I know i should trust him on his word, but 1) i always worry that he maybe hiding his true feelings and i am getting dragged along for the ride 2) i dont know if its my own misogyny but i am worried that he may be gay (even though before i never thought about this and he clearly is attracted to me and the sex is very good) 3) i feel like i am preparing myself for a breakup which sucks, because he is truly the kindest soul for me at this moment.

My question would be:
What would u do in this situation?
Should i take him on his word or talk even more about this?
Is it just cold feet?
Idk anything helps

"i can’t get this phrase out of my head. i’ve (21F) currently been seeing someone (22M) for about a month. he has a lot of good qualities to him. he’s been very patient, compassionate, and open with me communication-wise. sometimes he has been a little to open to the point where i feel like it is a form self-sabotaging. this was one of those comments.

on our first date, we were hitting it off and went back to his place for a movie. while watching the movie he said “i feel like i’m going to hurt you.” i was somewhat confused on how to respond, so i asked him to explain. he said that because he’s only going to be in my town until may, we would have to have a short-term relationship if we ever got to that point. i told him that was fine with me as my longest relationship was 2 months (mainly because i’ve only been in two relationships in my life, and i haven’t been in the dating scene for a while). 

there was also another comment of that nature where he said “i feel like we don’t have a lot in common.” this was on the second date, which i’ll admit was a bit awkward because it was a museum date and i genuinely had no idea what to talk about. this comment didn’t mess with me as much because i think it’s okay to not have a lot of commonalities with someone. in fact, i think you can learn a lot of new things from another person’s hobbies while getting to keep your individuality. 

however, i’m so confused about the comment where he feels like he’s going to hurt me. he likes me and we’ve been seeing each other a lot. his actions are lining up with the fact that he likes me: remembering every little detail about me, doing thoughtful gestures like helping take some things down in my apartment, and saying things like “well you’re very high on the priority list.” i can’t tell if this is just a game and he’s faking his feelings toward me or if it was a conversation about what our expectations for a relationship. it’s been making me insecure for the past couple days, but i don’t want to make a rash decision based on some irrational fears. any advice would be appreciated",guy (22M) says to me (21F) that he “feels like he’s going to hurt me.” how should i interpret this?,18no88m,1703168783.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18no88m/guy_22m_says_to_me_21f_that_he_feels_like_hes/,

Hello, I guess I should start by saying this has been one of the most stressful years of my life.  I met my boyfriend who I’ll call K on Snapchat. He added me out of nowhere and replied to one of my stories. 

He was 26 when we met, I was 21.  We hit it off almost immediately, I had just came off a very bad depression and was happy to have met someone so special.  Early on he opened up to me about his mental health issues and abusive family. So our relationship became me making sure he was okay while he went through his struggles.  He painted a story of how horrible his family was, claimed they’d beat him, wouldn’t buy food, take his money.etc etc   So he’d start asking me for money I’m which I’d give him because I cared, it was only small amounts so I didn’t mind.  


Eventually he told me he got diagnosed with heart failure and needed medication urgently and his family wouldn’t help him. So I’d give him the money to pay for his expensive heart meds.  I was basically his caretaker and I never got anything from this. We never got a real date or anything because of his religious family’s hold on him so I’d settle for only seeing him for a little bit every so often. I’d drive to him and hang out for an hour before he had to rush back home.  I’d bring him gifts like a new phone or his favorite stuffed animals…..to an expensive watch. I just wanted to make him happy.  


Eventually things hit a bump in which stuff at home became so unbearable for him from the abuse. He told me his family came in his room threw away everything I got him and beat him.  I was so hurt and I decided to get him out of there. I worked hard and got us an apartment. He said he’d love to come with me.  However, his family went threw his phone and found out about me. They texted me saying I’m an evil sinner and going to hell and they’re trying to help their son get clean off drugs.   


I didn’t know what they were talking about and while this was happening my bf was texting me from his second phone (the one I got) telling me to ignore them.  They took him to some church therapist who is a family friend and he came back refusing to come live with  me and became some super religious person.   I was so hurt by this we begin to fight I couldn’t understand why he’d stay there. We’d fight everyday for a month straight and I went to therapy because I believed I was a horrible boyfriend.   

Eventually he opened up and said he’s staying because his mom is sick and passing. I understood and let it go.   Then he vanished for months, I went crazy wondering if he was okay. Everyday I called and texted him asking to know if he’s alright. He’d read my messages but not respond.  


Well he came back after his mom died. Said he regretted staying with his family, asked if I still loved him, found out I went on a date and became very angry.  He asked me for money again shortly after and I gave it, was only 25 bucks.  Well he finally told me the truth.  He told me he was an addict and he used the money I gave him on drugs. All the help I thought I was giving was enabling his addiction.  He said he’s turning to Jesus and the Church to get clean and start a new life, that he can’t be with me anymore. He wants me to be his friend and support him through all this.  

 I feel hurt. I snapped and he started guilting me and now I feel trapped. I feel like I have to be his friend.   He told me he keeps pressing to god that I stay in his life but I just wish I could forget him.   I feel used and now that he’s used me up he’s going to go down this christ path while I’m left with the emotional damage. 

He wants me to be his friend while I watch him leave me behind? Broken? His family hates me and he now wants a wife?….  

He’s even pretending like he doesn’t remember our times together because he was apparently So high that his memory is gone. He even asked me if I touched him without consent?!!!? He said his therapist thinks I may have taken advantage of him???!!! I broke down so hard when he asked me this….

Where do I go from here. I have so much financial damage from trying to help him, my emotions are destroyed, and he doesn’t care at all…….  I’ve had a pretty hard dating life and I don’t think I want to date anyone ever again…….


  TL//DR: Boyfirend claimed he was in a horrible situation and would ask me for money. Turns out he was using it for drugs. He wants me to be his friend because he can’t be with me anymore while he turns to Jesus to get clean.

"Some background: I have been dating this guy since 8 years and it has been a long distance relationship since we started dating right out of high school. We've been doing okay for the most part until marriage came into the picture. His parents do not approve of the relationship because of caste difference, however my family is really after me to get married and they do not understand the delay from our end.Since an year, I have been asking him to seriously initiate conversation with his parents, because family is important to both of us and we would really love to have both families present and happy for us. Here's the problem: He is very paranoid about hurting his parents' feelings so he has been dragging this out.Very early on in our relationship, it was also sort of a given that I was the counsellor/therapist person and he was the anxious/paranoid one. I was just there for him, no questions asked. Through his school, internship, job hunt..everything - And he acknowledged my efforts and told me that everything will be fine once he is in a stable posititon with a well paying job and that he will make it up to me. He did manage to do well and is earning good as well, but he does not want to put in the efforts to sustain a relationship. He does not understand that it is effort everyday with a long distance relationship with such huge time difference.. There have been days where we have not spoken to each other at all. This is all very concerning to me as I am a working individual too with insane hours and have always prioritised to be there for him+relationship.So I got very worked up and recently gave him a very tough time about all of this. I told him that if he cannot take a stand in front of his parents for us + cannot make time for this relationship, then we are pretty much done. He just did not respond to my concerns. He tells me that he is very sick and needs some time to recover and will write back post that.Now after 1-2 days, I get very worried as he is alone in a different country and sick too. So even though I maintain my stance, I decide to call him everyday and check in on him. I realised that he is working through the sickness so he definitely had the time to address my concerns. However, I decide to wait because he tells me that he has never been this sick and has gotten some bloodwork done as well.One weekend, I see his friend post a story of them partying in Vegas. I broke down. I called him up and he lied to me about it. When I showed him the picture, he admitted to it and is now telling me that he pretended to be sick for one extra week as this was the only way I was keepingin touch with him. He also adds that he was just scared and did not have answers to my questions which is why he resorted to this.I am hurt beyond repair. He was my everything. I never thought he would lie to me.

I am so hurt that I want to end things with him but the history is so strong with this one and that I am very confused about how to naviagte this?

"I wrote this at 3 am, on my phone, and I'm off my meds so forgive me if this is unhinged, and poorly organized. 

So. I am mildly autistic and have suffered from insomnia my whole life; I need warm blankets, a cold room and *silence* or i can not sleep. My house (as in MY house, my name is first on the paperwork, and i have been responsible for paying vast majority of the mortgage. The house is *mine* and i will die on this hill!) has very thin walls. The thin walls weren't a problem after my two room mates (both 29f) and I moved in. The thin walls became a problem 3 months after moving in when my room mates younger sister got kicked out..

The sister is 8 years younger than my room mates and i, and she is also autistic, however her condition is enough to qualify her for government assisted housing. She has been on a list to get this housing for at least a few years, so when i agreed to letting her live in my house i was under the assumption that it would be temporary. This was *supposed* to be temporary! She has been here for over a year! And maybe this wouldnt be a problem if she wasnt so fucking noisey!

Her default volume is shouting, and she doesn't shut up! Damn near every hour she is awake she is online, playing games with her friends and her volume while on the computer is worse than when shes talking to you. The volume on our TV is regularly set to 70 or higher and sometimes you *still* cant hear your show over her!

She is regularly awake until after 3am.

This wouldnt be so much of a problem if her computer wasnt 10 feet from the wall my room shares with the kitchen! 

90% of the messages ive sent her have been requests to keep her volume down.

She went out of town to visit their parents for an early christmas whatever, and my other room mate said ""it was too quiet without you"" and NO! no it wasnt! It was the correct amount of quiet and i want to go back to that right the fuck now thank you very much! 

Dont get me wrong she's a perfectly nice young lady and sure she doesn't have a job or pay rent but she helps with chores and cleaning, but i am tired of asking her to keep her volume down after 1am (as in i am sick of it being after 1 am and having to ask her to keep her volume down!). And its not just her talking either, her phone is also in a constant state of crazy loud!

My insomnia has been kicking my ass lately and she is not helping! 

I miss having peace and quiet, i miss having a living room. I miss having just two room mates. I am at a point where i just want her out of my house so i dont have to listen to her any more!

I know i am probably the asshole in this situation.

Do i care? No! I am in a constant state of over stimulation and i am *tired*! 

I had to ask her to put headphones on TWICE *while* i was writing this because i could hear her phone from my room! It is 3:27am!

The big issue? My roommate, ie the noisy ones older sister is *super* defensive of her. Plus she has bipolar disorder and gets super *angry* when i try to voice my grievance surrounding  her sister. I once compaired her to an unwanted guest who wont leave and she was *pissed*

"My boyfriend and I have always fought since being together, the beginning of our relationship. I thought because I wanted to settle down that there are bumps in every relationship and I just have to work on this one and eventually we will love each other enough to make it work but I’m seeing now that this probably isn’t going to work. Just today he admitted he wants kids in any form meaning adoption or kids of our own. I told him for a while that I don’t want kids I’d say two years into us being together he’s known I don’t want the responsibility of children due to my childhood and having to raise all 5 of my brothers while my mom did what she wanted. I grew up in a very controlling relationship with my parents I was strictly to come home from school and take care of everyone and I’ve told my boyfriend this and this being the reason I want to life my own life free of responsibilities like children. He’s agreed with me for the entire time or so I thought. 

I told him I will not be having kids and I don’t think this is going to work to out anymore because he wants them and I don’t and his response was “I’ll just shut up about what I want in life because it doesn’t matter as long as you get what you want.” This man will also say I’m destroying his life when all I want to do is talk about my feelings or how some of his actions have made me feel. I seriously cannot talk about my feelings at all because if he does something that he intended to be good I don’t get to feel any type of way about it other then greatful because he didn’t mean for it to upset or offend me and if I do have an issue he calls me selfish/ungreatful because his intentions weren’t to do that. 

Throughout these 4 years I have been on two different kinds of medications to help with my mental struggles and have been to two different therapists and I have stopped smoking cigarettes because I have severe asthma. He is a heavy smoker in thc and cigarettes and has told me he’d stop shortly after I did two years in, everytime I bring it up he gets defensive and starts getting mad and saying “you think I can be with someone like you and not smoke cigarettes? You make me mad everyday” but when he’s not mad at me it’s “work is so stressful I’m sorry I can’t seem to stop.” I’ve told him he has until August of 2024 because that’s when our lease is up and I’ll be 25 and won’t be staying in this same situation any longer. When I asked him a few months ago if he even has a plan to be done before then he says “eh I have until next August I’m fine until then.” Which baffled me. 

Today he told me that I’m the reason our life sucks and is boring because of my hobbies. I do a lot of artistic things like crocheting drawing reading writing and playing video games. He straight up said “I want to do things and go to shows and go out and you won’t do anything but sit and do your dumb hobbies. You’re fine so f me right?” I was taken a back because I had a deep heart to heart discussion this year and last about going to find him a hobby whether that be metalsmithing to wood burning or anything and I even offered him my art supplies so he could try to find a groove and he rejected it saying he’s not interested in any of that. I have no friends and can’t talk to any of my family, is this worth it? I’ve had no friends the entire 4 years and I need some outside perspective. Should I call it quits sooner and move into our guest bedroom? I can’t live like this anymore, there’s so much more to this, more issues I could talk about but this is just a gist of it.","I F24 and my M28 boyfriend may be splitting after 4 years together, should I pull the plug and do it sooner then the deadline I have set?",18nnyuo,1703168021.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nnyuo/i_f24_and_my_m28_boyfriend_may_be_splitting_after/,
"Me and my bf met in a online game. We had instant connection and we fell in love really fast. Everything was so beautiful and nice. We both said we haven't fallen like this before. Beginning of our dating, about 3 months was so perfect, I guess that's called the honeymoon phase. We have been together for 6 months, but its a long-distance relationship. We have met in real life before and planned to meet soon again.

Me and him met during time he had difficult times in his life and I was grieving over my grandpa's recent death that time. Me and my bf were so close and supported each other. We gamed with other people,  he liked my friends, there were no jealousy issues.  

But his behaviour has changed so drastically. Constant accusations of guys who follow my instagram, wanting to f#ck me. Guys I game with are ""simps"", how when I meet up with my guy friends I am f#cking them. My guy friends who have girlfriends who I am good friends with, some even have kids, we would never do such a thing. But my bf takes the idea of me being a h0e and doesn't change his mind until I prove him wrong. He has changed so suddenly. I haven't cheated once. I have same friends I talk to and hang out with, that were not a problem in the beginning of me and bf dating. Suddenly he thinks every male in my life wants to date and f#ck me. He even said he knows how guy's mind works. 

I am very offended. He has told me I'm the best girl he's dated and his family has said it too.  His parents love me so much. I have given him love, affection, have comforted him when he has problems with his insecurities, I haven't given up on us during arguments etc. And he sees me as some cheap h0e who wants men when it's not true. We have argued before, when he said my male friends are sticking around waiting until they have a chance to date me or jump into bed with me, even the taken ones. I really don't know what went wrong. Why did his mind towards me changed so suddenly.

Let me also mention something about him. He is traumatized because his own father cheated on his mom. Then in his dating relationships girls all cheated on him. He is so broken and traumatized from past experience and he has told me sometimes that he sees ""patterns"" from the past in actions that I do. As an example he said when his ex went out with a male friend, she had s3x with him. And now he thinks I am doing it too. This constant comparison to his exes is draining me. I am a completely different person. If I have feelings and I love someone, I can't go and cheat. I am turning 24 years old soon and I want to settle down with one person and start a family etc. I am not interested in having s3x with randoms. My last ex also cheated on me with lot of girls and I have noticed patterns in my current relationship, but the difference between me and my boyfriend is that I don't jump at him with overthinking and accusations. I am not a jealous type. But he always attacks me out of thin air when just hours before we laughed in a call, we talked about future. His mood changes so suddenly and he can be very offensive towards me when he is mad.

My point is. Our relationship is not what it used to be. I am just trying to figure out what went wrong. How does he suddenly think I want to hurt him or cheat on him. I constantly have to prove him I love him, I don't want anyone else. I have to send screenshots and long messages every time he assumes I did something with someone, that's when he calms down. He has become so controlling. Me myself I am not jealous, I don't ask him who is this, where are you, prove me you're not f#cking someone etc. I have cut off guys who had romantic interest in me, I have blocked and removed countless people for him and it's still not enough. Now when my friend circle is really small and I only have guy friends who i know for years, who even have girlfriends and kids, they're a problem too. They didn't use to be a problem in the beginning phase of our dating. I feel like my bf wants me to be completely isolated, so he is the only person for me. 

Let me also mention how he is different in real life. When we are together every day. He is very loving and not jealous at all. But due to circumstances we are forced to live in different countries until spring. He is a completely different person online, most of the time saying ""go call your other boyfriends"", ""go game with other guys"". One time when we argued I said let's calm down and talk when we are calm and we won't say offensive things out of anger, he said ""oh you want time off so you can go spread your legs to other men"". 

The only reason I've even tolerated this situation for so long is because I know how well we connect in real life. Maybe he is not a long-distance person. I am willing to understand that trust issues are easier to come online. You can never be sure if your partner doesn't lie to you where you're going etc. My ex who cheated on me during long distance, told me he is hanging out with friends but he actually went to have s3x with girls. So yes i understand LDR is difficult and most people don't believe in it. 

He thinks his thoughts, then he isolates himself, goes drifting, fights, smokes way more, gets emotional etc. His parents and friends never know what's going on in our relationship, he never tells them something's wrong. Then I have to send screenshots of chats with someone as proof I haven't flirted with them, then he calms down. And comes back like nothing happened. He is again that loving bf. Even though I'm worried what he will do to himself when he isolates himself. He has told me he sometimes needs time to cool off and think about things, he has apologized for things and then he behaves same way again.

He has said he has insecurities. I have said I love you the way you are. He has attacked me verbally by saying I don't understand his insecurities. 

I really love him, but I feel like my mental health will just suffer because of his behaviour. One moment he is so close to me and so loving, making me feel so happy and next moment he is an absolute monster, who distances himself, goes to do dangerous stuff in real life because he overthank and got emotional. Lately it's me walking on egg shells thinking when will he flip about something again. Like i mentioned, the only reason I am still here is because of how different guy he is in real life. He doesn't accuse me, he doesn't get jealous, we actually sit down when we argue and talk, but online he isolates himself doing harmful activities, doesn't want to talk about things etc.

"I don't know where to go from here. Throwaway because my brother knows my reddit account.

For context, my brother (25M) is a POS looser, and i've been giving him the silent treatment almost constantly for close to 2 years now. He's a terrible person, i won't go into much detail, but lazy, plays video game all day, stuck in mom's house, you know the type ...

Recently my parents went away to take care of my aging grandmother, and they left me and my brother alone in the house. One evening we started arguing about dumb sh\*t, and he was rambling about me being too weak to do anything to him physically so he didn't care about me. We started fighting and he punched me so hard i coudn't get up for a couple of minutes.

I was crying and the first person i came forward to was my boyfriend, and he was very angry and decided to go fight my brother. I didn't tell my parents because i thought they would side with him, but that was a stupid decision ! To be fair i didn't try and stop him because of how much i hate my brother, (he is very sexist), and i thought his lazy and weak guts would make him back down and apologise or something like that ...

So we came back to my parent's house, and i don't remember much because of how quickly it happend, but my brother threw my BF on the floor and started kicking him and beating him up, when he was done he was screaming like a madman at my bf who was on the floor. I thought he killed him at first because he wasn't moving, but he regained consciousness and we went to the hospital. He broke his nose, wrist, lips, and his chest and arms was covered in hematomas.

My parents came home and were quite angry, but we have cameras and they filmed the fight between my bf and my brother, (and not ours !), and they very quickly sided with my brother because the camera footage show my BF attacking my brother first and he defended himself. My BF and his parents wanted to sue my brother, but a good friend of mine who's parent is a lawyer said that because of the camera footage and the law in my country my BF could be concidered an invader, so it woudn't hold in a court .. My parents are asking me to break up with him ( we have been together for 2 years now )

My brother claims that i attacked him first because he was taunting me, so now my parents are completely on his side and i feel lost. And he is very cocky now because my boyfriend is a very fit / manly guy and he beat him up ...

"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over a year now, and we're in a long-distance relationship. We haven't met yet, and it won't be happening anytime soon due to various reasons. Initially, everything was good, but he suddenly started acting differently and became less involved. He even ghosted me for a long time. When he came back, he explained he was stressed about a few things and couldn't handle everything properly. Although we got back together and started anew, I had already developed trust issues.

He made significant changes in his behavior, which initially reassured me. We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them in a healthy way. However, recently, things have been different and weird. We're having more arguments that don't end properly. He often avoids topics and refuses to communicate effectively. His stubbornness and expectation for things to be his way, disregarding my feelings, are concerning. There were instances when I was criticized for not doing things a certain way, but I'm expected not to react when he does the same.

"Yesterday, we rode the train together when we were doing our commute to work (I work from home most days. But when I have to go to the office, I leave even earlier just so I can go with her)

We live quite near each other, with our moms.
Her mom is often outside home or sleeping, because she works a night shift.

When we were riding the train yesterday, she mentioned if she could expend the Christmas night in my home, since her mom would be away at work. I made myself clear that this wouldn't be possible, I said that the house was a mess and so my mom doesn't want that. 

She mentioned that this isn't the first time I say that (and it isn't), but the truth is that my mom doesn't want her around, I didn't want to mention that. We went on a small trip with my family, and my aunt and godfather didn't like her(my GF), so they started critiquing her after the trip to my mom. I'm still working with my mom to make her understand. Most of their complaints is that they feel shes only with me cuz of money, I earn triple the amount she does, and during the trip I paid for everything for her, as I do most times we go out.

I don't feel like this is straight up the case, and I only pay for small stuff like a drink or a ticket. We did had a long trip this year across the country, and we split all the costs 50/50.


After I mentioned we can't expend the Christmas night in my home for now, I've even suggested we do it in her home. She said this made her feel distant from me, and started ignoring me a little bit.

I've been to her home several times, and her mom is very receptive of me.

After we parted ways, she started being cold on the phone. Yesterday night when I got home, I told I wanted to call her to talk a little bit. She said she didn't have anything to talk to me, and acted very rude. Next Friday is her birthday, I was planning to make something for her, then we have Christmas, and then next month is our anniversary.

She always mentions I'm not the one who plans our stuff, and she always has to make up plans for going out etc(that's also what she said last time she gave me a cold treatment). So I wanted to make this special.


This is the third time this year that this happens, I feel like the worst.
We never had a argument or anything. But anytime I say something she doesn't like, she starts acting like this, and I have to be very understanding, I always have to play the won who did wrong.
She's a caring girl and works a lot for her goals, and I also care a lot for her. We have known eachother for 5 years at least. Had a relationship with her since the beginning, but we only made it official last year.

How can I work with this moving along? I need advice",My GF(F21) is giving me(M22) the cold treatment,18nnos1,1703167237.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nnos1/my_gff21_is_giving_mem22_the_cold_treatment/,
"At the beginning of the relationship, he told me that he was more nonmonogamous but is happy to be monogamous with me. I told him that if I'm going to be in a serious relationship I would prefer we be exclusive. 

With that, we started dating and he says some interesting things now and again. He comments on how attractive other people are a lot and I try to play along and pretend I don't care- saying 'oh yeah they are hot'- but on some level, it does bother me. I know this is more of a me problem, but everytime he calls someone hot I just start comparing myself to that person and wondering whats wrong with me. If he says a short girl is cute I'll start feeling insecure about my height, if he says a really thin person is hot I will start to feel like I'm too fat or something. Its making me feel really shit about myself and I don't know how to bring it up to him because I've pretended to be fine with it for so long.

Further, every now and again he will ask about 'the boundaries of our relationship'. In my head, 'exclusive' kind of says it all: we only date, only kiss, and are only intimate with each other. But even still he will say shit like 'is it ok if I were to makeout with someone at the club' or 'am I allowed to kiss my friends'. These feel like obvious no's to me, something already covered when I said I want to be exclusive. But even still he asks. I find it really hard because suddenly I have to be the b!tch who tells him no. Im annoyed that he can't just understand the basic rules of a very common relationship structure without me constantly reminding him what he can and can't do. It makes me feel like I'm being controlling or something which makes me feel really shit.

Anyway, it happened again today, he told me he was going to a party and said 'i might make out with someone would that be ok?' I just said 'I guess if that's something you really wanna do', even though I honestly would prefer he didn't. Now I'm just sitting here knowing he's making out with some random person while I'm alone and jealous. 

I don't want to be the one to limit him because I don't want him to resent me as our relationship continues. Am I being stupid? Should I just explain to him the basic nature of an exclusive relationship? Should I try and work on my own jealousy and try to embrace a nonmonogamous relationship? I just don't know what to do and I'm freaking out I'm reaching a boiling point. 

I just can't deal with feeling insecure and controlling all the time. I want him to think I'm enough like how I think he's enough.

I (25M) and my girl (24F) used to live together. This year she moved to another city for study (only for one year and she will come back). 

since she moved I visited her twice to help her move her things. During the last month I ran into some money problems then I resolved it and then I had some huge workload so I couldn’t visit her. 

 for not visiting her, she became cold with me until we had a fight over the phone; she called me selfish, that I don’t take care of her and that is why she became cold in the relationship. And when I explained the reasons why I couldn’t visit her she told that I am a cry baby, and I make efforts only when I can ( because according to her, a loving partner will figure out a solution). And she also mentioned that I go out with friends on Saturday night so Money/time aren’t an issue.
 And just an info she lives very far away (6hours travel) and the plane ticket isn’t cheap. 
I proposed that she comes and I pay for her trip, but she refused because she don’t want to take my money, which I honestly think is just an excuse because we never have this « kind of relationship » and we always spend money on each other.

It really bothered me when she called me selfish because I really give a lot in the relationship for example when she has trouble not understanding something I ll call her on zoom to explain the course and this can take up to several hours ( this was during the period in which I had a huge workload), I already came two times to bring her stuff.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION:
1) My girlfriend lived some trauma  when she was young so calling me names is just the trauma speaking, she worked on this a lot during the relationship and I respect it because it is not easy ( so I am willing to let pass these). 
Also you should know that I was very independent in my life and I am not a very emotional person ( It doesn’t mean that I don’t have emotions but I can control them and think rationally).

2) Going to this school is not only her decision. I supported it a lot and I did my best to help her get accepted, I always knew how much she wants to go there and I really love seeing her achieve her goals. So I never blame her for going there. 

3) she is a great faithful, loving and caring person.

"First of things I don’t need you to tell me that I am a piece shit human because I already know.

I have been with a girl (let’s say M) for 3.5 years now. We don’t live together but we live close. The first 2 years were really almost perfect and I could see a future with this girl. She had lots of things I adored. After these two years things took a down hill. We stopped laughing and we stopped doing things. We fell in a routine. She would at times drag my mood down from not trying to be talkative with me or do things with me. To be more precise she became a really boring person to hang out with. We also shared different views on family stuff and when the discussion went to that we would always argue pointlessly. 

Now the second person comes into my way.  For 5 months now I have been on dates with a coworker of mine. (Let’s call her S). S is truly beautiful and has top humor. We always laugh and have great great time.  I can say I’m in love with that person. She is though not mature and acts childish a lot of times and that turns me kinda off. Every feeling is vivid with this girl but I cannot see any future with her as we are very different characters. 


When we started dating with S we went out as friends. After sometime it became erotic and working together we had many hours close. We have very good chemistry but we are really different people so we don’t have future together. 

I haven’t breakup with M because 1)these last months I tried fixing our relationship by pointing my problems without an answer back. 
2) the 5 months went by so fast that I didn’t even notice it. 
3) I really have some feelings for M and would love to save it but I can’t  find how. I tried lots of things but it doesn’t feel the same anymore. 

I really feel bad for all of these things I have done. I know I am a bad person but I am trying to fix it. The thing is I don’t want to lose M but it just not the same anymore. Please understand that this is not something I intended to do. It just went naturally and my actions little by little brought me here.

My wife (34F) usually wakes up earlier than I (36M), we’ve been married for 5 years. Lately, she has had this annoying habit (ok to some) of drawing the curtains as soon as she wakes up at 6 AM. Because she has to leave early for work, she does that and proceeds to go in the kitchen to prepare the meals. 

I am extremely sensitive to light and even the light from the floor peeking through under the door is enough to keep me awake at night. So after what my wife does, I have no option but to wake up and join her. 

At first, I tried to talk her into not doing this but she always conveniently “forgot”. This really made me annoyed and I wanted to do something without having the burden of conversation again. Note that she goes straight to the kitchen for an hour after waking up. 

So what I did, I bought the darkest pair of blindfolds that I only use after she’s left the room to sleep the extra 40 minutes or so I keep craving every morning. This seemed to really annoy her and when she came to the room and discovered me, she was PISSED. She didn’t say anything to me but proceeded to slam the door shut as she was leaving for work and would give me an attitude after she came. 

Here’s where I might be the AH - I may have slighted her when passing by her this evening when I said “It feels good to advocate for yourself” and laughed to myself as she seethed. I know I was being petty but she brought this upon herself by being an ass every morning. 

Maybe it’s envy. I work from home so I can usually chill and not have to prepare my meals. It’s just the guess however. What’s funny is, she would keep her noise really down so I can’t even accuse her of annoying me on purpose. It’s always “habit”

It reeks of plausible deniability and this time I refused her to have it

"I have come in search of advice because after my GF started taking a new medication, her feelings and behavior have changed. This medication is necessary but she is going to tell her doctor soon that the known side effects are not working for her. That being said I am worried it is not just the medication and things will not go back to how they were. We have had talks about everything and she assures me she loves me. Our bedroom life is suffering and she seems uninterested(was not the case before). She used to be very loving, happy, and energetic. Now she is sometimes loving and sometimes seems to push me away. The other day I laid down next to her and she turned her phone away but when I asked why she turned it away(it was not subtle) she had been texting a friend/former coworker of hers that can be flirty with her. I don’t feel threatened by him especially because he is now across the world and my GF showed me the conversation. However the new behaviors, catching her trying to hide something , and  lack of intimacy/ trouble “finishing the deed”, all make me wonder if our relationship will ever be how it was again, if this is more than side effects, if she is losing feelings for me and gaining them else where.

He’s a narcissist who constantly put me down.He really did hurt me in the past a lot. I’m pretty sure he was also cheating on me, don’t have any evidence but for sure emotionally cheating he did. The one thing I couldn’t get past was when I had an ectopic pregnancy. He was there physically taking care of me. But emotionally, when I started feeling depressed, he wasn’t there. He didn’t wanna touch my belly when I’d grab his hand. He told me to get over it when I was sad. And then months later he went to comfort his pretty coworker when she was fighting with her boyfriend. He always had a bestfriend at work that I’d see would treat him as their work husband. I caught him 3 times coming home straight to the sink to wash his d*ck. I know I should hate him, but I don’t know..I’ve seen other girls put up with more and it feels like it wasn’t enough to leave maybe. We’re told to stick with our men through thick and thin but I couldn’t do it anymore. He told me people separate for far worse. I keep having trouble validating my feelings and my hurt.  I left for so many reasons. He acted like he hated me, like he was begging me to leave practically. 2 years ago I started telling him I was losing feelings and I wanted to go to therapy. After a year he agreed and then he changed his mind one hour before the session. I really wanted to fix our relationship and he didn’t take me seriously. I’d tell him eventually I’d lose all feelings if we didn’t work on our relationship and he’d tell me to just leave, that he wasn’t going to change. A few months before our break up he sat me down and said “I’m not gonna change, take it or leave it”. I also did 100% of the housework while I was expected to pay 50/50 even though I was making less than he was and I was struggling financially. For a whole month he’d come home at 4am, he was gambling at the casino which actually put him in debt for $23k. We didn’t have sex anymore, I’d beg him to take me on dates. I also feel bad because he helped me get my green card, and everyone keeps telling him I just used him. I wish I could give it back. I paid all of it while I struggled financially, he didn’t help me with any of the paperwork just signed when he needed to.

"Hi guys! Sorry if this is a long post. I just need someone’s else opinion. I was wondering if you guys think I am in the wrong for telling my boyfriend to please be a better driver after he just got into an accident?

So a week before this, he was backing up and didn’t look back, and came very close to hitting a lady. He has also ran a few red lights because he’s speeding up and going too fast , and can’t stop in time when the light has changed to red. He also doesn’t break when the car ahead of him is breaking. Sometimes he speeds up when a car in front of him is slowing down and is pressing on the break. I don’t understand why he’s speeding up when he sees traffic is slowing down?  He’s also only relying on car sensors so he’s not looking back, there’s time he comes very close to hitting an object or not looking at his blind spots. He expects me to just brush it off but he doesn’t change how he drives. Today, he got into an accident and Tboned someone at a four way stop with only him and one other car. He said he somehow missed the other car and that the car blended in with the dark and he didn’t see it was there. But I don’t see how that’s true if his car lights was on and if he was observing and looking before he goes. I tested it out myself to see if it was too dark but no, the car light alone allows you to see what’s in front of you. It’s very hard to not see another car there unless you’re not looking. ( this four way stop is in front of my house and we go through this way every single day)I just think that he isn’t cautious of his surroundings and isn’t careful when he’s driving. I have voiced my concerns of his drivings so many times and he doesnt see how dangerous his driving can be and how it could potentially kill someone. He has an ego and also refuse to take my advice on things he can do and change to be a safer driver. I’m just very concerned that he’ll accidentally kill someone or a bad accident would happen .

"You read the title. He is an amazing, amazing man and i love him dearly, I really do. However, he is a big teaser. On the other hand, I’m pretty much like dinamite. 0 tolerance. I was extremely bullied at school and developed a volatile and aggressive character to defend myself. Do not think that I’m always in bad mood or I can’t have fun, I’m 
pretty much a jokester and have a very black humor, but I do respect people’s boundaries.

The teasing me almost to tears has being a constant in our relationship (I’m embarrassed to say). The teasing is sometimes unbearable. Even though, it’s very easy to annoy me, I try to be patient. Sometimes I also have fun and I do love his teasing side, but sometims I’m not in the mood and are very sensitive.

Today started with the normal teasing. I was pretty annoyed but whatever. I talked with him last week about feeling in my lowest, I hate my job, I have problems with my disfunctional family and on top of that I’m constantly in a very very bad mood, my period it’s not coming and we are thinking that maybe I’m pregnant ( we want to do a test at the end of the week). I also told him that recently the teasing is unbearable for me. That he please should stop. A little teasing here and there ain’t so bad, but please be aware of my feelings and stop when I tell you I’m not having fun. He said that he understood. Mind you that was the 3rd time in this moth that I told him to stop this cuz for me is like torture.

Well, sadly for my husband his fun is more important than my feelings. He continues to do his thing till I exploded. Not new, this is actually common behavior. I screamed at him a lot of things that I do not regret cuz they are true but I think they could have been said nicely. I made him feel like a piece of shit. I didn’t ask, I just know he feels that way. Now, he is bloody mad at me and I feel also like crap, but I’m also livid cause he provoked this. Sure, I have to control my feeling in general, but this is also something that he always does, he put me always on the edge just because he finds funny when people mad. His teasing is so bad that as a kind, my MIL had to look him in his room sometimes because he was teasing his brothers till the point of tears or slaps.

And for the comments of “you knew already that he was like that you shouldn’t have married him”… come on, 2 things can be true at the same times: me loving him from the bottom of my heart and he being a kind and loving husband and also his very bad teasing habit.

Last week, my father had dinner with us, and although he thinks he’s got a great personality he doesn’t see our paths aligning. My dad thinks he’ll most probably have to return to Japan to do business, as theres limited opportunities in Australia (my dads a businessman).

"When he and I met, we were just a casual fling so I didn’t think to tell him facts that my ex fiance (M27) has applied for a visa a year ago for me to come see and marry him. My ex and I broke up in March 2023, while the visa was still processing so it was not something that was active for me. But since we were still talking casually we both thought that maybe once the first form of the visa gets to me (takes 6-12 months), we can start reconsidering our relationship. I didn’t date from March - August thinking maybe we could get back together but the love was just lost. 

My current boyfriend and I being a casual hookup at the time made me feel that I should inform him somehow that I am potentially moving to another country at some point (if my ex and I’s relationship went well) so I said that my grandmother was petitioning me instead, just to not get into a deep conversation about it. 

My ex and I stopped talking 3 weeks into my relationship with my current boyfriend because we got closer and became more serious. Therefore the visa wasn’t even a consideration for me at this point. But because I’ve already mentioned it before, it was an integral part of our relationship that I was no longer moving to America and so we could then stay together.

Anyway, recently he said he noticed me go into the bathroom at 3am with the lights off with my phone and stay there for 20 mins, that I would hide my phone from him when he rolls over, I would lock my phone when he looks at me, etc. and this was enough for him to think that I was cheating.

I was 100% not cheating. There was no cheating involved at all. Maybe it was a habit to close my phone and maybe I was in the bathroom looking at memes and got distracted, I don’t even remember at this point but it genuinely was nothing truly suspicious but I get why he felt this way. 

This conversation led to me talking about my visa process being a lie and this realization made him feel that I was cheating on him the whole time with my ex (who I have not talked to in a long time.)

It has been 24 hours and he has been sure of me being a cheater. He said he couldn’t forgive me nor could he trust me. He said it’s not gonna work out. 

We live together so we have been trying to coexist during all this but he would get bursts of anger here and there. He is furious at me. He doesn’t believe a word I say and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to breakup over something I didn’t actually do. He thinks I’m a cheater.

I don’t quite understand his life style. It reminds me of myself asking my besties to go to bathroom w me when I was 7. It seems a bit immature to me, and I think his life style is not making him independent/mature. I’m worrying that he may not be mature enough to overcome the difficulties of living/ sharing life w just me. (He’s only been living w friends.)

All my male friends are not like him so I couldn’t get much advice from them.

"We’ve been dating for 6-7 months  but we’re only starting to truly get to know one another, as the honeymoon period phases out. 

We recently got into an disagreement where I agreed that I was immature and childish that I went home because I was upset that he would disregard some of my questions by answering them comically. The question was :” when did you start caring about me.” And he said “maybe in a couple week.” So whilst I found it funny, I was annoyed and didn’t understand why back then. 

From his POV, he was extremely tired from work and I should have been more understanding however when I left for home, it wasn’t just I was annoyed, it was also because I knew he was tired and I had to go home anyways for work. 


So I apologise the next day when he bought it up that it isn’t fair that I got upset at something he didn’t know about, I fully take accountability for that and agree it was shitty of me but nothing I did is to intentionally hurt him. I thought we were over it and we got in another fight where he found my banter too harsh. 

He called me fat jokingly and I just replied “I hate you” over text, I thought it was pretty normal banter but apparently not because from that text, it spiralled and it went back to the fight where he gave me his time, weekends, and despite being so tired. He was so upset that I just left home because “i didn’t like that he didn’t reply me”. 
 

I tried to make amends by adhering to him because I was in the wrong by being immature but he just wouldn’t let it go. I know he’s upset and annoyed but it frustrates me so much. I’m not sure what to do…. 

It’s dawning on me that perhaps we’re incompatible when it comes to communication? But at the same time, I don’t want to drop something that’s good. He’s absolutely amazing except for this which isn’t a dealbreaker for me

"First off, I am not forcing her to do anything and completely respect that it is her body, her choice but she doesn’t seem to realise the huge responsibility of having a child so young. I have explained to her how bad it would be to keep the baby due to:

If my family finds out, they would disown me and most likely her family would do the same to her so this means the baby will wouldn’t have a proper home to be brought up in

We both do not have the funds or the maturity to raise a baby at this age which would lead to the baby not getting what it needs and bad parenthood

We are both in university/college and would most likely have to drop out which means we can’t pursue future careers and would probably end up working a worse job with a worse pay therefore also impacting the babies life negatively

This reason might sound selfish but we are both in arguably the best years of our life right now and to ruin it by bringing up a baby who would have a bad quality of life regardless, would not make sense

What annoys me the most is her reason for keeping it is “because babies are cute” or “babies aren’t that hard to raise”. I appreciate I have no experience in raising a child but I think everyone knows it is no easy task - especially for two broke 19 year olds.

"Hi

My GF has had this friend for a long time, she lives in a different country, they basically grew up together.

Theyve always joked about sexual stuff, but my GF always assured me that her friend is strictly a friend and she has no romantic feelings, but things seem to be starting to get out of hand

They met for the first time, friend came over here for about 2 weeks. During that time, there were a few (2 or 3) texts from my GF that her friend had a sex dream about her and described it to her (they were never alone [gf's friend's boyfriend came along too] and im confident nothing happened). Weird but whatever. Her friend even tried to do some ""gotcha"" thing while we were all in the car and asked the guys ""if my and (my gf) slept together would you guys be upset?"" Obviously trying to see if we would day soemthing to the extent of ""no, girls kissing is hot"" or something. We did not, we both said it was cheating.

Flash forwards and my GF and i are starting a road trip home for winter break and in the first 30 minutes of the drive, my GF laughs and says her friend just told her that she ""came from just penetration while thinking about her"" and ""had a mini panic attack afterwards because she clenched so hard and couldnt take her vibrator out for like 10 seconds"" along with other graphic details. Gf asked if I was upset, and I voiced how weird it was, and compared it to one of my friends saying something like that and my GF went a bit quiet.

I can tell she feels bad and i feel horrible for making her feel that way and im wondering if i overstepped. Im not sure whether i should apologize or say something to my GF's friend about it, because its ultimately her  saying these things. Just seems a bit hypocritical to me.

"I am home for Christmas visiting my dad, step mom (51f) and grandma (78f) where they all live together. My dad is not an easy person to get along with, and the dynamic between the three of them is my dad acts out while the two women sit idly by. He does and says egregious things and the only people who will stand up to him are me or my sister. 

Yesterday, my dad made a comment about how getting an agent and getting an acting role on tv would be easy and he could do it. I am an actor, who has struggled greatly to get jobs even with an agent of five years. The three of them know of my struggle. I did not respond to his comment at first. But he continued on loudly with this claim, and my grandma joined in encouraging him. I eventually chimed in and remarked that it’s not as easy as it looks. My dad jumped on this immediately losing the playful tone to dismiss me and tell me that it is actually very easy. We went back and forth for a moment but he did what he always does when I am not agreeing with him: interrupted and spoke over me while raising his voice. He at one point shouted over me that his days as a college football player and getting tackled by grown men was “truly difficult,” and that “what I do is easy.” At another point he asked me why his confidence in himself makes me insecure. I maintained a calm tone, and consistently repeated that he was not being very nice and was hurting my feelings. He said he didn’t care. I continued to repeat this sentiment and he eventually refused to continue to talk to me and sat in silence. I then told him that him giving me the silent treatment wasn’t very nice, hurt my feelings and I would appreciate a conversation. He then got up and walked away. My grandmother and step mom watched silently and did not speak to me after either. I found myself pondering going to speak to him to apologize and clear up that my intentions weren’t to start an argument. I realized that that was the people pleaser in me, and have decided to not say anything to him and see if he comes to speak to me. I repeatedly told him that he was not being nice and was hurting my feelings in a calm and respectful manner. I feel that if I am not in an environment where I cannot express myself or that my feelings are hurt, then it may be best for me to not be around at all. 

This is not at all out of the norm behavior for my dad. For context, he was physically verbally and emotionally abusive to my mom from the time I was a kid up until their breakup when I was 13. I was hit with a belt and yelled at until I was 10. Yesterday after our spat I wanted to leave the house and found myself being scared of the prospect of returning to my clothes being thrown outside, as he would do things of this nature when I was a kid. He is not physical anymore and hasn’t been for many years, but is not at all reasonable, understanding, empathetic or nice. My grandma and step mom never disagree with or say no to him, if they do he will insist on his point until they capitulate. When he is drinking, it is worse and I feel it’s most I mperative that I agree with whatever he says so as to not aggravate him (but he will still find a reason to shout or become petulant). I have grown exhausted of this dynamic and feel it is impossible to be myself. Should I have kept my mouth shut in the first place? Should I approach him and apologize? Is someone who can never be wrong someone you can eventually reason with?",My (27f) dad (49m) is giving me the silent treatment after I told him he hurt my feelings,18nmutv,1703164762.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nmutv/my_27f_dad_49m_is_giving_me_the_silent_treatment/,
"Hey, so, I'm stumped... my (18m) boyfriend (18m) has shown to be possessive and jealous to a certain degree before. He'd admit to it, although he'd say it was something he would work on for my sake, because he didn't want to stop me from being friendly with my friends, etc etc. This jealousy of his did, really, take a turn for the better; and now, basically the only thing that makes him jealous is when I speak to my ex (or just am near him, at all).

My ex (19m) and I broke up by January, and had been 4 months into a relationship– but, before that, he'd been part of my main friend group, and so he continued to be friends with my friends (and to a certain degree, to me as well) after our break-up. It was a really normal, ""no harm done"" kinda conversation, where we left off in good terms; I broke up with him because I saw he wasn't nearly as involved in my life as he'd been before, in our first two months of relationship or the previous year we'd been friends (as in, forgetting to text me back for weeks and even in holidays like the 25/12 and 1/1, and just not showing interest in my life). We'd agreed however we'd go back to friends, and were both fine with that-- but it ended up kind of awkward(?) between the two of us and we ended up growing further apart.

Now, skip to yesterday. My boyfriend, who's been with me for 7 months now, saw my ex in our graduation ceremony (as he'd come to congratulate us and other friends), and later expressed to me how much it hurt to see me interact with him; even telling me he'd had a nightmare were I left him for my ex (which is a dream he's had quite a few times before). I knew this could be a sore spot to my bf, so I tried talking him out of it explaining there was nothing to be jealous over, but in the end I was met basically with a ""yeah, I'm still gonna be jealous"". This stumped me. I tried telling him there was a possibility I'd go back to being friends with him normally, or in the very least interact with him more often, since I'd attend the same university campus next semester (and was quite frankly glad I could ask someone about uni stuff without feeling too dumb)-- but my boyfriend was adamant he did not even want to think about the possibility of me being more friendly with my ex. He in fact said that he *refused* to think about it-- that it was something that would make him very sad/anguished and, quote, ""even if I hated him for it, it wasn't be something he'd be able to let go of"". 

But to be honest idk how to feel about this. I hate feeling like anyone controls any part of my life, and this just feels like him saying ""no, you can't be friends with that guy"". I honestly can't see how jealousy could be so deterring. I've felt it before, of course, and with him no less (some friends of him that were not mutual, so I didn't know)-- but I don't think I could ever let that get in the way of my partner's relationships. It's not like I'm ever going to cheat on my boyfriend, and he himself says that's something he trusts 100%, but then what is this jealousy? How can I tell him I don't want him controlling this of me? I feel like if I just straight tell him that, he's going to go the ""I'm not gonna say no to you doing that, but just be warned in advance I'll be VERY sad and it'll be very much YOUR choice to MAKE me sad because I am WARNING you how SAD this would make me""-route. Either that or saying I can't make sacrifices for him. 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend doesn't want me to be friends or more friendly with my now ex, as it'd make him very, very uncomfortable/sad/uneasy. I don't want him controlling who I am or am not friends with, and can't see a reason this has to make him so overly jealous.

So, how can I help him overcome his jealousy? Is there even anything I can do or a way to tell him how I feel about this without opening a door to emotional manipulation?-- Or am I just wrong in this cenario, and should listen to my boyfriend? :(",My (18M) boyfriend (18M) doesn't want me to be friends with my ex,18nmum0,1703164741.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nmum0/my_18m_boyfriend_18m_doesnt_want_me_to_be_friends/,
"I hate posting this because of trauma I have with my ex regarding this server, but I feel it might be necessary. My long-distance boyfriend of going on 2 years, whom has admitted to raging too much at games, cannot stop getting overly mad when playing. We bonded as best friends through Overwatch, before it went to Overwatch 2, for about 2.5 years. The game has its issues, but I am able to stay optimistic and look past them to continue to have a fun game. However, this is not how he experiences the game(s). He gets so mad that he screams at the game and says “that’s fucking ridiculous how the fuck did that hit me?!?!” that his mic peaks and cuts out the rest of what he’s saying. Sometimes he leaves mid-game and says “I’m done for tonight. I can’t play this game”. This goes for other games like Apex Legends or sometimes Valorant, though it is less so in that one particularly. I want so badly to be able to play games like we used to. I can understand, and have also complained about, how the game has balance issues and needs lots of reworking/tweaking. But.. I can’t enjoy even 5 minutes of Overwatch with him without him getting mad, complaining, or yelling. I don’t know what to do because we BOND through playing video games together and that is slowly becoming ruined.

How do I make it where we can enjoy this game together again? And if not this game, then what do I do in general? Every other game is either another rage-fest or seems very boring to us. Or it costs like $60 and we are broke college students.

Note: he NEVER has gotten outwardly angry at me, yelled at me, or directed any of this negativity toward me. This is purely toward the game(s). We have a healthy, communicative relationship and I am proud to say that as someone who has been through many abusive exes. He is not abusive at all so do not say this please.

"for context, i am overweight and my boyfriend is underweight. both of our goals are different— he wants to gain weight and more muscular and i want to lose weight to become slim and fit. this is something we’ve conversed about on multiple occasions. 

he says it’s a critique that he wants me to lose weight, which i understand because i am unhealthy. however, it doesn’t feel like it because he doesn’t necessarily help me do anything that would assist me in achieving my goals. it feels more like a judgmental comment. i have very bad depression and anxiety, which makes it difficult for me to take care of myself sometimes and especially maintain motivation and discipline when it comes to the gym.

because of our goals we started going to the gym together, but outside of that he doesn’t necessarily help me with weight loss. however, i’m not exactly sure how he could support me, because i am not expecting him to be my nutritionist or my personal trainer. this is kinda where i need help. i want him to help me with my food choices, help me realize when i am full (i have binge ed), and help me with drinking more water and stuff. i told him this but he doesn't really help me. he's pretty quiet about my habits surrounding my health, which is offputting considering his usual bluntness.

how am i supposed to receive his help? i want us both to grow together in this aspect so we both feel supported in our goals. i try to motivate him to eat more and whatnot. but usually it's seen as more offensive when someone tells you to limit your calorie intake. i just want his help. and honestly, i want to know how i can properly ask for his help so that i feel critiqued and supported instead of judged. weight has been a sensitive topic for me my whole life, and since i have had a lack of support i have stayed being a heavier kid. i literally have never been at a healthy weight and want to break the cycle.

any suggestions??

EDIT- i don’t expect him to just magically do everything for me. but i support him so much with fixing him meals and making sure he eats and whatnot for his weight / muscle gain. he wants to support me in a similar fashion, especially because he is very into fitness. it is just difficult because we have very opposite issues. i just want to feel similarly supported, and instead of his usual commentary on my weight, i want him to encourage me and uplift me during my journey as a partner should.",how can my (18f) boyfriend (20m) help me with weight loss?,18nmta5,1703164627.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nmta5/how_can_my_18f_boyfriend_20m_help_me_with_weight/,

Known for 1.5 years through work, went to same university (rarely saw her there, not same course, not same year either)
I'm quite introverted and struggle to have conversations with people more than say 2 minutes. With her from the start I found it so easy to talk to her, she seems very attentive. I find it hard to talk to people to begin with.
Went to gym with her today, asked her to show me a workout she does and I'll copy, I'm new to the gym, only been a few times. My anxiety is through the roof in a gym when I'm by myself, with someone else (a pT or her) I'm much more.
She will leave my work soon when she gets a job to do with her degree she graduated this year with. Which is looking likely the next month or so maximum.

I have adhd and autism, it is hard for me to know if someone likes me or not.

"For backstory: One of my biggest fears is to end up with a momma's boy, and by that I mean: puts his mother first in every situation, disrespects me, doesn't stand up to his mother, etc. We have been together fr 2 and a half years.
He isn't like that though. He knows how to put boundaries, puts our relationship and wellbeing first. And still loves and respect his mother. (She is basically a single mother, raised 3 boys by herself, dad's a deadbeat)
Problem arises, he's lately been saying things like ""My mom always does that"", ""Mom says that all the time too"", ""Mom's favourite colour is also purple"", ""You look like mom when you do that"".
I jokingly told him to stop saying I resemble her, let's not make Freud happy.
I thought maybe he misses her, they don't see each other that much since he got a new job.
Yesterday I snapped. I painted my hair a dark wine colour and was extremely happy with how it turned out.
When he saw me, he said it looked beautiful. A couple minutes later, he turned around and said ""Not gonna lie, mom had that exact colour when we were little, it reminds me of her""
I got so mad. Started crying from anger saying how I don't want him thinking of her when he looks at me, how it's my hair, my laughter, my personality, my favourite colour, my quirks, my sayings. Just threw it all together at once.
He was perplexed and confused, tried to apologize and later said ""I'm not comparing you two, and I don’t have mommy issues or whatever, but I can’t help but to see the similarities between the only two women I spend my time with""
And I have to admit, we are kind of similar, we are both latina women, emotional and loud, hardworking, extroverted and so on. Hell, when my mother and her met, you could see how their personalities were almost the same too.

"We've been together for 5 years, when I first met her I was unemployed as I was a drop out. She is an international student, so her parents have been helping her financially a lot. 

I got a decent job a year after meeting, and have been working. While she was studying, she was able to pay for rent and other stuff with help with her parents. However, about a year ago, her mom has refused to send her money for rent, so now she covers food, and occasionally my gas money. She's had a few online gigs, and she worked as a TA at her school for money, but aside from that she hasn't really had any real job experience. 

She's much better educated than me, so I don't doubt she could find a decent job, it's just that she's  been slacking on it hard. I've been putting much more pressure on her lately, and she does apply to jobs in small bursts, but she doesn't really have the ""I must find a job"" mentality that I'd really like to see. It also doesn't help that my parents, while true in their assessment that she has to find a job, have been utterly toxic about it, berating me about it every single fucking time I meet with them without her, which had honestly made me resent them and has made me not want to even talk or engage with them, because I know the conversation will inevitably turn into them yelling into my ear about how bad my girlfriend is, basically trying to convince me to break up with her.

Additionally, she never admits when she's wrong, and during arguments, she becomes extremely cold. This frustration often leads me to say things I don't mean. Sadly, she never apologises or acknowledges her faults. To complicate matters, she needs medication for BPD, but she refuses to take it or seek help, leaving me to battle her demons on my own.

"my boyfriend is such a sweet boy, he’s been a great guy since we first started dating. sure, we have had our ups and downs but i’d say we’ve gotten through it well and we’re going strong. the issue is that recently i’ve felt incredibly insecure because i’ve realised that my boyfriend often likes other girls’ posts that look nothing like me. for context my bf is asian and well known for his good looks. i’m hispanic, medium length hair, 5ft 3 medium size, but the girls on the posts are asian, tall, slim or have straight or curly hair and are overall more fashionable than i am. looking directly at them i can say that we look nothing alike and the most comparable feature would probably be the colour of our skin. when my boyfriend calls me the prettiest girl ever now i can just think of the girls he likes on social media and i find myself comparing because he must’ve liked those posts for a reason…most are selfies taken or full body pictures (clothed) from a night out where they look drop dead gorgeous and i feel inadequate since i look like roadkill in those occasions. i know i should take my boyfriend’s words to heart but knowing that he 100% likes something else that looks nothing like me has left me feeling ugly and i can’t believe anything he says. i brought it up to him and he just said he likes whatever comes up on his feed (which may be true) and he sent me pictures of the girls followed by an explanation of why he liked the post e.g. he liked the filter or thought it was a cool dump…but just seeing the girls again just made me feel even more insecure, i truly look nothing like them and it’s made me  wonder whether someone who looks like that is better suited for him. i feel that he has settled for me and nothing he says makes me feel better. am i overreacting? i feel that this wouldnt bother me as much if i felt better about myself in general. i guess i selfishly want my boyfriend to think of me as the best thing he has ever laid his eyes upon. i dont ever like other guys' posts..am i odd for not doing so?",I (19F) feel insecure that my bf (19M) likes other girls’ posts that look nothing like me…I feel so insecure HELP!,18nmcnj,1703163145.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nmcnj/i_19f_feel_insecure_that_my_bf_19m_likes_other/,
"My boyfriend and I have had a rough time together, and I’ve gone through a lot of emotional turmoil in this relationship. He didn’t do anything wrong, I was just heavily insecure. 

Anyways, today we met for the first time in a week because we were both upset with eachother during that time to hang out and look at Christmas lights. At the end of the night we were in his car and we started hugging eachother. This was when he tried to touch my breasts but I kept rejecting his advances and obviously pulled his hand down. This happened twice where I rejected him and pulled his hand away. 

He then asks ‘why do you not let me touch you anymore? Do you not like me anymore?’ in a sad tone. Before this incident I would usually let him touch me but I was feeling very sad and upset at the time and didn’t feel like doing anything sexual. 
On the third time, he started putting his hand there again but this time I thought he knew better not to touch me because I clearly rejected his advances. And he still slid his hand in and groped me. I felt taken advantage of and upset that he didn’t care about my feelings for it. 

I explained how it made me feel and he kept apologising and he said that he ‘did it because he was scared I didn’t like him anymore’ and kept saying how he missed me a lot and wanted to feel me again. I do believe he missed me because before this encounter he told me that he was thinking about me and missed me. I still felt disrespected and don’t know what I should do.

"We’ve been dating for almost 3 years and a couple months ago I mentioned that I was planning to go home for the holidays (we live in the US but my family lives abroad). She was not happy then but after having a heavy conversation about it she told me it was fine and I booked my trip. I see my family 2-3x a year and I have two sisters including a much younger sister (14) who I haven’t spent much time with since I left for college. I viewed this as a last trip home to spend time just the 5 of us (parents and two sisters) as we’ll probably get engaged next year and after that I expect to spend the majority of my holidays with her family given the proximity. We’ve also spent every major holiday at my GFs parents this year and last year.

She’s always been a fanatic about Christmas and it was also her birthday recently and I’ve done everything in my power to make sure she felt the Christmas spirit and felt special on her birthday. I’m talking expensive gift, Christmas themed restaurant, cooking fancy dinner, dinner with her family, etc. Despite all that, we’ve been bickering a lot about small things. Things finally got to a point where she admitted some of it stems from her resentment about me going home and us not being together for the holidays. Furthermore, the last 3-4 days she keeps crying and saying how anxious she is and giving me grief about it. She says she needs to get over it and then it starts again not too long after that. I feel miserable now - it’s too late to change plans and I feel like any enjoyment or feeling I was trying to capture from the last time home with just my immediate family is gone and all the things I did to make her feel special were for nothing. She’s treating me like we’ll never have another holiday together and her sadness/anxiety is worse than I’ve ever seen (even worse than when I’ve been around her before and after the passing of a family member). I get that it’s not ideal but I also think that this reaction is overblown and ruining an otherwise good relationship.

"So a bit of backstory - Me and my boyfriend were together for 4 years, we lived together (still do) and for the most part, had a perfect relationship. We communicated brilliantly and I truly felt like we were going to be together forever. He supported and loved me through some really difficult times and I will always love him for his patience and kindness. Our one big issue was our sex life, in that it was almost non-existent, I didn't often feel very desired by him. Anyway, around the start of 2023 I went through a sudden bereavement, this triggered a manic episode that spanned months. I withdrew completely and ended up feeling I would be better off single and have the chance to travel and be independent. We split up around July but we still live together. We get on brilliantly and I still have so much love for him. I guess I'm just worried that I made a mistake by ending a relationship based off of some manic decisions and based off of a fairly poor sex life. These are surely things that can be worked on? Some advice would be really helpful, I'd say this is my first properly serious and committed relationship I ever had despite being in relationships since I was 17.

I think I do just get scared of stagnating and missing out. 

I will also add that even if I decide I want to try work things out, he might not and that's absolutely fine; I just feel so scared to lose him completely I guess. I don't know where to go from here. I don't want to look back and regret losing who is so far, the love of my life.

My bf (26M) and I got into a heated argument on FaceTime. To be honest it started when I told him I felt upset he was out drinking again (since we have a flight leaving tmr), and he took this personally as me not having enough faith in him. The conversation got very heated as I felt very frustrated as it seemed like he was trying to deflect the blame. At one point he slaps the phone twice (I am still on the vide call) .. and I was quite shaken. 

He then tells me it was out of frustration and that he would never lay a finger on me in real life.

"Me (25F) and him (21M) have been dating for two years. We met when I was an exchange student on his country and we were together physically for a year before I had to move back home and we’ve been doing long distance since then. He still has one year of college left and I’ll be graduating in the next few months. I can’t go work in his country because of visa issues, at least inmediately. He has no idea what he’s going to do with his life when he graduated (I don’t either). We see each other every 3/4 months, and he is coming to see me next week.

This past year we’ve had some issues.

-Found on his phone screenshots and pictures of girls with gym bodies (not any girls he knows personally). I confronted him and told him that since my body doesn’t look like the body those girls have, by fapping to it he is telling his brain that’s what he likes. Same with porn. He said he would try to watch it less but a few months later I still saw some girls on his instagram explore page. 

-There was a girl on his group friend that was into him, asking him to go study alone together and getting touchy with him. I am aware he was never interested in her, but he didn’t really say anything to her, although he tried to keep a bit of a distance between them because it was making him feel uncomfortable.

-Sometimes he has mentioned the future and he always uses the first person (“maybe I could live here”, instead of “maybe we could live here”)

-We facetime pretty much every night and a lot of times he is just scrolling on reddit while talking to me. He’s been getting better at this tho.

-Last year he had a breakdown where he told me he wasnt sure of being with me because he was soending too much time thinking about me and stressing about this relationship. We talked it out and continued being together but since then kinda everytime his mood shifts or he is kinda distant i have a lot of anxiety thinking he wants to dump me.

-He has ADHD, depression and anxiety. I also have my own trauma that I’m dealing with, but he kinda uses it as an excuse to sometimes not pay attention to me. I joined a music band recently and we have been doing some concerts. He keeps forgetting to ask me about how they went because he just doesnt remember. I told him to set alarms but he tells me I am being condescending. He also forgot our two year anniversary after I told him how important those dates were for me.

-Kinda continuing with that, a lot of times he is not busy and he justs spends time scrolling on his phone instead of calling me or being with me. This past summer we worked together on his country (I basically went there to be with him as much time as possible) and he kept going to the break room to be on his phone during his time off instead of looking for me or texting me.

-I am a person that loves giving little gifts, letters, send love memes… I have been basically begging him to send me a love letter for two years now. He keeps forgetting (he literally has a post office on campus). Same with flowes. He’s sent me flowers like three times (one of them I literally asked him to do it) while I’ve sent him stuff, ordered him uber eats, etc. He’s gotten food for me like once or twice. I told him it would make me happy to be on his profile picture on whatsapp (an app he pretty much only uses with me) and he saw it as me trying to mark my territory so he put a picture of his dog.

Of course there have been good moments and we have made lots of memories together. I know he loves me a lot and I do love him too but with everything I feel that right now its not our moment to be together. He is coming next week and staying with me for two weeks and I dont even know if its worth it to talk about it. I feel that he needs me to pull away from him for him to realize that he wants to be with me. 
When we are in person we get along pretty well and have lots of jokes and cute moments. I feel loved by him.
I acknowledge he has been making small improvements but I already told him that sorry doesnt cut it anymore. I know it feels like I am mentally checked out of the relationship but I would love to hear from your advice or experiences.

"TLDR:  
  
Grandma demands visits instead of asking friendly. How should I respond?  
  
LONG VERSION:  
  
I am in my 30’s. I have never had a great relationship with my grandma but as I child it was ok. I lived far away to study and visited maybe 3 times a year through that time. I didn’t change that when I moved back 9 years ago. 2 years ago I got the vibe that she started to be lonely. She used to have a very active social life but all her friends keep dying because you know she’s old and her friends are old. Anyway, I upped my visits to 1’s every 6 weeks. She texts weekly, and I generally call back and have a small chitchat. Pretty much anytime after around 4 weeks I get a somewhat mean message demanding I visit, thinks like, I never hear from you, you never come and visit. Honestly I don’t enjoy the visits, they are for her. She always judges strongly and gives a lot of unsolicited advice that are very out of touch for this era. I was planning to go next weekend (didn’t tell her yet). She send a message 2 days ago demanding I visit and it makes me just don’t want to go. I don’t want her to think her nagging works. I have left her message on read for 2 days as I don’t know how to respond.  
  
How do I navigate this situation? I am ok with continuing to visit every \~6 weeks. I just hate her way of communicating and don’t know how to respond to it every month.  
  
EXTRA BACKGROUND INFO  
  
I recently quit a good job because I just couldn’t handle the stress anymore. Honestly, I was burned out. It was a thought-through decision and I have the savings to take my time to recover. Afterwards I would like to start for myself but I am planning on slowly building this up and not grind all day like I used to. My grandma finds this all very stressful and I really hate how she makes me feel stressed about it all with her questions and doubts in me. She has never worked and my grandpa worked for the same company all his life. She views starting your own company as too risky and that we as working-class people do not have the resources. Besides this, she doesn’t believe a burn-out exists and that I should just pull myself up by my bootstraps. This all makes it very hard to answer honestly to any question about my life currently because I know I will be berated for it.

"Me and my ex are still sleeping with each other. I know that's wrong but here me out. He's my first everything and have just so much feeling in me for him that I couldn't let go. After he broke up with me I became severely depressed because he left me. And the reason as to why is "" I love you, but I'm not in love with you "" on some friend shit if you didn't understand it. It took me a little bit to figure out but I finally know that he only thought of me as a friend and not as a lover. I don't know if he ever cheated on me, but if he did I wouldn't like to know. 

But here's my dilemma. After breaking up in August we've still be sleeping with each other. I haven't been with anyone else. Idk if he has and I again wouldn't like to know. I have kinda just been holding out for him hoping he comes back to his senses but clearly that won't work. I've been really messed up in the head these past 4 months chasing after a boy who if I don't call or text I won't here from him at all. He was never reliable to me. But if I was one of his homies he would be there in a jiffy. But I digress. 

Like I was saying I have just been waiting for him to maybe change his mind, but I don't think he's going to do so. So I'm finally going to cut it off. I dont want to. But everyone around me is all saying the same thing about him probably doing it with other girls and he's just using me. So I'm just going to take myself out of the equation. I hope I will be happy, but idk. He is my everything. And I still love him after everything he's done to me. And trust me he's done a lot. But I can't let him go for some reason. 

I'm attached to him in an unhealthy way. Id wish for his approval and hope that maybe if I stay friends with him he'll come back. But that has ultimately done more harm then good. I just want him to feel what he's done to me. To put him in my shoes. But he's just not there for me anymore. He's hasn't in a long time. I wanted us to be end game so badly. But he clearly doesn't want me. It's been like this for a while now. Even before we broke up. But today I'm hoping to make a stand. I'm going to give him an ultimatum. 

Either we stop this forever and you never contact me again or we make this work again. 

Because I can't be sitting in the dark playing with my thumbs forever. I just need to know. And I know I mean absolutely nothing to him. I still would like to hope for something.

"I had many adulterous relationships when I was 14-17. The men were at least 12 years older than me.

I feel ashamed to admit this but I’ve had sexual relationships with multiple guys before I turned 18. My first time was with a guy who was 27 and I was just 14. We weren’t in a romantic relationship. Just sexual. We didn’t actually have sex but we did everything else. He wasn’t the only one before I turned 18 unfortunately. I had sex with a 30 year old guy when I was 17. He was the one who took my virginity. I’m from India where statutory rape wasn’t a thing back then. I’m now in the US. I understand that this would be considered a serious offense here.

What do redditors think? Was I raped? I do feel some PTSD from those experiences but thats because I’m hard on myself for my promiscuous behaviors when I was a child. I only blame myself here. But all the men I was with before 18, knew my age. That’s also a little disturbing to me that my age wasn’t a big deal to them. In fact one of those guys has been living in the US for a long time.

"Hi everyone! I am in need of some advice and I don’t really have anyone to discuss this kind of matter with. 

Basically, my boyfriend of 2 years is watching porn while he is away at work. As of my knowledge, this started while I was away for 2 months (to my home country). He did it a lot while I was away however now he does it maybe once a week or so (what I know of)

I am not sure how to feel about this, I do know that I feel like shit whenever I discover it—he looks for specific girls and I know for a fact has a porn folder on his phone as well. He also has been saving reels or IG pics, it’s not excessive amounts however I did notice it happen before. 

I feel bad, a bit insecure and also like a hypocrite. I have watched porn in the past however I do not go and look for specific guys or couples to watch—so I guess that is the part that is hurting me, that he looks for specific girls their nudes/videos. He likes to search for their melons :,)  

I’m just asking myself—why? Our sex life is good and there isn’t really anything missing or any issues with our yknow, shenanigans. So I don’t completely understand why this has been happening since a few months ago. 

I’d love to hear some insight on this so I could possibly open my mind more and see if it is normal or if I should be concerned :,)

I did early on in our relationship (about 4 years in) have doubts about how young we met. This led me to cheating (not sex) on her whilst I was travelling with friends. We got back together and that doubt has faded over time but it does always crop up in my mind.

We spend so much time TOGETHER and our lives are very much intertwined, we all have the same friendship group, all know each others families etc and we do A LOT together - she is my best friend which is great BUT I do and have recently been much more concerned about this now that I am 30.

I am not where I want to be financially or career wise yet and in my mind, I use her as an excuse for that. Yeah we have a nice life, our home is amazing and we are busy every weekend doing things with each other or with friends or family but that is not enough for me.

I feel bad because in my head, I just want to break up, sell our home, take the profit we have made from it and dial in and focus on myself, without any distractions. I know this would absolutely break her! She suffers from anxiety/panic attacks and I know what this would do to her.

It's easy to get back to feeling comfortable and into our daily work/life routine as we are both so busy so it's easy to forget about all this.

I can't fault her - she is loving/caring, works hard, looks after our home but that still doesn't feel like enough for me? I know I am being selfish but I can't help how I feel.

"Edit to add: I put the wrong age by mistake, it should be F53

I (F30) and my partner (M29) went to visit hid mother after they'd been apart for over 10 years.

It's clear she's so happy and pleased to finally be reunited with her sons and at first my partner was pleased to see her.

My partner officially changed his name about 4 years ago.

From my point of view, I'm no expert, it seems like changing his name was a method of gaining some control over his life and getting rid of his past self as well as all the trumas affiliated, so that he could start fresh.

He met his mother once last year, she refused to accept his name change.

He thought it would be different this time and tried again, but last night the conversation went from cheerful to her asking him what his real name is.

He replied with ""Robin"" (fake name) to which she shook her head and said ""no, it's Robert John"" (fake name)

There was a small back and fourth, to which he pointed out it was an official name change but she insisted. Neither of them seem to have the ability to actually shout so it didn't come to blows.

She didn't seem to mind or care that I kept calling him Robin though and I wasn't about to call him by his old name.

Sadly how ever, my partners brother who also just got back in contact with her after so long, refers to my partner by his old name in front of his mother.

I do get her point of view, but obviously I think my partners wants and needs come above that.

After we left he said he felt aweful about the situation, that he had just wanted to leave but didn't want to make an awkward situation worse.

He is a rather timid fellow. I was fully prepared to walk out with him when she started demanding he refer to himself by his old name.

On the way home I let him vent his feelings out, he isn't sure what he should do, whether he should cut her out again or continue visiting. It devastates him to be called Robert again but she's also his mother.

I told him that I think he should explain to his mother why he changed his name. Give her a chance to understand how important this is for him and if she still refuses then cross that bridge when it comes to it.

I also said he should ask a couple of his close friends who have known him longer and his brother. But he shouldn't make any decisions until he has had a chance to calm down.

Most importantly I've told him that reguardless of his choices, I will support him.

The reason he wasn't in contact before is because they lost contact after his father illegally moved him and his brother away without even telling his mother.

(Edit to add: this wasn't the entire reason as it turns out, but it meant he wasn't able to see her as often and when he did see her 10 years ago, they fell out over something he doesn't want to talk about)

She was devastated by the loss and kept up all the old school photos of her boys.

We loved each other, but our marriage wasn’t perfect. We were on the brink of divorce at one point. Then things got better...suspiciously too good. So after a while, I did some digging. He was cheating on me, but never actually told me. But I knew that he knew that I was aware.

I confirmed it 7 years ago, but it’s something I speculated for a long time. I never confronted him about it, ever. And if I had the chance to do it all over again, I would go the exact same route I did. I don't regret any step I took. After he died I found his journals and was able to retrieve his AP's address. I sent her something of his, and as I went to check the mail yesterday, I found a letter from her. She didn’t outright say “I was with your husband for the last couple of years”, but she did ask to meet.

I’ve been wondering all morning what she could possibly want to meet for. To explain herself, to apologize? Either way, I’m at peace with everything. Part of me wants to just ignore her but the other part of me is really curious.

"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 10 months, but we've known each other as friends for years. He has an awful ex which used to verbally abuse him and she cheated on him, so he has some trust issues. I knew this going in but didn't think it was a problem because I know me and know I'd never do any of the things his ex did to betray his trust. The issue is he keeps going through my phone, and it makes me feel badly about myself. 

To start, he's ALWAYS known my phone password, I have nothing to hide. It started with just noticing that he looks at my phone screen all the time when I'm on it near him. No big deal chalked it up to being a screen obsessed person. Then I noticed every time he had my phone while navigating on the GPS or something he was kind of looking around on it. Then I caught him on my phone when I was coming back from using the bathroom in the middle of the night. He claimed he was just checking the time but that makes no sense to me since his phone is closer to his side of the bed than mine. 

A couple times after I noticed apps open which I hadn't been on. That's when I decided to ask him outright if he checks my phone to which he said no. And I told him that he has my full permission to go through my phone if he feels the need or want to, no need to be sneaky about it. All was fine for a few weeks and just last night at 3am after being woken up by the cat for food, I caught him on my phone again. The screen was unlocked fully however he claims he was just checking the time again.

I want to confront him again, not because I'm upset about the phone but because I'm upset that it feels like he doesn't trust me.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months, very new relationship. M25, F22. He grew up in Canada and I'm from Asia so our dating culture is very different. He is very laid back and has not initiative of doing things for our relationships, and I, myself, have expectations of how I want our relationship to be. I have this ideal thinking of how it should be and how he should love me so that I can feel loved the way I want to be loved.  
  
We've been having so much fights lately about his exes, cause he is still following her saying that he doesn't want to unfollow them because he doesn't want to completely forget all his memories with them and still wanna know what is going on in their life (but he unfollowed her already after a huge fight we had), he still keeps all the physical photos and gifts from his ex, and keeps all of their photos together on their phone (which he says that he deleted but I haven't checked his phone about it because I want to trust him when he says so).  
  
But then I saw some selfies in his phone from the timeline when he was still with his ex. I always thought he was always just never the kind of guy who likes to take pictures of himself, but I found out that he used to send pictures of himself and his selfies to his ex as updates since they were kind of in a long distance relationship before.  
  
When I asked him why doesn't send me selfies like that when he was able to do it before, he says that he doesn't feel like doing that anymore but says that we can do it too if I want too.  
  
So I felt sad about that, that he'll only do it because I want to and it feels like I have to ask for updates and pictures of him and I feel like it's not genuine. He says that if I want him to send a selfie, I should just ask. But I don't feel like asking because isn't that mandatory or normal? To send pictures of you to your girlfriend when you are not together? We're not together this Holidays because he's spending it in a different city with his family and he doesn't send me pictures of himself and I miss him so much.  
  
I tried to address it to him again and all he answered was that we can just call (audio call) and text more but he doesn't feel like sending pictures, he also said that he will only send if he wants to (which also never happens).  
  
I don't want to be petty about this, but it makes me really sad, because for me it's a small act of effort to make your partner feel your affection especially that I miss him a lot.

"TLDR: kissed friend who liked me in highschool when drunk, they're posting a lot of 'friends but not friends' subtext songs and matched with me on a dating app. I'm not sure if I'm actually ready for anything.


For some context, they've liked me since 
highschool and every year they'd ask me out. Though a lot of this was clouded by a shitty friendship with another person who'd cause conflict and confuse both of us. Least to say, definitely fucked over our friendship and any chance with a romantic relationship back them.

When drunk, I'd gushed a bit about this. How I thought it'd have been nice to have a sweet romance in highschool without that whole mess. We talked about it a lot, and i recall saying I thought of them more than a friend, then I just had the overwhelming urge to kiss them. I asked, they said yes so I did. Later we slept in their bed together.

Following that, a half sober walk to the local park the next night. I admitted I was a bit confused, but thought when we were both ready and a bit older, if we didn't go our own ways romance wise I think it'd be nice to talk about it as an option. Primarily because they've had a lot of abusive exes, and I came out of hospital only a few months prior for an OD and recovering from anorexia.

It's been a few days since, and they've messaged me twice and downloaded the dating app I was on a month prior (out of curiosity since being old enough now) and matched with me jokingly. They've also updated their instagram with a lot of songs about someone calling the singer friends but them doing things friends don't do.

I really don't want to string them along, or hurt their feelings by still being elusive. I know I initiated everything. I don't know if I'm ready for a relationship with someone I care deeply about and have known for years, I want to experiment and learn about relationships first with others. Then if things just, happen and coincidentally do lead back to us again. I'd feel ready for it.

I'm in a kinda odd and horrific situation, because my parents marriage is worsening. My father (49M) thinks that my mom (49F) is cheating on him, because he is paranoid and can't accept the truth (that my mother had enough from this marriage, etc.) and my father gone through my mom's phone history, where he found ""things that strengthen his doubts against my mom.

"I’ve been really confused the past few days. This guy ignored me for the past year as if I don’t exist. We worked closely for two months until he ghosted ted me when the project ended badly. I never contacted him at all. He was always silent around me. I even unfollowed him on social media a month back. 

He sends me a message out of the blue (cc’ing my supervisor) and tells me he wants to work with me. I even have an out of office message but he insists on calling me. The call lasted for 10 minutes with lots of awkward pauses. I told him I’m available to help and worked while on leave. 

The other day, I called him and brought up why I did not want to work on the other project and he told me it was a misunderstanding. He told me he asked for me specifically through my supervisor and that we worked so well together. He will support me and wants to work together again in the future. 
I’m really confused. He messages me on weekends and even late at night asking about minor stuff. There are other people in the team. Why does he specifically ask me especially after he intentionally avoided me all year long even when there was a chance to talk.
I never approached him at all especially after he told me he’s married. We used to stare at each other but that was it.

"About six months ago, two of my best friends ended their romantic relationship after 4 years. The guy, let's call him Robert, realized he was no longer in love with her, let's call her Susan. Additionally, Robert had been talking to another girl for a few weeks, and he didn't mention her to Susan until they broke up. When this happened, there were a few weeks when Robert seemed to regret it and tried to fix things with Susan. However, she, hurt by everything that happened, was reluctant to this. Shortly after, in a phone call, Robert told Susan that this situation was wearing him out, which Susan took terribly, leading to her blocking Robert everywhere. Within a few weeks, Robert started dating the other girl who had caught his attention. This made Susan feel even worse.  
  
On my part, I supported her throughout, as Robert was the one who initiated the breakup, and she was going through a tough time. The problem is that I share a group of friends with him, apart from having a different philosophy than Susan. She believes that if someone has harmed her or someone else, others should cut all contact with that person as they are a bad person. In contrast, I believe that if someone has done something wrong, friends have the duty to talk to them and make them realize their mistakes for future correction. When all this happened, I adopted a mix of both philosophies: I cut as much contact as possible with him after talking to him and making him aware of what he had done wrong, but since we have a group of friends in common, we left on good terms, and I kept the idea of seeing if his behaviour improved.  
  
I've been hiding this from Susan as much as possible for the sake of her mental health because she didn't want to know anything related to Robert. However, she knew that I still had a group of friends in common with Robert, so a few months ago, Susan distanced herself from me because of it, which I accepted. We recently reestablished some contact, but she's been attacking me with indirect comments, saying that I'm friends with a cheater and that I should feel bad. As I mentioned earlier, I have distanced myself a lot from Robert because I don't agree with what he did, but I still have a minimal relationship with him due to the mentioned group of friends. I no longer consider Robert a friend after all, but Susan has a different perspective on this; she thinks I still do. I asked her what I should do to make her realize that I support her and not him, and she said I should stop sharing a group with Robert. I find this illogical because I don't think I should be the one affected by something I haven't done.  
  
Recently, I was talking to this group of friends on Discord, and Robert was there too, entering after me. Susan saw this and made me believe that I've been lying to her all this time about my relationship with Robert. She made me think that I've lied about distancing myself from him, and that all this time I've secretly been his close friend. This has caused her to cut off all contact with me completely. Today, she publicly posted stories on Instagram talking about what happened with me, something I find unnecessary and somewhat aggressive on her part. I don't know what I should do now. What should I have done differently? Many people have told me that Susan's actions are exaggerated, that she shouldn't be so radical. What do you think?

"My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2.5 years. We live together and life is pretty great for the most part. The one area that is not the greatest is her insecurity and trust issues. Her previous boyfriend cheated on her, which led her to almost die by suicide. She got help and saw a therapist, then we met just a few months later.


Fast forward to today and while we have a fantastic relationship, good communication, etc., she’s always waiting for me to disappoint her. I have a lot of friends that are girls, but it’s simply friendship, nothing more (even made that clear on the first date). My gf has made it clear she does not want me liking pictures of any girl where they are either wearing a swimsuit, posing like they’re looking for attention, or anything that would be deemed like that, regardless of if they’re my friend or not. Some coworkers of mine also follow me (and vice versa) on social media, and she has a fit about that because one of them is a girl. I understand work/life boundaries but really don’t see an issue on that… I gave pushback on this because I wasn’t actively out there oogling over other girls or going out of my way because I like how someone else looks better than her. In the end, I came to an understanding of how liking a sexualized picture of any girl would be upsetting for her, and because this is something that makes her extremely insecure and anxious.


However there would be times where I’m doom scrolling and like a picture of a friend who is just out for the night or something (not like a bikini or something pretty obvious) and she’ll find out and we’ll have a 2hr argument about it. She’ll make assumptions and accusations of all sorts. It’s a whole ordeal and drives me crazy. I am not pursuing other women, cheating on her, or any other crazy conclusion. I love my girlfriend and hope to propose to her within a year or so.

"My ex-girlfriend and I dated from the age of 14 until I was 21. We broke up in August of this year.  
Overall it was a good relationship, with a lot of respect, love and affection. We always got along well and were never toxic towards each other, but I had some problems.  
I couldn't feel the urge to go out at night with her because when we were younger (from 16 to 19 +/-) we had a lot of arguments about drinking alcohol and smoking weed/ganza.  
She didn't like doing it as much, or at least as often as I did it.  
This ended up causing some friction in the relationship because I felt like I couldn't have fun in more social environments/parties and over the years, I felt quite judged and a little comfortable and we grew apart in that aspect.  
Sometimes it wasn't even about drinking or smoking for fun, because I don't need that, but more about the fact that if I felt like it, I would have the option to do it without the fear of feeling remorseful.  
Attention, these ""addictions"" have never been a problem for me.  
I have always been an excellent student, an extremely well educated person with both personal and professional goals.  
We had always discussed before any festivities (Carnival, Halloween, New Year) because we both wanted to spend it with our groups of friends and at the same time we would be together. It was difficult for me to give in because I felt that either way, I wouldn't have 100% fun.  
These situations ended up giving her the idea that she never put herself first when it came to the ""important moments"" of the year.  
She warned me about this and we had some tense moments over the 7 years.  
However, we both went to college and obviously the problems persisted/worsened because my view of her in relation to this topic only got worse because I basically accepted in my head that our relationship would be like this forever.  
I started to feel a little bad for both myself and her because we went through a lot together, she was my best friend, confident, the person I turned to whenever I needed something and despite all the struggles, we ALWAYS we care about each other.  
  
As time passed, I felt that it was less and less funny to her,  
that she let me physically search, and that she felt upset with me.  
  
At a certain point I also became too comfortable in the relationship, I stopped exercising, I stopped organizing dates, I lost my physical ""charm"" and she started to take on more of a ""mother"" role in our relationship, which also ended up killing me. a lot of the physical attraction she would have for me (I assume) because our sexual activity gets in the way a lot in the last year and a half that we've been together.  
  
  
She also complained that I didn't go out much with her friends and that I didn't go on vacation with them, but that was because when we were younger (15 years old), I discovered that she was getting involved with one of her classmates. her group and since then I felt like he was a thorn in my side, I was never one to do shipping and I didn't feel comfortable pretending I was friends with him just because all her friends that I liked were his best friends.  
  
About 2 years ago she also went ""for a walk"" with our local dealer (known for being people's girlfriends), which I thought was really strange at the time because I didn't even know they talked. She told me that he responded to some stories and discovered that he only wanted a friendship with her even after I told him lots of stories about what I described above.  
  
She told me one version of the story and later after we finished I went to talk to him and he told me a different version (I don't know which one is lying) in which it was she who suggested that they go to the beach to smoke a joint.  
Something she never asked of me and complained about me only smoking with my friends and not with her.  
  
Obviously, I'm just giving you the crap about my relationship, but despite all the disagreement, for a long time I was very happy.  
  
I loved the way she loved me, how she remembered me throughout the day with small gestures, how she included me in almost all of her plans but  
Something in my head told me that I had to break up with her, not because I didn't like her, but because I didn't lose my normal self, I didn't feel  
comfortable in certain environments with the person who was closest to me, with whom I had basically shared my entire life and with  
who was there 7 years ago. I spoke to her, she understood and didn't have much of an opinion about us ending up, which I thought was strange, but fair.  
  
It didn't take more than 1 week of separation (we continued talking) for me to understand that a large part of her separation was my fault.  
Guilt for not being able to overcome the past as he should and because he felt that he had never really given the relationship an opportunity to nurture.  
I went to talk to her about it, I showed her where I felt I was wrong in the relationship and that I really needed some ""space"" to be able to see things from another perspective.  
She said it was too late for us and that's when she told me everything she didn't tell me during the relationship.  
In short, he complained about the amount I smoked (my consumption used to be every other day +/- when I was in college, despite telling him it was just a phase, which is proven because now that I work my consumption has reduced to 1/2 times a week), he also complained that he slept late on weekends (I always preferred to do college work and music in the early hours of the morning), so I always went to bed later.  
She complained that I was unhealthy. That she felt pressured to have sex with me sometimes just because she wanted us to look good (I was NEVER pushy in anything, I was simply always the one taking the initiative and she never objected) which basically destroyed my self-esteem.  
  
These were things she could have talked about with me while we were in the relationship, because I was always honest with her, in EVERYTHING, and I thought she was the same with me too.  
  
After a month of much conversation I told her that I wanted to try again and she said ""we can try, but without boyfriend and girlfriend labels"".  
At the time I accepted it because I thought it was better than nothing and that it was a fresh start, but I quickly realized that we weren't fighting for anything and that after 7 years, this ""downgrade"" didn't make any sense because I simply felt that she wasn't on the same page as me so I told her that and she agreed and it ended there.  
  
Sorry for the testament and some bad phrasing but I feel like I needed to give a bit of context to really understand my state of mind.  
I miss her and I can't shake the feeling of guilt for feeling that I didn't give everything when I should have, that I should have left my comfort zone and I can't stop the obsession of reliving past scenarios with the anguish that I could have done things in a different way.  
I'm not a very superficial person, but I admit that it also doesn't help that she is a very affectionate and extremely physically attractive person (her glow up over the years has been surreal and much better than mine and I don't just say this because I like her, she has half the world behind her)  
  
I'm really asking you for some help because I can't take this feeling of guilt anymore and thinking that she will always be the best I can have, even though I think I made the best decision for both of us, as we were no longer being good to each other.

I am also flying across to Europe to go to her wedding and have paid for everything including accommodation myself. Is it fair that she doesn’t like my dress? I am not a bridesmaid and there will be lots of other people there.

"Ending my (23M) relationship with GF (21F) of 3 years at the holidays

About 6 months ago my partner and I mutually decided to end our relationship. We had a lot of baggage to work through and thought this was the best decision. However after a lot of reflection from both of us we both wondered if we had been too rash in our decision making and decided to give the relationship one last shot.

Unfortunately I don't think the time we've given it has shifted me much from how I originally felt. Despite having so much love for her and loving her company, there is a spark in the relationship that I haven't felt in some time. I feel that we make incredible best friends but there's a level of romance and passion that has gone away and never seems to return.

I'm very torn on how to proceed. On the one hand I don't think it's healthy to keep this ""will we won't we"" dynamic going any longer for either of our sakes, I don't enjoy being in limbo like this. However I also recognise how devastating it could be to break up with someone with Christmas a few days away and new years shortly after.

"Ik im probably being dramatic abt this but I can’t shake the feeling the my bf of 3 months is loosing interest in our relationship. When my bf and I began our relationship it was heavily based on our intimate relationship, doing it at least once or twice a day everyday, as that was the only thing I was capable of giving him in that moment but now that we have been going steady I chose to go on birth control which has caused me to not want to do it as often. A few weeks ago he told me that he didn’t think I was attracted to him anymore bc of this. And ofc this made me feel horrible so I’ve started do it any time he initiates whether I’m in the mood or not. This was working until he kinda put two and two together and asked abt it and I told him the truth. This has lead him to behave as if he doesn’t want to be around me. When I’m in the mood not and try to start something he shuts me down and plays on his phone or says “I have to go to the gym now”. Even during the day and I try to hangout with him he says he’s busy or gets upset than I’ve interrupted what he’s doing, which is usually video games. Or he tells me he’s gonna go mas*****te rather than wanting me, I can’t help but thinks he’s saying it to hurt me

"So my dad; who, up until two years ago I hadn't seen since I was really little is coming to stay with me and my girlfriend for Christmas. He doesn't have any other family or friends really that he can celebrate Christmas with (he has two other daughters but they are with there mum) so he would be on his own. He also suffers severely with depression, anxiety and OCD. 

I was looking on his Facebook page trying to find hints at what to get him for Christmas, as I still don't know him very well and I stumbled upon his liked pages. 
I was really shocked to find just tons and tons of porn, fetish groups, groups that were dedicated to posting pictures of women that had wardrobe malfunctions accidentally exposing themselves, groups titled 'barely legal', sex workers, porn stars, regular groups for lingerie brands, stocking brands, socks and tights brands, 'sissy men' groups, dominatrix groups...

A lot of these women looked so young, younger than me (his 29 year old daughter, he also has two other daughters that are (24 and 26) and its just creeped me out so much, I'm no prude and I dont have any issue with porn or sex workers, but its wierd seeing so much of it on your dads facebook page, especially young girls. 

There was also a lot of pages like 'real mens bible' and 'just for men' which was full of misogynistic, transphobic hateful stuff. Other important things to note; his personal hygiene is really bad, I know with depression it can feel impossible as I suffer with depression, but he doesn't wipe his butt and he smells a lot at times and it's really difficult to be around.

He's also really timid and quiet usually; he struggles with anxiety so can't use public transport, so he hasn't been able to come and visit me yet, it's always been us travelling to see him (he lives an hour away) bear in mind he was missing for pretty much all of my childhood and ive only been in contact with him over the past two years. 

I'm also a SA survivor and I've found this all really triggering and it's really made me feel gross and disgusting and not want to be around him or see him at all at Christmas. 

I'm unsure whether I want to pursue a relationship with this man now, but I'm not ready to completely cut him out, how do I go about letting him down gently r.e staying for Christmas and possibly addressing this all with him?

"So, this is more of a rant, but if anyone has any ideas on how I can get out of this, please share!

My sister (36f) and I (21f) have never, neverrr got along; it could be because we have different dads or because my parents became financially stable after having me (which shouldn’t be the case; they give her everything). I don’t know the reason, but she’s always hated me. When I was little, she would control everything I did. When I became a teenager, my parents were focused on putting her through university, and at 14/15, she would always push me down, saying she had a degree and was getting married (I mean, duh, I was 15).

When I was at school, I was bullied really bad; my sister found out and told me she was bullied worse and to suck it up. As I got older, some horrible stuff happened, and I constantly got, ""Well, my life was always harder than yours"" from my sister. My parents also got into an insane amount of debt for my sister's wedding, which meant no driving lessons when I turned 17, no car, and struggling through university financially (I should also state that I never ask my parents for financial support, as I saw the stress it put on my sister).

When I turned 18, I got my inheritance from my grandad. Not much, but it could have paid for driving lessons. Instead, my sister was crying to my mum about her horrible debt and needed help, so I gave the money. I refuse to let anyone know how much I have in my savings because I know they (my sister and husband) will ask for money. The cherry on top is they always belittle me at any chance they get since I was 13, making snide comments about how I'm bisexual when I'm not out, about how teachers do nothing with their lives and ruin children (have your own opinion, but it’s my career in training), anything I say is stupid or wrong, how I'm fat, or lazy, or how I have done nothing in my life. How I’ll never move out (I did but with the living crisis and me working part-time, I had to move back home, which she also did).

During my GCSEs, I had to practically be a mother to my nephew. But the worst is when she found out I self-harmed; she said they were barely scratches, and if I really wanted to feel pain, I'd go deeper than that. Anyway, my sister and I have a horrible, horrible relationship.

My mum notices that my sister and brother-in-law ""poke fun,"" and she understands the struggle, but it’s Christmas, and we all have to be together. So, from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day, I’m at my sister's, and I have no choice whatsoever because I'm part of the family. It sucks because my boyfriend invited me to his family for Christmas, but I can't choose him, or that would be WW3, and I just want peace. So yeah, I’m dreading Christmas, absolutely dreading Christmas!! It’s ruined my usual plans; usually, I go to church and volunteer at a food bank or homeless shelter Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, but my sister doesn’t believe in that stuff and lives deep in the countryside, so I can’t leave without having a car to get anywhere.

This part is petty, but when I was a kid/teen, I used to dress up in different costumes to bring laughter and joy during Christmas dinner. My sister and brother-in-law always made fun of me until one year I just stopped. Now, because we’re having Christmas there, they said everyone is dressing up in costume (it was my mum's idea), but I really don’t want to because no matter what, I’m ready for ridicule, and the closer it gets to Christmas, I’m starting to feel the same anxiety I used to have going into school.",I (21f) have to go to my sisters (36f) for Christmas what should I do?,18nkenh,1703156196.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nkenh/i_21f_have_to_go_to_my_sisters_36f_for_christmas/,
"Hello! 
So my 3 yr relationship ended over the summer, it was sad but expected in that we had planned to end due to my bf moving away for work. Honestly I had wanted to try LD and see if it could work but he didn't want to, so I am the dumpee in the situation really.
We did no contact until about a month ago when I reached out, we had lunch one day and he said he didn't know how to be friends with me because he ""doesn't usually want to kiss his friends"", we also spend a couple of nights together since and did sleep together (he was begging and I felt pretty good - I've worked on myself, lost weight, gained hobbies and confidence). 
Anyway, he has a very busy job, very high pressure and works long hours, but obviously when we were together he'd always make time to reply or message me when we were apart. He also has ADHD and is terrible at keeping in touch with people in general. However, I am not used to being just 'people'!
After the last time we saw each other I said I would not want to have to chase him (I don't think this is good for me, I still obviously love him), so the ball re further contact is in his court. He messaged a few times and I replied sporadically, working on not getting reattached, and not being clingy (pretty sure he is avoidant and this is off putting for him). 
Then I mentioned an activity we could do one day. 
He replied ""busy now, message after work"" 
I said no problem!

That was four days ago! Do I follow up or am I being a mug? 
My friends think he's ""more of an F boy than he seemed"" and has had his cake and eaten it since we reconnected!

"I've been going through a tough time lately in my 6-month relationship, especially during the last 3 months, which have been long-distance (8k kms apart). When we were physically together, everything was great, and I never felt the need to question who my girlfriend was talking to or hanging out with because we shared everything about our day-to-day lives.

However, since she moved away, my trust issues have started to take a toll on our relationship. I can't help but feel jealous about her having so many guy friends in her DMs, especially since I don't really talk to any girls.

She reassured me by offering to remove everyone from her DMs to make me feel more comfortable, but she also has two male best friends whom she can't block, and this has also been a source of ongoing tension.

I've been reading some of her chats, and although she's trying to maintain healthy friendships, I still can't shake off the feeling of discomfort, particularly with some guys who come across as perverts.

I appreciate her kindness and caring nature, but I've noticed she goes to great lengths, even going out when she's sick, just to help others. While admirable, I worry about her pushing herself too hard. I'm navigating a fine line between supporting her kindness and ensuring she prioritizes her well-being.

To be honest, the strain has led me to contemplate breaking up multiple times. However, she refuses to accept it, and seeing her commitment to our relationship makes it difficult for me to fully commit to ending things.

I can see she genuinely loves me, and it's creating a conflicting internal struggle.We've discussed having a call throughout the night to bridge the distance, and we're both open to finding ways to keep each other updated on our activities. However, I'm looking for some practical advice and suggestions on how to navigate these trust issues and strengthen our relationship.

What are some strategies or tools that have worked for others in maintaining trust and communication in long-distance relationships? How can we strike a balance between giving each other space and staying connected?

I  didn't invite my boyfriend to Christmas this year because we're visiting family who he doesn't really know that well (he doesn't talk to his parents so we as a couple rely heavily on my family for events to go too ). On top of that everyone in my family and friend group is skeptical of his character and how he carries himself. I  just wanted a normal Christmas after a long year without having to hear off handed remarks about my s/o or have to defend him. After telling him that on Christmas Day I  would be with extended family but free to spend time with him the day after he got defensive and anger with me. He said I didn't think about him and started asking weird questions like who's going to be there. Mind you he made no real plans for Christmas but expects me to just sit and wait for something to happen. Instead of fighting with me he could have said let us do something on Christmas Eve or just enjoy the day after Christmas which I  had set aside of us.

Married. Feelings for colleague won’t fade.

Throwaway account.

I’m married with young kids. Happy with my marriage and family. Has been tough with kids and work, the spark is certainly still there but no fireworks in a long time. I’ve had feelings for a colleague for perhaps 2 years now. Plan was to let that ”go by”, but they’ve only grown stronger and I’m completely head over heels.

I’m not a cheater, and this won’t win me any karma but honestly I probably would cheat in this situation if the opportunity arised - which I’m certain it won’t. They are in a serious, committed relationship, engaged. Often I feel like the feelings are two-sided (intuition, behaviour, logic behind behaviour), but rationally I doubt it.

The option space to me seems to be as follows:
1) Realize feelings: i.e., make a move - I don’t want to lose what I have so not an option. I love my spouse, but first and foremost the kids
2) Do nothing: this I’ve now tried, and doesn’t seem to work
3) Avoid them: this is not really an option either. I’m in a situtation at work in which this would get reaaally weird, and switching jobs is not an option
4) Attempt to make other feelings bigger in comparison: i.e., focus and effort into my marriage. Probably the safest option, but with kids easier said than done, and I doubt it would necessarily work. We’ve had plenty of family vacations and marriage time as well during last 2 years, and whenever I went back to work nothing has changed.

(5) Theoretically suggest polygamy for all parties but no, just no.)

I now think both about them, and the ”problem” itself so much it has started to affect how present I am for the kids, the spouse, and at work. I do love my spouse, and given the kids I truly don’t want anything to break the family. The ultimate lottery prize would be if my crush changed jobs, but I don’t think that’s happening any time soon.

So me (20f) and my bf (24m) have been together for almost 3 years now. He's the most intelligent person emotionally and mentally I've ever met.
He's a very messy person, he has ADHD and other issues with concentration. I tried to help, I tried to teach him how to take care of his environment, but for 2,5 years my tries haven't led me anywhere. He's still messy, and now that I've moved in I do the household chores by myself (I also have a really bad knee injury, 3 ligaments are missing, l'll have a surgery soon, and I'm also a law student.) he takes down the trash and cooks, and that's nice, but he's just not helping me with anything else. He has a high paying job and still studies at university. I get that he's tired and stressed out, but he has the time to play video games with his friends and never the time to do the dishes, so I get home after walking with crutches and a knee brace all day long and I start doing the chores, because if I don't do it we will just live in filth. Yesterday we got into an argument, I jokingly told him that ""you would be a great dad, if your kids cleaned up after themselves"" and his reaction was ""oh don't worry, you will take care of that"". This comment really really scared me, because I don't wanna do this alone... Otherwise he always listens to me, respects me, he's the type of guy who gets me just because flowers and surprise dates and great gifts, and I don't know if I should just suck it up and do it myself?

I knew I liked him as early as the first date, so I really put in a lot of effort to win him. It was very casual during the first few dates, he told me he liked me too by the end of the second month, and by the fourth month I realized I was falling in love already. It was mainly because he was starting to show signs and signals that he would like to have a relationship with me too. He talks to his family about me, sex was great, making out in the car after our dates were magical, daily updates, random kisses when stuck in traffic, we even already have a full itinerary of planned trips in the first quarter of 2024, weeks were basically doing all stuff that couples do, but without label. These made me open the discussion about us, which led to me saying 'Mahal Kita.' His response was not what I was expecting - that he is not ready yet, he wants to enjoy being single first, and the he is not sure he will get to the same level where I'm at in terms of being in love. And then he pulled away, just like that. I asked to meet with him after two days to try and salvage the relationship but he just said the same things.

"We've been dating for 7 months now.  Almost everything in our relationship is great. We agree on every important thing except one: opposite gender friends and boundaries with them.

My gf would get jelous of every female friend I have. It makes her uncomfortable if I hang out w them alone, or even text about college stuff. Even if I go study day before an exam with a female friend that's crossing her boundaries. Now, she does have guy friends, but isn't really social and rarely hangs out with them alone. She has a history of her guy friends hitting on her and being extremly flirty, even touchy, buying her food everyday, following her home... and she ended those relationships when she realised they were flirting, altought it had been obvious to me and all her friends weeks before. So her judgement of people flirting with her is... not that great. I trust her 100% and she says she ""mostly trusts me"", but ""doesn't trust women"". Most of my female friends are in long term relationships, but that means nothing to her because she believes women are more likely to cheat.

Now, to the point. I talked to one my female friends and we realised we had a lot of mutual friends back from highschool, so we discussed about them, as well as about college in general. Then she sent me a college related reel and we talked about some homework we had to do fof college. She saw these messages and concluded ""the girl is flirting with me"" becauss she is texting me ""too often"" (it was like 3 times in that one day about different college related sfuff and convos lasted for about 5min). I told her that was crazy and talked to her about her judgement of people flirting. She then tried to argue how she is a girl, and girls understand how girls flirt, but she isn't a guy, so every time a guy flirts with her she is oblivious.

Now, this is not the first girl she made a drama about. She was worried about 3 other ones that I had talked to for like 2-3 days sending/recieving notes from college / getting coffee inbetween  breaks and studying in a libary with. None of those girls later on had shown any interest in me, we talk only in college or about college over texf, rarely. And all of them have boyfriends, whom I had met as well. So my judgement was correct here as well.

Now she wants a break from our relationship because it's too much to handle for her. Also she demanded that I stop ever talking to that girl from college. I refused, as I don't want to enable such jelous behaviour, and I don't want to accept the ""I'm a girl so I get to decide wether or not the girl is flirting with you"" card. I have no intention of making any of these girls my ""besties"" or giving them a lot of my attention, but to not hang out during college hours or ask for help about something because the person is female is just apsurd. Yes, I do have male friends as well, but some of them aren't all that smart, nor they like helping others / aren't on the same schedule as I am.

Now, she said she doesn't want to ever break up with me and it's sad how we agree on every other thing in life, but this is a very important thing to agree on so she needs time off to think and cool down. She blocked me.

So, what should I even do? How do i approach this conversation witouth calling her crazy jelous and telling her to be less insecure? Or am I doing the wrong thing here and should just respect her (controlling) boundaries?

btw, she has traumas of her ex being way to friendly with girls who literally forced themselves onto him and having 0 boundaries and he used to choose haning out w his female friends instead of his own gf. so that's probably the reason for all of this, but it shouldn't be affecting my social life that much.",My (18M) gf (19F) wants a break after fighting about jelousy,18njxei,1703154275.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18njxei/my_18m_gf_19f_wants_a_break_after_fighting_about/,
"So I (18M) am in an increasingly weird situation with a friend/talking stage(?) of mine (18F). What do I do? 

—- this is a very long post, but I think pretty much all of it is needed since it’s a very weird situation.—- 

Some basic backstory, we “dated” a couple years ago, but nothing really ever came of it, we broke up a couple months later and didn’t talk at all until a couple of months ago. I didn’t talk to her because I heard that she didn’t want me to, which was apparently wrong.

 Anyways, she unblocks me on stuff and all that and started trying to have small conversations with me. This was mostly on Snapchat so just like commenting on things like what I was doing or whatever. 

We hung out a lot in some classes we have because of some mutual friends in there. Then about 2 months ago at a Halloween party she was really flirty with me (probably because I wasn’t in my right mind if you get what I mean) and my friends all told me about how she was into me and blah blah blah. 

I ignored them until a friend of mine (who’s a good friend of hers) told me that I should ask her to hangout. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to, but did it anyways and we hung out about a month ago. It was chill, we got dinner, went to her house and cuddled. That’s it. 

A week later (2 weeks ago) I was at a party with some friends and she texted me asking about “us” and “what are we”. I didn’t really respond, and she came and long story short she kissed me and we madeout. However, before she did that, I was again not in the greatest mindset at that party (she was) and when I tried to make a move on her she backed up, so I felt bad and left it. She then started saying stuff like “cmon (my name)” and “I know you can do it (referring to me kissing her)”. However, I didn’t want to mess up as I already assumed she didn’t want me to since I tried before and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Which I think was the right thing to do, but I don’t think she liked that. I also wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss her anyways, but she kissed me so whatever, it is what it is. 

The day after that she went to some mutual friends and called me a “coward” (she called me something else that starts with a p, but I apparently couldn’t write that on here) for not making a move on her, even though I did. Pretty sure she did this to get my attention since she told 2 of my best friends.

Over the next couple weeks we tried to make plans but we both were genuinely busy so they fell through. 

A couple days ago I had a friend of mine over and we were just chilling playing video games when a friend of the girl this is about texted him to have us both go over there. When he asked about it she said ”(girl’s name) says definitely come if you bring (my name)”. And a mutual friend of ours (the one from above who told me to ask her to hangout) texted me saying to “make sure not to be late”. 

So we went and there was a decent amount of people there. Maybe like 10. But we didn’t even talk to them pretty much the whole time. They were playing a tournament style sport that we couldn’t get into since we were late, so we just threw a football around with her and her brother. It was just an awkward group and I don’t think my friend or I were expecting a large get together like this, rather than like just 4 or 5 people.  

—-Some important info for this next part is she has a friend that she’s gotten really close with recently (and honestly he’s really good looking), however he has a girlfriend. He’s actually a really friendly and nice guy from when I’ve interacted with him, but one of my really close friends actually told me about a week ago that he saw her talking to him a lot at a party in a “supposedly” flirty way, but I brushed it off since he has a girlfriend, and my friend isn’t the most reliable source of information especially since he probably was bouncing off the ceiling at that point. And he ended up saying he wasn’t sure what he saw and that he left to early. This guy also doesn’t seem like the kind of person to do that, but I could be wrong. Although I’ve been a bit suspicious of that guy for a while. —-

Anyways, about an hour later some people left, leaving just a few of us including that other guy. We went to like a forest area and just messed around. Eventually my friend and this other girl went off to do whatever they were gonna do leaving 4 of us. The girl I am sort of in a thing with was hanging with the other guy (not in a romantic way at all, but like it was sorta strange) it went on for the whole time. So I was stuck with just her brother who likes me a lot. At this point I thought this whole thing was weird, considering she wanted me there but was hardly talking to me. I was also getting really suspicious of the other guy, despite him having a girlfriend. Her brother even thought it was weird and asked me what was going on/happening between us. 

Anyways I basically just hung out with her brother and my friend who I ended up finding for a bit before we left. He was equally bored and we left as quick as we could. He even said “it would’ve been more fun to stay at my house and play COD”.

The whole thing seemed weird. This girl wanted me there, and then didn’t talk to me. She even got her friends to text me. But then, she just talked to this other guy to the point that I thought it’d be awkward for me to join in. 

My friends are split between thinking she’s intimidated by me or that she’s trying to make me jealous in a really stupid way. I kinda feel frustrated by her antics and don’t know if I even want to continue whatever this is. It seems super stupid and overly confusing, because I know the next time I see her at a party or 1 on 1 (probably New Years) she will be all over me and will probably want to kiss me at midnight knowing her. 

What do I do? I haven’t snapped her or contacted her at all since this happened. I just think it’s weird that she’d want me there and have her friends tell me to come all for her to just not talk to me. My friends think she’s really into me but immature or afraid of something. 

I’m going to have classes/be interacting with her for the next year so I want to be chill about whatever I do, and I am genuinely friends with her at school, that’s where this all started. 

My question is- what do I do ? What does she want/what is she doing? She almost definitely  is into me, but then does dumb stuff like this. And what’s my best course of action?

"Hi everyone, just posting my story to see if I was in the right or wrong. I've told my story to a couple of friends, and some believe I've cheated, and some don't, so I'd like to get Reddit's opinion on it.

I was with my ex for about three months. It was my first relationship, and I truly felt I loved him. However, our relationship was very toxic, and I hadn't felt safe with him when he was high, due to the fact that he had SA'd me before. He broke it off between us when he had to go to rehab, and I felt like I was over it.

 Fast forward a couple of months, and I meet my boyfriend (who I've just broken up with). He is the sweetest man alive, and he's caring and wonderful. He actually liked spending time with me, and we had a very healthy relationship. Maybe 5 months into the relationship, I realised that I couldn't stop thinking about my ex. I'm not sure if it was the undiagnosed BPD at the time that made me constantly think about him, but whenever I tried to think about my boyfriend, my ex would pop into my mind. I NEVER contacted my ex and never thought of him intentionally. When I realised that I still had feelings for my ex, I broke up with my boyfriend because it wasn't fair for him to see me in love with a guy who essentially broke me. I haven't broken up with my boyfriend to get back with my ex, nor am I in a new relationship now. I'm just wondering if I did the right thing. Or did I cheat?

"I think that me and my girlfriend should break up but whenever I try to, I’m unable to go through with it. We have been together for 3 years, and we’ve been regularly arguing throughout its entirety. On average, we would probably have an argument every 3 weeks. There would be good periods of no fights for maybe 6 weeks, but then there would be periods where we would fight twice in a week for a few weeks. At the start of the relationship, I was still hopeful and would want to work on it, but now when things turn sour, I’m unable to feel like I really want this to work and instead just feel fed up and feel done with it. This emotional burnout is definitely contributing to us fighting over small things that shouldn’t really cause fights, and I feel like she must be feeling similar because she’ll start fights over nothing as well. 

Other things that tell me that we should break up is that she makes me feel worthless about myself as a boyfriend, I feel like I’m walking on egg shells all the time not knowing what’s going to set off a fight next time, and I’ve realised that I’ve noticed and started to dislike some of her personality traits.

When I talk to my friends about the relationship, they think this isn’t the right relationship for us, and I agree when I’m not with her and feel like we’d be better off apart. However, whenever I then hear her voice or see her face, that feeling goes out of the window and I’m not so sure anymore as I still love her. When I think about breaking up with her, I can’t imagine not having her in my life, not laughing with her, cuddling with her, and having her mannerisms around me. We’ve tried to break up in the past, more often initiated by me, but we both get upset and when I think about the stuff mentioned above, I’ll start crying. As a result, we’ll both then say maybe we should stay together if we feel so strongly about each other and give it one more shot. 

I’m torn between the logical side of me telling me we should break up, but then the emotional side telling me that we still have strong feelings for each other and we should be together. However, I’m not sure if that’s a good reason to stick together? 

TL;DR: I’ve been in a 3 year relationship with my girlfriend and a number of things have come up that tell me we should break up, but then I still have strong feelings for her and she’s been a core part of my life that I can’t imagine not having her beside me, but I’m not sure if that’s a good enough reason to stay in the relationship.",I (25M) feel like me and my girlfriend (25F) should break up but I can’t go through with it,18njlvc,1703152980.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18njlvc/i_25m_feel_like_me_and_my_girlfriend_25f_should/,
"I (19M), a college freshman, fell in love with a college senior (20F) throughout this semester. She was always really nice to me, helping out in various ways that you would expect an upperclassmen to do. She is also a big figure in terms of helping out A LOT with the organization we are in and just being a very friendly and social person.

At first, I didn’t really think much of it. I always have had low self-esteem and hadn’t dated anyone since I was 13 because of that. I’m definitely not the most attractive person out there, and the only things I have going for me are my talents and my social skills (as long as my social battery’s full). She, on the other hand, is out-of-my-league attractive and has a lot of guys who like her constantly around. I only started falling in love with her when she began to appear where I least expected—i.e. going out of her way to strike up a conversation—and I was immediately lovestruck by those simple things. 

I started communicating with her through Snapchat (just regular selfies 5-10 times a day, nothing special) after asking her an unrelated question through the app. (I was really crushing on her at this point.) Some three weeks later, she started leaving me on opened, leaving me heartbroken—“what did I do wrong? Am I just not that interesting? Was I too slow to make a move?” After a lot of hurting and thought, I mustered up the courage to tell her how I felt, with the sole purpose of finding a reason to finally give up and to start learning how to love myself again. I understood that I probably took her kindness as something more than what it was, that I was probably blowing things out of proportion in the first place, that I never really pursued her in person due to my shyness anyway, and that we were in two completely different places in life.

I found the time and place, and told her how I felt in person right before Thanksgiving break started. I told her everything that I felt—how I probably overlooked her kindness and blew things out of proportion, and as I expected, she rejected me, saying that she didn’t believe she could properly invest the time into a relationship (as she learned from a recent past relationship) and that she was sorry if she was leading me on. It was funny, too, because she thought I was just going to ask her to be my partner for a formal event that our organization was hosting in a few weeks. I accepted her rejection and was happy to be relieved of a heavy weight on my chest. We agreed to keep things as less awkward as possible, and I apologized for suddenly dropping a bomb on her. I was happy to finally be able to move on and work on myself. That never happened, though.

She kept snapping me, and I told her that she didn’t need to to sugarcoat her rejection (which I already got over) to which she replied that she just liked snapping me (which I found weird because of her tendency of leaving me on opened and delivered). Hence, I fell back in this disgusting dark hole.

Recently, she has been going through cycles of ignoring me, leaving me on delivered and opened for long periods of time. In person, she’ll straight up ignore me when people are around and look really awkward, even though I have done my best to interact with her in the same way I did before with no change. On the other hand, she’s randomly come by to give me a hug twice—the first after I won an award at the formal event and the second after I left her snacks (as a friend) as support for a stressful week—offered to drive me somewhere when she knew I was going to ask someone else for a ride, and even talked about past relationships/current problems to me whenever she asked me to get food with her. But it still feels like that out of all the guys that like her, I’m the one who’s the most swept under the rug.

I hate how I’ve been feeling these past few weeks. I’m afraid that I’ve even developed some sort of limerence and hate for her. Yet, I don’t want to hate her. She is one of the kindest and helpful people around despite going through so much in her life right now. I would hate to be a source of stress for her, but I know I need to get away from her for my own sanity, which is why I want to create space between us without creating any tension or telling her how I feel.

I have no idea what to do anymore. Is there a chance she still likes me or am I just going crazy? Should I just try to ignore everything and let things run their course? Should just I start leaving her on delivered? Should I lie about talking to another girl to create a reason to talk to her less?? How can I disappear from her life as silently as possible?

"I had a nearly three-year relationship with my ex, who is Colombian, while I am Italian; both of us were residents in a European country. Differences in our priorities and ambitions created tensions: she was very focused on her career and financial success almost  exclusively .
Despite our connection and love, her apparent selfishness at times made me doubt the sincerity of our bond.

Things got complicated when I lost my mother. I coped with this pain through isolation, using marijuana and video games as an outlet. My mistake was not openly communicating my feelings, hiding behind a ""I'm fine"" when I felt shattered inside. 
She didn't fully understand my suffering, and requests to attend crowded events seemed insensitive given my recent loss.

Conflicts and reproaches contributed to emotional distancing. My sadness was dismissed with labels like ""slacker"" or ""marijuana-dependent."" Meanwhile, I developed a connection with another local girl, initially tied to work but evolving into something more personal.

She(this new girl )  was empathetic and sensitive, with growing attraction. Meanwhile, the lack of communication with my ex worsened, bringing me closer to this new person interested in me and my well-being.

My girlfriend found out everything, and our breakup, which occurred after a few months, was tumultuous. During the most intense arguments, she used physical violence on me. At the peak of my tolerance, I reacted with a slap, not stronger than those during intimacy(we use to have intense intimacy), but it turned out to be the final reason for our separation.

Meanwhile, I severed all ties with the new local girl and, of course, with my ex.

After 4 months of no communication, my ex and I reconnected. She says she can never be with me again because of that slap. But for months now, we've been meeting, she comes to my house, says she still loves me, and I genuinely love her. At least once a week, we meet, have outstanding intimate moments, talk, and finally manage to communicate well. However, she remains adamant about not wanting to try again because of that slap.

I am suffering; I love her and seem to feel good only when we meet. Then, I fall into a state of heavy sadness and psychological low, every time she steps the door to go out .

I would like to free myself from her and stop loving her,  she has already made plans for the future (ofc without involving me )
Yet, she wants to see me, calls me at night crying that she feels lonely, calls me for everything, as if we were together. 
But getting back together is not on the table for her . 
I genuinely continued to have contact with her again becasue I thought was a way to fix the things and get back together,  but is just company and sex at this point , 
Now  I just want to move forward, not suffer anymore, and if necessary, close things definitively with her, but I don't know how.

Why she is acting like this with me ? Why she want contact and sex? just to don’t feel alone ?
Why she can’t even considerate to come back together but looks like we are ?

"Fiance never sees his kids. Seeking all advice

My(32f) fiances(39m) ex(43f) has full custody of their children (5m, and 8f). 6 months after their divorce,  they were supposed to revisit the custody agreement.   He asked to, she refused. For about a year as we were relocating and our lives were too unstable to manage partial custody, we entertained her having sole custody, even though she made it very difficult. She is chronically late, changes or cancels plans. She doesn't allow my fiance to have private conversations with his kids.   She had a baby 3 months ago with her new boyfriend (that she moved in with her kids without mentioning it to my fiance,  and had the kids tell my fiance that he was their ""imaginary friend"" for months.) We attempted to give the kids a tablet so they could call their dad over zoom whenever they wanted... and the kids never got to use it. After 4 days of them not having it,  we asked the kids where their tablet was,  and her son said ""[new boyfriend] said he needed it more than us"". We flipped out and demanded to know why they didn't have it, and as it turns out, her new boyfriend had it in his possession,  and he gave it to the police to give back to us. The cops showed up at my fiances work with the tablet with the cameras covered,  and it was very evident that an adult male had attempted to unlock the screen (we only gave his daughter the password to unlock it, and she kept it a secret from them). Then she seriously began to censor the kids and limit interactions with their dad. We now have a 3br with ample room for the kids and have expressed interest in having them come stay with us on weekends.  She adamantly refused, going so far as to file false harassment charges against my fiance to prevent us from having them over. She dropped the charges (they were totally bogus) but the judge told her and my fiance to come to a reasonable custody agreement.
The next day, this is what she texts my fiance:

""Going forward as of November. Since we don't currently have any kind of schedule this will be the one we use. Calls will be Monday at 6pm  Wednesday at 6pm and a zoom call Friday at 7pm. The kids don't want to talk every night and this way we have consistency for their sake. They will know when you will call and when we will see you. You may not make plans with the kids. Don't tell them they will be sleeping at your house or you will be picking them up from school. This messes with their emotional wellbeing. We will meet up every 3rd Saturday of each month for a supervised visitation.  If you can't make the visit we will not reschedule we will see you the following month. Same with phone calls if you miss the 6pm on school nights we will not reschedule. The zoom call can be rescheduled for a later time since it is not a school night. It can also be moved to Saturday night if need be. Just give me a heads up on that.  If there is a concert for the kids at school I will let you know the date so you can attend. All visits going forward will be with only you, not [me] No uninvited guests allowed. This way we have a set schedule we both have to abide by and then accusations aren't thrown around unnecessarily.  Please only text me if it has to do with the call or visit. Please confirm that you have recieved this text. I will also email you a copy. Thanks.""


This ""agreement"" she made up 100% herself,  and when asked to discuss, she refused to negotiate.
It limits my fiances ability to see his kids about 200% more than it already is.
She also banned me from going to these visits (in public places) because she accused me of being disrespectful.  (I asked one time why my fiance couldn't see his kids, since then,  she said I'm ""not allowed"" to go to visits. The kids love me. They ask how I'm doing and miss me. On zoom calls they always try to include me; it's very sweet. They're the best. 

Since then, his ex wife has also gotten confident and disregards my fiance as often as she pleases. She grounded the kids for a week because they were allegedly reasonable for 8 ducks that died in their care (the kids told him this). When my fiance asked his ex about it, she refused to tell him anything about what happened or why they were being punished, and told the kids not to talk about it.  At the end of the week of them being grounded, we were supposed to meet the kids an hour away at a library between her house and ours (they live 1.5 hours away). When hits ex wife showed up and saw that I was there, she ripped the kids away before my fiance could even see them.  (He hasn't seen them in over 2 months because last month he had a seizure and was in the hospital on the 3rd Saturday.)


Now she's trying to make the kids resent their dad in any way possible. She gave them their technology back and put a movie that the kids both wanted to watch. She then forced her son to take his scheduled zoom call with my fiance, but allowed their daughter to continue watching the movie in the other room. His son said he wanted to watch the movie and asked why he had to take the call and his sister didnt. He said ""it's just not fair! It's not fair! This is just like when...."" and my fiances ex cut him off (I'm assuming he was talking about how she punished them for me being there for my fiances visit with them) 

We just notarized the paperwork for a petition for family court. Does anybody have general advice for how we should approach everything? We're definitely expressing concern of parental alienation. 
Is what she's doing even legal? What are other things I should consider here? This has been overwhelming me for months and I would love insight from anyone who may have had similar issues with their partners/ families.","My(32f) fiances(39m) ex wife (43f) is manipulating his ability to see their shared kids (5m, 8f)",18nja5m,1703151631.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nja5m/my32f_fiances39m_ex_wife_43f_is_manipulating_his/,
"I’ll try make this as short as possible but after a number of revisions this is as short as I can make it.  I was living with my other ex that I was in previous long term relationship with (6+ years) we will call her Sara. Me and Sara had a rocky relationship the last couple years, due to her cheating on me. The last couple years of our relationship we just went through the motions. There was ZERO intimacy and affection. I slept on the couch the entire time, but she didn’t call it quits and I could tell she was still secretly seeing other men. At this point I didn’t care though I was making a plan to break up and leave. The issue was at the time I didn’t have a good support system and had just started a new job so money was extremely tight especially with the amount of debt I accrued during us buying a house (while thing were good)

During the start of this new job I met a coworker and quickly became friends with her. The relationship turned into something more. This is who I referenced in the title and we will call her Liz. Me and Liz are extremely similar. Exact same taste in everything. We joked that our hearts were dark soulmates. Before I started the job people told me she took an interest in me but I didn’t believe them. As far as I was concerned it was just rumors, and I viewed her as way out of my league and simply didn’t believe it. They said to be careful with her because she was known to string people a long and had turbulent relationships with other coworkers including her ex who also worked there. Again I ignored all this because their issues aren’t my issues and I liked to formulate my own opinion of people without others bias. 

I was very forthcoming of my situation to Liz as soon as she confirmed her interest in me. She confirmed that she was still interested and we proceeded to date in secrecy for 4 months. She stated she didn’t want to go public with the information until I was off my work probationary period and out of my situation because she feared her ex and other coworkers would retaliate and try to get me fired. People in our work place started having their suspicions and Liz claimed that it was causing issues for her and that our workplace began an investigation against her saying that they could fire me because technically I was in a common law marriage and on probation. 

While I had my suspicions this was not true, because this situation or variants of have been highly common in my workplace (after doing a little digging) with the result of no disciplinary action. But regardless she was clearly  stressed and not happy so I gracefully accepted her wishes to stop what we had and told her that if she ever wanted to revisit what we had I was more than willing. 

We remained friendly toward each other and cordial. Liz stated once I was off my probationary period and out of my situation we could revisit us. I told her I would not be seeing anyone else and had every intension of waiting for her. I did  ask her if she lost interest just to let me know so I could start my healing process to which she agreed. I would occasionally stop in and update my progress with her and express my intentions. 

Flash forward several months I’m nearing my end of probation, we randomly text (me always initiating them) she even shares photos of her boudoir photoshoot to me. I miss her tremendously and I even write her a letter confessing my love to her and throwing some of what little cash I have in an envelope and tell her not to read/open it until she’s having a really bad day.  

Ultimately I briefly turn my socials back on and find out she’s seeing a guy. She posted a pic of them saying “we’ve finally made it official” just a couple weeks after sharing those photos with me. A couple more months go by and I don’t address this and limit my engagement with her. Just a couple days before my probation ends she hits me with “I’m possibly filing a lawsuit with our employer and my lawyers advice me to not date coworkers”. Still not telling me about this guy.  

Couple more months go by. And here I am now. Off probation, living with a friend until I get on my feet. And she’s with some guy who suspect she ultimately chose over me and I suspect was also seeing while seeing me due to the dates of some comments he left on some of her socials that she has since deleted (she is also unaware I know this).

Do I still stand a chance? Did I get played? What should I do? I’m still totally madly in love with her. I can’t shake her from my mind. I feel destroyed, but still keep on pretending I’m fine. She says she still has my letter and has it in a special place but hasn’t opened it . Am I the other guy? She never mentioned the guys existence even now. Until the other day when I asked her if it would be ok if I gave a her a birthday present, or would her man be upset.

I recently found out this guy filed for divorce shortly before she broke it off with me, and they went public shortly after it his was finalized.  

Reddit, I feel like I know most the answers to what I’m asking…but further input and confirmation is welcomed. As well as advice. I am utterly fucked up over this. As soon as I think I’m ok, I see her again and realize she still has my heart. We talked about meeting each others parents, hell even shared what type of rings we might want one day. Shared extremely valuable information with each-other. Stuff neither of us told anyone. And now I’m just floating around like nothing ever happened.

I also heard they’ve talked about trying to buy a house together. Again she still has shared little to nothing about this guy to me.

"TLDR I (30F) pay for 4/5 dates with him (34M). Not liking it and not sure how to bring it up.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been dating for 3 months and decided to be exclusive pretty quickly because he and I got along so well. He spends every weekend at my place and one night during the week. In the beginning I made it clear that I don't expect him to pay for everything and actually prefer that he not pay for me all the time because I'm happy with a 50/50 situation, but I think I sent the wrong message because now I'm paying for most of it. 4/5 times we eat out I pay for it. He likes to cook and when we go out to get the ingredients he needs I pay for it because leftover ingredients will be left at my place I guess, but the leftover meal he always takes for lunch the next day (I don't really mind that part). We attended an event in another city (about a 3 hour drive) a few weeks ago and he was taking his car and paying for gas so I offered to cover the hotel ($260 for one night) and that's more than what he paid for gas. But then he kept reminding me that we need to get tickets for the event so one day when we're sitting on the couch I pull out my computer to buy the tickets and he doesn't say anything. I made the assumption that if I paid for both tickets he wold pay me back for his, my mistake because that didn't happen (paid $220 total for both tickets). He's super nice most of the time, but then made a couple comments that bothered me. At the grocery store one day I picked up a bag of chips since I was paying for the groceries anyway and he said, ""Put that back, you don't need that.""  Another day we were getting ready to watch a movie and planning to make dinner after the movie which was 2 hours long so I decided since it's going to be a while I'm going to have a snack during the movie. I brought a bag of popcorn and he seemed irritated and said, ""now you're going to eat that and not be hungry for dinner"" and it just felt weird. I didn't touch the popcorn after that. How to handle it? He seems serious as he's hinted at us finding a place together in a year or so, but I'm not sure how I feel.

I [22f] and my boyfriend [23m] have been together for more than a year and moved in together in september. 
Our relationship in great except for 2 things :

The first thing is that his ex gf dumped him a month before we met and they were still talking after our meeting. I discoverd this the day I met his parents and I my heart dropped. There was here PS5 account with hier name. I stalked a bit her Twitter and I saw everything. She is very public so she twitted about them, their sexual life etc... I contacted her to know the truth since he lied to me (that's where I fucked up I guess). She told me everything. Still he denied that they broke up a month before meeting me. Still I apologized and moved on. Despite this I still fell like I was a second choice.

The second thing is that on my graduation (it was a thé beggening if out relationship) day my sister and I joined him ans his friend in a club. Let's call his friend Lucy. I suspected some history with her and asked him. He denied everything to the point I belevied I was a pathetic insecure girlfriend.

Yesterday I was alone at home and did some digging in his computer. I know it's bad but honestly I never felt this insecure and unhappy in my life. I search in his photos I found (among other things) a text where he wrote how much he loved his girlfriend (now ex), how she was the woman of his life, how beautiful she is. How he never loved somebody like this, not even his other ex or Céline. I saw that he postes her while he never posted me. I saw how jalous he were while he never is of me.

Now I confronted him about Lucy. AT first he tried to gaslight me but this time I stood my ground. Then he told me that she was his best friend and liked her in a romantic way but nerver made a moove. One day (for no reason apparently) she blocked him and a year later she deblocked him. I feel like it was nothing but I don't accept lies. He still made a fool out of me. He still accompagnied her home while I went with my sister. One day I was with my bf, a friend and Lucy. A guy on the street told them there were a beautiful couple. I feelt mortified but still didn't say anything.

Now I just feel do sad. I don't trust him anymore. One thing about me is I never lie. I hate liars. I feel like he were a coward and didn't respect me. Yesterday I throw a huge fit and I went toi telling me I was insecure to apologize. Now I don't know if I want to stay with him... Should I leave him over those lies ?",I [22f] IS thinking about dumping my boyfriend [23m] over lies,18nj3k7,1703150843.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nj3k7/i_22f_is_thinking_about_dumping_my_boyfriend_23m/,
"We’ve been together for 3 years and the relationship’s been going great so far. I can tell he really cares for me, puts effort into the relationship and is there for me when I need emotional support.

I’ve been on hormonal birth control for over 5 years and after doing a lot of research on the effects of hormones and how they might even alter your brain structure and since the brain is still developing until your mid twenties I’ve got a petty bad feeling about taking hormones throughout the development phase. Furthermore, there’s some issues during sex like pain and me not really being able to orgasm anymore that might be related as well. So about a year ago I’ve decided that I want to stop taking birth control and see if it changes anything. 

I talked about it to my boyfriend and mentioned condoms as an option and he just completely shut down. He was really sad and it took a while before he told me his reasons why condoms are not an option for him. He said that they are really uncomfortable for him but also that he wouldn’t enjoy sex anymore as there’s a barrier between us, physically and emotionally for him.
I’ve tried talking about it more to understand him better and maybe find a solution but he just shut down and didn’t want to talk about it as he said there’s nothing else left to say for him.
He said he’d rather not have sex with me anymore than use condoms which I guess is valid but I don’t really get to understand his motivation.

I’ve decided that the copper IUD might be an option. However, after doing some further research and made an appointment with my gynaecologist, I wasn’t so sure about the copper IUD anymore. 
My gynaecologists told me it would be hard to insert the IUD due to the position of my cervix and that most likely I would have to be done under anaesthesia. 
So getting a copper IUD would be pretty expensive but my boyfriend would pay half. 
The actual problem is the risk of heavier bleeding and cramping during the period. Since I’ve struggled a lot with it already before taking hormonal birth control I’m really scared it could get even worse from the copper IUD. So it’s a pretty high financial risk if I had to take it out after a short time.

So I’ve brought it up again but every time I bring it up my boyfriend gets so sad. He pulls back and starts crying and just completely shuts down and is unable to talk to me. He tells me he doesn’t want our relationship to end because he loves me and cares for me a lot and that he just wants everything to stay the same. He said he understands my concerns but that he can’t think of a solution for our problem. He agreed to to try out condoms with me but he says he didn’t like them before so it wouldn’t change anything with me and that he’d just not have sex at all. 
When I mentioned options like a different size, latex free, … to see if it might be more comfortable for him but there’s still the emotion barrier for him with using condoms and not being as physically close to me as without. He’s not willing to talk about that aspect a lot and gets frustrated with me because he thinks I should accept it instead of trying to change it.
The only option he sees for me to stop hormonal birth control would be me getting the copper IUD.
It think this is pretty unfair, him getting upset about me bringing up condoms as an option but him still seeing me staying on hormonal birth control or getting the copper IUD as an option.

It’s pretty frustrating to talk about it so after a while I’ve stopped bringing it up so much.

There’s never a good time to bring it up either because he gets so upset it ruins his day or he’s unable to sleep at night which makes me feel really bad.

The first time we’ve talked about it has been over a year ago and we haven’t found a solution yet. 

I’ve noticed that I started to resent him and I’ve stopped wanting to sleep with him so much so we talked about it again. 
He says he’s putting a lot of effort in to make sex more enjoyable for me with the problems I mentioned earlier. He’s really patient and puts a lot of effort in to make me come first.
And while I appreciate it, I still feel unhappy and frustrated about the whole situation and I feel like it’s not enough.

I’ve been thinking about wether this is worth breaking up over when the rest of the relationship is going great. Buy I’m not just just frustrated with the contraception question anymore but I’m also very unhappy with our way of communication.

Thinking about braking up makes me really sad because he’s my very best friend too and he told me he wouldn’t be able to stay friends with me anymore if we broke up because he loves and cares for me so much.

What’s your advice on how I can navigate through this situation without having to beak up?

"Okay I (18) f am dating (22) m for about 4 months . I’ve never really felt loved the way this man loves me . He’s sweet and kind and very handsome , but we have a lot of differences for starters me and him constantly are fighting about if I’m faithful and yes I am I had a past relationship for 2 years and never once cheated although I was getting cheated on constantly. I was raised very religious and I’m not that religious now but I still am and go to church every other Sunday when I can . So I think cheating is not okay at all . Anyways while he is very kind and respectful. He also has another side of him , when he’s mad he takes things out on me a lot he says words he doesn’t mean but always apologizes later . I mean I am in the wrong sometimes as well I’m no victim . One time we got into a big fight about me following one of my classmates on instagram he doesn’t have service in his phone and I do not use snap chat and he also has a android device so he couldn’t iMessage me ,my boyfriend got upset at me for texting him asking if he completed his osha certification. Now the only men I follow on insta is my brother that classmate and 2 gay  guys I went to school with in middle school and we hardly ever talk and obviously my bf. But my boyfriend follows a lot of girls so I don’t understand why he was upset and we got into an argument , he told me he should’ve left this relationship a long time ago . It really hurt me I feel like hes always picking fights with me and I started to have a gut feeling he was cheating but never found anything and it’s making me lose my sanity. Being in a relationship is never easy for me , I was diagnosed with bpd not too long ago and I feel like being in a relationship makes me choose between my sanity or being loved but I really love him , like honestly . I think this is the best I can be with . I’m just scared to get hurt again and scared I’m going to get cheated on . It’s just little things he does sometimes that make me feel like I’m not worth it . Like he told me one time one of the girls he follows if he wanted her he could’ve had her . I don’t know how to take that . I think I’m just getting in my head but a lot of my friends say he’s gaslighting me and he sounds narcissistic . Should I just talk to him about my concerns about this and my mental health or just say their is no saving this and give him a explanation why I need to leave , or just see if things get better?

"TL;DR! The guy I like has been through some rough times and I would like to help him in any way I can. Sadly, I don’t know how to approach the situation

We’re in the same uni, different departments. I met him through some common friends, when we went out at a bar one night

He’s extremely cute, curly hair, dark green eyes and athletic. He also has pretty deep cuts on his forearm, although they seem old. He didn’t speak much. His eyes seem… empty, devoid of life; Idk how to explain it. I talked to him at the bar and he opened up a bit more; I hate using this expression, but he really seems more emotionally mature for his age. I asked for his number and we’ve been going out to get coffee/walks in the park regularly, for the last 6-ish months.

We had sex a a few of times and he’s extremely good at it: he listens to what I have to say, he teases A LOT and he can be both gentle and rough. He cuddles me and gives me lots of kisses. Despite that, his eyes always look devoid of any feelings and his laugh &amp; smile always seem forced. Kinda like “American Psycho”, in a less creepy way

I asked his friends if something is wrong with him; they said that about 4 years ago he met a girl who said he loved him, treated him kindly etc; she then proceeded to go to a gangbang (only girl there) and never talk to him again. Idk how he was acting then, so idk how it all really unfolded (other than what I’ve been told), but I was pretty shocked. They also said that for anout 2 years he cried almost daily, mostly after school

Also, I’ve recently discovered that the hair on the sides of his head is greying rapidly. It could just be genetics, but I think it might be due to stress (I have no medical expertise)

"So I (18M) am in a weird situation with a friend/talking stage(?) of mine (18F). What do I do? 

Some basic backstory, we “dated” a couple years ago, but nothing really ever came of it, we broke up a couple months later and didn’t talk at all until a couple of months ago. I didn’t talk to her because I heard that she didn’t want me to, which was apparently wrong.

 Anyways, she unblocks me on stuff and all that and started trying to have small conversations with me. This was mostly on Snapchat so just like commenting on things like what I was doing or whatever. 

We hung out a lot in some classes we have because of some mutual friends in there. Then about 2 months ago at a Halloween party she was really flirty with me (probably because I wasn’t in my right mind if you get what I mean) and my friends all told me about how she was into me and blah blah blah. 

I ignored them until a friend of mine (who’s a good friend of hers) told me that I should ask her to hangout. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to, but did it anyways and we hung out about a month ago. It was chill, we got dinner, went to her house and cuddled. That’s it. 

A week later (2 weeks ago) I was at a party with some friends and she texted me asking about “us” and “what are we”. I didn’t really respond, and she came and long story short she kissed me and we madeout. However, before she did that, I was again not in the greatest mindset at that party (she was) and when I tried to make a move on her she backed up, so I felt bad and left it. She then started saying stuff like “cmon (my name)” and “I know you can do it (referring to me kissing her)”. However, I didn’t want to mess up as I already assumed she didn’t want me to since I tried before and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Which I think was the right thing to do, but I don’t think she liked that. I also wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss her anyways, but she kissed me so whatever, it is what it is. 

The day after that she went to some mutual friends and called me a pussy for not making a move on her, even though I did. Pretty sure she did this to get my attention since she told 2 of my best friends.

Over the next couple weeks we tried to make plans but we both were genuinely busy so they fell through. 

A couple days ago I had a friend of mine over and we were just chilling playing video games when a friend of the girl this is about texted him to have us both go over there. When he asked about it she said ”(girl’s name) says definitely come if you bring (my name)”. And a mutual friend of ours (the one from above who told me to ask her to hangout) texted me saying to “make sure not to be late”. 

So we went and there was a decent amount of people there. Maybe like 10. But we didn’t even talk to them pretty much the whole time. They were playing a tournament style sport that we couldn’t get into since we were late, so we just threw a football around with her and her brother. It was just an awkward group and I don’t think my friend or I were expecting a large get together like this, rather than like just 4 or 5 people.  

—-Some important info for this next part is she has a friend that she’s gotten really close with recently (and honestly he’s really good looking), however he has a girlfriend. He’s actually a really friendly and nice guy from when I’ve interacted with him, but one of my really close friends actually told me about a week ago that he saw her talking to him a lot at a party in a “supposedly” flirty way, but I brushed it off since he has a girlfriend, and my friend isn’t the most reliable source of information especially since he probably was bouncing off the ceiling at that point. And he ended up saying he wasn’t sure what he saw and that he left to early. This guy also doesn’t seem like the kind of person to do that, but I could be wrong. Although I’ve been a bit suspicious of that guy for a while. —-

Anyways, about an hour later some people left, leaving just a few of us including that other guy. We went to like a forest area and just messed around. Eventually my friend and this other girl went off to do whatever they were gonna do leaving 4 of us. The girl I am sort of in a thing with was hanging with the other guy (not in a romantic way at all, but like it was sorta strange) it went on for the whole time. So I was stuck with just her brother who likes me a lot. At this point I thought this whole thing was weird, considering she wanted me there but was hardly talking to me. I was also getting really suspicious of the other guy, despite him having a girlfriend. Her brother even thought it was weird and asked me what was going on/happening between us. 

Anyways I basically just hung out with her brother and my friend who I ended up finding for a bit before we left. He was equally bored and we left as quick as we could. He even said “it would’ve been more fun to stay at my house and play COD”.

The whole thing seemed weird. This girl wanted me there, and then didn’t talk to me. She even got her friends to text me. But then, she just talked to this other guy to the point that I thought it’d be awkward for me to join in. 

My friends are split between thinking she’s intimidated by me or that she’s trying to make me jealous in a really stupid way. I kinda feel frustrated by her antics and don’t know if I even want to continue whatever this is. It seems super stupid and overly confusing, because I know the next time I see her at a party or 1 on 1 (probably New Years) she will be all over me and will probably want to kiss me at midnight knowing her. 

What do I do? I haven’t snapped her or contacted her at all since this happened. I just think it’s weird that she’d want me there and have her friends tell me to come all for her to just not talk to me. My friends think she’s really into me but immature or afraid of something. 

I’m going to have classes/be interacting with her for the next year so I want to be chill about whatever I do, and I am genuinely friends with her at school, that’s where this all started. 

My question is- what do I do ? What does she want/what is she doing? She almost definitely  is into me, but then does dumb stuff like this. And what’s my best course of action?

"*burner for obvious reasons*

My husband(25M) and I(24F) have been in a relationship for 10 years. We have been having sex since we started dating. We initially had sex at least once per day either before or after school. It didn't change at all through until we got married and moved into our own home. Until about last week we tried to have sex at least twice maybe three times a day. I'm aware this is a lot of sex, but we were both very happy and at times discussed trying to have sex more often but never did. 

Just last week, my husband decided he wanted to lower the number of times we had sex. We typically had sex first thing in the morning and in the afternoon once he came home from work (sometimes again before bed). He said he probably only wanted to have sex after he got off work, which went on until yesterday when he came home from work, and said he didn't want to have sex. 

This morning I tried to wake him up with a blow job and when he woke up he told me to stop. When he came home today he told me no again, and when we were showering a little bit ago he told me he wanted to take a break from having sex.

I'm not sure if he's tired of the sex because it was too much or too repetitive. We've had pretty similar sex for the past 3 years. We stopped doing anal in college after an accident, but started trying to again about 3 weeks ago, but besides that it's been essentially the same (missionary, doggy, cuddle fucking, cowgirl).

"Hello everyone,Happy Holidays to everyone and their families.

I’ll preface this by saying,I’ve not had a nice childhood or a childhood at all. Physical Abuse,Mental Abuse,I was also forced by my parents to take antidepressants at 11 years old and made to visit psychiatrists because they were convinced I was severely depressed(because of their fights). 

All this just led to an insane big ball of intense suppressed emotions which wasn’t a problem as I’d gotten very good at doing that and had gone emotionless. This was even further worsened by my father’s passing(and the need for me to be the pillar of support for my family)and me losing my dream job in a field that I’d waited for since I was a kid. I’m telling all of this just so you guys can understand where I’m coming from. All said,I’d turned into an emotional zombie,Emotions never existed for me except for anger. Everything else was stuffed into a pandora’s box and locked away.

All that changed when I met my girlfriend. I love her more than life itself,She’s the most mature,beautiful,smart,affectionate woman EVER and I see myself marrying her in the near future. She loves me just as much if not more and it’s HEAVILY evident in her words and actions.

Here’s where the problems start,Being in a relationship,As amazing as it is,It also has put me at odds with ALL my emotions.
Trust issues,Retroactive Jealousy,Hyper independence,Lack of emotional expression. These are the prime culprits.

She has never once given me a reason to not trust her,She has not once done or said anything that would justify all of these but then that’s where I ask for your help. I want to overcome all of these,I want to become a better man for her and MOST importantly,I do not want to hurt her while these things just take over my brain and stab it left right and centre. 

For example: We are going to be in a long distance relationship shortly for a year or so. She dislikes clubbing due to past experiences but obviously she cannot not ever go while she’s away with her new friends in a new place. I know myself and I’m fiercely loyal to the point I automatically zone out any other female trying to be anything more than a friend and she is the same too.
A part of me,And this has been the case for a while now,ONLY TRUSTS ME TO GET THE JOB DONE,Be it professional or personal,I don’t trust anyone but myself with an assigned task or work and take it all on me to complete it/see it through.
This has led to thoughts like “I know I’ can control myself even in the most sloshed states but I’m afraid she won’t be able to”
Whenever thoughts like these come up,I immediately activate a breathing exercise on my watch and just take deep breaths for 5 minutes,If it doesn’t work and puts me in a bad state of mind,I distract myself by doing my work,Hitting the gym. All in all I understand that these issues are a fight I’ve to fight myself and they can have me beaten to me knees but I’ll never let my girlfriend feel the brunt of it.

I’m asking all of you for help and advice on how to overcome all of this,I’m starting therapy soon but that aside I need any and all advice to overcome all of this because I will not be able to live with myself if I end up hurting her because of these things,And I NEVER will,Just need help to not let these things hollow me out.

"i’m [f20] currently in my first relationship [10 months] and my girlfriend [f20] and i are long distance during breaks from college. this time last year we were facetiming literally every day, good morning and goodnight texts, all of that. that was before we were official. i shared that i wasn’t sure if i wanted good morning/night texts to become the norm because i knew it would start a war inside my mind once they became less frequent. low and behold, same time this year comes around and even though we’re actually together, we’ve only facetimed once since we left school on the 7th.

i worry not only because of this but because her last relationship ended while they were separated due to a college break and she “lost interest.” i don’t want to be the next because it would absolutely tear me apart

"Heads up, this might be a long one!

My partner of nearly 3 years is being incredibly distant. We've always had a very good sex life, usually 3-4 times a week if not more, or in times when stress is high or work/life is busy it might drop to 1-2 a week. He also loves snuggles, so close snuggles at night and in the morning before getting up are a daily occurrence. He even used to have a snuggles alarm 15 mins before his actual alarm! He would always hig me when he got from work, little touches throughout the day, booty slaps etc. You catch my drift!

I have 2 kids from a previous 7M and 9F. 9F has some behaviour struggles mostly related to emotional regulation and anger management. She's also a neatly 10yo girl, so she can just be an arse at times! Her behaviour causes him a lot of stress. She raises her voice a lot, stamps, slams doors, gets pissy at the drop of the hat etc. He gets really frustrated with that, which I understand. I have firm boundaries with her, but when she's emotional or struggling I have a very firm belief that being calm and empathetic have just as much of a place as discipline and boundaries. I don't always get it right, and often will look back and think *'ah she played me there, she was just being a douche and I should've gone in with boundaries instead of kindness'* and vice versa. I'm human, and trying to do my best at this parenting lark! Their dad is very active in there lives, but OH also gets frustrated that he doesn't reprimand her behaviour adequately. She is basically the apple of her dad's eye and he excuses or brushes off her behaviour quite often.

A couple months back, both kids and my OH were home together for about 45 mins while I was travelling home from work. In that time, they managed to piss each other off, 9F demanded to call me and ended up taking OH phone. He followed her demanding it back, so she screamed and threw it (I *think* like a hot potato throw rather than malicious, but hard to know as I wasn't there. OH says one thing, she says another). The phone hit the TV and broke it. I could go on about the nuances of this situation (i think she was wrong and playing up, but i also think OH riles her up by being way too tough etc), but I'm just using it as an example. TV was bought by OH, I said I'd replace it, but ultimately we decided we had wanted to go TV free for a while anyway. OH was cross that kids dad didn't seem to make it a big deal, and didn't offer to replace the TV his kid smashed. So that's just an example of how and why OH gets frustrated.

It got to a point fairly recently that OH moved out for a week. He was pretty much decided that he wasn't coming back as he couldn't deal with her behaviour and doesn't believe that it will get dealt with, especially all the while dad isn't making as big of a deal about it as he should be. He wanted to have a live apart relationship, but I didn't feel the same so didn't agree to that. I was devastated, naturally, and trying to come to terms with letting him go. He ended up coming home and we talked and agreed to work on some things. I've been trying to sort out therapy for 9F which hasn't been easy, but was one of the things we agreed. I now have a referral through school, and just waiting to hear back from that.

In the last 2 weeks 9F lost great grandad and grandad (her dad's side). GG died, and grandad emigrated. She was obviously distraught. The day after waving off grandad, she came home from school in a crap mood. I knew why and tried to make the evening lovely. We decorated cookies, played games together etc. At bedtime, she started kicking up for seemingly no reason. OH went to chat with her, said something along the lines of it not being nice to come home from work to her always stamping and slamming around. That set her off, and she ended up screaming and shouting, then trashing her room. I was dealing with it, it was in full meltdown mode, to the point that for 30mins I was just restraining her. Called dad and he came straight over. She eventually burst into tears sobbing that everyone is leaving her. I believe that this outburst was to be expected. Yes, her emotional outbursts are extremely intense, but we know she struggles with big feelings. But she had also just lost two people very dear to her. Anyway, she went to have some quality time with dad for a couple days (as it was his fam, so kind of *their* shared grief iykwim). When she came back she was VERY rude to me, and at this point I made it very clear that I have a ton of empathy but I also have boundaries. She got a very firm talking to about this, and her behaviour has been better since.

Since the meltdown, OH has massively pulled away from me. He brought up being together but living separately again, and I reiterated that's not the kind of relationship I want but I respect his choices. He said he just needs time to think. He says its nothing to do with how he feels about me. Its been a couple of weeks, and he's not brought it up again. But he seems to have just gone stone cold on me. Doesn't hug me unless I ask or initiate, pulls away when I do hug him, has brushed off sex multiple times, and has now even stopped our usual evening/morning snuggle.

Things were *okay-ish* before this latest meltdown - I have definitely noticed for a while that he was less physical. I was having to initiate most physical contact, he didn't seem to notice me, and I don't really feel like a priority.

I do my best to take care of him and make him happy. I've always been the kind of person so tell him uplifting things like how proud I am of him etc. I cook pretty much every day, I keep a fairly clean house, I work part time around the kids, I pick him up little treats throughout the week, I listen and try to make sure I understand and adjust whebever he raises relationship issues with me, etc. I'm not perfect, but I try really hard. I tried to raise a few days ago that I'm feeling really unwanted and sad, and whilst I understand his need for space and time that doesn't make it hurt any less. He got frustrated and left the room and we haven't talked about it since. He's barely touched me since then. He says he's super tired, but I know his work has actually had a really really slow week and he's been having half days because they're getting ready to close up for Xmas.

Anyway, I feel like he's just holding out to get Xmas over with before telling me he's decided to leave. Its the kind of thing he'd do, not wanting to ruin Xmas for everyone... But it's actually just worse not knowing. I don't want to bring it up because I know he'll get frustrated that I'm pushing the matter (he's asked me not to push him on it), but equally it's driving me mad not knowing and making me feel pretty shitty that he's being so distant and cold.",Is my (35F) partner (34M) of nearly 3 years preparing to leave?,18ni58l,1703146851.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ni58l/is_my_35f_partner_34m_of_nearly_3_years_preparing/,
"I’m beginning to realize that my boyfriend of two years has some codependent tendencies and other qualities that we should compromise on or agree on if we want to keep things going. I want kids, he doesn’t, he is not religious, I am, and he is oddly against LDRs; if I propose studying or travelling solo abroad, he needs to find a way to come too. He tends to not mention his own needs or communicate his discomfort, and I am left feeling like I have taken advantage when I haven’t. It would not be healthy for me to stay, and I know this needs to end, but I am good friends with his mom and frankly, she is what I am most scared of losing. It is one thing to end something that is going to hurt both parties at some point and another thing to complicate a friendship. I don’t want to hurt anyone, I don’t want anyone to hate me.

"Hello, I wanna keep this relatively short, i would like to first say that I understand that not all women are like this, and that I was just very unlucky in my last relationship, however that doesn't change the fact that I am still just anxious to start dating again.
To sum up my last relationship, I knew my ex gf (f19) for almost her entire life, we weren't close most of the time but there were times where we were good friends. We finally decided to date and it was the happiest I had been in life. I would also like to say that she was my first legitimate gf. To make a long story short after almost a year of loving her and making her my top priority, I find out on vacation, less than a week before our 1 year anniversary, that she had been having sex with a guy that she had waited until he turned 16 to have sex with. Not only that, but she was dating him also, whilst dating me, and I found out that I was the ""secret relationship"" and that he had been posting her and she had been posting him on stories that I was blocked from (I never checked her phone I found it immature and trusted her). Not only was she dating him, but she also hooked up with someone I hate, random guys online, and the list goes on and on. I had to read messages of the love of my life telling other guys that she loved them, I saw pictures of them together, and she had been with at 8+ guys behind my back. When I went to block her she threatened to kill herself. And now a days she tells people that I abused her because so many people figure out. I never laid a hand on her, nor did I ever mentally abuse her. Anytime I would question her she would threaten to leave me. Since then I am way over her and I have lost over 100 pounds healthily to help myself mentally.

But even with me over her, I still find myself afraid to date anyone 2 years later, and often sabotage myself, nor do I try even tho I desperately want companionship again. I've had 1 FWB since her and it made my viewpoint on dating even worse tbh. I just wish I found it in me to date again, but feel like the anxiety of it happening again isn't worth it. I'm doing well right now without the stress of a relationship, but I feel so alone. Is it worth it to try and date again? Or should I wait until my other goals are complete?

"I'll keep this short. A bit of bckgrnd: my aunt is a good person with a heart of gold. She also has a flair for dramatics, tends to be quite negative, and regularly espouses ""woe is me""-type remarks like the world is out to get her and life is mostly shit. She can be critical and often has a ""why aren't people doing ABC or living life the rigid way within which I do"" approach to relatives' lives. (We've clashed a few times regarding this over the years. She'll start to yell, I go quiet and quietly tell her to knock it off and stop yelling at me for nothing, and then she somehow ends up mad.) Nonetheless, I love her, but I don't see her too frequently.

Recently she's been going through a distressing family situation. I've been there for her pretty much every day the last three months (messages, calls, etc), as you do when family is going through shyte. I've made sure to acknowledge her pain without offering platitudes. Several times over the last quarter I poured my heart into deep, meaningful messages, hoping they would make her feel held. 

Long story short, my partner sent her a nice but benign message the other week, and she proceeded to wax rhapsodic about how she hadn't received a message like that in the longest time, and that was when I was like, ""Wait, WTF?"" My husband acknowledged that it was odd bcos the content of his msg was more matter-of-fact than anything else. 

So now I'm feeling like my messages meant very little to her, and it's been making me sad and mildly resentful.

"a bit of a back story on our personalities. I am a calm and collected man with a 9-5 job that does not smoke, drink alcohol or sleep around. She is a energetic, fast paced, independent woman who works in nightlife entertainment which requires her to drink with patrons and go home with them. We met because of a mutual Dj friend and we both love music.

We agreed that she is not ready to commit to have a bf/gf relationship but she loves me and have a title is unnecessary. Due to her nature of work she earns at least 5-10 times more than me and spends money like water. She doesn't like luxury brands but she doesn't take care of things that she bought because she can just buy a new one.

I absolutely love her to death and I hope one day I earn enough where she can stop working and I can take care of her. Here is the problem, in order to keep up I have been spending alot of money as well. She is very emotional so I take an Uber to go over to her place during the midnight after she finish work and take Uber to work from her place. This takes a huge chuck of my money. 

Whenever she calls she asked if I want to come over and if I hesitate a little bit (I am usually groggy because I was asleep) she will be annoyed. And then when I said I booked Uber, she will say ""It's fine cancel it"" and will shout at me to cancel it. 

When we go to parties guys will come up to her and she will flirt back and entertain them. When girls flirt with me she gets mad and super jealous. I get jealous too its just that she is well know in the nightlife and we don't want to announce we are together, so I let it be. In the end of the day she still comes home with me.

and now comes new years and Christmas season. There are a few concerts that she wanted to go to and wants me to go with her. So I bought the tickets. She never settles for anything less than VIP. She wants to go to a music festival for a countdown which is super expensive and gets mad that I didn't make plans for New Years and Christmas. I have no more money for Christmas gifts or even dinner. Heck, I am eating instant noodles just so I can afford doing to her house whenever she calls.

I feels so lost with life. I feel like a failure. That I can't provide for her. I don't want to leave her. I never want to leave her. I used up all my savings and I am in credit card debt.

"2023 has opened my mind to many things lately. I’m very scared about the decisions that I want to make in the future (possibly breaking up with my bf). 

There’s nothing too crazy wrong with my boyfriend. He’s super nice and acts very loving. I was his first every girlfriend. It’s just that.. we’ve been dating for 7 years.. and I’m afraid that I am falling out of love unfortunately. I love him so much still and I want him to be happy. I’ve always wanted him to be happy so, this type of decision is scary for me. I don’t want to hurt him and at the same time I’m afraid of what my future lies. AND I live with him now (~5 months). 


Other reasons why I think I’m falling out of love: 

- Finance issues. Only recently, he found his “big boy” job but the pay is still pretty low (min wage).. compared to what I used to make and what I will be making soon (nursing student currently). 
- Half of the relationship wasn’t exactly how I wanted or expected because of certain financial issues he’s had. But I’ve stuck with it.
- Recently he has improved with gift givings and wanting to go on dates. But it feels like it’s too late now. 
- Most of the things that he say he would do for me seem unrealistic. Basically not a lot of action being done and it’s all talk. Or I know it’s going to take a lot longer (since it’s been already 7 years). 
- I’ve been loving myself more often and I’ve been enjoying my alone time a lot more since beginning of 2023. 
- He has improved slightly with gift giving but it still feels like he’s not really thinking of me. 

About my boyfriend: 
- He’s been assisting me with rent now for the first time since I’m a nursing student. I’m really thankful of that. But kind of makes subtle complaints.
- Friendly, loving, funny. Passionate (has goals) but again, doesn’t take much action in certain things. Takes a long time for him to learn and actually do things on his own. 
- Taking awhile for him to get his degree. He usually jumps into new goals and aspirations but, quits shortly or lose motivation. 
- Loves his family a lot. 
- I feel safe around him but not for sure if I could rely on him for certain things in life. 



Idk, what do you guys think? Am I being too much or asking for too much? Am I stupid or an a$$hole lol? I don’t want to make a mistake like possibly losing the “one.” Life improvements for us take so long.

"Had to repost because the last one got removed

This will be messy because I’m emotional right now. 

So, the situation is exactly what the title says. My boyfriend and I are long distance and have been together since June. He has had this girl bestfriend for a couple of years that he’s close with. They drink together, go to clubs together, stay at each other’s places alone, etc. and this has all been going on even since we became a couple. Sometimes he’d ignore me while they’re together and one time she got angry because he was messaging me while they were having dinner together. He says that it’s purely platonic and that there’s no attraction there whatsoever, which I forced myself to believe because I didn’t want to make him choose between us.

Anyways, we recently just came back from a trip together and it was amazing. On the plane ride home, I noticed he hadn’t updated me at all which ticked me off a little bit. That night, he called me up and said that he drove 2 hours to the coast of his country with the girl bestfriend. He explained that her brother died and she took the week off of work to mourn. Of course, I understood the situation but I couldn’t help feeling a little jealous.

A little more background, I’m usually the one making the effort to visit his country (18 hour flight away from me). When I’m with him, he always tells me to not expect dates or little trips because he doesn’t have time or money. But when I’m gone, he goes on these random out of town trips with the girl bestfriend and it started leaving a bad taste in my mouth. He also took her home to his family where people asked if she’s his girlfriend. He has never asked me to meet his parents even if he’s met mine twice. He even made a fuss about picking me up from the airport, but drove hours to drop her off and pick her up because “they had a fight” the night before (this happened multiple times).

Back to the story, he tells me that I need to understand the situation and that he won’t be so available for me anymore because he needs to be there for her. Since the holidays are coming up, I’m expecting that he’ll take her home to his family again.

I want to believe that it’s just a friendship, but I’m genuinely hurt by everything that has happened. I’ve tried to make friends with the girl in person, but she has never followed me anywhere on social media nor made any attempts to get to know me better. I don’t know what to do anymore, and I don’t want to be selfish in this situation because obviously she just lost her brother. 

What is the right thing to do in this situation? Please help me.


EDIT: I want to add that he’s always been the “non-jealous” type or at least that’s what he keeps telling me. I tried to have a serious conversation about our boundaries in the beginning of the relationship so we both knew how to respect each other, but he refused to participate in the conversation. He said we should both be free to do whatever, as long as we’re not cheating. 

But then, I posted a silly video of my cousin and I dancing on my Close Friends story (only 6 ppl in it) and there was a small part in the end where i’m twerking a little (fully clothed and i suck at dancing—which was the joke). He was LIVID and screenrecorded it then sent it to his family. He told me he was so disappointed and that I was an embarrassment. I was mortified that he’d sent it to his family. I told him only my cousins and him were able to view that story but he was still so angry that it was on the internet. He’s always really mean to me when he’s angry, so I just promised not to do it again. 

Anyways, I’m just confused because I never tell him what to do with his life nor do I control how much he sees his girl bestfriend—- but he’s allowed to get angry because he’s jealous when I post little dance videos to a very small and trusted group of people?

"What is more weak, and emasculating??


Staying in a relationship where every time my wife is upset she tells me she hates me, doesn’t want to be with me, emasculates me, etc.

"So, my girlfriend and I have been dating since the summer, for about 5 months. We actually went on a single date back at the beginning of the year, thought it went okay, then moved along from there. We reconnected later in the year and have been dating exclusively since we started talking again!

We share so many of the same hobbies, get along really well when we're together, and honestly I really do enjoy my time with her. The issue is me, I think. Normally, I do take a very long time to develop strong, deep, emotional connections with romantic partners. I tend to fall in love after about a year or maybe a little more. But the feelings are always there.

The issue is, right now, I think the romantic feelings are fleeting. Part of this honestly I think is because I've really grown the past few years into a pretty self-assured and confident person, but as sweet as she is, she is very down on herself and needs constant reassurance to the point of I think driving me away from the relationship emotionally. I feel I spend so much of the relationship making sure she's feeling okay rather than, well, getting to spend real quality time together.

We've had discussions about this, but normally it kind of spirals into her getting really down on herself and panicking because she's had some (admittedly) horrific abandonment in the past by long-term partners. That being said, I can't control how I feel. I also can't take the semi-regular sessions of her panicking that I'm ghosting her or similar behavior if I don't happen to text back as quick as she'd like, or saying I deserve someone great because she's ""worthless"". I feel more like a parent sometimes than a partner. Maybe that has influenced why I feel the way I do now.

Here's the kicker though. I've never been in this spot before. I've broken off casual dating with partners before in shorter relationships. And I know 5 months isn't long, but I've never been the one to fall out of feelings first in a relationship where both people decided to be exclusive or more specifically a couple. And even the scenarios where I've been broken up with, they were 4+ years into those relationships, so there was a lot of ""here it comes"" feelings before.

I don't really know how to approach this, it's not something I've done before. We also have a 5 day trip planned in a few weeks alongside a concert she bought tickets for us both. I feel really bad, I've never experienced the other side of falling out of feelings before. I'm growing some serious new empathy for my past partners when they broke up with me.

"I want to start by saying this is based on true events in my life. I tried posting from my other account but I got a bot message saying I needed to have ThrowRA in my username???

For context, I’ve felt this way for a couple months. I’ve caught him messaging an ex (a different one each time twice within the past year). The convos were inappropriate like discussing missing each other, comments regarding each other’s body’s, etc. When confronted, he told me he loves me and only does these things to be “an asshole” after huge arguments. Am I being gaslit? Anytime I try to bring it up now, he acts like I’m bringing it up to “hurt him / try to start an argument”. When it’s really just an insecurity that I get, &amp; the most recent time I caught him was two months ago.

Currently, we are both in different states of the country(US) for the upcoming holiday. My parents are from South Dakota while his family lives in Indiana. He’s being dry in his conversations with me, and has only told me he “loves me” once in the 24 hours we’ve been apart. I don’t feel loved, and I’ve brought it up to him. He makes “changes” for a few days then he’s back to his normal ways. We have sex somewhat regularly (every 2-3 days). 

He’s also a gamer, and when he’s playing he doesn’t want me around. I get it…he’s playing his game but he will straight up tell me “leave me alone”, “don’t bother me”, etc. I go to bed alone some nights because he’s up playing his game. I feel alone. I don’t know what else to do, and it seems communication isn’t working.

"TLDR: After a breakdown my girlfriend's attitude suddenly has changed towards me. Her mental health is getting worse, mentioned suicide, refusing help and now wants to break up. What do I do? 

Hi reddit, never had to do anything like this before but here goes.

A few months ago I met a girl and she's the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love her more than any previous relationship which is crazy in such a short period of time but I can't help it. Up until this month everything was going great. 

Now I need to provide you with context before we go any further. Sadly, my girlfriend has already lost both of her parents. He father passed a few years ago from cancer and her mother died very unexpectedly towards the start of the year. She has quite a large extended family but doesn't see them as she moved out her of hometown to where she is now (where we met). She does live with her sister though but her sister is in an absolutely insane amount of debt due to poor trading decisions and refuses to admit her problem, only making it worse. On top of this, she is currently working on releasing music as she is an incredibly talented musician.

About a month ago, as we were laying in bed together, she had a breakdown in front of me. She told me that she finally got given her mother's life insurance but was going to have to use it to pay off a small part of her sister's debt. She told me about how lonely she has been, how everyone she's ever had has left her or hurt her and how hard she finds it to open up or trust new people. She was a crying mess but I calmed her down quickly cause I know how to. I don't think I can ever fully understand how she feels about this as it's such a horrible situation for her to be in, but I try my best to and try my best to help as much as I can.

After this breakdown, she almost immediately became more reserved with me over message. In person it seemed fine but that has been a more gradual change. Over text, she stopped calling me pet names, asking how I was doing or what I was up to, and getting annoyed when I would ask about her. I put this down to what she said about finding it hard to trust people, being scared that she had really opened up to me and that it was due to work which she was (and still is) very busy with. She told me in person that everything is a lot right now and that she needed time and space, which I was happy to give her. We stopped messaging as regularly and the conversation got a lot harder, but when we got time between work to see each other in person it all seemed fine. We stopped going out as much and she preferred to stay home and relax which I didn't really mind. At this point I could sense that something was a little wrong. Yet at the same time I realized I loved her, and told her that. You shouldn't keep that emotion inside. After this, she started to say things that were quite hurtful towards me. Telling me that she is usually very affectionate towards her partner, despite a sudden lack of it towards me. Saying that she hates the idea of dating a foreigner (we come from different countries) and doesn't know if she has the patience for it, despite the fact I'm trying to learn the language as fast as I can for her and her saying it was no issue at the start. Telling me that she used to like me more in the past and that she suddenly doesn't feel safe or comfortable with me. And suddenly referring to ""us"" as nothing which is frankly ridiculous. Obviously this was hurting me, but after her breakdown and with work I knew she wasn't coping very well so I let it pass knowing it was more than likely a defense mechanism. Yet in person, things were still fine. She was quite affectionate, happy, apologised for saying those things above the next time we would meet after saying it. She did maintain that some things were still a big issue (mainly the foreigner part as she is finding it hard to explain herself not in her mother tongue, although she is basically fluent, which I understand and want to work on together.)

Finally, on Monday we had our Christmas together (we can't spend it together because I'm out of town). It was wonderful. We got each other great, meaningful gifts. She cried with happiness. We ate together, we did puzzles together, made plans for when my family visits in a few months time and she slept in my arms. When we awoke she opened up some more, telling me how she felt like she was a bad person, the worst person on earth and how she considered suicide after her mother's death this year. I told her I would never leave her and told her how much I loved her. Everything seemed okay. I drove her home that night and we chatted like normal, she squeezed by hand extra tight, called me pet names and we shared a loving kiss and hug goodbye. Pretty normal.

The next day, she could barely talk to me. No signs of affection whatsoever, even flat out ignoring me. I called her about it last night and she told me she wanted to stop. She said she feels like the worst person in the world, the worst version of herself and how she cannot trust me because everyone always dies, fucks her over or leaves her. It truly broke my heart. I begged her not to, knowing that she is trying to defend herself but she told me she isn't okay with constantly hurting me whilst her mental health is so bad and getting worse. We left things in a grey area, with her saying she wants to stop and me saying I would give her a lot more time and space to try and work through this. I don't know if we're still together or not. I'm worried about her. What do you make of the situation? And what should I do moving forward?",My (M27) quite new girlfriend (F27)'s mental health seems to be spiraling and now she wants to break up with me.

Most times people can’t make it and I end up scraping everything. This was what it was like in grade school, high school, and now university.

"We both are in graduate school and dated for going on ~6 months, but about 3 months before the start of our relationship his parent passed away unexpectedly. 

I entered the relationship knowing what I was signing up for, I have been exposed to a lot of death and grief and I was prepared to be a support system. Things were going really well for the first few months - we both were busy but made time to see each other a couple times a week. 

Fast forward to a month ago - I felt ready to say finally say “I love you”, he said it back, and we both seemed happy. We continued to say it to each other every day up until a couple days before the break up. 

Then our semester ended last week and it was like a switch flipped in him. He realized he was facing his first holiday season without his dad and suddenly didn’t have school to distract him. He’s decided we need to break up because he wants to be “selfish” and to solely focus on himself and his needs right now. 

I completely understand why he made the decision he did. He said we can have a conversation in a month and maybe try to be friends (something I usually don’t do but I have a lot of respect for him). 

My problem is - I can’t get it out of my head that our story isn’t over. It just feels surreal because there wasn’t any lies or deception or anger - we never had a single fight and everything was always filled with understanding. I have so much love for him and want desperately to know if there’s any chance of a future down the road. I know only time can tell but any words of wisdom is appreciated. I don’t know how to handle a breakup where neither of us did anything wrong and it ended in so much respect. I would like to know if anyone has advice on how to be realistic about this?

And yet, I can't seem to climax no matter what we try.

And don't get me wrong he's not bad and he is not small. I feel useless. Perhaps I have a low sex drive? i can go weeks or even months without touching myself because it's always felt like a chore. But when I met him, it was like I needed it every day to survive.

"Hey guys! I'm really struggling here. The start of the relationship has been the last year, we tried dating but she was really into her studies so we stopped. She came back to me this year's September/October, and it was good, we did lots of sex chats and everything, but I just didn't feel satisfied at all, I don't know why, but she didn't compliment me at all, when it came to flirting and affirmations, it was really just nothing. She had only heard my voice by that time, and she had told me that she found my voice really hot. So I thought, okay, maybe its because she hasn't met me.

Everyone talks about the love languages here, but no one talks about the love language of voice, she finds my voice very sexy and that's all she needs. She's getting her needs met but I was dying to get one single affirmation. The feeling of being unappreciated became so bad I had to breakup with her.

Fast forward to December, we tried this again, this time meeting each other, and it was great, I had a great time, she was gorgeous, the most fun, loving hot woman I've ever seen, and we made out lots, she was plenty wet, but, again, the moment I left the car, I realized that I wasn't fulfilled by physical touch, like it was great, making out was the best, but I don't feel like I got what I had wanted.

Meeting was an important and anxious step for us because we both knew it could be that we don't feel physically attracted to each other at all and that she just finds my voice sexy, but here she's wet and won't leave me alone, so I know she is physically attracted to me. She's getting her love language met, which is, voice, touch, and I have told her thousands of times that and broke up with her for it before that I feel really unappreciated and I feel insecure, I don't want anyone else to call me hot, I don't want anyone else to call me cute, I don't want anyone else to say I love you, I miss you and I am eager to see you again and more words like these, I want HER to say it, but she just, doesn't.

So as a solution, I thought, hey, maybe she isn't getting chances to catch on, so I started using phrases which she can reply to, such as, ""Mhm, well, I'm not hot to you anyways, right? Because you like big forearms so much"", or ""I don't think you find me cute anyways"", but she just goes pitch silent, which makes me feel even more insecure.

I do not find this to be a self esteem issue, because I don't want validation from anyone else but her.

She understood that things are going serious again so she put a few sweet words here and there, and now they just feel like she's forcing it, I don't want forced words. I feel jealous how my other friends have girlfriends showering them with compliments, affirmations and the way they talk to each other, they try to make everything sound like they're taking on every opportunity to turn a normal convo into something they can compliment their men or women for. But man, I'm so upset about this, damn.

She was born in a very boyish surrounding, all her cousins and brothers were boys and she hung out with boys all the time and acts like boys, I've tried telling her to take small steps to improve but nothing, seriously, nothing from her.

And now yesterday, I blasted, she refused to send me pictures of her to me, it was like my inner anger was waiting for a moment, and this was the moment. I cut the call and just didn't call her. I don't want to leave her, I want to find every way I can to fix this.

I told her today about it, and she seems shocked, like we were good yesterday and today you're not. Like she has been getting everything she wants to feel loved and I get none, and when my bubble bursts, she complains why my bubble burst. After tons of talks already done about this.

"How donI deal with resent in my relationship?

Me (23) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for a year and some change. We’ve known each for 7 after meeting on a “dating” app back in middle school, we spoke on and off through the years but never maintained  steady communication (talking for a few at a time, when we weren’t in our own relationships). We met for the first time after I had become homeless after my mothers passing. She messaged me randomly asking how I was doing and I told her the situation. She brought me in and got me a job with her, we started dating 2 weeks later and it felt like true love. 

After a few months of living with her in a small town, we found a place in a large city. Rent was much higher so we got new jobs. She became a waitress and I became a cable tech (still am). After around 6 months I started to get better at my job, making $1700 a week. She decided to go to beauty school and work at the restaurant part time because I had money. One major issue I started having with the relationship was about money, she barely made anything and I often paid all the bills. I stuck through it in the hopes of her making decent money after she got her license.

Fast forward 6 months. She finished school and got a job at waxing place. Our lease was ending so we found a new duplex to rent in October. We drained both of our bank accounts moving. I started making a lot less money due to the season. She started to get her first checks and they came in at $800 biweekly. I became very stressed about the lack of money, on top of the stress from working 60 hours a week for a year straight at this point. 

Our relationship took a turning point after the new move, my stress levels were at an all time high.  For context I have always been a very anxious and depressed person (more so after my mothers passing) with a nihilistic view of the world, but I was happy when we first got together and for many months after. She knew of my issues and assured she would always support me. The stress that built up throughout the relationship put me back into a depressed state of mind. The vision of a happy future I originally thought we would have, began to fade away. 

I should note that she also has become a more negative person throughout our time together. She has no hobbies at home and her only interests are me, and stuff related to beauty (makeup, skincare, etc.). While I do anything alone, she sits in bed on her phone. I have tried to find find common interests but she does care for anything I suggest. When we hang out at home, we sit in bed and play on our phones. Sometimes we watch tv but rarely can find anything we both like. This is important to know for the next major issue.

Since the move in October I have been spending a lot of my free time playing games. It is my only hobby and one I’m very passionate about. It is my only real escape in life and I’ve explained that to her since we started dating. There was instance in the beginning of November where I played for about 4 hours a night for 3 nights in a row. Work was especially terrible that week and I needed to decompress. The first two nights I explained that I needed the time alone and she eventually complied but was unhappy. The third night she became very mad, telling me she feels like a roommate and that I never want to be around her. I tried to explain that I need time to myself especially during this time, and that laying around and doing nothing was mentally torture. She wouldn’t have it and said I needed to make sacrifices for her if I really loved her. After that, I started to resent her slightly, I have have sacrificed so many hours working so that she could go to school and get a cozy job she enjoyed. I explained that too her, and also told her she needed a hobby as well. She saw that as an attack and the relationship has struggled since. She refuses to understand how I feel, I know she gets lonely when I’m not upstairs but I shouldn’t have to be her only outlet. We have had around 4 fights about me playing my games. Each time I grow more distant. I feel like this beyond repair, she refuses to listen to my logic. I understand how she feels but I cannot bring myself to want to be around her, she has voiced concerns in way that makes me feel scared of the future. Maybe I’m wrong in this situation. I’m writing this while sleeping on the couch, after another argument so please excuse the sloppy post. I would greatly appreciate any advice and will answer any question about the relationship.

"I am 34F, met a guy ~45M at an interest group meet up recently. He’s been in that field much longer (I am a newbie) so he offered to chat more about it separately to provide a bit of guidance. Not being more specific what the interest group is just in case he is on here.

We met up once over lunch for 1.5 hours in the middle of a work day - just sat on a park bench with our own food. He wanted to share about his own dilemmas and get my input on it (not sure why my input would be that helpful given I’m so new). Some things I noticed: he kept talking over me; he asked a question which would have revealed my address, but then immediately realised I might not want to do that so he called it out and said I don’t need to answer. That all seemed fine, so when he said afterwards we should meet up again I was open to it. 

Since then, all via text: he said on a Friday night that we should meet the next morning. I said I wasn’t free that weekend, and suggested another work day lunchtime instead. He said that wouldn’t be enough time to properly chat, so I suggested ‘maybe’ after work on a certain day (which I regret). He said fine then he questioned two more times if I really couldn’t meet that weekend. I was pretty uncomfortable about being pressed on this. I said I couldn’t. 

The day before that day I said ‘maybe’ about, he texted to ask if I’d like to meet. I didn’t reply because busy at work and after work meet up with friends - and still also uncomfortable about being questioned about the weekend. So he messaged again the day of (today) to ask if I’d like to meet.

I still haven’t replied. Not sure if I’m overreacting. If this was a dating context it would be straightforward to communicate that I don’t wish to meet again. But this is a community interest group so I really don’t want to make things awkward. I could say I’ll see him at the next catch up (happens on an ad hoc basis a small number of times a year) but that seems awkward because just after the last meet up I had agreed to meet up again.

"Hi guys, so me and my boyfriend moved in together about 2 months ago and things have been going really well. We moved about 3 hours away from friends and family to experience something new together. My boyfriend goes and visits his family about every other week, which I feel is a lot but it’s important to him so I don’t say anything about it. 

Tonight, after he just got back from visiting his family, he told me he wants to spend New Year’s Eve with his family back home and wanted me to come. I told him I couldn’t because of the dogs (I have two very anxious dogs and the fireworks scare them immensely and they aren’t allowed at his family’s house back home). I also have no one to watch them who I trust unfortunately. 

He plans on leaving me by myself on New Year’s Eve, which felt pretty bad honestly. It would be our first New Years together and i expected him to want to spend it with me, but now I know he plans on being gone and leaving me by myself. 

Am I over reacting? How do I talk to him about this?

"Hello! Thank you in advanced! 💗

I’m sure I’m making a big deal out of things…maybe? For the last 6 months I have been urging my partner to go get tested. 

I recently had to get a physical exam for school and did a whole blood pannel and it included STI testing. After seeing my results I thought it would be nice for my partner to get tested too! I’ve mentioned this before hand as well. 

He has made no moves to do so.

Context: 

Been together for 3 years and we are intimate. Being so young we’ve both only ever had one partner before each other. Both carrying around the ignorance that “we are probably clean” since our sexual histories weren’t really extensive. (I know that it only takes one partner to get something, but the environment my partner and I grew up in. STI weren’t really a worry.) 

When I got my STI results back, everything was negative as expected. So I understand if he’s like well if ur negative then so am I…but that’s not true is it? 

Idk I think it’s good to just have ur OWN results. Also he tells me that he  is a bit nervous bc he apparently hasn’t had his blood drawn since he was a child. Which is alarming to me tbh (is that normal). But I understand his hesitation since blood draws can be scary.

Either way, I’ve mentioned it and mentioned it and mentioned it. He says he’ll do it, but he doesn’t. I’m tired. I’m just gonna see how long he goes without doing it. Truth be told, I “know” he’s probably negative. Like I’m not worried for his results but I could be wrong??? Who knows! 

We’re long distance sooo I might just stop having sex with him. Should I communicate that I’m not going to have sex with him until he gets tested? Or should I just not say anything until the sexy moments appear and just say no? I’ve talked about it so much already….

Or…am I doing too MUCH! 😭💀

Please be kind ✨💗

So I have been in a relationship for almost 3 years now (20m) and something happened tonight that made me worried.

I went out with a few friends of mine for a birthday party, it was getting late so I had my friend drive me back to his place where my car was. I came in for a few to chat and catch up. When we were talking my legs gave out because I had hit the gym the day before. So he offered to stretch it out for me, not thinking it would lead to anything bad, I said why not. He's studying to be a physical therapist so I trust him to do these things. So he is helping me do certain stretches to make me feel better but as he's helping me, I get this wave of uncomfortable feelings and want to leave. I quickly get up and tell him I need to go, but he offers to stretch my glutes out. I deny and quickly leave.

I love my partner so much and see myself being with him for the rest of my life. I couldn't possibly think of anyone I want to engage sexually or emotionally with. When he offered I didn't have any intention of doing anything inappropriate or intimate with him. Should I tell my partner about what happened, im worried he'll see it as cheating. Is it? Or was it that his intentions were wrong and because I left right away, I did the right thing? Please help:(

Edit: We talked about it and he doesn’t blame me for anything that happened and we’re good. he’s upset with the other guy that instigated all of this. thank you for all your kind words and advice:)",I’m worried F20 that something that happened tonight might make my partner M20 not trust me,18nhd02,1703143629.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nhd02/im_worried_f20_that_something_that_happened/,
"To start things off and to avoid confusion I’m gay and so is the man I’ve been seeing. 

I met this man online, let’s call him Adam, back in November. Since then we’ve spoken nearly every day (usually text though we do call) and have been on 2 dates. I have not seen him this month yet. He is currently pursuing an advanced degree and has been very busy with final exams. Im working full time and am currently on vacation abroad so between our schedules there has been no time to meet up. 

We’re on the same page about what we’re looking for (a relationship). We’ve had numerous conversations about what we want in a partner and all the meeting someone for the first time questions (love language, sexual preferences, etc). We are both relatively inexperienced with dating, him only having one relationship prior, and me having none though I came close a few times. The catch is things have been moving very slowly. In my past situationships things progressed faster, there was more passion, we flirted, told each other those sweet nothings. I’m not talking about sex  here either- we have not and I don’t have a problem with that (he only really has sex inside of a relationship). It’s all the other things people say to each other when they like each other. 

I’m left feeling confused. On one hand he’s still here and hasn’t said anything about not being interested. He’s open to seeing each other again and we’ve loosely planned for when I’m back. On the other hand it’s so slow and there’s none of that passion, we haven’t really had a heart to heart or any deeper conversation about us.

All of my past experience was when I was in school which allowed for much more flexibility. The fact that we’ve only seen each other twice in 2 months boggles my mind and honestly is something I would take as a bad sign under normal circumstances. 

I need a new perspective on this. I need to be grounded and hopefully gain some clarity. Is this normal for dating as an adult? Do I have my head in the clouds with my expectations?

He checks a lot of boxes for me and I could see things going further if we get this vulnerability hurdle out of the way. It’s something I absolutely need in a relationship and I will not catch feelings without it.

"so i’ve been seeing this girl for a couple of months and i like her a lot . this is the first time i’ve ever done this , but it isn’t hers . i can’t lie i really really like her , and she really likes me , but the problem is that i’m a university student from europe currently doing their year abroad in the us and will be leaving the country in may .  i do not at all want to do a long distance relationship so i’m stuck on what we are going to do when i have to go home .

anyway , a couple of weeks ago we were in bed and she had just finished with me but i didn’t manage to finish ( this is normal for me , she’s only made me cum once from our 10 or so times together ) . i told her to stop because i was struggling to stay hard and her arm was hurting a lot . we lied back and talked for a bit where i eventually explained to her how i couldn’t get into a relationship because i was going back home and didn’t want to do anything long distance . she said it was okay and that she understood .

but about 15 minutes later after i had turned around to be the little spoon i heard her crying which killed me inside . i asked what was wrong and if it was about what i had said , but she insisted that it was because she didn’t make me finish . i did not believe this because that has never happened before in the other times she didn’t make me finish . i comforted her and we fell asleep shortly after , and we haven’t talked about her crying since .

it’s been on my mind ever since and we have just become closer and closer since . if i was permanently living in the us i would absolutely have asked her to be my girlfriend by now . i am just very stuck on what to do here .

i fear that if we keep spending more time together but as “friends” then when i have to move away i am going to be very very sad and i don’t want that !!! should i ask her to be my girlfriend ? was she even lying about what she was crying about ?? i really don’t know what to do .",she (f19) started crying after i (m20) told her i couldn’t be in a relationship but then blamed it on something else ?,18nhawl,1703143383.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nhawl/she_f19_started_crying_after_i_m20_told_her_i/,

I ask him where it is, he said it’s in a closet. I checked that closet and it’s not there. I asked him to check himself in case I missed anything. Nothing.

I genuinely am attracted to all of him and deep down he is insecure about himself being on the smaller side. 

Multiple times a day he’s been saying how he would find me more attractive if I lost weight. He said that me being my size makes him “uncomfortable”. Note that I’ve haven’t changed weight/size since I’ve met him. I was shocked &amp; hurt by his statement to the point I cried so hard that I threw up. He always reminds me during the times of the day I’m doing nothing I should be doing something to work on my body. 

He told me as of rn I’m a 7/10 but if I lose weight I’d easily be a 10/10.

(Excuse me for my bad English)

Soo there was that one time I was playing online on January 2023, I met a girl and we played a really nice match and after that she sent me a friend request, I accepted and started playing everyday just as teammates, days after days we started to know each other and became friends, after few months I really liked her and I felt she liked me back and finally admitted to her that I love her and she said she loves me back that was on March if my memory doesn’t betray me.
We kept texting, sharing our day and playing online at the end of the day after work, our relationship became strong in a short time but she decided on April to be just friends because she felt our relationship wont make it.
But I insisted that I really love her and I will be loyal to her no matter what and I tried two times to make her change her mind but she refused but one day on May she changed her mind after she realized that I’m a good man for her and our relationship became stronger than anytime. she was my soulmate.

On 24 June we arranged to meet up in real life she is 160KM away, we arranged everything and met her the other day 25 June (we met 5 more time after that day) We spent a really good day, but ended up she wanted to drive my car and my car is really expensive, she said “Don’t worry I can drive” but ended up crashing it and costed me $3500 to fix it, I spent really bad days after the crash cuz I couldn’t do my job and that had me problems however I forgave her about it and the money comes and goes and I forgot about it. 

But the thing is and this is the reason I’m posting here, She was sexting with another guy on 27 June that was 2 days after We met (But I just found out 3 days ago from now), at that time I was really sad about the crash, I was borrowing money to fix my car, I had my schedules and meetings but couldn’t do it and I had real problems, at that time she said she felt comfortable to me after we met and we are soulmates, she was trying to make me feel better (cuz of the crash) but at the same time she was in another guy’s chat sexting with him.

That guy knew her before me in 2022 I guess but she said they didn’t make it and they weren’t even in a relationship and he is the one that left her and he really treated her bad, Despite that she kept him, she kept his Number, WhatsApp and messenger. 

After I found out (3 days ago like I said above) I really can’t forgive her, I feel broken, betrayed and destroyed. I feel like I’m an idiot. She was the first love of my life. I couldn’t believe she would do such a thing like that to me, she was like an angel to me.

I blocked her on everything you can imagine, she called me from her sister’s phone and her female friend’s phone, she kept apologizing and she would never do that again and she regretted it.

I’ve been in a long distance relationship for a long time( almost four years now? ). It’s been full of ups and downs and despite being long distance I fell in love with him. Truly. 

While he suffers mentally I do really appreciate everything despite our issues. However these lasting issues from both sides has made it increasingly hard for me to see a positive outcome. 

While I love my time with him, and I know I’ve made mistakes, as he. I’m at the point where I feel that it’s doing more harm to him than good. The longer we hold on to something falling apart the more is going to hurt when it finally collapses.

I know that he says I’ll never break up with me, but when I tell him “I haven’t seen you happy with me,” I’m told there’s too many issues in the relationship. And we just need to fix it all. Don’t get me wrong I want to fix everything, and I’ve been trying to fix what he tells me to but 

There’s so much emotional investment in fixing it, where I don’t believe there’s a relationship left. I feel like I’ve appreciated the little moments growth have had but it’s not what works for the relationship. Most issues include me not making him feel loved enough to be happy with him, that I’m too comfortable almost. While I’ve been trying my best to make him feel loved, it’s not making him feel any better. 

He often says that he doesn’t want to have wasted his time on a relationship for so long, so he wants to come to fruition. While I don’t think it would ever be time wasted from all the happy moments, I’m thinking to myself how much the bad memories are start to over crowd the happy ones. 

I’m not sure if there’s ever been a point in my life where I haven’t been able to fix something, I’m  starting to feel like after over a year of fixing things… should I let someone go?

If this how it is for so long, I’m a supposed to follow the saying if you “love something let it go,”

"My boyfriend of 6 months would constantly bring up how really pretty one of his ex-girlfriends is. It got to the point where he’d mention how pretty she was every day for a week or more. I’ve never even asked about any of his exes; he’d say this all by himself. And he would almost never compliment me, unless it’s about my body (private parts). Eventually, I got tired of hearing it and told him it made me really insecure and to stop. And even after I asked him to stop, he eventually started bringing up how pretty she is again. So I asked him what he thinks about how I look compared to her, and he said she’s way prettier, like she’s a 9 and I’m more like a 7.5 in prettiness. This upset me, but he tried convincing me that a 7.5 is good. When I asked what he liked about me, he said he liked spending time with me and that I liked anime and video games. Then he told me personality and looks aren’t the number one thing he’s looking for anyway.

She isn’t the only ex he’d talk about, but the other one he’d mostly say bad things about. He did call that ex pretty a few times too, but he said the really pretty one was always his most attractive ex. To be fair, he did seem to talk more about the ex, who he talked badly about, if that matters.

He does say he likes the way I look, but it does feel pretty empty. And it’s even worse that he hinted that even my personality isn’t that great by saying both looks and personality aren’t a priority to him.

After he saw some pictures of her, he said she looks way worse than he remembered and is not even that attractive. She went from being a 9/10 to a 7/10. I honestly don’t even think it’s possible to misremember someone that much (it’s been 2 years). Now he’s trying to reassure me that I always looked way better than her and that he just misremembered her, and I’m the best-looking person he’s been with. I honestly don’t care if he does or doesn’t think his ex is better looking; it’s just the fact that he was always bringing it up.

"Hey, so my boyfriend and I have recently been talking about our future together and it's really forced me to shine a spotlight in the problems in our relationship and this is definitely the biggest one.

My boyfriend is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met, and he treats me like an absolute princess. I'm so grateful to have him, but at the same time, he starts arguments out of thin air, about anything and everything, all the time. We can't seem to have one day where we don't argue about something, and the thing is, he always says he's ""not trying to start an argument"" but he always does. And apparently he doesn't really classify anything as an argument, so when I mention that I'm getting stressed out over our conversations, he claims that it wasn't an argument to begin with. I could say ""the sky is blue"" and he'd find a reason to disagree and nitpick at what I said. 

I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be so negative, I might be a little emotionally charged because I just sent him something cool and it started something, but I don't know if I can handle this type of thing for the rest of my life.

Again, he treats me so well. Better than I've ever been treated, but does that mean we're meant to be together? I don't know.. Our senses of humor and conversation styles (very important things to me) don't match up but our plans for the future (also very important) do.

I appreciate any advice ❤️

"I’ve been hooking up with this girl for 2-3 months in college. We get along very well and she sleeps over pretty often. I would definitely consider dating her and probably would be by now if it weren’t for this problem. 
 The dilemna is that I am going to London for a semester. We live very far from each other in the states so could not see each other over summer. Then she goes to europe the following semester so we will not see each other again for a year. I do truly like her but 2-3 months is way too short to then commit to a one year, long distance relationship. We text all day though and clearly have feeling for each other. Is there a way I can communicate that I would like to keep talking to her but not date her due to the commitment of being away for a year. My end goal would be to keep in touch text once or twice a day like I do with my friends and then pickup where we left off in a years time? Is there anyway to go about this without sounding like a dick. I’m already pretty bad with my words so that does not help.

I (19F) and my boyfriend (19M) have only been dating for a little bit now, but he is starting to display some qualities that I don’t think I like. I have started to feel like the “man” or the protector in the relationship and that’s not the role i want to be playing…

I know I sound like an asshole for saying this but he is too nice. He always is using various pet names with every. single. sentence. he says. He also always changes his opinions to agree with me. Everytime we have a small or big disagreement he starts out with one opinion and then slowly begins to contradict himself to agree with me and act like it was his idea all along. I would like for my partner to be able to stick to their own opinions where we can have natural interesting conversations, (it feels like i’m talking to myself considering he always just agrees with me).

Also everytime I get sick he always gets the same symptoms shortly after. For example, the other day I had to start a new medicine and took it w/o eating and got violently nauseous. I asked him to come lay down with me because this might sound needy, but I wanted my partner to take care of me (which i feel like isn’t abnormal) and the whole time he was continuously asking me why i wasn’t giving him attention even though i specifically told him i was very sick. he then goes on to say that he almost threw up earlier from not eating. also the other day i had a panic attack and he then the next day says he has a panic attack (he has never voiced having an issue with anxiety before) EVERY TIME i have an issue he states to have the exact same issue to where i have to focus on his problems and forget my own. and when i got good grades on my finals i texted him excitedly about it and he immediately starts one upping me by telling me about his better grades and completely dissmisses me and oneups me i cant decide if this stems from a self-esteem issue or what…

additionally, whenever there is any issue whether that’s me/my friend me/him or him/his friend. he gets so worked up over the littlest things and starts crying. he once told me “you can’t come to me with your issues because i can’t handle big emotions like this” if there is any problem i have to put all of my emotions aside and calm him down. the littlest thing puts him in a bad mood and then he starts legitimately pouting like a little kid

he also asks me maybe 5 times per day if i still love him or he will make comments like “you don’t even like me” or you don’t find me attractive anymore” and it really really bothers me. 

also, everytime we have an argument he starts to throw himself a pity party and says things like “yep i’m always the mean one” or will start crying and say that i hurt his feelings because i blame everything on him (which genuinely is not true) but i feel like i should be able to bring up when something bothers me or hurts my feelings without him crying and making me feel guilty about even bringing it up in the first place

I feel like an asshole for thinking all these things about him. How should I bring it up? Or do we sound just too incompatible? Help!!

TLDR: My boyfriend mirrors my opinions in order to appease me, and everytime i have an issue he miraculously is going through the same issue, he also cannot handle any “big” emotions",I 19F am having issues with my boyfriend 19M.. he is overly sensitive and “too nice” and maybe a hypochondriac?,18ngmwi,1703140843.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ngmwi/i_19f_am_having_issues_with_my_boyfriend_19m_he/,

Should I block?

Hi,
I met a guy on Omegle almost 2 months ago. We talked for 3 hours straight, essentially about everything. We both showed a lot of interest in one another and exchanged our socials to further get to know each other. We talked for about 2 weeks before finally meeting up, almost like a date of sort. The thing is, this man is beautiful, like so good-looking that people would come up and ask if he was a model. He literally got scouted by a model agency on our first date 💀. We only held hands and exchange greeting hugs on our first date. He even posted a picture of our dinner with a tag of my name on his Instagram story, I did the same but didn’t tag him (cuz yk you gotta keep pretty men for yourself 😭). We continued talking for 2 months, going on about 3 more dates. He live an hour away from me but he never fails to make that as an excuse to drive down and see me. We kissed on the 2nd date but haven’t done anything more than that since then, like we don’t even talk about it. Now…this man sound perfect, no? Handsome, oh did I mention rich?, and a gentleman. Here’s the thing though, our communication is really bad…We take hours to respond to each other and honestly it’s such a turn-off that sometimes I just wanna block this guy. We don’t call, and he doesn’t even care to watch any of my Instagram stories. Ok, one may say that this is because he isn’t active on socials but let me tell you, he would post stuff on his Instagram before responding to me. It’s kinda like he is active but just don’t want to respond. We don’t even flirt when we text like it’s very minor flirting and we never talk about anything deep like our feelings or our experiences. I honestly don’t know what this man want from me and I have asked him this before, his response was that it’s casual for him at that time but he wants to get to know me more before he can see the full picture. Tbh, that is very reasonable but I just feel like I’m wasting my time on something that won’t have any result. I enter this with the full intention of it being something not serious at all but I think I may have developed feelings for him…and if my intentions one day don’t align with his casual intentions anymore, then I will be the one hurting…Should I just block?

"i’ve never made a post on here before but i’ve been caught up in my head and im very much in need of some advice.

i haven’t had trouble being with her. everything has been great. we’re compatible in every way. a couple months ago we broke up because my job was making me less motivated for a lot of things. i was just always tired and just wanted to go home and sleep. we just kind of drifted apart. 

she felt like things weren’t getting any better and we talked about it and mutually broke up. the weeks and months following we still hung out and talked and it wasn’t easy at all. eventually we did go no contact but after going no contact, one of my friends fucked me over big time. he hid it from me, lied to me, told me he loved me and cared for me. was just constantly y’know, just telling me i didn’t need to worry about anything. come to find out he’d been talking shit about me and trying to talk to her and get with her. we were friends for like, 9 years. he was also a very narcissistic person. always thought he was the shit or that his dick was bigger than everybody else’s in our friend group. relatively just a douchebag all around but he was ‘our douchebag ‘ so, y’know. needless to say we aren’t friends anymore but that’s just some other rant. 

anyways, to get back on topic: him and her would talk a lot and i confronted her about it and told her the typical reaction one would have to that and we stopped talking. we got back together after a month of being broken up and it’s been around a month and a half since we started talking again. the day we got back together, she told me that they had sex. mind you, me and her were together for about 3, going on 4 years. we lost our virginity to each other, fell in love unexpectedly, our families got along great. it was just perfect. but it wasn’t just sex that they had. like, normal, intimate, and meaningful sex. he pretty much pressured her into it and didn’t give her much of a choice. it wasn’t r*pe or anything similar. it wasn’t against her will or forcefully made to happen. it was just something that he wanted and she didn’t have much of a choice to get out of that situation. she feels disgusted with herself and regrets it. she didn’t enjoy it and often zoned out during it and thought of me. it also only lasted like 5 minutes so that’s another reason i feel silly even worrying about it. i told her she shouldn’t be disgusted with herself and that she’s still beautiful to me, but obviously just because i say it doesn’t make it easier on herself mentally and emotionally. we’ve had a bunch of talks about it and are trying to move on from it together. 

please just let me know if there’s anyone who’s been through something similar and how you got past this in terms of having mental images or thoughts. im not disgusted with her or feel like i can’t be intimate with her or anything like that. i love her to death. she’s my whole world and i couldn’t imagine being with anyone else. i’ve just got really bad anxiety and it eats me alive knowing that it happened. im just looking for some advice on how i could move forward and hopefully learn to come to terms with it. 

and i understand we weren’t together. before anyone thinks of me as a toxic or obsessive pig. im not holding her accountable or saying she didn’t have a right to do what she wanted since we weren’t together. it’s the fact that it happened and she didn’t want it to happen. i want to know what can help me forget about it, and help her forgive herself for it.

"I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend, Simon (24M) for almost 6 months, but we have known each other for over 2 years. 
Due to cost of living we have just signed a lease together, along with another friend of mine. 

Recently, I have been feeling like I have been giving it my all in the relationship, and I just don’t think Simon is that into me. 

He doesn’t talk much about his emotions and only does if I prompt him to. He tells me that he likes me, but barely ever says so without me saying it first. I feel like I have to ask him a hundred questions to get to the bottom of how he feels, and I get worried it’s becoming too much like an interrogation and less like a conversation.

His love language is probably physical touch as he enjoys cuddling up to me and other bed activities, and does do a lot for me. We split chores evenly and he does show me that he cares for me by helping me through my work stress or cooking me dinner. 

He helps me a lot in other ways, and clearly demonstrates his commitment to me by moving and signing a lease with me, but I wonder if I should keep trying to encourage him to share his emotions with me, or move on to someone who can offer me that reassurance and words of affirmation.

At this point, I don’t know if his feelings towards me are progressing or what he is thinking, as he is very “macho man” with his emotions.
I’m also not sure what to do because talking about it doesn’t seem to help him open up and I don’t want to put undue pressure on him to talk about his feelings when he isn’t ready.

My girlfriend is bisexual. While I don’t have a problem with that in itself, I find it creates a lot of friction when discussing our boundaries in other(platonic) relationships.
We have some rules that cause no issue
Drinking: never in large amounts or in large groups(without partner there)unless it’s with family
No clubs/parties without the other(neither of us are into them anyway)
Etc.
But as far as friendships go, I say don’t do anything you wouldn’t want me to do
Her: Don’t hang out with girls unless it’s with their partner

Me:Okay I agree, same for you with men, but you’re attracted to girls too so should my rules for women apply to both genders for you?

She says I should trust her and that it’s different but I don’t believe that it really is, and I do trust her, but I want fairness
I have no desire to spend time alone with another girl and I have no female friends anyway and don’t need to make any
She said she wouldn’t care if I hung out with a lesbian girl, because she couldn’t be attracted to me implying that it’s the other persons potential attraction that is a concern. 
I mentioned that practically all of her friends are bisexual or lesbians so why is it more okay for her to hang out with them or spend the night at their house than for me to spend the night with another girl(which I have no interest in doing)
I’ll be honest, I have BPD which comes with severe abandonment issues and I know that my own issue but I don’t understand how it is so different.
I don’t at all want to cut her off from people or make her lonely but if a girl in a relationship spent the night alone with another guy 9/10 of their partners would consider that a dealbreaker and I can’t see any difference when it comes to two bisexual/gay women.
I know if I were bisexual my long time friendships would of course be exactly the same, my friends are like family and I’ve known most of them for over a decade, and I wouldn’t have any feelings about a similar situation with her friendships.
But her meeting another bisexual/gay girl in public or at work and then becoming friends and hanging out alone or with one other bisexual/gay girl feels exactly the same as it would if it were a man.  
It may even be better with a man because I can have some kind of confidence when it comes to looks and attraction because I am pretty good looking for men where we live(other than height), but how could I gauge a lesbians attractiveness for reassurance? Should I even be having these thoughts?
I know there are women I’m very loose friends with(more like pals) that I would never sleep with and I know I would never cheat on her, but I don’t advance our friendships out of respect for our relationship,I can’t expect the same from her for men and women and leave her with no friends.
What if she made a friend and they were friends for a couple years before her friend admitted to having feelings for her? Could she bring herself to cut it off and be honest with me about it? She forms very strong connections with people and I think she is way too nice to abandon someone “just” for thinking she is attractive.
I really don’t know how I should feel or what boundaries are acceptable here. She would never speak to anyone ever again if that’s what I wanted from her, I know she would do just about anything for me, and I am hesitant to set any boundaries at all because I don’t want to abuse that especially with my BPD causing brief feelings of abandonment and distrust over the simplest things",My(21M) girlfriend(22F) is Bi and expect different boundaries,18ng77o,1703139297.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ng77o/my21m_girlfriend22f_is_bi_and_expect_different/,

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and I’ve never met this female friend, nor, have I questioned their friendship since I knew they have been friends since high school.

I don’t mind them having drinks but my issue is that my boyfriend never told me they went out together for drinks, it’s not just one photo, it’s two.. one dating back to months ago where he also didn’t communicate that they met up for drinks. The most recent one is from last night. It’s really worrisome and I can’t believe he would keep this from me because I’ve never given him a reason to, I asked him if he went to the bar and he told me he didn’t but he was in the photo she posted and I really don’t think he’s aware that I’ve seen it.

She still lives at home, and therefore her parents were very involved in the trip. Flying back from Miami there was bad weather, and they had to divert us from our destination (BWI) to Pittsburgh instead. When we landed she explained the situation to them, and they FREAKED OUT! Telling me I had to ""be more assertive with the airline people"" and ""put my foot up their a**""... And apparently that wouldve magically fixed the weather (none of them had ever flown before).They even drove to BWI just to chastise the staff there. Then my gf got mad at me because rather than wait a few hours for the next flight she would've rather had her dad drive 4 hours to us and back, when it would've taken half the time just to wait for the next flight. She even stormed off from me at the airport and told me to leave her alone. Then her mom called me and acted like I was the one that left her.

We've talked about a future together, what we'd name our kids, taking care of our parents, etc. He does a lot for me and I'm very grateful. But...one of the main issues I'm having is this: Stuff like in the segment below and video games are his only hobbies. 
Which was fine, but now it feels so consuming. He drives trucks for work, so it feels like any time we could talk about something fun or something to do together it turns to this.  

He knows about my hobbies and interests but doesn't seem like he wants to do them, not even watch movies or TV shows.  This stuff is the most important thing to him. He's gotten so deep into wanting enlightenment and the truth and learning from ""the masters"". It's his ""mission and purpose"" and he ""expects it to take his whole life"" to work on and spread to people. 

I told him I get concerned because as much as he tries to explain it to me, I can't make sense of it. I can't express what he's up to to other people because I guess I just don't understand it enough to explain. He got upset and said he ""doesn't deserve to have his sanity called into question"". 

All I hear about is Thoth, and Enoch, and Hermes...and don't get me wrong, I'm a pretty big geek about things! I could talk about the media and stuff I like and the lore and theories for hours but it's not the same as this and what he's doing.

Sometimes I'll just try and keep the conversation moving and acknowledge like wow, thats a lot to think about on one shift. And he'll get bummed I didn't think it was so amazing.

Texts from him:


You of course remember my quest to discern the heart from the brain, especially when it cones to impulses and hunches.

 You know there is a part of you that has information beyond your physical senses, and the idea behind this quest was to discern the magic part of me from the physical.

To discern a correct heart message from a faulty one or a brain message - to discern psychic sight from imagination - and to know where to find answers - the way to do all of that is by recognizing the *feeling* of it.

Maybe one day you too will pursue the question of “how can i discern psychic sight from imagination?”…the journey that that question can provide is something I shouldn’t ruin for you.
So, why did i mention all of this? 

Because I know why hermes and the masters say people do not recognize truth when they see it nor do they even know.

 what it isInstead of “the carbon atom is taken into the cell” It was, “rays of turquoise coloured light”

Pursuing that sentence will lead me to an understanding of a question i am working on currently.

We hung out on and off all day (both had most of the day off) and then finished off the night watching TV and cuddling for a while again (lots of smiling laughing etc) and I tried to initiate something sexual. He then said something along the lines of, “you put effort into your appearance today, and your hygiene, and maybe all that would have worked a long time ago when it still mattered. Now it’s like putting oil into a car that’s been out of oil for months.” I got off him and said “I don’t even understand what you’re trying to do at this point” (meaning our relationship). He said “I’m trying to go to bed. I’ve been saying that”. And just walked off, didn’t say goodnight or anything, just closed his bedroom door on me.  What am I even supposed to do with that?

Yesterday she tells me (the day before) we can’t go because she’s driving to get her sister early Friday and it’s annoyed me when she knew we already had something planned. I told her calmly that it’s annoying when she cancels stuff we’ve already arranged for family (it’s happened before) and treats me second best. She stormed out of the house, said she’s done nothing wrong and refuses to see my side. 7 hours later she said sorry but still doesn’t think she’s 100% in the wrong when her sister asked her last week and she said no. I’ve told her if she can’t prioritise us I’ll start doing the same by cancelling NYE together. 

I’ve told her I’m not the one in the wrong. The only reason she’s picking her sister up is because she doesn’t like getting the train with her dog and I’m being put second. I told her if she’d have asked instead of just going ahead I wouldn’t have a problem with it we could’ve picked a different day but it’s the lack of thought for me which bothers me most. It feels like I come second to her family and she doesn’t care about our plans. 

I feel like I’m being treated second best here and her family will always come first so I’m not sure what to do when she doesn’t see she’s wrong?

What made it 10x worse was when I told her this morning I wasn’t happy about her cancelling she screamed in my face and stormed out. I was blunt but calm. I told her I feel second best when she cancels and she called me pathetic and it’s not her fault. Since then she’s started ignoring me after coming home and is again adamant she is in the right. I’ve tried talking it through and she starts shouting and telling me I’m pathetic and not to bring it up again because it’s boring and she doesn’t want to hear it. She can’t cancel because she’s said she’ll go (but she’ll cancel us).

"I met my friend—let’s call her Jamie, on a dating app. We went on a couple dates and had a good time but we go to colleges that were far from each other so I didn’t want to start anything serious but we stayed talking. 

Jamie and I really became close friends, she confided in me and I did the same and we recommended each other things to watch. She cried to me when she was having problems and I comforted her. We made plans to hang out when we were back in the same location. 

She started to feel distant recently and i was wondering if something was up. I just found out that she got a new boyfriend and I don’t know how to react. I’m not sure if I actually have feelings for her or am just jealous of her new boyfriend. 

I’m not sure if I should still stay friends with her or just cut off contact completely. When she told me about her bf she said she had to set a boundary which I understand. She said she never had to tell someone who she used to like that she had a boyfriend and that’s why it took her a little bit to let me know.

What should I do? I’m very lost and really value our friendship but feel like there are feelings still there so don’t know how to truly react.

"Hi!! first time poster, long time lurker. I was just hoping for some advice and also an outside opinion if I’m being delusional or not. Long one, sorry. (He’s single btw)

This guy and I work together, not in the same team, but in the same building and we see each other the daily, but it’s not a requirement like if we didn’t want to, we don’t have to. But I just so happen to cross paths with him most days. In doing so we’ve built up a rapport and I think he’s very cute. Our Christmas party was a couple of weeks or so ago, I didn’t spend any time with my friends and he didn’t spend any time with his because we spent it together. We were just chatting. We had such a good conversation and we danced together.

Even at one point, another one of my guy friends was trying to dance with me, and he came up on the other side of me and dance with me on the other side when he wasn’t dancing at the time. So I took this as a positive sign, and I asked for his Instagram, but he doesn’t have social media. It was kind of the end of the conversation after that, but then he asked if he could buy me a drink and I said yes. 
To describe this guy, he is kind of quiet, but he’s really funny when you get to know him and likes similar things to me. He’s in the technology department so you know how that goes. 

Anyway, we see each other now in passing and it’s like the Christmas party didn’t happen. We still chat and have a good conversation but nothing has come of it.  And I really would like it to, and since he doesn’t have social media, I can’t just dm him on Instagram or something. 

 I would really like to get to know him more, and maybe even go out on a date, but I don’t know where to go from here. I have another friend who works in the technology department, but I don’t trust him not to say anything to the Guy. How should I approach this from here on out?

"Hello,

I feel like maybe I need to vent and hopefully gain some wisdom or piece of mind from any comments people want to share.

I am 43M and my wife is 37F, we have been together for almost 13 years.  

It has recently come to light that my wife was very slutty from 18-24 when we met.  It just so happened that she had a boyfriend of 9 months, first one ever, at the time.   A relationship that was coming to an end.  She was also a big family person and just seemed like a sweet girl.

I was in the mix of soiling my wild oats so to speak after a long term relationship, but have always been more of a relationship person and wanted to meet a sweet girl.

Now - fyi - this post is not just about me being RJ about her past sex life so please read on-

 And I am not saying that there is anything wrong with being promiscuous but I am 6 years older than her and she covered about 60-70 partners in her 6 year ""slutty period"" which is definitely more than I covered in mind.

Now, again, there is more to the story - yes, some people's past should stay in the past or sometimes it can be fun to hear about your partners sexcapades to spice things up.

I was traveling for work, away for two weeks, on my way from the airport in an uber, my ring camera alerts just kept going off repeatedly.  When I went to check on it to make sure all way okay and to put it into snooze, if it was just the wind blowing trees...I saw my wife and two new friends, not even solid friends, chatting on the back deck.

One of them got up acting crazy and was pointing at the camera, etc, so it made me curious.  I arrived home, they left, my wife and I slept together and I didn't bring it up that night.   The next day I couldn't help myself, I had to see what that was all about - what I found was 2 hours of them sitting on the back deck, having drinks and basically my wife leading all conversation while these two new friends soaked it in.

There were stories about a guy with a monster cock, guys she fucked in Italy (""we didn't have sex, he fucked me"") who didn't speak English but ""they spoke the same language."" etc etc.  Then she said, he's probably watching this on the camera right now and that is when the friend got up and said ""I see you!"" and laughed, then she said ""I got your back though.""

The really hurtful part of this was that my wife went on a roll about me - how boring sex was, how I always wanted to be romantic, (and basically had an itch for other dick and just getting fucked from what I can tell), etc, etc.

The new friend saying ""I got your back though,"" later I found out, was like - oh just give it to him, it sounds like he just wants you so bad and you're not letting him have it.

I confronted her about this, I couldn't hold it in, she looked like a deer in headlights and said - well, I hope you know I didn't mean those things I said about you (immediately).  Then, the sick human I am, watched more of the two hours and came back to her.  It sounded like she may have cheated or it may have just been another past sex story - the wind was blowing and the audio was not super clear.  She really looked stunned and said, no she had not cheated on me and if there was something specific to ask about, do it.  Well played.  But alas the audio was fuzzy at that point.

There are many more elements to this (her really laughing about the things she was saying and other examples/details) but again, this has been some time...it bothered me at first but then I tried to let it go and just really put it on her when we had sex.  We've added toys, outfits, etc.  

Fast forward (we have two kids during all of this by the way), I catch her in a few small lies.  I put apple ids in our cars but forgot to tell her (both cars are in my name) because I got a 4 pack and didn't have a use for all of them - I totally should have told her but didn't think about it between the hours that I put it in and then time she went out for the first time that night.

That night, she told me she was going to a friend's house, I had just put the id in and wanted to try it out, she was in a different neighborhood.  When she got home, I asked her questions about the friend's rooftop that was so nice and plush (we had been before), she said we only went up for a little while, it was great.  Meanwhile, she never went there.  This occasion I came to find out was fine because she did go to another friend's house but just didn't want to have to explain that plans had changed and she needed a night out from me and the kids (which now that I'm typing this sounds like a bunch of bullshit, what was the big deal and why boldface lie).

After this I went on the defense and have caught her in other lies, nothing solid as far as cheating but I just don't trust her after all of the things. 

Then over the past few months, old stories have come up and the facts have changed.  The guy that we both went to hang out with at a bar and then his apartment, when we first met - she originally said they never hooked up and now, turns out she really liked him, they hooked up a few times and that was it.  Which is fine, but the truth would have been nice originally, maybe I would have passed on hanging out with him and laughing for the afternoon.

The most recent one was a text that I saw - great seeing you tonight (to another married guy that she did tell me she was going out with because they have known each other for years and done a lot of business together).  He said let's get together asap, basically.  And they set a date on the calendar, to which she said ""I'm marking it on the calendar, unlike the proposed sexual calendar that I have for my husband.  Because he thinks that sex involves 'feelings'.""

I told her after the ring camera incident not to bring up my name or our personal sex life to anyone and now a year or two later, I see that.  

I asked how familiar she was with this guy and if she complained about the kids (which she does sarcastically often) or if she talked about our sex life....because I know those two things are her MO.  She said NO and we got into an argument.

I'm in deep on this relationship with kids and years of history, the whole nine, but the trust has been broken here and I don't want to be a sucker to other things happening behind my back.  I just don't know what to do, can someone please offer your own personal experience or advice?  

Have you been in a similar situation?

Can you get by if the lies are small and there has been no cheating?

Thank you!

"I’m not in the best mindset right now, so I’ll try not to make this ramble on too much.

My girlfriend and I have recently moved up to college, and since her mental health hasn’t been too well and she didn’t have too many close friends in high school, I’ve been encouraging her to make friends here so she has people to talk/vent to if I’m studying/working.

She eventually met a group of people at the college we both go to, and hit it off really well with them. I was really happy for her, as they seemed like very genuine people that got along well with her and shared some common interests. I even helped get her to some of their hangouts/parties when she couldn’t drive herself. Things seemed to be going good for a while, until she met someone I’ll call Cleo.

Cleo is about 7 years older than us, and I can’t remember if they’re actually a student or just a friend of a friend. Regardless, after a few weeks of my girlfriend knowing Cleo, she confessed to me that she was attracted to them, and that Cleo had told them that they had a crush on her (my girlfriend).

My girlfriend said that she felt attracted to Cleo because they were closer to her “normal type” (she told me I wasn’t the type she would normally date when we first started dating, which I was ok with because it didn’t seem to bother her at the time) and that she felt they had more common goals and views. The funny thing is that before this, we’d gone over our goals and views multiple times and figured out that even though we come from different backgrounds, they’re pretty similar.

I was obviously taken aback when she told me this, but because I didn’t want her to feel trapped with me, I told her I would understand if she wanted to be with Cleo, or even just take a break to explore it more. She immediately refused, and told me that she felt guilty because she loved me and wanted stability over her preferences. We went back and forth on this for a bit, but eventually dropped it entirely.

She spend the next month, give or take, getting advice from her new and old friends, and even her parents (who she isn’t on the best terms with). And eventually, she told me that she wanted to stay with me because Cleo had some “turn offs” that she didn’t like. I was definitely happy to hear this, but something still felt off.

The next few weeks, it just felt like something wasn’t right. I couldn’t tell if it was her self esteem/mental health being lower, or the situation just sitting with me still making me feel bad. But then, this morning I got a message from an account I didn’t know on instagram that sent me a screenshot of the comment section of a reel that my girlfriend had shown me a few weeks ago. In the comment section was a comment from her that was along the lines of:
“I think I’m in love with one of my friends, but I don’t know if it’s romantic. I would fuck the shit out of them if they let me, but I don’t know if I feel connected to them in a friend way or something else. I still love by bf so y’know.”

The last sentence of that was word for word what she posted. It felt just like a huge punch in the gut. I love her and I care for her wellbeing, but I don’t know if I can get past this. She’s definitely given me reason to regret dating her before (which could fill up a whole other post), but I still have feelings for her. The voices of reason that are my friends and family have been telling me to distance from her since we started dating, but I haven’t listened to them fully.

Ive only told one person the situation in this post, and they’ve told me to break up with her (which I kind of agree with).

I just wanted to get some more outside advice. What should I do from here? I can’t forget what’s happened this past month, but at the same time I don’t want the last 2 years to have been a waste.

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 2 years admitted that she was attracted to someone else, and would “fuck them” if given the chance. What should I do?

Any advice is appreciated. I’ll try to clarify for any confused comments.

"There’s a guy at work and we kinda speak but not very often. We’ve just began to get to know each other and have only just started to hang out in a group outside work. I’m crushing hard. 

I’m an intern that’s leaving the city in a few days and going back to college. Today is his last day at work before vacation and I noticed he wasn’t in office so in the afternoon I got brave and sent him a text message, and here are the texts word for word;

Me: “Hey &lt;name&gt;, since I’m leaving I just wanted to say I had a good time with you the few times we spent together. Also completely forgot to thank you for insisting on waiting with me after &lt;friend’s&gt; bday dinner. Have a good break! :)”

Him: “Shoot are you leaving rn?”

Me: “Leaving Friday but you mentioned today was your last day lol”

Him: “Oh cool I’m on my way to the office rn, I get to say goodbye in person”

Me: “Oop see u soon then”

Him: “Yup”

Him: “Still loved the text tho” *goes back and puts a heart on my paragraph*

Me: “Guess I’ll have to repeat it to you in person😔”

He came into work in a bit (he lives walking distance away). He may have come into work just for me maybe? He’s never before walked into work during the second half of the day like that so that’s a first. He may have just needed something there tho I’m not sure?? He smiled at me.

At 5pm, I noticed he was caught up in a foosball match and decided he wasn’t as interested as I thought so I left and was waiting for my Uber outside when I saw him walk into the lobby *possibly* searching for me (I sometimes sit on the couches in the lobby) before he walked out. I then got a message -

Him: “I think I missed ya but have a great break and good school year! Hope to one day see you again”

Me: “Sorry didn’t wanna disturb your last foosball match with &lt;insert intern name&gt;. I hope I see you again too!”

Him: “you definitely should’ve but I got you”

Me: “Welp my Uber driver is going in circles so I’m waiting outside if you’re still here”

Him: “I left when I first texted ya😂”

Me: “Rip”

Him; “it is what it is”

Me: “are you leaving tn?”

Him: “tmrw”

I am loving someone who isn’t ready in life
Hello. Currently I am (24 M) and she is (22 F) I believe I am in a unique situation. I met this girl when she was 18f and I was 20m, she was my friend’s younger sister and she had a crush on me. I used to tease her but we ended up becoming friends and we ended up becoming closer. 1 year later her brother and I ended up gettin a townhome and she became our roommate along with another roommate. We started to hang out all together more and more, eventually her and I just started to hang out alone. We were up front with everything with her brother. I didn’t start to take her seriously as anything more than a friend until after we started hanging on our own. He didn’t mind, he actually encouraged it. So eventually we started dating. We’ve been through a lot together, we’re currently not together because we had a lot of personal problems we needed to work out. I feel as though she’s still very disorganized in her life and my life is becoming very structured and disciplined now. She is starting to catch up she’s even going into the navy. We are still very close. I do love her but I am afraid she might not live up to my expectation of a partner I can rely on. I know it sounds fucked up, but I believe love isn’t enough to keep a relationship going. It is work, I feel we need to work on ourselves but I feel like she has more work to go than I. She has to make sure she’s okay first before worrying about a relationship and understand who she is. I do see a future with this girl but I can’t put my life on pause waiting. She is smart I just want her to be self sufficient so that we can come together and work with each other as well rounded human beings. I should love someone as they are but I’m afraid of not having a partner (especially a partner I intend on building a family with) that can stand on their own two. She’s trying and doing well, she’s still young. I just don’t know what to do. I love her, we are very compatible. I don’t want to lead her on if she just never gets to that point.

"Just to let you know, he does not know that I know this.
I found out because recently he always tried to press back on his phone everytime I look at him, or quickly press ESC to close the chatting window when he chat to her on PC. I also noticed that now he is always awake until around 4am looking at his phone doing chatting gestures. So last night, I know I invaded his privacy by doing this, but I could not find another way to get certain evidence other than by looking into his phone and exporting his chat with her. Then I send the export file to myself without him knowing, read everything, and here I am.

The story begins like this.
So, last week Wednesday, my boyfriend went for a drink with some of his friends. He said that he also wanted to go there because he wanted to get some career advice because some of his friends are way older than him. However, on that day he went to meet his friends around 7 pm and came back home at around 12.30 am with a TOTALLY drunk condition. He was yelling, breaking and throwing stuffs like kitchen stuffs, breaking the shower head in the bathroom, hitting the walls, breaking tables and drawers, but most importantly, this was the first time he tried to hurt me physically. I was so angry and scared at the same time at that time because I knew he wouldn't even remember any of these the next day. So I just left him in the bedroom and I went to another room to sleep. I was so exhausted, scared, and angry.

The morning after, on Thursday, he woke me up by caressing my head and hugged me,  smiling like nothing ever happened,  and said ""Good morning, how was your night yesterday?""

In my head I was like... what the fuck?
""You came home in a totally messed up condition, breaking and throwing dangerous stuffs, even tried to hit me several times. I will let you decide what type of night that was."", I said with a very angry face and tried to get away from his hug.

After that his smile faded, said a simple ""I'm sorry"" and he just went back to the bedroom.

I was like.........????? Is it wrong for me to be angry about this and feel unsatisfied with this type of half-assed apology?

But suddenly around the evening, he said to me ""I want to eat dinner, my head hurts"". And I was like, ""So?"", and he went like ""I want to eat dinner with you so let's eat something delicious, something that can cure my hangover"". I was like... what the ACTUAL FUCK?? I mean... I was still traumatized by what he did but he acted like nothing happened?! But at that time I just accepted the offer and so we ate dinner together.

But during that time, everything just felt disgusting. While eating, we did not talk at all, but many thoughts ran in my head. I feel like shit, too. I know that he does not have ANY memory of the things that he did on Wednesday night because of blacking-out but this is not the first time he blacked out and did stuff like this so I was hoping for a more proper explanation and not a half-assed apology. I felt like a freaking crazy person because the memory of that day only exists for me as he does not remember anything, making me feel bad for getting angry at him. After all, it is analogous to getting angry at a person who thinks that he did not do anything.

After that dinner, I directly went to the other room where I slept previously, and practically did not talk to him until Sunday. Why?

So actually on Friday, he had another drinking party with other friends, again he went around 7 pm and came back home around 1 am. I was still awake at that time so when he came home he greeted me by saying 'I am still hungry, I did not drink"". I was like...... dude? So what? So I said ""Oh, good job. You can eat whatever you want there are foods in the fridge"". I was still fucking pissed off what the heck?On Saturday, when I woke up in the morning, he was already gone. I don't know where he went, and he did not come back until midnight so I just went to sleep.On Sunday, in the morning I saw that he was already asleep in the bedroom.

As my anger was still intact from Thursday all the way to Sunday, I tried to refresh myself by going to a cafe alone on Sunday. There I gathered my courage and decided to tell him how I feel when I went home. So I went home at night around dinner time, and when I came in, he said ""I am hungry"" while jokingly poking my cheeks, all smiling. My face expression was the opposite as I was fucking pissed off, so I directly said to him.

""Let's talk about this. I was very angry about Wednesday night and I am still very pissed off  about it until now because you acted like nothing ever happened, while for me it was one of the most traumatic events in my life.""

Then he replied, ""I know, I am sorry, but I do not remember anything.""

So I said, ""That is the problem, I feel like a crazy person because I am angry about the situation that only exists in my head! It is very suffocating and this is already the nth time you did this. What makes you drink that much on that day?""

Then he just said, ""Okay sorry, I remembered my ex-gf while my friends talked about their ex-gf and breakup stories, too. I will try to better control myself in drinking. Let's just eat, I am hungry.""

I was like.... I am tired of being angry with someone that I love and I see every day, too. At that time I just swept his words under the rug and accepted his apology, then we went to eat together. After that dinner, we were awake until dawn because he usually play his games until 4 am. But this time, it was kinda weird because he kept typing. I was thinking that maybe he was typing to chat with other players so I just brushed it off.

On Monday, I tried to act back to normal with him. Everything was fine until he got angry because he could not find his phone, then accused me of hiding it. I did not hide his phone, and this was also the first time I saw him frustrated and angry with not seeing his phone. I mean, you could've just forgotten where you put your phone, right? Anyway, he found his phone somewhere, then went back to the bedroom, and played his PC games.

Everything was normal until I noticed him trying to quickly change windows or close the chatting application every time I entered the room, and this happened for several times until Tuesday. I just thought that maybe those were coincidences so I just brushed it off again. Or if he is on his phone, every time I call him or look at him, he will quickly press the back button first before answering or looking back at me. Still, I just brushed it off because maybe he got some messages from work or his friends.

Until, accidentally, when he went to the toilet, I saw a new notification on his phone, ""New chat from Meow"".

I was like.......

Is this.... what am I thinking? My blood boiled. I feel ashamed, disgusted, angry, disappointed, and curious as well. I mean.... Really? We've been together for around 3.5 years and because of ONE time I got angry with him because of his dangerous drunk behavior, he did.. that??

So last night, when he was asleep, I tried to open his phone, and found his chatroom with that person named 'Meow'. My heart beat so fast I thought it could explode but I tried to stay calm and just directly export all of the chat into txt, then secretly sent it to myself then delete all of the traces of me doing so on his phone.

When I opened the chat, I saw that it is actually my BF who started to contact her since Sunday MIDNIGHT (around 12am). And he make the name of that chatroom,  ""Solo drinking, will chat with anyone"". And it turns out that he has been chatting with her since Sunday to this day (Thursday) almost EVERY MINUTE like non-stop except during sleeping time.

Some of you might think that maybe this is just casual chatting, but there are some parts that makes my blood boil.

1. He started this chatroom on Sunday midnight and from that one, the chat went like 5-10 lines per MINUTE and around 6 am he was the first to say that he wanted to sleep. But, when he woke up around 2pm on the same day, he was the first one to chat her again, saying all things like ""Ugh, I just woke up but my head hurts from all the drinking :("" Then she replied, then they proceed to chat intensely just like before, ALL THE WAY TO MONDAY midnight. At that time, again he was the one who said that he wanted to sleep first, but he said with ""I want to know more about you, can't wait to chat you again later. Bye\~!"" I practically cried when I read this.

2. On Monday morning when he woke up, he was the first one to chat her again, by saying ""How was your sleep?"", then again, proceed to chat intensely just like before ALL THE WAY TO TUESDAY 2 am. This time, it was the girl who slept first.

3. Tuesday morning, it was snowing and he was the one who chatted her first again, by saying ""Did you see the snow? It's so pretty~"", then proceed to send her a photo of a cute snowman that he found around our house. Then again, proceed to chat intensely just like before but this time only until 10pm because that girl seemed to got to sleep after my BF replied to her. But the difference of their chat today is they started to talk lovey-dovey, cutely, sending over heart emojis and everything. I already cried a lot at this point.

4. Wednesday morning, which is yesterday, when she woke up, she is the one who chatted him first and said things like ""I wish you had a great day today!"". My BF woke up a little bit late that day, around lunch time, so he replied by ""Sorry for the late reply, I just woke up. Did you have something for lunch already?"" then proceed to tell her about his fun dream where he got on an airplane and move to somewhere nice etc etc. Anyway, she replied that she ate pasta for her lunch. At the same time this happened, actually I fell sick, I coughed blood and got a fever, so I wanted to go to the hospital. At that time, because I still did not know about this, I asked him to go together to the hospital and he agreed, only if after that we eat pasta afterwards. I said to him, ""I got fever so I think I need something warm and light?"" But he said, ""But there is a great pasta restaurant near the hospital, let's just go there while we're going to that area"". I just agreed because I just wanted to go to the hospital. While I was reading the chat, it turns out that while we were waiting for my turn to the Doctor, he said something like ""I am wondering what part of you can I learn more today! I am sooo excited Haha"". Practically I am already broken at this point. By reading the chat and observing the chat timeline, I also found out that actually it was the girl that told him to eat something nice like pasta, ""Because you slept well today, might as well eat something nice to start the day!"" then each of them shared the photos of the pasta that they ate for lunch, competing for who ate the better pasta.  From my point of view, when he ate the pasta with me, he really did not say anything at all, just ""Woah delicious~ good~"" just like that for 30 minutes or so.

5. On that day at night, the girl will go to the airport to pick her friends, then my BF asks the details like where is your friend coming back from, ""I think I also will plan a trip soon because of listening to your story"" and blablabla. When the time comes for her to go, he sent her off by saying ""Be careful ~ Drive slowly~ I wish you a safe trip!"" After she got home from her trip, she then chat my BF again, saying ""@_@ Ugh I am tired, might as well watch Netflix to close the day~"" then my BF said ""What are you watching? I will watch it too so you can talk about it with me!"". Then of course she told what series is she watching now, and my BF said ""Okay, I will catch up with that series until the part that you saw so that we can talk about it!"". While watching the series, the girl said she is hungry, so she asked my BF for any recommendation for food. So my BF told her everything he likes the most, how he cooked it, and recommended all of his favorite Youtubers to follow the recipe. Then she remembered that she will have a party with her friends this weekend, so she asked for any good food recommendation to have, then my BF started to send his best choices, what are the best ways to modify the food to make it tastier, etc. After this, he said ""You must be tired after all of the driving, so please do not watch Netflix too much and rest soon. Have a nice dream~!"" Then she also replied ""Sure sure, I will do so. You, too, have a nice dream~"" By seeing the chat timeline, I also noticed that he was chatting with her like this at the same time he was caressing me and hugging me, telling me to sleep together (I was in another room at that time because I did not want him to get sick from me) because I was sick and he said he is worried about me.  What a jerk.

6. During all of these series of timelines, there are also many instances where he talked about something personal like his deep interests (something that he used to not share just with anyone) like the type of art that he likes, how he started to learn guitar, and his childhood dreams. There are things that he never told me, too, like his past trauma when he was in elementary school, etc. I have tried to talk about our personal past several times, but he always avoided the question by saying ""How can I remember something that happened decades ago?!"". Haha...

7. There are also many instances where he just sends her cute moans? Like ""Aaaahhh"" ""Euugghhh"" ""Huhuhu"". He... never did this when he talk or chat to me. With me, he act like a big badass man, not cutesy lovey dovey like this.

8. He also tells her every single tiny thing that he would be doing. For example, if he wants to go to the toilet and if he wants to shower. Before he said he wanted to sleep, he also asked things like ""For today, when will you sleep~?"".

9. During this series of chat, it is the girl who first say to him ""Let's not leave this chatroom and keep the chat alive! I like talking to you"" and also she tried to ask for my BF's phone number. My BF avoided it by saying ""Umm I think you will not need that, I am not a good person"". But, then after sometime, it is my BF who asked her to meet-up soon because he is grateful that she brightens his days. :)

Actually, after I read their chat, I tried to ask about this indirectly to him by saying ""Actually I think you are hiding something from the way you act, do you want to talk about it?""

Then he just say, ""I'm sorry. There is nothing"". Haha....

There are many more details that happened during the past week but these are the points that makes me turn batshit crazy mad at myself but I really do not know how to deal with this. 

Is this considered cheating? How should I confront him about this? Or is it better to just leave him and consider this just as a casual chat just like he's chatting using Omegle?

"I need some advice bcus my boyfriend seems to think I’m overly jealous and controlling but he doesn’t understand me or try to understand how I feel: 
I’m going to give one scenario where I feel he was in the wrong. 
We’ve been together for 3 years and recently he started a new job and posted some pictures on instagram taken by a photographer, one of my distant friends shared his selfie on her story and I found it odd bcus she is a distant friend and it’s just like why are you putting my boyfriend on your story? I asked him if he speaks to her or has a friendship with her I don’t know of and he said no but I was still upset and I didn’t want to approach her about it bcus I didn’t really know how to or what to say. A few days later I noticed he liked her selfie on instagram which upset me bcus he knew I was already upset about her posting him and now him liking her selfie was just ehhh. Now tomorrow he will be getting his hair done in a place where she works at and he doesn’t want me to go with him to his appointment, I’ve gone with him the last two times but now he didn’t tell me I can’t go but he didn’t invite me either. If I’m missing anything or you need more context please ask but am I crazy for feeling this way about him and my friend?

"I (f19) am so lost and confused about this situation and I'm afraid it's way to late to fix it. My (nb18) friend let's call them X might have feeling for me. I (f19) have a gf (f20) and we have a poly relationship let's call her Lola. Me and Lola have been together for 4 years and recently about 1 1/2 ago opened up to being poly. I had been friends with X for around a year at that point. Let me add that I am extremely flirty with all of my close friends bc I feel like it shows them how deeply I love them. I was very open with X about how I am and they had accepted and understood and told me they would tell me when I crossed a line. X never said anything and very much flirted back like all my other friends had done.

Before Lola and I opened our relationship I had told her how I had feelings for X and she said she thought so and had also had feelings for them. We agreed on many things and talked tons about how we felt and what was okay and what's wasn't. Once we had agreed and let it sit that we were poly, like 6 months or research and talking, we told our group of friends, this includes X. 

Around November last year I had decided that if X didn't ask me out I would ask them out at the end of their senior year of hs. 2 months later X was asked out by somone else. I was so happy for X seeing them happy and feeling love they had deserved but it hurt sm seeing that it wasn't me. I tried so hard over the next 8 months to be friends with X's bf (m18), let's call him Y, but X always said Y didn't feel good or didn't like going where we went, ect. And made many excuses as to why we didn't hang out with Y. I thought Y was just a very busy guy but I'm thinking now that X didn't want Y to see how we interact with one another. Because over those 8 months nothing had changed other then we didn't see each other as much. It went from once or twice a week to once every two weeks, but the same energy that was there between us was always there.

Now let's get to the good stuff ig. Around 3 1/2 months ago after a friends trip with X, Lola, and 2 other friends. (Y was invited but he had declined) after the trip X had taken themselves off of our gc and went no contact with everyone. Our one friend (nb19) let's call them E, texted X to make sure they were okay, X never got back to them.  So after 4 days of being mad then worried and upset I had decided to text X. I had asked X if they were okay and if they had decided to no longer be friends. The response to me was absolutely insane. 

X responded back to me within minutes of my text (I had thought it would take days due to X not answering E). X texted me that they could no longer be friends with me, and that it was because they may or may not have feelings for me and was still working it out. Along with that X added it was because of many things like lack of time for friends and it being disappointing that they were never around alot.

 ik that it's hard to see oneone you like and it's painful thinking they don't feel the same as you but I did feel the same, I'm dense and don't make the first move becuase I can't read people well. 

And I'm not sure what to do, it's been 3 months sence then and I'm still as lost as I am when I read that text. I read the messages X sent telling me everything, look at old pictures, watch old videos, and cry missing them and the friendship we had. I sit and wish I had told X sooner about how I felt or told him when he had texted me. But I thought I didn't make X happy in the way you want to get with somone. If that makes much sence. And ig I needed this off of my chest to move on or maybe just read when in feeling sad again. I miss X all the time and wish they were still in my life.

"I (20m) am a part of a family of 6. I have my mom, dad, and three older sisters who aren’t that far ahead of me in age, but we still have our differences.

I am the black sheep of my family: the most obvious being I am the only boy, my mom and sisters are in the medical field while I’m going into engineering, I’m quiet and very introverted while everyone else is more extroverted, and I am the only one (apart from my mom) who has darker skin complection and hair color. Growing up my sisters teased me a lot as siblings normally do, mainly about me being the only boy and saying I was adopted since I have no resemblance to them. I know I’m probably just being sensitive to that, but adding it onto lack of self confidence and mental problems, it still nags at me all these years later. 

Now, we have family group chats that all of us are in. I will admit that I do tend to keep on the quieter side of things, but still send stuff to try to be included. Here is where things start getting to me. In the group chats, we always pull at each others legs and make funny quips at each other, however, whenever I make a joke or try to it always ends up not being acknowledged or making my sisters mad at me. 

This same thing happened yesterday. Following it, I went over to my parents house to bake with my mom. While baking, my mom told me that my sister didn’t really like the joke I made earlier(This is also the same sister I would say I am closest to in age and relationship wise). For years, I’ve had a large amount of negative thoughts thinking about whether I am just a burden/shadow standing in the corner of the real family. Realizing what my mom said, I sent my sister a message saying that I was really sorry and didn’t mean to offend her. Her only reply was a quick “you’re good”. Which brought me down even more. I was going to bring it up to my mom and try to see if she had anything to say about it, but she just went on her phone after baking and didn’t say a word to me. 

These situations have been consistent for a while and I try my best to watch what I say. This is partly why I don’t say anything at all most times. 

But basically, for the past day, I have just been pondering whether or not my family actually wants me there or not. Or if I’m just overthinking the crap out of things like I typically do.

I have tried talking to my sisters one on one same with my parents, but the conversations die down really quickly. Should I keep trying to talk to them more? Or even going and doing things with them?

"So December 1st I asked my boyfriend to set up the Christmas tree with me to be honest we’ve been having a lot of issues and are going through an extremely rough patch and our relationship because of these issues. It’s honestly caused him to just be burnt out all the time and not show me any love or affection and I just feel like it’s been damaging our relationship, so like I said, I had asked him outside of the Christmas tree with me. He said that he was busy because of finals coming up but it just made me actually really frustrated because he had time to be doing other things than spending one hour out of his day to set up the tree with me Weeks pass by and he asked me on Sunday if I want to set up the tree and I told him yes in the car I’m not sure if I should overthink it or not but when we are in the car I was just sobbing because of all of our issues that we’ve had and so it just makes me think that he was only asking because of how sad I was not because he actually remembered or anything because prior to that he hadn’t said anything about it. When we got home, he didn’t mention anything about the tree. Not sure if this is my fault or his or both of ours. I did kind of remember about the tree, but I had been asking him for so long leading up to this point (literally every other day) that it just felt embarrassing on my end to keep asking him to put up the Christmas tree with me because in my mind, I just kind of feels like if he wanted to he would. Fast forward to yesterday. I mentioned the tree again to him because Christmas is right around the corner and it just made me sad that we still hadn’t yet. It ended up and us deciding that we were going to set up the tree today but I just got extremely depressed thanking about Christmas in general. For me Christmas has always been a bad time of the year and I’ve hated it for awhile now and cry every year. Obviously when we first started dating, I hoped that that could change and really wanted to make that change because I always wanted to like Christmas but it’s just really hard when you come from such a damaged and toxic family. I started thinking about how when we first started talking I asked him things he liked because I wanted to get him a Christmas present even though we hadn’t officially started dating yet I wanted to get him one just to show him that I cared about him and I didn’t think it was anything out of the ordinary. His response was that I didn’t need to get him anything as we weren’t dating. I tried not to think about it a lot but it kind of bothered me. Then the next year around Christmas I was supposed to come visit him and because we were having issues at the time he told me that he didn’t want me to meet his family and come spend Christmas with him. He ended up apologizing, but it’s just really stuck in my memory and some thing that honestly just makes me extremely sad.. and then this year ‘s like I said, I had asked him so early on to set up the Christmas tree, and I just felt like I was being blown off because despite the fact that he had finals coming up, he did have time to do other things that I felt like could have been put on the back burner to focus on us any of the Christmas tree (ex: playing video games).. all of this made me just express my feelings to him about all of this including my childhood and experience with a Christmas so told him that I was sad. During the day today he had texted me about it and I only really said I was sad but when I got home I said we can set up the tree. I’m still sad but we can just set it up. Then, he decided that he was sad too because I was  and that he wanted to be happy when he set up the tree. it just ended up turning into a big argument of us wasting time and not setting it up. I just wish  of wish that he could have seen my pov and showed me love and affection which he hasn’t shown me for months now. I know thar if he had given me some reassurance and just made me feel loved It would’ve helped me just feel better about the situation overall, but it just seems like it turned into him being said just because I was (which is exactly what he said). He also admitted to being burnt out and not having energy to be sad while we did this.

Here are some other things he said:

But yeah I’m burnt out I kind of need to be dating someone who’s happy more than they’re upset and who actually wants to create positive memories instead of just these disfunctional sad memories 

Alright we’ll idk if you feel like trying to be happy together I’m here. If you want to live in the past and be miserable please talk to your therapist about that 

You’re choosing to be a good girlfriend right now right? 

Your relationship isn’t supposed to be what makes it breaks your happiness. You’re supposed to be happy with yourself and being that to the relationship and then I do the same and we make memories together but it’s gotten so backwards that it feels like that never happens 

Just talk to your therapist like I’m not your therapist

"So, I have reached the classic 30 day marker for no contact with my situationship and am wanting to break it and talk with them again. For context, the situationship was only 2 weeks long but we saw each other practically every day for 4-6hrs. We had an instantly profound connection and I think it scared him how fast we were falling for one another, especially because we had time constraints because we were leaving for school break and I am leaving the country this coming spring. He was the one that broke it off because he did not want to get further involved knowing all the trips and duties that we both had already planned that would get in the way—he also said he needs to work on himself. But, during the break up, he said “I do not want to go no contact with you” but then never specified what that meant. The next day, I had to set the ground rules for contact and I said we could take a short week break and then text as acquaintances afterwards. But, then, I went against that and ended up going no contact completely with him and am now regretting it and want to at least reestablish a friendship.

I don’t know if I should feel wrong and horrible for wanting to choose this for myself or if I’m being selfish.

"New to dating after 20+ year marriage. I'm (45f) confused by guy (44m) FWB, is that all it is?

I'm (45F) confused by guy (44M) I'm seeing. I'm recently separated after 20+ years and things are so different now

First post ever, so please excuse any mistakes and formatting. 

I (45f) separated from my husband 1 year ago. I was married for 22 years and it fell apart for various reasons (no cheating). In the last 4 months I've started to see P (44m). It started as FWB. I told him from the start that if I'm sleeping with someone, I'm not sleeping with anyone else. That's just my thing. I told him I didn't expect the same but after about 2 months he said he wouldn't sleep with anyone else either.

P has been upfront about not wanting a relationship. He's been burnt a few times and came to the decision that it wasn't for him. He's reconciled himself to never having that. He's content with his life without a partner, enjoys doing his own thing, etc. I respect that. So I was a bit puzzled by making this arrangement exclusive. Bear in mind, I've been out of the dating scene for more than 20 years. Not sure what's normal anymore.

So, we've had conversations where he has agreed to certain relationship like things. For example, he doesn't like apologising, saying sorry if he's messed up, but I said I need that. He said he could do it. When we discussed  his anti relationship views he said that he was re-evaluating that. He said he was considering and thinking about a relationship with me. I thought that's where we were headed.

But when he gets angry, if we've had a conversation about his previous relationships, he always says, ""no wonder I won't have a relationship"". ""What's the point in it?"" ""Get married? No, it ends up in divorce"". ""Why have a relationship if you can't have kids?"" (I can't have children). Or saying I'm proof of why he wouldn't get married, because I'm getting a divorce. He also has, I think, very contemptuous views of women in general. We've had a number of disagreements about his opinions.

Frankly I'm confused by all this. It seems to change for him. He's agreed we have some type of relationship, no label, and it's comfortable and suits him. He knows I want a relationship. He's still thinking about it. I really do understand that for the past 5 years he has reconciled himself to not having one and know I'm challenging that. I'm not trying to change his mind, I couldn't anyway. That's up to him. But it's so hurtful, some of the stuff he's said. I've been completely open and vulnerable with him. When I last talked to him about my concerns of being with him and him maybe never committing, he said that hopes I won't go. That's big for him. But I know if I'd walked, he wouldn't have said anything else to stop me. He doesn't behave like a boyfriend and isn't really affectionate. 

Despite this, I really like him. He has a brilliant mind, which I love. He's not my physical type at all but I feel so much. I'm guessing it's chemistry. I've never felt this before. He says he likes me but I've never felt more hurt by someone's words and actions.
He's a massive thinker, like me. I know the conversations we have, while disagreeing with me, he'll go away and think about it and I know some of my views have changed his.

Do I give him time to ""think"" about a relationship with me, given his previous/changing (?) mindset of being alone? I realise that these changes don't happen overnight. Or am I risking my heart on a lost cause?","After 20+year marriage ended, I'm (45f) at a loss with guy (44m) I'm seeing.

"It’s not even something I went looking for in his followers or something (honestly I would rather not know), but for some reason IG’s algorithm always suggests posts from the various Instagram models he follows. At first it sorta annoyed me (more like, why is IG constantly showing me this) but the more I see it the more sort of triggered I get. 

I think a lot of this also stems from the fact that he and I have been having some issues lately in bed which has just led to us not really having sex. He has sorta stopped initiating and now I don’t really want to as I don’t wanna put pressure on him. We’re only a year in so it’s a big deal to me.

I know social media in general can be so detrimental to people’s self image as it presents so many unrealistic beauty standards. Knowing that his feed is just filled with these beautiful women with perfect bodies coupled with our issues just makes me worried that he just isn’t sexually attracted to me. 

What sucks is that I used to feel pretty confident about myself when I was single and I feel a lot of shame about feeling so insecure.

And I feel a bit let down by him. I myself sort of judge guys that follow a bunch of IG models and hot influencers (esp on their public personal accounts) bc it seems so thirsty and weird. Even he himself has said stuff like his big red flag when he was on dating apps was coming across influencers with tons of posts of themselves, etc. bc he thinks they’re ridiculous. But then I found out he was literally on that dating app that you need to get invited to and that is basically all those people? So I sort of am seeing him differently now?

All of this combined is just making me feel less secure in general in our relationship. He’s so sweet but might get defensive if I bring up any of the underlying sort of touchy aspects of this issue. I also am scared to say anything bc I don’t want to expose how insecure I am about this. I’m not proud about it and it feels like a failing on my character. 

Sooo, sorry about the novel but has anyone else experienced similar issues? Do I say something or just try to get over it in time? I can feel myself becoming more distant probably as a defensive mechanism and I don’t want to ruin anything over something that maybe isn’t a big deal so would appreciate any perspective.",My (F32) BF (M36) follows so many IG models and it makes me insecure.

"This is hard to write bc I really do love my bf, we’ve been dating about 4 months. But we recently got into a big fight and it’s been hard to get past it. Over the phone I told him how the relationship felt a little one sided+ that I felt like I was the only one putting in most of the attention and effort. Then he blew up at me+ started complaining about how I was always so sad, or that I only wanted to talk about the news, and that I didn’t have time for him anymore. 

Which was surprising bc when we hang out it it’s always at my place. I give him gifts, while I still haven’t received any gifts from him in return. I have to initiate everything, even during sex, and I send the good morning texts+ usually don’t hear anything back until afternoon. Hanging out is on me, I have to suggest it, plan it, coordinate it. Also, not that it matters, but he can’t make me O and sometimes it feels like he’s only focused on himself during that, too. 

In fact part of his complaint was that one time when we had sex, he felt like I was only doing it bc I was angry + wanted stress relief. Which, yeah, I was. Why else would I, when he doesn’t make an effort to make it pleasurable for me+ I don’t get to O? Sometimes I’ve done it just bc I wanted to make him feel good, as an expression of love, but otherwise it’s good for stress. And it feels so shallow to say this but I’ve asked him multiple times to brush his teeth before he comes over+ then he’ll take a shower but not brush his teeth. His breath smells SO bad sometimes, but part of the problem is that he’s so sensitive to criticism that I don’t feel like I can tell him. I think it would just hurt his feelings+ I don’t want to hurt him. 

I tried explaining why I’m obsessed with the news: my family lives in one of the countries that might get nuked to shit by the U.S. depending on how the tide of the war goes, and that really stresses me tf out. And I’m always sad bc it hasn’t even been a full year since my brother died, and my parents won’t talk to me anymore. They’re separated but my mom is addicted to prescription drugs+ too high most of the time to even know what day it is. While my dad just completely withdrew when my brother died. I don’t blame him but damn does it hurt. 

I’m sad. I’m really really sad. The year started with my brother dying and might end with my family dying too. God damn am I stressed. But we talked it out+ came to a compromise, and he said he would appreciate it if I asked him if he was emotionally capable of hearing bad news before I told him about those types of things. But even after this, when I’ve asked+ he said it was ok, and I told him- it feels shallow. 

I told him about how I broke down about my brother, how alone I feel and he basically just went “wish there was something more I could do :/“. Like yeah, me too. I wish you’d do literally anything to help with this stress. But it feels like he just waits for me to make him happy, to show him love, and when it’s my turn he just kind of does the bare minimum. 

How do I even communicate this to him without setting him off again? I love him, I don’t want to hurt him. I’m devastated, I can’t help it that I’m obsessed with the war+ my brother’s death, I’m going through the worst time of my life rn but I want to give him all my love and kiss him to pieces and I just want to feel that in return.

"It’s been almost a year since i’ve been broken up with my ex. He was my first love (not first relationship but actually the first guy i loved), I was with him for 2 years and a half. I met him when I was 16 and we broke up when I was 19. I didn’t think I could ever move on until. I met another guy a few months after and at first it felt surreal. He was everything I ever wanted, our texts were on a different level, like full on novels, planned dates, we talked about our goals and they aligned so well and that was something I never had with my ex because he lacked a lot of emotional intelligence. I had always felt in my relationships that I could never love in the way I wanted because I loved writing paragraphs and I loved working things out. I loved doing acts of love and everyone i’ve been with didn’t have the same passion. This guy did. I felt as my energy was reciprocated and he treated me as if I were the girl of his dreams. I liked it for a week maybe until I started thinking about my ex and I missed the comfort I felt with my ex. I brushed it off as something that I would have to get used to and it being a new relationship but I found myself trying to resent him and run away from this because it wasn’t my ex. He allowed me to be open and there was nothing wrong with him. I just kept pushing away and self sabotage because I felt uncomfortable. I cut contact with him for a few months and he was understanding knowing my situation. Recently I reached out to apologize for my misbehavior in our situationship because I would cancel and for even leading him on. I met up (just to catch up nothing else) with him after 5 months of no contact and at first I felt the butterflies I felt at the beginning but I suddenly started feeling the discomfort I felt before.

"Me (19ftm) and my boyfriend (19M) have only been dating for a week but we’ve been friends for over a year. Despite the fact that I recently got out of a relationship, that was short and the two of us are compatible in many ways, though I was hesitant to start this because I was nervous that it could ruin our friendship. For some context about him, he’s in the national guard and will be deployed next year. We’re both autistic as well though both have very low support needs. This is some ways contributes to our communication issues.

That being said, I think I might’ve jumped into this too soon. 

Last night, we had an argument. I struggle with a lot of body insecurities, being trans, and long story short, he told me that sometimes he wished I had different anatomy so he could get me off easier. This hurt me, because I also have a host of health conditions which makes a partner doing that almost impossible. It’s something I’m very self conscious about. Needless to say, I did not take it well. I ended up hanging up the call and he sent me a host of messages apologizing. I called him back and we talked and I thought everything was fine.

Well, I woke up this morning and we were talking on the phone. Apparently his friend told him that it was “too early to have fights like this” and he should “think about things”
He’s stopped being affectionate over text and is only giving me one word answers. Everything feels weird. He’s picking me up from the airport when I get home and we have a date planned for a few weeks later. Just a few days ago he was telling me that he was falling in love with me and now he won’t even respond. 

I’m angry and upset and now I feel like me being too sensitive fucked everything up between us. I’m definitely falling in love with him too and I’ve had feelings for him a long time. I can see us being successful long term if we can work this out.

How can I talk to this man about long term plans and help him understand that was he said hurt me?

"I’m getting really frustrated bc my bf has been increasingly distant from me over several months. We’ve been dating for almost 2 years. We live together. He used to want to kiss me all the time, but now it’s rare that he does. I always have to initiate hugging or kissing or holding hands, which most of the time he pushes away from. He comes home from work and goes right on his video games, which wouldn’t be a problem if he wasn’t on it all night until after I fall asleep. This happens almost every night. I feel like he isn’t making time for me or paying attention to me. We rarely have sex or intimate moments anymore. The only time he wants to cuddle is rare and only when we’re in bed. One of my love languages is physical touch so it’s hard for me to feel close to him emotionally if we don’t have these moments. It feels like we’re roommates. I’ve been wanting to talk to him about this lately, but every time I bring it up, I feel like he isn’t taking me seriously. Nothing is changing. I feel like he pays more attention to the games and his “boys” than he does to me. I usually end up crying cause my frustration boils up and then he finally takes me seriously and we talk.

She told me her family came crashing apart because her mom served her dad and she found out as shit hit the fan. Her mom threw out her dad and almost immediately started working on packing up the home and listing it for sale.

My friend is still going to school, works and lives at home so she has her plate full, so this all blindsided her and now she needs to pack everything up. She went to go see her dad for a week and she didn't come back in good spirits. 

She already had her relationships with her parents being complicated. She was not interested in continuing going to church and being a part of her mom's religion and is scared to tell her when she's living there. Her dad was very much trying to steer her life and it caused a lot of stress.

She said she is overwhelmed, burnt out, and not handling what's going on very well. Her family is basically skipping Christmas and she loves Christmas and says she has 0 holiday spirit at home. School is not helping and work is stressing her out. 

I really want to help her, she's really sweet and kind and it sucks to see her like this. I went through a brutal divorce and also watched my mom's family destroy my childhood home, so I kind understand what it's like. Although I don't want to do anything that's too far or not my place.

"A little over a week ago, I (25f) found out my boyfriend (32m) cheated on me back when I was pregnant with our son (3m). When it happened, we were living together. However, we had a big argument and I went to go stay with my mom for a couple nights. He told me he was going camping, but he picked up some other woman and took her to the hot springs, got a hotel room with her, took MDMA and had sex with her. 

When he returned, he wrote me a letter expressing how he was going to be the man I (and our unborn child) needed. We tried to work on our relationship for a few months afterwards, but it didn’t work out at that time. We got back together a few months ago, and a little over a week ago I found out about what happened. Initially, he lied and told me it happened while we were broken up. After more conversation, I found out it happened while we were still very much together. Not because he was upfront, but because he accidentally gave me a timeline. This woman has a boyfriend &amp; based on a little Facebook stalking, it appeared to me they were together during that time. I wanted to message the boyfriend, but my boyfriend swore up and down that they were not together and he had only met this girl in person once &amp; he barely ever talked to her before that night. (he says he never said he only met her once, but I remember him saying that). I forgave him &amp; honestly moved on for the most part. I did ask to see messages between them &amp; conveniently he had already deleted them. 

Fast toward to today- he saw a screenshot in my phone of the message I was going to send this woman’s boyfriend but never did. He said to me “Oh he already hates me.” How is that, when “he’s only met her once” &amp; “barely talked to her at all besides that one night” &amp; she supposedly wasn’t even with the guy at that time? And what reason would he have to hate my boyfriend other than something to do with her? He then told me they all met at the same time before he met me &amp; the guy hates him for something unrelated.

"I met this girl in my short time working at a restaurant as a cook.

She was the manager there, and her mom was the owner. At the time we were both dating but were in super toxic relationships.

Her mom for whatever reason really REALLY liked me, after my first month working she would often in her native tongue call me her son. I also got along insanely well with the girl too, Ive never had a relationship with a girl where I just instantly clicked with them on a platonic level.

It was against my principles to be unfaithful, but there were definitely times where it got close or it could have gotten bad, but I always stopped myself because I felt so ashamed.

She ended up breaking up with her bf first, and I was still with my gf.

As you can probably guess, the timing between us was always off.

Whenever Id hang out with her outside of work, someone would mention how great we would be together, even sometimes strangers we would meet would just assume we were dating. I always piped up before things could get awkward by just saying we were good friends or something like that.

Anyways, it was a long time coming, I broke up with my gf a couple months after her.

Im working at some tech company now, but I kept in touch with her and her mom throughout everything.

I wanted to pursue her but she dropped the bomb on me that she had found someone else.

Its been like 3 months now and they are together.

I know the guy, he isnt a good friend but Im connected to him through mutual friends, Ive had some conversations with him prior.

"I've been trying to plan a little holiday party get-together with my gf, my best friend (call him Brandon), and a couple of my neighbors at my apartment that I've been trying to make friends with.

Some background: I am moving 30 minutes away at the end of the month shortly after Christmas, from my apartment to a house.

Anyway, so I've been trying to make these plans all week, working around everyone's schedules. I'm going to my parents house on Sunday until after Christmas. I told my gf all of this at the start of the week. At some point I also said ""wanna give each other our presents on Saturday?"" and she said yes.

Yesterday, I get Brandon's work schedule. He is off Thursday, and works closing shifts Friday and Saturday. So I text my neighbors asking if Thursday works for them. I tell my gf we will do the party Thursday if they're available.

Today, my neighbors reply saying they're busy Thursday. So I suggest Friday or Saturday, since we could do it in the afternoon before Brandon goes to work. Saturday works for them! One of them gets off work at 5, them and Brandon would basically trade places since he goes to work at 5. Best I can do to work around everyone's schedules. I figure the party can go from like, 3 or 4 to 7 or something. Just long enough to play a game or two of Monopoly or something. I figure we can give each other our presents before or after the party since it won't be long.

(Friday does not work, as my gf is busy until the evening, and Brandon works the closing shift)

I tell my girlfriend, excited. She is not excited. She says she was planning for us to spend that entire day alone together (watching Christmas movies, snuggling, etc, alongside exchanging presents) since it is the last day before I leave for my parents', but she didn't tell me until just now. She says it is common sense and I should have known and I should want to do that too. I told her I have never done that with any of my exes before, and asked if we could do it any other day before then, but apparently one of her presents for me arrives Saturday, which she also didn't tell me until just now.

The same thing happened to us around Halloween time, when our previous plans fell through due to inclimate weather, and I said we should have some friends over and do halloween stuff. She also wanted to do that alone and didn't tell me, and reacted similarly. I told her after that fight that in the future she cannot expect me to read her mind on things like this and that she has to tell me when she wants me all to herself like that for a day, and that this is how clashes like this are avoided.

She has told me I've ruined every major holiday for her this year and that I'm on track to ruin New Year's for her too.

I don't know what I did wrong. I feel like avoiding these fights is impossible if I can't expect my partner to communicate their plans to me in a timely manner.

"Hi reddit, I have a girlfriend who's in a very depressive episode at the moment. She is non responsive (No calls or texts) and in the care of her brother, so we have not seen each other in weeks. She has essentially 'ghosted' me.  
  
I have been sending her messages of affirmation, basically saying im there for here and I love her etc. She leaves these messages on seen and does not reply to any other messages either.  
  
Are my messages of affirmation and support helping her at all? When you're in a depressed mood, do you appreciate things like that even though you dont reply? She hasn't told me to stop or go away so far, so it at least isn't doing any harm I think.  
  
Btw she has told me she still loves me and she predicted this was going to happen while her depression was ramping up so I was already prepared.

"OK, disclaimer context, I’m not too stupid my intuition is sort of on point, I’m just unsure and I was raised sheltered. Im also not looking for a relationship atm, but I’m ok w one if the best guy for my life journey atm shows up. Im not unaware of my ability to become easily attached AND I enjoy attention from specific ppl bc it distracts me from being anxious at times, it’s how I cope atm! I don’t feel right or wrong, I’m just looking to find myself and understand myself better, so be nice pls.

Ok so, long story short, there’s a guy at my gym that shows me attention, and that I feel like I’ve sort of become friends with. (It’s been 4months since we met &amp; I go to the gym daily and so does he). In him hitting on me and flirting w me, he also talks to any and every other “attractive” woman that he can get the attention of. This doesn’t bother me to where I feel jealous necessarily, but it bothers me to where I feel like I look stupid to everyone around bc I continue being flirtatious w him, although everyone knows he flirts w anyone that’ll show him the attention back. How I feel kinda confuses me, bc I don’t think I’m jealous, but I feel a bit of an ick, but not enough to block him from interacting w me or ignoring him in the gym. Tbh I enjoy our interactions, like I said I’m a bit attached to them, but I can’t help but feel so stupid looking. Is this how it may look to everyone else?

Sidenote: no one around me knows this but we have had conversations abt marriage and dating, etc and he doesn’t want any of that, he literally just wants to do what he’s doing, which is mess with anyone that he can. I can be honest and say that I do have the tiniest bit of pick me in my heart (childhood trauma based maybe) to where I hear what he’s saying, but bc of how I interact w him outside of the gym, like talking, texting, somewhat sexual, etc, I find myself randomly feeling and increasing feeling of “maybe just maybe”… I hate that tbh, bc I know that won’t happen, nonetheless, my mind creates scenarios where it might… He is not my ideal partner at all, but with me being in my early 20s, just graduating college and “getting into the real world”, I find men like this curious and somewhat intriguing. I hear stories about how these men are unsure and only a plan for failure, but I haven’t experienced it myself… and I don’t want too, but it’s a thought bubble in my head bc, I don’t understand how a male on his 30s, wouldn’t fall for an attractive woman in her 20s, says they don’t want a partner, but constantly tries to speak to women just to, “become friends w them”… I’ve asked him why he does that before, and he says he wants to become friends w them, and obv that “friendship” is the same type “friendship” he has with me… or maybe it isn’t idk… I just don’t understand why he does this, and why I can’t feel enough of an ick to cut him off. Typically when I was younger and dating I’d say, f any guy that doesn’t want to talk with or “choose” only me… and it was towards any and all guys, even the ones that liked me and I didn’t like back.
Now, it’s less of that and more of me saying to myself: “well I would like it if a guy would just be focused on me, but bc I’m not desperate for a bf rn, so this guy isn’t a problem, is he?”… while simultaneously feeling a bit of, “ be more serious and more concerned abt how I look. Do people see me as a sucker even tho no one knows if we’re having sex or if I’m falling for him etc… 

Lastly, i get major anxiety texting him, like I bet the butterflies that feel like I like him but it’s really just nervousness from a gut feeling that no interaction w him actually matters to him, and that it’s just a phase in his life that leads to nothing and ends, and then a new one will start for him. I don’t have a problem w anyone having this mindset, I truly just do not understand why or how ppl think this way and but id love to so it doesn’t stump me from me being naive to it.

There’s so much I want to learn and understand in becoming an actual adult, but in this make interaction category, I don’t have the best experience… can someone decipher what I’m

"So I have been with my girlfriend for about 7 months now and it’s been super great. She’s a great person who is very friendly with everyone, and in turn a lot of her friends (including one of her closest) are guys. I also trust my her 100% that she would do anything to hurt me, but for some reason I feel a lot of jealousy whenever she does go and see these friends. There has been some incidents where I was with them and something happened that made me uncomfortable- one night out at the bar we ran into one of her closest friends, and he was very drunk and proceeded to grab her by the face while talking, we all talked about it together and he apologized for making her uncomfortable with that it’s all water under the bridge now. Anyway, whenever she goes and sees them I feel very jealous, even tho I have no real reason to feel that way and I feel very selfish that I do feel that way.

"Hi all,
This is my first time doing a post like this so bare with me if I miss out any details.
My girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) both are in our first year of university and have been going strong for almost 3 years now. Since moving to university, obviously friendship groups change and you become a different person, however there are small details my girlfriend has started to lie/ leave out of conversations.
For context, we do not live together and we were both keen on having separate friend groups and time apart from each other as that is what we were used to. We do cross between friendship groups of course, but I’ve always been keen on the independence.
Initially, it was about her using sunbeds  (something I wasn’t too fond on her doing but never going to be the boyfriend to tell her she can’t do things). She had never used one before but had brought 50 minutes with her new friend. When I asked her about it she said “she had never tried one” but I later found out that she had through a photo she had taken whist she was there. We talked it out and she apologised and we moved on.
A couple weeks later, I came across a video of her vaping (a huge trust issue I’ve had with her as I always had a suspicion she did but never admitted it). We spoke about it again and she said she was really drunk and couldn’t remember it, again apologised. We were a bit rocky at this stage and she thought it might be best to take a break. However, I persisted to keep going and we were doing really well, booking a gate away for the end of the year to celebrate our anniversary.

She got drunk the other night and took a nude but did not send it to me and couldn’t remember taking the photo (found it on her phone). I also looked though a chat with another boy of one of her friends (whist trying to find out wether she got spiked or not) and found this person calling her sexy and reminding her that apparently she said “if I wasn’t dating my boyfriend, we (her and the boy) would be a thing” and that she “wasn’t too sure what I want”.

I’m left in a really strange spot, I think the plan I’m going to do is speak to the guy about it (as I’ve already spoken to my gf and have gotten her side to the story) to see what he will say. The girlfriend is saying he was just trying to wind him up and can’t remember what she said fully.
I really do love this girl and willing to battle through anything with her, but I think university life is getting to her and don’t want to keep doing this

If there’s anyone can give any advice to this situation, that would be great. Thanks",Girlfriend (18F) starts to lie/ not fully communicate - what do I do going forward?

TLDR: Trying to make this as short as possible. My post history gives more back story. 

We recently started talking again after he relentlessly pursued me. He’d broken up with me, and I’d resisted getting back together as long as I could. Even when he convinced me, it was under pressure.

He told me he changed and apologized and took accountability for his part in the toxicity. From what I could see, it was genuine. I still wanted time to work on myself and go from there, but the persistence made me cave. 

This is going to show a toxic unhealed part of myself. A few weeks ago I blocked him on Instagram while very drunk. He was leaving me on read in messages again, and had stopped the whole pursuing thing. It triggered what had happened previously in our relationship. The love-bombing at the start, to bare minimum. 

Anyways, I obviously unblocked him, but it was a conversation because he ended up somehow seeing whose pics I was liking. It was someone who I met once who he noticed and got super mad about, saying I had to block him. He takes high quality nature pics, it wasn’t shirtless sexy dude or anything. 

That turned into a whole fight and eventually I deleted the app and said I’d deactivate my account when allowed (it had barely been up, so I couldn’t then). That progressed to further arguments and him saying next time I activate it, I’m going to block whoever he says to. 

Then he checked the phone plan to see who I’d been talking to. I didn’t want to, and eventually caved. It was someone I had previously been employed by whose number he’d noticed. He was fine after he saw that, but I’m guessing he’d going thru as much as he can now. 

He has a camera at my place because I’ve let him store some valuables, even when we weren’t together (it was that or pay him money I apparently owe him). He told me he knows it makes me uncomfortable, but he’ll move it soon. He’s said that for months. My place is secure and i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. 

Recently I saw an ad on cl for an Amazon gift card in exchange to listening and offering insight to someone’s relationship. I decided to check it out and was talking to them on the phone. Suddenly I get a text from him saying he’s getting notifications from the camera. It goes that a lot, even when I’m not around he’s said. Before I have time to reply he calls me and says he saw the notifications and heard my conversation. Then he hung up on me. I called back to explain and he said I better get back to work, and did that again. 

I feel stupid because he would always ask about the camera and bring up whether I could see the light blinking. I found out there’s a way to not show its recording and I think he’s been messing with me. For example, I just saw the light turn on, so idk how this works. 

After leaving me in the dust, he texts yesterday to tell me he’s coming by to pickup some of his clothes to go out for his bday. I said I’m not there and he has a key so he went over. He’s shown up a few times unannounced when I asked him not to. He also disregards most boundaries. 

Today I wished him a happy bday and he didn’t reply. It seems I’ve been ghosted and I’m wondering where to go from here. He has a bunch of his stuff at my place and is always very intimidating and mean when things don’t go his way. He said if we breakup, he’ll take me to court for all the money I owe him (he helped with rent last month since he said he’d take care of me, then turned the table).

But we went to a Christmas party recently and she spent alot of time hanging around him, I thought it was strange but again I didn't think much of it.

I then clicked on the chat to see lots of messages to one another but didn't have time to read them because she gripped me by the face and ripped her phone back. She told me there was nothing suspicious going on and they were just friends. She talked me down but I was still having doubts, I then asked if I could see these messages to which she replied that she deleted him and the messages went also, she has since added him back a couple of times.

"As the title states I (26 M) got dumped by my (24 F) ex about 5 months ago (even though we didn’t actually fully split until recently) our problem was that I was her first everything and her longest relationship with someone. She began to explain to me some time ago that she wants to have fun and experience life more but after talking we both essentially broke down that the reason shes dumping me and why we can’t be together is that she feels she needs to have experiences with other people sexually and if she doesn’t she’ll eventually hate me for it later on and doesn’t want to do something she’ll regret. I personally don’t think this is a fair way to think about it and this had never been an issue between us before as our relationship had been good all these years.

"I'm mom (30f). Dad (33m) and kiddo (4f) and I have always lived together. Kiddo is our first kid and only kid.

Kiddo is a typical 4 year old. She colors, loves TV and the usual. She attends day care regularly, for 8-10 hours a day.

I believe that dad constantly paints me as the bad guy. He never reacts to Kiddo's doings- coloring on furniture, climbing stuff she shouldn't, whining, ect. I do notice, and I try to make corrections. 

We're all sitting in the living room, watching a movie. Kiddo takes a couch pillow, tosses it from the couch, over the coffee table and on the floor (throwing is her new thing). Well, the pillow knocked stuff off the table in flight- and I tell her to go to time out. Throwing is not okay in the house for any reason, and this is not the first time even recently.

Dad and I are tense with each other to say the least- that's for a different day. But I'm mad because it's always on me to react and to clean up- I get no support from him. He claims it would be double jeopardy for him to back me up. I'm mad about it today because he knows I'm fighting off a cold and I had a physical therapy session- yet I'm the one who gets up to get the towels to clean up the cup that the pillow caused to spill.

"Me (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) (who I'll call Jackson) have been dating for a year and 4 months. For the last 3/4 months I have been feeling frustrated with Jackson. He struggles with severe levels of depression and anxiety. He even has a registered service dog to help him. Because of his mental illnesses, he has a very hard time regularly taking showers and keeping his spaces clean. Which I understand. I also struggle with depression and anxiety but not at the same level of Jackson. For most of our relationship I have done nothing but supported him, I've clean his entire living space multiple times, I ask him what's wrong and if he wants to talk about anything, I'll research solutions to his problems, I'll make him dinner all in an effort to help him out. And in response I usually get maybe a quick thank you then he will continue to complain about the problem he's struggling with or act cold and distant and refuses to talk. I understand that doing nice things for him or letting him vent won't solve his problems, and his mental illness won't magically go away. But it can become discouraging when I put so much effort into trying to help and I barely get a thank you in response. He's always asleep and when he's not asleep he is pissed off at something and/or complaining that he's in pain or he's upset. And I honestly feel like a broken record saying ""Take a bath"", ""What's wrong?"", ""Take some medicine"", ""Eat some food"", ""Are you okay?"" Etc. And It becomes so exhausting when I never get to see my boyfriend in a good mood, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to fix it. Every time I'm with him, he is in such a bad mood that eventually I get in a bad mood as well, But! He can't know I'm in a bad mood! Because that will make him feel even worse. It's been so exhausting I have stopped helping keep his space clean as it gets so bad but then I get frustrated as I spend all of my time at his house in that messy environment, which makes him in turn anxious because he gets worried I judge him for his mess. His solution to this problem was to stop letting me into his room all together instead of trying to clean his room. He also does this with his bathroom making me go to his siblings bathroom anytime I need to use it. As I spend all of my time at his house, when I need to eat, he never has food in the basement and I don't like going upstairs because I don't want to take food from his parent's kitchen as I'm not super close with them and they are very intimating but he refuses to go upstairs to get me food because if he's not hungry it's not his problem but when he's at my house and is hungry he will get frustrated and will beg me to get him food. This is a reoccurring problem as he constantly expects things from me that he won't ever do for me which becomes very frustrating. We always do what he wants to do or he will be in a bad mood all day. I've spoken to him about this problem multiple times, which all ended in a similar way. He says he has no energy to get better and that he will try to put in more effort but he won't promise anything. I've talked about him maybe possibly trying therapy or medication for his depression and anxiety but he refuses those options as well.

  
Me and Jackson have been raising a kitten together for the last 6/7 months, and my bestfriend (18F) a kitten from the same litter. The kittens are siblings and see eachother every few weeks and are close. I am emotionally attached to our cat (which I'll call Lily) She is attached to me more then anyone else, Jackson's family regularly joke about how Lily likes me the most. I love her so much and I cry even thinking about never seeing her again. I raised this kitten as much as Jackson did, but I don't feel entitled to her in any way considering that Lily lives at Jackson's house and his parents pay for her basic needs along with medical care. My boyfriend also struggles to take care of Lily. He lets her litter box collect for weeks and lets her freely eat whenever and however much she wants. He gets upset with her when she does typical cat things, and when I try to explain that you can't train a cat the same way a dog he doesn't listen and gets frustrated.

  
Lily is one of the main reasons I'm still with Jackson as even though I do love him I don't see him trying to change or fix himself anytime in the near future. Some of the other reasons I've been hesitant to break up with Jackson are; I don't want to separate Lily and her brother from never seeing each other again, I'm worried if I break up with him he'll try to hurt himself, We share some of our finances and, we both are one of the only friends we have. I'm only eighteen and he often brings up marriage and we both have separate options on wanting kids. I just feel like I'm so young and have so much ahead of me. I know that we probably aren't going to last, which does make me sad but I'm starting to accept. I'm not really sure how to go about breaking up with him. I know that it'll destroy him and I feel so guilty even thinking about leaving.

  
Any advice on what to do with Lily and how to break up with Jackson would be appreciated.

"My partner and I own our house and our roommates are considered lodgers. Our roommates are my boyfriends friend and his girlfriend. 

About 2 days ago (1 day before they were meant to move out), our roommates finally decided to start packing up their things (they’ve had months of notice). They spent all day yesterday cleaning and packing but they didn’t finish so they asked me if they could stay one more night and they’ll finish packing in the morning and leave and I said that was fine. 

Fast forward to today, it is well into the afternoon and they’ve made no effort to do any packing today. I have family coming over for Christmas and I would like them gone so I can start cleaning and putting together furniture for when my family arrives. 

The girlfriend also told me that she used up some of my cleaning supplies and I don’t think she’ll replace them, and they have not paid rent for the past week and it is due today.

"I started a new job recently and now work predominantly with a lot of women around my age. They are all well educated, most of them are attractive and a good number of them are very attractive. I had been married since my early 20s and honestly NEVER flirted with girls I would encounter throughout my day. I feel pretty stupid asking this question but I really dont know how to interpret some of my encounters with these girls I'm working with. 

I'm not the only guy, theres a good number of men around in this workplace too. You could say I'm a reasonably attractive guy. I'm almost 6ft and workout regularly. One of the girls I work with has told me multiple times I'm handsome, has touched me on the shoulder in conversation and talks to me often. I start to pay more attention to her and I'm trying to figure out if she's dropping hints or not and then out of the blue she's talking about her boyfriend within earshot of me. I'm like wtf? I would never act like that if I was in a relationship. 

A lot of these girls are married or have boyfriends but still seemingly ""flirt"". Honestly I don't know how to handel this. If I know a girl is invested in a relationship im not interested at all. I despise people who cheat, fool around and act flirtatious when they are committed. 

Some of these girls I catch looking at me, and I feel like are giving me eyes. They look at me all the fucking time. I kind of feel like I was just Tom Hanks in cast away trying to reaquiant myself to civilization.  I really dont know what is happening around me. 

This probably sounds so stupid.

"i met this guy at a party roughly 2 months. i know it's not long, but a LOT happened. we have mutual friends, i've known him for a while but he had a girlfriend for most of the time so i never saw him in that way- but always known he is a nice guy. we flirted all night.

so, after the party, we start dating. things move weirdly quickly. almost immediately we call each other every day, have lots of sex, go on dates, stay at each other's houses while the other is working. i decide this is probably kind of unhealthy because like i said, we have mutual friends and they've told me he just got out of a 3 year long relationship 3 months ago (meaning i'm just a rebound). i have also just gotten out of a little situationship- nowhere near the same scale, and i'm over her, but still upset at the fact i ruined a friendship over it (different story). also, this girl i used to date was the OPPOSITE of him and it's throwing me off. she was exactly the same as me - very verbose, overthinker, emotional, same taste in music fashion tv and everything. now, i get on with the guy obviously, and he objectively treats me way better than she (or anyone) ever did, but i don't like the fact that we don't have these superficial differences in common. like little things like the way he dresses, but also i also realise that while very open minded, he is way more traditional than me and very much into the idea of kids/marriage/mortgage one day. he believes in god, has friends who are lowkey homophobic even though he isn't himself etc etc. so i decide that  i don't want anything long term with him, and i've got to cut it off to prevent anyone getting confused. i tell him this straight up essentially, and tell him we should talk less. i've also been feeling ill and overwhelmed for the last 3 weeks of us talking (it's been like 6 weeks in total roughly, idk not doing the maths). i am very against the idea of committing to someone with differing values to me.

he is a little upset but agrees. i'm shocked because he backs off almost instantly, never calling or anything. i can tell he is prioritising his uni work and stuff over me, which is what i wanted him to do, but i kinda miss him now. anyway, i find out i'm pregnant, which is why i've been feeling ill. we slept together pretty much on the first date, and the condom slipped off halfway through so we just kept on doing it raw. i obviously tell him, and we decide that i'm getting an abortion. i end up not telling very many people in my life because of reasons i won't get into right now- but he basically does the same thing. so we are both relying on each other for emotional support for like 2 weeks. he took me to the scan, looked after me during the actual abortion, and both of those turned into like 2 day long dates. i don't know if we would have even met up again if i hadn't got pregnant- or definitely not so soon. i feel like i wouldn't have given him a chance as i wouldn't have wanted to fall for someone i wasn't sure about- im super picky.

he admits that he was a little upset when i initially said we should talk less but is glad we took a break so that he could stop revolving his life around me. so, now we have a less obsessive relationship but we are definitely dating again. but we have this weird new bond now. because we've admitted we probably weren't gna be together long term, both of us were just acting completely natural. i can't explain it, like he wasn't trying to impress me anymore and vice versa. i end up learning stuff from him - like how to be stoic and focus on the greater picture. and he learns stuff from me, like how to talk about his emotions (eg about  how he felt the abortion). also superficial stuff like i played video games and liked it, and he did yoga with me. we would have super deep convos and then end up playfighting. i genuinely feel like we built a deep [friendship.](https://friendship.is) but is it just a trauma bond?

like i said, no one's ever treated me this good, i feel like a princess. he has seen me at my most emotionally unstable (the pregnancy fucked with me) and remained so calm and kind. i probably don't want kids ever, but he would obviously have been SUCH a good dad.  the sex is genuinely the best i've ever had. he makes me feel like i'm not broken, like i'm fine the way i am. however, i asked him what he wants and he said he doesn't know, and that he just wants to date me and find out. i've obviously caught feelings now that my original plan to just back off from him was ruined by the pregnancy. so we both don't know what we want. i could just stop talking to him now that the whole pregnancy thing is over. but i'm having so much fun, and we are only young.

like i said, not many people around me know the full story. they just know that i said i was going to stop talking to him, and i didn't. so they all think i'm just denying my feelings. also, everyone who knows him knows he is a ""great guy"". so, long story short, they all want us to be endgame. i still don't know if we are long-term compatible at all. that was my original judgement- surely i shouldn't ignore it? also, the recent split from his girlfriend? i don't know what to do or where this is going. i don't mind being in a situationship i just don't want it to end badly, i think.

TL;DR: i got with someone and initially wanted it to be a casual fling. i tried to end it because i thought we were too different, but found out i was pregnant. after going through abortion and stuff with him, i've started to really like his character and catch feelings for him. not sure if this is healthy or if i should just end it.",am i (21f) only with him (21m) because he got me pregnant?,18nd4m5,1703129046.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nd4m5/am_i_21f_only_with_him_21m_because_he_got_me/,

This week, she said she liked me. I said, “Ok. I like you too, but my first concern is your safety.” And left it at that. She had been calling me in anguish about her feelings: she cannot accept the age gap, but she misses me. I told her to see a counsellor.

I told her I’ll work from home told her Friday so that she can sort herself out.

At this moment, I just want to draw the line and say, “It’s not personal, but I don’t date colleagues.”

I'm a 30 something divorced mom with my life together. I own my own home in a great area. I'm an attentive mom. I have a good job, I volunteer, and am respected in my community.

I also have a lot of things in my past that have weighed on my ability to maintain reasonable self-esteem, which I think is playing into this.

After getting divorced a few years ago, I jumped right into dating, desperate for companionship I lacked in my marriage. I, within a few months, met a guy that was everything I thought I wanted. Handsome, ambitious, and so attentive He was SO sure and I wanted to go slow. 

Now, I am not without fault, but I feel like he presented himself differently when we first started dating. He always worked from home and drank a lot, but in his attempt to drink less, he started smoking pot again. I'm not opposed to this as long as it doesn't interfere with life.

All he has wanted to do for the last several months is play video games and get stoned. He barely cleans anymore. We used to go out with his friends and spend quality time together. Now, even when we're together, he just wants to be distracted.

I don't doubt his love for me or my love for him. We deeply care about each other, but I'm finding that I'm not finding satisfaction in this lifestyle. I started this very hesitant to take it seriously, but he pushed ahead with making plans to move in, buy a house, and get married. I knew I, and more importantly my kids, were not ready for that so I pushed ahead with the my life and we mutually decided on the idea that we would get there.

Years later, I can't even mention any of those steps or I'm pressuring him. We only see each other 8 days a month when we both don't have our kids.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. I’ve never met his sister but from what I’ve been told I’m not allowed to meet her cause she’s trouble according to him. A long history of lashing out/airing out dirty laundry or making up lies about family on social media. This was fine with me I didn’t really care to open my life up to drama like that.

Earlier today I saw that she had reached out to me over Facebook messenger. I didn’t realize drama was going on today so I shot him a quick text about it and read it. To summarize it was her going on to say my boyfriend had blocked her today, calling him names, being very ridiculous and telling me to screenshot it and send it to him. After reading that I regretted telling him she had text me and wished I had just read it and ignored it. I could tell there’s obviously something seriously wrong and that she wanted me to tell him. So I try to tell him after he asks me to screenshot it that I don’t think I should and it seems like that’s what she wants. I proceed to try and reason with him. I try to tell him to let it go and I don’t want to send him a screenshot of it.

He ends up getting his way, I send it and say “this is just a cry for help” in my eyes no sane person would say this type of stuff to their brother’s girlfriend whom they’ve never met. This was partially an attempt to reason with him and prevent him from unblocking her and giving in to what she wanted. Unfortunately this was the wrong thing to say as I was greeted with a paragraph on how I have no idea what the situation is and how it isn’t my business. I explain my side that no “normal” person would do this kind of thing. I ended it by saying I felt bad for her and everyone involved. Apparently not the right thing to say either. I end up leaving him on read and moved on. He has outburst’s similar to this constantly.

Later on he calls me back to apologize and explain a little better. I tell him I understand but I didn’t appreciate him blowing up on me when I was only dragged into this. Proceeds to blow up on me again and I hang up. Afterwards I get 2 gigantic paragraphs on how I’m wrong and it’s none of my business. I leave him on read once again because like I said this is common. He didn’t want to speak to me the rest of the night. 

I’m so tired of all the fighting. Is this going to be my life from now on? We have terribly egregious fights so often where he dog piles me with his words and I can’t say anything because it’s just going to make him more upset. I fear this may only get worse in the future.

Hey everyone, so basically, I [19M] started staying at my [24M] friends house for the past 2 months, he has a girlfriend, and she has a [18F] sister, let's call her Amy.

Until about a month ago, Amy and I didn't really speak much, until one night, we both just started breaking the ice with eachother, we spoke in the lounge until about 2 in the morning even though she had finals at 8 the next morning.
From there, we'd been starting to speak more gradually, we'd basically speak in the lounge while watching movies or whatever until 12-2 in the morning, we realised we both have quite a lot in common, we have the same personality type, have a fair amount of interest in common, I've started teaching her how to cook, she even started watching football with me and seems really into it. 

At the time, I had been a month out of my 3 year relationship, so I wasn't really looking to getting into anything as I was still quite hurt from everything. 

While speaking in the lounge until late, I've noticed her body language is really towards me if that makes sense, she faces my way and brushes her hair a lot, not sure if that means anything though. She asked me why I stayed up so late, I told her it's nice speaking to her, she said it's mutual.

Shortly after, I found her Instagram account and saw she has a boyfriend, so I was a bit confused to be honest. She did bring him up not too long after that, so it's not like she was planning on hiding him from me. She saw him for that weekend, and before, she mentioned she didn't really feel like seeing him, since they hadn't seen eachother for 3 months, and their texts were one worded. 

Fast forward to last week, I went out to a club with my friend, his gf and Amy. When we got just above tipsy I noticed she started having more physical contact, such as playfully hitting me and things like that, which she doesn't normally do. This is where things started becoming really confusing to me, so my friend and his sister decided to go home, with the car, so we stayed there a bit longer. When we did decide to leave I asked Amy if she wanted to Uber, she said she would prefer walking (which was a 30 minute walk at 2). We started walking and we randomly started holding hands, she asked if it's weird, I just said no it's all good. Maybe it was because she was drunkish or scared I'm not sure, but the fact that she has a long distance relationship boyfriend and did that started making me ask questions. 

And what makes me question it more, she has a male friend who likes her, and especially recently he has been seeing her more and visiting, he admitted to liking her 2 weeks ago, she told him she doesn't like him and has a boyfriend, they agreed to continuing being friends, and shortly he came over and we were watching a movie with the family, and he was sitting next to her, and was holding her leg, I saw she was uncomfortable. She told me the next day that she didn't know what to do in that situation, and she was very uncomfortable with everything, which makes me wonder why she wasn't uncomfortable with holding my hands for 30 minutes, maybe just the alcohol?

We've still been speaking for the past week, and didn't bring up anything about holding hands, so I'm not sure what to do with that, because I feel like I want to know from her why she did that, but I don't want to ask her directly because it might make things awkward between us, so I'm trying asking her if how her boyfriend would feel about the situation by starting the conversation.

"I won’t get into too many details, because I could write a whole book on this. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. Over the course of the past 3 years, my boyfriend and I have had the same fight over several issues. Much of this has taken a toll on me, physically and emotionally. I really thought at one point that the only option to truly heal from the damage was to leave him completely. 

We recently started seeing a couples counselor. He has recently apologized for one event. However, I don’t feel…. exactly forgiving. I feel that what would be healing is a real heartfelt and genuine apology on how he has been doing this hurtful thing several times throughout the majority of our relationship. I would like him to apologize for not only his fault in this one recent situation, but apologize for how he’s been doing this for the past 3 years. The damage is a lot worse because of how repeatedly I have been hurt by his actions in the past. 

We really like our couples counselor and agree on the suggestions for improvement that she has given to us thus far. She told me that I need to let go of the past and only focus on events that are affecting us in the present. So because my boyfriend is apologizing for this one current problem, I need to forgive and move on from it. 

But I don’t feel like I can forgive that easily. I feel that the damage is so much more significant, and I feel that I’m going to struggle to fully forgive him if he isn’t sorry for how he’s been putting me through the ringer for so many years.

I’ve (36m) been dating my gf (35f) for almost a year. Shes great and so is her mom(63f). Gf was married 10 years and divorced a few years ago.  Gfs dad (deceased) owned a company and hired the ex about 9 years ago. The dad paid the ex well because he is married to his daughter. The dad suddenly died 7 years ago. GFs mom was a stay at home mom and inherited the business. It’s a small consulting business of about 15 people and respectable revenue. 

About 1 month into dating the GF told me the ex worked for the family business. I thought it was weird given the divorce wasn’t amicable but wasn’t bothered by it much. A couple months later the gf informs me her ex makes in excess of $400k a year. The ex does sales and I’m sure he does a good job but it sounds like he’s getting the friends and family commission rate. My gf asked her mom to get rid of her ex before I came into the picture. Her mom isn’t business savvy and has empathized with gf’s discomfort but is reluctant to get rid of him. The mom says she has no other reason to get rid of him and is worried the ex will treat my gf worse than he already does amongst other reasons.  I suspect the ex is a key player and the mom doesn’t know how to replace him.

The ex was very emotionally abusive especially toward the end. Gfs mom is aware of the abuse and thinks poorly of the ex. 

I explained to the gf that the situation doesn’t bother me much now but I am not comfortable getting married in the future with her ex being employed by her mom. Gf makes a decent living and works her ass off. They have two kids. The ex pays max child support which is about $3k. 

The gf will talk about money on occasion and not being able to afford things like private school and vacation for the kids. I suggested to the gf it’s a little strange that her mom pays her ex handsomely when she could be giving the opportunity to her daughter who in my opinion is capable of doing the job. I asked her why she doesn’t cut the commission rates since she admitted her dead father made them generously high. She doesn’t know. I suspect her mom is afraid to alter the rates and fears upsetting the ex.

It may be insecurity but I know I can’t go into a long term situation and get close to the gfs mom and fam while the ex is treated so well. I make decent money and I’m secure with who I am but I will have a constant reminder of the generosity afforded to the abusive ex. 
Kids say stupid stuff. I know they’ll be commenting on the places we dine or vacation and asking why we don’t go to the higher end places like they do at his dads. Amongst many other small reminders of the situation. 

Gf has had several conversations with her mom about letting the ex go in the last few months. They always go the same. 

I didn’t ask the gf to talk to her mom. I made it explicitly clear that it’s not my business and if she wants to ask her mom then to only do so for herself. If the mom moves to get rid of the ex things could get messy. The ex will very likely not be able to make the same money elsewhere and his identity is tied to the income. 

The situation will drive me nuts in the long term. I’m about at the point where I’m going to breakup with her because I don’t want to waste her time and Im exhausted after months of gently explaining that the situation isn’t going to work only to have her talk to her mom and have the same conversation. 

Some of this is insecurity and I recognize that but I’m only human. I know his continued employment will cause a lot of personal frustration for me which will likely ruin my relationship with my gf long term. The ex flaunts the family’s reliance on him in small ways. Some they see and some they don’t. It’s embarassing.

Hi guys I am a 22(F) and been seeing a 23(M) for about a year. We met while in South America, and live in opposite ends of the US. We have basically never stopped talking since meeting since it was such a great connection, and seen each other in our respective homes as well as other parts of the country whenever we have the time/money. These visits are usually two week long intense periods of being super in love. We have a wonderful super healthy, communicative, and loving relationship. The real issue is our connection is so different in person than on the phone (which is the majority of the time). We don’t talk as much as I’d like, but I don’t want to ask him to be more attentive because it feels needy. I know I’m young, but I think he’s the most special person I’ve ever dated. We haven’t put a label on things, but it’s basically assumed that we are together and exclusive, and we have enough trust and communication that I don’t really worry. I don’t think he’s my PERFECT match, but it’s by far the happiest and safest relationship I’ve ever had. 

I just have no idea what to do though. I want a relationship like this that exists in person (obviously) but don’t want to end things with him and don’t feel ready to drop everything and move to the opposite side of the country for him. I worry that if we continue what we are doing, someone will end up getting hurt because the only viable next steps the way I see it are getting together officially and one of us moving at least a little closer, breaking up, or someone meeting someone new which would hurt the other.

So on one of our dates, I basically said ""hey, I know this may be too soon (she broke up with her ex in August this year) but I want you to know I really like you, and I want to ask you out, if this is too soon that is okay and I was wondering if we could be exclusive"". She said she really liked me too, and wanted to talk about some stuff from her past (trauma etc) before we got into a serious relationship, so we are now exclusive and still dating but not yet official. ))

To the main point, I am worried that I have been showing too much affection and putting in too much effort into this relationship. She is the loveliest, most kind-hearted person I've ever met, she is smart, funny and really beautiful too. I guess I want to treat her well because I know she deserves it and she's told me how bad her ex was to her. I guess really I am worried that I am showing too much interest and buying her gifts when I see something I think she'll like, and I compliment her whenever I get the chance. She does appreciate all of this and tells me that she thinks I am nice for doing it but I'm wondering if it's too much/ what counts as lovebombing or if this is normal?",I (M21) am worried I am lovebombing the girl I am dating (F19),18nckc5,1703127270.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nckc5/i_m21_am_worried_i_am_lovebombing_the_girl_i_am/,
"My fiancée works as an RN in outpatient in the pain management department and works 4 10 hr shifts a week (7am-5pm). She comes home every day after work in a terrible mood frustrated from what she had to deal with all day. A lot of this pent up frustration/anger is then directed towards me. For example, getting super mad at me over what I think are very minute things such as a few dishes in the sink or dinner not fully done yet. I work from home 2 days a week and in office 3 days and try to get everything done around the apartment before she gets home. It’s not always the case every time and I feel under pressure when around 530 rolls around because I know she will be home soon. I feel like I am always on guard and looking for what could cause her to go off about something. I love her very much but this is starting to get very exhausting. It’s almost like clock work where every day she gets home and will start going off about little things like not making dinner exactly as she wanted. 

I try my best to make her life easier like making her breakfast every morning before she leaves, packing her lunch, doing the cooking every evening, cleaning, paying the bills, etc. As much as I can to make her life easier but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Is there a possibility she doesn’t like living here or maybe with me? 

As context: she recently moved in 6 months ago and this has been evident pretty much every week. She came from her parents house where she was an only child of wealthy parents living in a big house with everything she wanted.

"Really as simple as it sounds. I can provide more context if needed but here are the basics. 

We’ve been together for 8 years and he is ALWAYS on or near his phone. On the couch watching a show or movie? Phone is in his hands. He literally pulled it out during Thanksgiving with my family—to his credit he wasn’t on it the whole dinner but it still made an appearance. 

When we’re relaxing on the couch, the TV has to be on and he’s either playing a game on his phone or scrolling Reddit. If I try to talk to him for too long it’s too overwhelming because there’s “too much going on.” If I tell him to just turn off the TV or put down the phone so there’s less going on, he’ll do it for like 10-15 minutes without itching to get back. 

Similarly, if I tell him I want to watch a movie or a show with no phones, he gets emotional and says he *needs* something else to do other than just watching the movie (for some reason he’s just fine watching just a movie when we’re in a theater). He’ll huff and puff about it, so it defeats the point of wanting to have lighthearted quality time together. 

I’m just really stuck and feel like I am never the priority over the phone. I get he’s genuinely addicted and it’s not easy, but I really need some help here. :(

Any insights are much appreciated:

I've been working with this guy for almost three years now. When I first started at my job, he barely talked to me, only when absolutely necessary. He was friendly with everyone else, so I thought there was something about me he didn't like. 

Flash forward to about six months ago - he starts coming by my desk to chat more often. I was happy because I thought I'd won him over. Then, I caught him checking me out a couple times. We started chatting more and more. Even better, I thought, I had a great time talking with him. But, I also started pumping the brakes because I realized I was catching feelings for him. 

Now, it just feels like we're caught up in this dance - a little too friendly, so we step back to just friendly. For example, a couple months ago, I really stepped up my appearance - I wanted to look better, on general. He started finding reasons to touch me just about every day. Then, he stopped all of a sudden. 

Yesterday, he mentioned an outfit he's seen me wear before. He said he thought I'd like something because of the outfit I'd worn before. I know that could mean anything, but just seemed cozy. 

Anyway, to get to my question - how do you figure out someone's feelings without asking? I know that's probably impossible. I also know that it doesn't 'matter' unless the person acts on those feelings. Call it a control issue, I just like to feel like I understand where I stand with other people. My concern is feeling stupid/conceited thinking this guy is maybe into me if he's just being friendly.",My (35F) Coworker (40M) is So Confusing,18ncge4,1703126924.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ncge4/my_35f_coworker_40m_is_so_confusing/,

She made a comment that took me off guard though. She told me if I was going to fly her out I needed to give her an “allowance,” aka spending money. I’ve never done anything like this before. Is that normal or am I being played?

My girlfriend and I are on a break, starting last week. We had a great relationship, sure things weren't perfect the last few months due to her personal issues but we never fought or yelled at each other.  
I just need help understanding where she's coming from I guess.

Her personal life is a mess at the moment, and her mental health has been declining. As a result, our relationship suffered because of it. She has always told me that I have never done anything wrong, that I've been sweet and supportive. She also said that with everything going on she feels pressured by a relationship and needs to de-clutter in order to have less stress, citing that she knows she can't give me what she wants.

I just don't get it. Why can't we make things work? Why can't she be in a relationship with me as soon as outside factors get tough?

I brought this concern up to him and asked why he doesn’t reply sooner and he said it was because he doesn’t use his phone often, which I believe because he doesn’t have social media besides Facebook which I bring up because I know social media is what tends to consume peoples times nowadays. But he changed the lagging for me and started replying quicker. After some months it proceeded again and he did it again but for a good while he remained a fast responder. Recently him and I had an argument about something of a completely different topic and we cooled down and stopped texting frequently but as days went by we staring talking again more and being affectionate again over messages but something I noticed is that the lagging returned he is again now texting until half the day. This morning I woke up at 5am and texted him and he did not reply till 5pm again 
I’m unsure if this is all happening because of the recent argument or if something else is up. Of course I can communicate with him and ask but I’m not sure how to bring it up because the topic of lagging is something that’s been discussed very frequently in our relationship so I hate to have to bring it up again.

I say yes, she tells me that he slept with her two days ago at her house. I'm calling him and he's nowhere to be found.

He says he's wrong for lying and that he just wasn't man enough to tell me when it happened. He also says that they weren't dating like he and I are and that it wasn't an ongoing thing. That it was the first time he'd seen her in over a month. Kinda pathetic but we end up making up.
No, he isn't my boyfriend. Thus, it's not cheating but it certainly felt like it. I suppose the crime is lying. I am still processing and trying to get over but I don't know if it's worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My partner and I are polyamorous; about almost two months ago, he broke my trust by lying to me and telling me he was meeting up with a ""friend."" I checked in on him, and the bomb was dropped on me that he and this person will likely hook up. I was distraught because, again, I was told he was meeting a ""friend"" and was given a warning at the last minute (this is not the first time he has done this, btw), and things have been rocky ever since. 

We've had our lengthy talks about the boundaries that have been crossed, the trust that has been broken, and the lack of communication. I've always pushed for talking, especially within a dynamic like this, we are already long distance and with us being poly only makes it harder. I put a lot of trust in him and he broke that. There was a lot of crying and apologizing, him promising to do better, telling he doesn't know why he makes these stupid decisions but he's willing to change. There's been a lot of internal work on his end being done and I just feel like I am constantly on an emotional rollercoaster, being fed trickle down truths whenever we do have talks. 

I don't feel like myself anymore and I'm tired. The last time we spoke, it's when I told him I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who's going through this ""age of exploration"". This move has changed him so much and I don't know who he is anymore, the conversation was heated and he tried to twist my words and even go as far to question my loyalty. I listed off all the times I could've left but I stayed, I reiterated that the words that he is saying is not what is coming out of my mouth (I also created Google Docs before every talk because that's the only way I can get my feelings out so I won't just go in guns blazing). It all ended with me explaining to him that I am on him because I DO LOVE HIM. I care for him but he's being reckless, he's not listening to me, focusing on the wrong things until I had to yell, he's all over the place right now and it's hurting me in the process. 

We're on a break currently. I did express to him during our last talk (we've had three so far and the one I am about to bring up is the fourth) that my feelings and what he has said to me is not going to hit because right now I am really all over the place. And it did. I had finals so the stressors of that and now being on a break with my partner? It all came hitting me at once and I sent him a voice message calling him out on his behaviors and how his words hurt me. I told him to not respond until he has sat with himself and listened, let it settle. 

We spoke a couple days later. It was just me spilling all the things that I have felt in the past few weeks, how I have been hurting and trying to stay strong, but it's so taxing. It was extremely heartfelt and it was nice, until it wasn't. He admitted that on top of feeling lonely, he was jealous of me. 

He was jealous. 

And I told him I knew or at least peeped it when we spoke and he mentioned how he didn't have any friends or was in school to connect with people (we were talking about him expressing how he wants genuine human connection but to me and the patterns that he has shown, he's extremely touch starved and paired with him experiencing desirability for the first time has him going head first into sex and not being safe at all. He's not communicating with me, when i always have and I'm not perfect but I'm open and honest. I just ask for the same respect and he even admitted that he needs to work on ALL OF THAT.) 

But again- he told me he was jealous of me and paired with loneliness made an ugly combo. I told him I understood because before I was at the school I am currently attending, I was on the West Coast fresh out of high school and this was during the pandemic. I was already struggling mentally with still coping from the loss of my dad, not having a proper junior nor senior year, I felt ostracized at home, etc etc. So that reflected in my school work and how I couldn't connect with friends, I was never present, I was so jealous of my hometown friends who seemed to have been succeeding. I was jealous of everyone. 

But I was also single and able to heal, able to do some reflection. HE was dating someone, he was dating ME. I asked him if this jealousy was reflected in his actions because I wasn't sure if I heard it or not and he admitted to me that it did. All the lashing out and distancing himself, every single thing. 

Everything. It was because he was jealous of me and he couldn't understand the feeling at first but when he did, he said it didn't like feeling this way. I was still so understanding and thanked him for telling me this, but deep down I was so hurt and cried to my mom. My partner and I had been together for a year and friends for two and I honestly wished he never had feelings for me. I never did anything to him but this whole time I thought everything was my fault, how I reacted to him betraying my trust, the fall out from everything-- how i pushed for deep talks and communication to grow from the aftermath, I thought I was doing too much. 

I wasn't. Now I'm stuck. I expressed to him everything I have ever felt, the good, the bad, and the ugly. I told him I still love him, but I love me too. I want someone who's gonna love and care for me with their whole being like I have done for everyone else. 

I really do love him and being friends with him feels so freeing, but I miss us. I'm just scared that even when he does get the help that he needs (he's getting a therapist after the new year), that can't give myself up to him again.

"Context: I am temporarily living with my parents while I search for a job after graduating college. I get along well with my dad, but my mom and I seem to fight or disagree on something every day. My mom has always been kind of uptight, especially about the living space being clean.

TLDR: My mom is controlling over me and when I object, it leads to fights and makes life in this house worse. How can I get along better with her (at least until I move out?)

I feel like despite being an adult, as long as I am in her home, I won't be treated like one. I have friends who are also living with family still who get (I feel) much more freedom and respect than I do. I don't deny any fault on my part: there are many times I knew I was in the wrong, especially in my response to her. Often our fights will be along the lines of ""she criticizes me, I escalate, we both end up mad."" We aren't constantly at each other's throats, but we have a small fight almost every day.

Here are the things we fight about the most:
- Clenliness. No one is allowed to make any kind of mess in her home except her. She leaves things out all the time, but if I have things on my bathroom counter or the dresser in my bedroom or out in the kitchen, it will be constant ""clean up your mess, I'm not going to clean it up for you, do you expect me to clean it up"" until I put it away. I once had a brush and some makeup on my bathroom counter and my bath mat on and she loudly exclaimed ""it looks like a tornado went through here!"" Things must be tidied immediately or there will be criticism.

- Laziness. I work part time from home during the day while she works full time out of the house. I admit I don't have a lot of chores in the house: I do my own laundry, clean my own room/bathroom, unload the dishwasher, feed our pet, and sometimes cook dinner or clean up after dinner. Usually she cooks dinner and my dad (who also works full time) also cleans. But if there is something I could have done during my day and didn't, she makes sure I am criticized for not doing it. Often I feel like ""what's the point of trying"" because I could do everything right and still she would find something. Often she criticizes me for just not wanting to do things. For example, today she told me that a coworker of hers (not even a friend) wants me to fix her laptop (i have a degree in CS). I asked her not to volunteer me to help her coworkers and she blew up, I assumed wrong and she did not volunteer me, but ""god forbid we help others."" She also often will ask me to fix problems with specific software she uses for her job, and when I say I can't help because I've never used it, or suggest she google it, she gets mad and says ""I know you can't help you just don't want to.""

- Going out. All of my friends live in the city, a longish drive away, so I don't get to see them regularly. So when I do, we often go out and stay out late so we can spend a lot of time together. Usually I am home around midnight, but sometimes as late as 2-4:00am. I have my own car and pay my own gas. I don't know if it's because she's worried or what, but I always get shit the next morning if I come home later than midnight. One time she even said I should ""stop going out late because the next day I have to recover."" Like yes, if I'm out clubbing with my friends of course I need a lighter day the next day...I feel like I am an adult and she has no right to criticize me for this.

- Her controlling behavior. In addition to the above, she feels she is right about everything, especially social graces. If I don't tell someone thank you within the second, it's ""say thank you"" like I'm 5. If I have an interview for a job, she will try to tell me exactly what to wear, when to arrive, what to bring, etc. If I object and say I know what I'm doing, it's ""oh I can't tell you anything, you know everything."" It makes me feel small and chided. I know I am smart and can figure things out. It's also confusing because one minute she's bragging to others about how well I'm doing in my part time job, the next she's telling me how lazy and unwilling I am and what I'm doing wrong in my job search.

I want to know if there is any way I can get along with her, at least until I am able to move out, without confronting her or implying she is at fault because that would only make our relationship worse. I don't know when I will have a job that will allow me to move out, so I need to make things bearable.

EDIT: Literally in the time I posted this we had another fight. Got mad because I didn't volunteer to clean the kitchen, ""error_502 doesn't do anything unless she's forced to. Can't clean, she's got better things to do, she's busy. Can't help anybody except her friends. Go ahead, go to your room and sit on your bed and do nothing."" She's mad at my dad too for some reason.

"In February 2022 me and my (ex)partner of 4 years lost our first and only baby girl. She was very poorly and we never got to take her home. It was and still is a heartbreaking thing to go through. 2 short blurry months later, I found out he was planning on meeting another girl. He said he wasn’t happy with me anymore and thought it best I move out. With the already broken state I was in, I didn’t give much resistance and moved back in with my parents who were a huge support system and nurtured me until I was able to somewhat function again. I had lost my baby, my partner, my home, my future, our rainbow kitten and life as I knew within a short couple months. I was a shell of a person for a very long time and couldn’t fathom how life could ever return to even bearable, let alone happy. For the next few months he played some mind games, one minute saying he wanted to fix things and the next sleeping with other girls. I tried to understand that he of course was grieving as well, and was maybe coping by avoiding and running away. So we tried to work it out. But after a while, it was so clear to me that the broken trust and complete sense of abandonment in my most vulnerable moment was all too much for me to forgive and forget, and we mutually agreed to part ways. 
It’s almost been 2 years since then. We occasionally send each other a text on special dates of our daughters and have both expressed a deep platonic love for each. Possibly because of what we went through together, and the grief we share? I’m not sure. Anyway, He’s now moved on and seems happy. I don’t really have an interest in dating yet and am more focusing on rebuilding myself and my life after it was completely flipped upside down within a matter 2 months. I still grieve deeply for our baby and motherhood as a whole, but I’m learning to embrace moments of peace and happiness alongside my grief. But I, without fail, still think of him every single day. I still find myself having to fight the urge to message him. If someone was sharing this with me, my first thought would be that they’re lonely and missing the relationship rather than the person. But I don’t think that’s what’s happening. I’m surrounded by friends and family and have never actually been as socially active as I currently am! I’ve since taken up new hobbies and have been trying really hard to focus on self love and care. I
Now I know I wouldn’t act on these thoughts because at the end of the day, we separated for a reason. I know I wouldn’t be able to trust him ever again, or lean on him during hard times in fear he’ll run away like he did before. It just wouldn’t be the same. But that doesn’t change the fact that he pops up in my thoughts everyday. And to be honest it’s draining. upsetting even. It’s also kind of.. embarrassing? To have been treated like that, yet still have these feelings for him after all this is just silly. So I haven’t told anyone. I’m hoping that getting this off my chest on here might help or at least help me to make sense of these feelings? Maybe that deep platonic love isn’t so platonic on my side? Or maybe I’m confusing the connection we have of our daughter with love for him? Most of my memories with my baby girl include him, so could i possibly be thinking of her and the memories trigger thoughts of him? Could I even be unconsciously prolonging “getting over” him to stop myself from moving on with someone else. I guess that would mean the end of this chapter. The one and only chapter that includes my daughter? I really don’t know and am probably thinking way too much into it.

"I\[20F\] was in a bad relationship for two years (guy from the title), I finally got out and after a while started dating another guy\[23M\] who was amazing. Not perfect but he was, and I don't mean I'm comparison to my previous. I mean in general.  
After a while we kinda just stopped talking to each other, just like that. No calls, messages.  
Before I go on I think I must say that:   
1. I severely dislike people,   
2. I'm not interested in getting married   
3. I probably wouldn't want to have kids.   
4. I don't really believe in love (at least not how people explain it)   
5. I have a serious trust issue   
Back to the story, when me and guy no 2\[23M\] drifted I reconnected with an old ""nemesis""\[31M\] (he's girlfriend was having an affair with my boyfriend at that time.; This was 3 years ago) and we started vibing(i  hated and I never spoke to him before but when we reconnected we spoke for over 3 hours on the first day).   
We've been talking for over 3 months now and it's been going well. He hasn't officially asked me out cause he said he wants to do it in person (we haven't seen for most of the 3 months) but he calls me his girlfriend.   
I'm currently having 3 dilemmas.  
The first one is that guy number 2 just called me out of nowhere and is acting like nothing happened and we didn't ghost each other. He did say he was going through stuffs but ionno considering my current situation with guy no 3. And I really care for him cause he really went through a lot for me during the few months we were together.  
The second and third are involving guy no   
he's 11 years older than me so we have quite an age gap. I told him about my situation with guy no 2 and he said it doesn't change nothing. it's just up to me. Then we started talking about things marriage and kids (which I don't really want). He said he doesn't mind the marriage but he'd like to cause of the whole fornication stuff. But he said he doesn't know if  he can do without a child even if it's one. I don't want him to have to give that up so I told him that we should end the relationship but he doesn't want to. Now he has said we should talk about this some other time. He believes that down the line things would change but it most likely wouldn't and I don't want to have to deal with this once this has progressed but I don't wanna end the relationship.  
He is also going overseas in a couple months and would be gone for more than 3 years so theres that.  
what should I do?

"(26F) I joined the same University after my PG for PhD. But unfortunately I don't know anyone there. I didn't actually get to spend time at the uni during PG coz of xyz reasons. 

Point is I don't have any friends and don't know anyone there. I was assigned to a room with other scholars who are divided according to what topic they are working on or the nature of the work. So the room I am in already has a bunch of students who have known each other for a while. There was a new addition of two ppl, 2-3 months before I joined and I think they were already in contact with the rest of the scholars before joining? Not sure. 

I am an introvert and don't really know how to start a conversation or keep it going. So when they asked me to go out with them for tea, I declined as i don't drink tea/coffee, nor do i eat snacks. And on top of it, I am allergic to milk/milk products so I ll have to order a black tea/coffee. It's just a Hassel on the whole. So i declined politely telling that I don't drink tea/coffee. 

I actually thought they would ask me for lunch the next day coz they all go together as a group to eat. They didn't and I felt it would be very weird to ask myself to be invited to the group? So I have been going to have lunch alone these days. I hate eating alone, so I decided to just try. I asked one of them to please invite me too when they go for lunch the next day. She(23F) didn't, so I figured maybe she forgot? I tried hinting to another person that I go to eat alone and would prefer to have company, asked where they go to eat n all. Maybe i wasn't direct enough. I tried again and asked the same girl (22F) to please tell me when they got for tea/coffee tomorrow ( which is today as am writing this) but I am not really expecting her to actually do it. Idk why, from her facial expression i just feel like it won't be happening. 

Do you guys have any advice? I am feeling really lonely and I can feel one of my depressive episodes coming up at this rate. I don't want to go home sad for Christmas and ruin everyone's moods.

Everytime I want to go out with some of my friends on days where my boyfriend is free, I get the sense that he gets upset. Since I want to still see him, I will suggest another time that day to meet or an earlier activity, but he will make a point to not meet me, and say he has actually made plans with his friends too all day - while I know he has not made any plans. Even if he ends up staying home and later tells me he didn’t go anywhere , he will make a point of not seeing me. For context, I usually try to hang out with my friends when my bf works and spend time with him whenever he’s free on Saturdays and Sunday. But there are times when friends that don’t get together often, ask me to hang out or there are specific events I want to go to that I can’t bring him to, and this always happens. 

How do I confront him about this? Or should he be allowed to react this way and maybe I’m the one overthinking ?

UPDATE: he reacted this way about me saying I wanted to go out with the girls, and now is saying he cannot meet me throughout the day and will go out with his friends ( which I do not have a problem with ) to a club , both the day I am going and new years ",I(23F) feel guilty whenever I go out without my boyfriend(26M),18nbspg,1703124867.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nbspg/i23f_feel_guilty_whenever_i_go_out_without_my/,
"I have a friend who I have known online for many years since we were both fifteen. We always liked to role-play talking about animal facts, history, brainy things that the rest of my friends didn't understand or weren't really interested in.

His problem is that he is someone who is terribly normopathic. When his friends approached him and he had an alien figure, he hid it because according to him, they were facets that he would like to leave aside.

Over time we started seeing my narcissistic ex-girlfriend and for what? He began to manipulate us both, triangulate us and he ( my friend) always took his side when we argued. Even my ex played me audios of him crying because I applied the cold shoulder and he laughed about it, showing it to me.

He seemed in love with my ex-girlfriend and when we broke up he became much more distant. He no longer wanted to touch on topics from the role-playing game we had, when I talk to him about it he blatantly changes the subject, he doesn't talk to me unless I don't talk to him. And he is imitating many of the rude attitudes that my ex had towards him.

For example, jokes are now taken seriously or everything is taken seriously and it makes me look like the crazy friend who touches on tricky topics. I once made a silly comment my stepbrother made about evolution and he said ""I don't think that's funny why does it misinform people and they believe it?""

A joke about evolution? Oh really? I'm afraid to confront him because he seems to carry many of the attitudes that my ex has and I know that at any moment all that anger he harbors could be directed at me and I value that friendship even though it has changed so much. As I said, it seems like he wants to fit in, so that's why he tries to be politically correct many times (and even though my jokes aren't even black humor and he used to laugh out loud). I just don't know who is wrong, him or me or if my ex just had something to do with it. They turn me around and I curse the moment I made them meet.


PS: the boy had literally become my ex's  slave , and she mistreated him like she did me. Once there was a civil war in his town ( of my ex)  and we stayed online all night to see how she was doing. The next day we asked her and she, quote, told us: ""What the hell are you doing if it's not your country at all?""

"I genuinely have no idea what happened or why my kids and I are receiving the silent treatment. A few days ago we had a nice morning together as a family then after lunch he locked himself in our bedroom without notice until the kids went to bed and he booted up his Xbox to play with his buddies. It’s been 3 days since and I can count on one hand how many words he’s spoken to me. 2 full days of him locking himself in our room from the time he wakes up until the kids go to bed only coming out for food. We have a preschooler, a toddler and a newborn (I’m on maternity leave) so handling all of them while he watches YouTube or a series in bed all day with the door jammed shut and giving all of us the cold shoulder is obviously difficult and hurtful. He doesn’t work and is a sahd while I work full time. I asked him if everything was okay and all he did was say “fine” without any eye contact. I’ve left him alone since then to see if he comes around, but honestly I’m burnt out of caring. I feel pretty dejected so I don’t really care if he comes out or not. 
My question is, and this may sound stupid, but what do I even do or say? It’s such a ridiculous situation I’m really at a loss for words and am a peacemaker/people pleaser as I had a father myself growing up that did this too so naturally I’m pretty skittish around the emotional abuse of it all so any assistance in verbiage to settle this or ideas for action would be greatly appreciated. I feel really embarrassed asking all of this and his actions honestly.

- My partner texted me to ask me to do something that requires coordination. I don’t want to do it and say no and she replies “right, because it requires seamless coordination and collaboration, neither exists between us.” I get annoyed by her response because to me it seems passive aggressive and text back “wtf does that mean” and express my frustration with her response. She later explains that it was meant to be a joke and regular relationships can’t achieve such a high standard of collaboration and communication either and asks me why I thought it was passive aggressive. I can’t explain why that comment felt passive aggressive to me that well either and just said that it seemed unnecessarily.

"We knew each other because we studied at the same highschool. 

My female friend - Gina [30F] just returned to the state to visit her parents with her husband so she wanted to hangout with us after 1 year.

A bit of a back story: 
My BF had a crush on Gina back in highschool because she was/is very pretty and studies well. I was/am just average. My BF took a lot of photos her and would sit there staring at those photos. He did try to confessed to Gina but Gina didn't like him and she let me knew about it because I was having a crush on him. Eventually we got together. I was very jealous while dating him unfortunately. So, to be honest, I was always  moody and miserable back in highschool. 

Gina moved to another state for college. A part of me was relieved that maybe my mind could had a break for once. We still kept connection with each other. He texted her too just to checkup but also sending admiration and hearts...

But it did come to a point that I was really really uncomfortable so I confronted him about his feeling about her. He said he is not a type of guy would go out to hit on girls and if it makes me uncomfortable so he will keep distance with her. I said no because I don't want him to force himself to cut down a connection that he has known for years. He is a lonely guy and wants to have friends so I don't want to isolate him. He texted her lesser and got occupied with jobs and responsibilities.

Back to now:
We went out. During the hangout, there were three then four of us. I noticed how he kept looking at her despite we had another friend there. Her every move and action - how she drank her coffee, how she had her meal, he took photos of our group and her seperately and she was sorta okay about it and posed (we had a talk and Gina said she doesn't like being taking for photos seperately but she is okay with taking group photos). He did look over me to give belongings, try out each other orders, share some stuffs about us but the rest it's just him focusing on her. I tried to look at him multiple times to get his attention but his eyes just glued to her. The hangout ended but on the way home I couldn't talk to him at all. 

My mind once again was/is filled with the feeling of jealousy I had way back then is really eating me out alive. I don't want to admit but I hate it. It hurts. It was really an eye sore. I feel so sad like I'm drowning under the sea. Again.

"I'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible.

My boyfriend of 24 years old had two sick leaves, both longer than 6 weeks, this year. He used to work night shift which definitely didn't help maintain good mental health as he is fragile (been depressed in the past). After his second depression this year, he finally realized that working the nightshift wasn't possible anymore.

He also smokes cannabis multiple times a day which probably ain't good either and overuses social media.

That being said, even though both his general practitioner and his nurse specialized in mental health both told him to cut the cannabis and cut the social media addiction, his resolutions never last. He makes the effort for 3-4-5 days and then forgets and goes back to his old habits. I feel like he solely relies on the medication he takes (Venlafaxine) to solve all of his issues without making changes to his lifestyle. 

Both times, a few weeks before he relapsed into his depression, there was an increase in his social media use (4-5 hours a day) and his cannabis use. I am currently seeing this pattern again and worry that I'll have to go through another episode which isn't fun since he becomes very hard to live with when it happens.

I am not againt the use of either but at this point I just feel like he doesn't really wanna change and is perfectly content with this constant cycle of ups followed by downs. Every time I discuss the issue with him, he is completely delusional and fails to see how the same pattern repeats over and over again.

So finally I brought it up to her and she admitted he took them. She said she was jealous and was just gonna “borrow” it for one trip to the mall but ended up taking it.

"**How We Met**  
  
I was 21 years old when I met my husband online. I was halfway through my Master's degree, living close to campus, and just getting out of an unhealthy one-sided situationship (I don't call it a relationship because I was never this person's girlfriend, and my husband was my very first boyfriend). I had grown up in a conservative Christian home with parents who told me I shouldn't have sex before marriage and I couldn't date until I graduated, so I didn't have my first kiss or didn't hold hands with a boy until I was 20. When my situationship ended, I downloaded Tinder with the sole purpose of gaining dating experience and wanting to boost my confidence. I wanted to mess around, go on a few dates, and maybe have sex for the first time.  
  
Instead of a full on ""hoe phase"", I ended up meeting my now husband on there. When I first saw his profile, I remember thinking he wasn't really my type. It took me a long time to swipe on him, but I ultimately decided to swipe because he had super liked my profile (I later learned the super like was an accident and he meant to regular like me). We talked for a week or so before agreeing to go on a date. He was my 4th online date.  
  
When I met him in person, I remember thinking the same things - that I didn't think he was that cute but at least he had a nice smile, that I didn't like how he dressed, that he was shorter than I thought. But conversation flowed with him so smoothly, more smoothly than with anyone else I had ever met or known. It was the first time I felt a ""friendship spark"", and because of this connection, we continued to go on more dates, became really good friends, did a year of long distance, and got engaged 3 years later. I want to stress that I did love and was in love with this man; I adored our friendship, our connection, our humor, our compatibility, and everything made perfect sense.  
  
**Fast Forward to Marriage**  
  
We got married in 2019, and then experienced our first year of marriage during the height of COVID. We argued a ton, but we also grew so much closer as a couple. I'll always cherish that first year. Time passed, and we decided it was time to buy a house, so we moved into my parents' house for close to half a year as we shopped around. We eventually found a home in Fall of 2021.  
  
*Section 1: Anger*  
  
It was around this time that our relationship changed. I'm not sure exactly what caused this change, but we started arguing A LOT, and in an unhealthy way (raised voices, saying mean things). There was one particular argument we had where my husband was so angry, he decided to throw my iPad against the wall as I was leaving the room. At the time, I had totally forgotten (or at least brushed away) his anger issues. But when that happened, I felt like a kid in my dad's house again, trying not to make mistakes so that no one would yell at me. I started feeling small around my husband, and being afraid to make small errors like parking my car incorrectly, or accidentally breaking a mug, because I thought he would yell at me. I even remember asking him for his help to kill a cockroach, and he got so mad that I was scared of the cockroach that it ended up turning into a stupid argument where he got pissed at me for being scared. I remember he got so angry while driving one time, that he started driving recklessly, and I remember crying and telling him I didn't want to have kids with him if he was going to be like this. He told me he was sorry, and I asked him to go to therapy, and he never did. Instead, he decided he could fix his anger issues by himself, and for a while things got better. But at that point, when he threw my iPad, I could already feel myself drifting away, feeling small, feeling afraid, and feeling unsatisfied with other things in our relationship. I never believed he would hit me directly, but I did believe that I might be collateral damage one day.  
  
(For additional context, I do want to add that both my husband and I have always been surrounded by angry environments. I grew up in a household where my dad was always angry and I was afraid to make mistakes around him; my dad never threw things, however, and he never said anything disparaging. It typically resulted in spanking. My husband on the other hand grew up with a dad who was very biting in his words. Neither my husband or his brother ever learned how to channel their anger - my husband told me he broke the oven in his parents' house once because he was so angry. His brother also punched the thermostat in the house simply because the A/C wasn't working).  
  
*Section 2: Sex*  
  
His anger was the catalyst for everything. Once I started feeling small, I started thinking about all the things I was unsatisfied with, and I started thinking about our sex life.  
  
To recap, I had never had sex until I met my husband. I looked to him as the expert in our sexual relationship because he had had sex and other girlfriends before. On our wedding night, I was really nervous; he calmed me down and we tried to have sex, but for whatever reason he couldn't stick it in and he ended up going soft. I thought maybe I was the problem, so the next day during our honeymoon, I purposefully got tipsy so I could be more brave, and then we finally had sex. Our entire honeymoon was like that; I'd get tipsy on purpose so I could be more brave, and then we'd have sex. I do remember trying to ""seduce"" him by walking around in lingerie, but he never seemed to be a ""I just can't keep my hands off you"" kind of guy. I even remember sending lingerie pics during our first year of marriage, and never getting anything more than a ""sexy!"" comment (I want to acknowledge btw that although my husband didn't make me feel desired, I do have a traditionally attractive body, so it was always confusing to me why he didn't passionately desire me).  
  
When we met, sex wasn't a super important criteria for me. However, as the years passed and we'd have sex once every month or two, I started feeling like there was something more that we could be doing, and that there was something more I could be feeling. Our sex started following a formula - we'd make out, he'd finger me, I'd give him a handjob, and then he'd go inside me missionary style, pump a few times, and then it was over typically in about ten minutes or so. I remember physically feeling like I'd get turned on, but never feeling like I actually finished. As a result, I started asking him things like: do you mind if we tried a sex toy? Do you mind doing more foreplay? Could we try different positions? Could we try having sex in other places, like in the backyard, or the car? Although I asked him all these questions, he never took my advice or really listened to me. He seemed to be embarrassed about not lasting long, or that I'd even make these suggestions. He wasn't willing to eat me out, EVER, even though I willingly gave him BJs (I think he tried once or twice and commented that he thought it was gross). He thought it was weird to have sex in the backyard, or try it in a public bathroom. And for all the years we'd been together, he still really struggled to find my clit or at the very least, understand my body.  
  
It came to a point where when we'd have sex, it was a chore for me. I'd never say no to him when we'd have sex, but when we would have sex, I started emotionally removing myself from the act because I knew I'd never finish, so I just focused on doing the motions and getting it over with. I also started to feel really insecure. My girlfriends were telling me all about their sex lives, and even though they were virgins like me when they got married, their sex lives sounded so much more exciting than mine. I started getting into my head about things like: Maybe he isn't THAT attracted to me because he doesn't want to eat me out. Maybe he doesn't think I'm that pretty because he doesn't want to try to figure out what satisfies me. It was during this time that I started masturbating for the first time because I wanted to know what made me ""tick"" so I could tell him. And even after I told him how I wanted to be touched, he still didn't seem to listen.  
  
This then brings me to the third thing I started feeling unsatisfied in.  
  
*Section 3: Love Languages / Emotional Leadership*  
  
One of my love languages is gift giving; it's how I like to receive love and also how I like to give it. While my husband and I have been together, I have always been intentional about how I like to show my love. When we were dating and I got to celebrate his birthday for the first time, I contacted all of his closest friends (some I hadn't even met yet) and invited them to a surprise birthday dinner. For his friends that couldn't come, I asked them to record a special video greeting I could send to him. One year, I planned an entire day of events for him catered around things he liked. Another year, I surprised him with a ticket to a festival he really liked, and drove us for hours there and back so he could fully relax and enjoy it. Earlier this year, I planned an entire one week long international trip for him. When we dated long distance, I sent him a love letter for every month we were apart, and when he finally came home, I had a custom art piece made to commemorate this chapter of our relationship. I paid attention to things he needed; when I saw he didn't have a nice watch, I got him a really nice one, as well as a FitBit because I knew he liked to work out. I bought him a Mac laptop before we were even married because I knew how much he needed it. I surprised him with an Occulus because he'd been wanting to try one for a long time. Always, I made his birthdays and Christmases as special as they could be, and during Valentine's or Anniversaries, I always came up with themes or fun ways to celebrate (Let's go to Target and give ourselves 14 minutes to buy each other gifts for Valentine's! Let's do a painting night at home and ask each other questions about our relationship so we can continue to connect with each other and deepen our relationship!)  
  
My husband, however, has rarely given that same energy back to me. When we were dating he'd buy me cookies and flowers, but when we got married, he stopped buying me flowers (even after I kept asking him for them, and even after he'd watch me start buying them for myself). He knows how much I like jewelry, but he's never once bought me jewelry in all the years we've been together (other than the engagement ring). I asked if I could buy a really nice purse, and he hesitated because it was expensive and an ""impractical"" gift, even though I had given him many impractical gifts. One year for my birthday I told him he didn't really have to get me anything, when in reality I just wanted him to think creatively of ways he could surprise me; but he took that at face value and genuinely did nothing for my birthday (not even anything as simple as a card, or chocolates). When it came to my birthdays, or anniversaries, he rarely if ever took the lead in helping plan or contribute; instead, I typically planned my own birthdays, or organized date nights, and he was content with letting me do that. And even though I'd ask him time and time again to contribute or take lead, it was rare that he would actually listen.  
  
All of these factors eventually led to me feeling ugly, undesired, small, and unheard. And while I have no excuse for what I did, these factors pushed me to the edge of my sanity, and I eventually pursued an affair.  
  
**Cheating**  
  
*Section 1: The Hookup*  
  
I first considered cheating about a year and a half ago (this was around the time of the iPad incident and I had all these grievances I was going through). Someone reached out to me online and was blatantly flirting with me. It was an emotional affair, which then turned physical due to my desire to feel beautiful and wanted. It didn't last long - maybe a couple months - and I quickly ended it because I was 1) disgusted with myself that I did it in the first place and 2) despite everything I was struggling with in my marriage, I still really wanted to make it work with my husband. I decided to over-commit myself to my husband, and be really really clear with what I wanted, what change I wanted to see, what I needed from him. But then a year passed, and it felt like the anger and the sex and the lack of attentiveness was the same, and I found myself slipping again.  
  
*Section 2: The Affair*  
  
Earlier this summer, I met a guy on reddit. I wasn't looking for anything other than community - someone who could relate to what I was going through. He was in a struggling marriage as well and going through a divorce, and we bonded over that as well as our lack of a good sex life. As time passed, things quickly became emotional, and before I realized it, I had fallen in love with him. We talked every day, about things we hadn't really told anybody, and we seemed to understand each other without having to over explain anything. And honestly, he met my needs without me ever having to ask for them like I had been asking for a year and a half with my husband. For the purpose of this post, let's call him P.  
  
*Anger:* From what I observed, both around me and how he was with his siblings, P was never angry. If he was upset, he never raised his voice or said disparaging things. He certainly didn't break things just because he didn't know how to handle his anger. He approached things steadily, with a big picture in mind, and was always patient. He always listened to me, and always seemed to understand my emotions and feelings behind the words I was actually saying.  
  
*Sex:* The sex with him was incredible. This is going to sound so silly, but it was like he worshipped me. I'd never been with a guy who was so eager to please me and thought I was so beautiful and told me all the time, without me ever having to ask. He couldn't get enough of me, and it genuinely made me feel like I was the most beautiful woman in the world. He was so attentive; not only did I cum with him, I'd typically cum multiple times, I'd have intense orgasms, I'd squirt, etc; I experienced things I didn't know my body could even do, in ways I had been begging, quite literally begging, my husband to do to me. And as rough as sex could be with him it was still always so sweet and caring and kind and emotional. I had never had such an intensely emotional and passionate connection like that before.  
  
*Emotional Leadership:* P is emotional in a way my husband is not. He feels so many emotions all at once and feels them so deeply, and he's never afraid to tell me how he feels in the moment or remind me of how deeply he cares about me. He's flown thousands of miles just to see me simply because I missed him. He's gotten me things that I'd spent years asking my husband to do - flowers, chocolates, jewelry, lingerie, clothes. But he gives in small ways too, and notices things about me I didn't even know anyone was paying attention to. For example, he noticed I always back my car into the parking spot, and immediately started doing that for me if he knew I was going to be driving the car. He always made sure I was on the ""safer"" side of the sidewalk when we were walking. He'd cut my food into smaller pieces without me having to ask because he knew I didn't like big chunks of food. He wrote me love notes. He opened the car door for me. He stopped us in the middle of the street because he heard a song from a restaurant nearby, and twirled me in front of his car's headlights so we could dance for ten seconds. He was creative with our dates, listened to feedback immediately, and was so romantic and caring and loving and attentive. He felt like he came straight out of a fairytale.  
  
I want to add a comment that I recognize feelings in an affair can be extremely intense since it is in a vacuum. But I do also acknowledge that my feelings for him, while more intense given the situation, were and are very real. And because my husband had made me feel unseen and unheard, I had removed my emotional openness towards my husband and essentially transferred it toward P. And while I still loved my husband, loved our friendship, loved our community, I found that I wasn't sure if I was IN love with him anymore. I had emotionally, nearly completely, shut myself off from him.  
  
**The Fallout**  
  
This weekend, my husband found out about the affair. While he doesn't understand the full extent of how long I have talked to P or how deep our relationship had gone, he did recognize that I had feelings for him. We have had hours long conversations these past few days, and some of the most candid conversations we've ever had around anger, sex, and emotional leadership. It was the type of conversation I wished we could've had years ago. The type of conversation I had been begging for us to have, but he never seemed to listen. Yet despite discovering this affair, and against his friends' recommendations, my husband still insists on staying and making this work. For the first time in years, he professed to me how much he loves me, that I am the love of his life, that he does think I'm beautiful, and that he'll do everything in his power to change and to listen and to really understand the depth and root of the things I've been asking him to do.  
  
Unfortunately, I currently stand in a weird situation because I feel like my mind and my heart are in different directions. Mentally, and on paper, I want to stay with my husband. Despite these issues I have brought up around our marriage, at the end of the day, I have known him for 8 years. We did have a very strong, trusting relationship around each other. We have the best friendship I could ever ask for. But because of everything that's happened, my emotional connection to him is gone, and I don't know if I can ever get it back, or if I can, how long it will take.  
  
Emotionally, I am with P. I think of him all the time and I miss him. I can see how beautiful a life with him would be. How patient it would be, how kind and emotionally attentive. I have full confidence he'd be a great dad, something I never was sure about with my husband. I have full confidence he would always make me feel loved, and I know I would do the same for him. But choosing him, and changing my entire life, scares me.  
  
**So the questions I ask myself now are the following:**  
  
Do I stay in my current relationship and give my husband and I a second chance? And if I do, do I trust that he can regain his trust in me, and that I will eventually be able to emotionally reconnect with him again?  
  
Do I leave my current relationship for P, have a very rocky start to this relationship, and will that eventually taper out into something beautiful or will there always be a cloud of strangeness because of how it started?  
  
Do I just choose myself, stay single for a bit, and figure out what I really want?  
  
**Other Relevant Details**  
  
I'm not sure if these are truly relevant, but I will add them just in case.  
  
My husband and I have not had sex in 6 months, but for the first time in years, this weekend he tried to eat me out and finger me (this was prior to him finding out about the affair). It was a very strange experience for me as it was during the middle of the night when I felt him go down on me. I think he was trying to take my advice and do something I had asked him to do, but instead I felt violated; we hadn't previously discussed waking each other up like this before, and he fingered me so roughly that I bled the day after. I didn't move, didn't squirm, didn't even pretend to enjoy it, and yet he still continued to do what he did and then finished inside me. I was at a loss for words and still don't know how to process that.  
  
My husband confessed to me this weekend that my constantly asking more from him in regards to sex made him feel too insecure to try, and that there were moments he masturbated instead of asking for sex with me. This was not totally surprising, but I cannot help but ask out loud - wouldn't every husband want to be with a wife who wants to do more in sex? Shouldn't a man be so in love with a woman that he'd want to please her anyway?  
  
As ironic as it is to say this now, my friends and family and myself included had never thought I would be the one to cheat. In fact, everyone always thought it would be my husband who would cheat. I truly believe that I have been an excellent wife up until this point; that I had done everything in my power to make sure my husband felt seen and loved and heard and protected. I think he knows that, and I think that's why he's desperately trying to keep me, despite what his friends are saying.  
  
I will acknowledge that finally, my husband did try to make a lot of drastic changes in the last month. After a year and a half of me asking, he did finally start going to therapy. He finally started buying me flowers and even made me a small love note, something he hasn't done in years. But given where I am mentally, I struggle to fully appreciate this because I have emotionally cut myself off from him and have a hard time thinking he's only doing this out of a sense of duty, and not because he genuinely wants to.","I (29F) was feeling emotionally, mentally, and physically neglected by my husband (30M) which led to an affair he learned about?",18nbaxw,1703123326.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nbaxw/i_29f_was_feeling_emotionally_mentally_and/,

"So this morning I had a dream that my boyfriend had a nude photo of some girl. I woke up feeling really anxious about it so I told him about my dream. He was casual about it and didn’t say much. So then I go to work and I get a text saying “that wasn’t a dream huh”. So then I was like WTF? I called him and he said he was certain I went through his hidden photos but I don’t even know his passcode and we fell asleep at the same time. I would never go through his phone like that. Then he said that he forgot the picture was there and it was a picture of his ex before his precious ex. So there were some red flags. First of all, why would he have this picture on his phone when he was with his ex girlfriend let alone while he’s with me? I went on google and some people say maybe he just forgot but it just makes me sick. If i had a picture like that of someone I used to date I would immediately delete it. On the phone, he started getting annoyed and said my concerns were “dumb”. Now he’s acting very loving like more loving than usual. It seems like he knows he messed up. We were considering getting a place together but now this is affecting the way I feel about him. Like i don’t feel like reciprocating the extra affection he’s giving me right now.

Well we were planning on leaving Saturday morning, but friends from our high school asked my husband if he wanted to go camping with them in Alaska, and without hesitation he said yes skipping our trip to Colombia.

I've told him it's a bad idea and I would like for him to come to Colombia with me, but he says he rather go camping. He's an experienced camper with survival training from his air force pilot training. He thinks that's why I'm worried and don't want him to go, but I was looking forward to him meeting my cousins who were also excited to meet him since he's a pilot an my younger cousin loves planes and apparently wants to talk about planes with him. My parents, aunts and uncles also love him a ton ( my dad especially), his Spanish has also improved since he was last with my family so I wanted to show off his progress. I also don't like being away from him, and he was deployed to Poland for 6-months this year, which was hard.

"Okay this is going to be a lot so right off the bay thank you to anyone who reads in it’s entirety.

Context:
We’re both male, 18 years old. 
Im in university he’s in college. 
And he is on the spectrum, not highly where he’s non verbal but he’s very unaware of social ques and unapologetically puts himself first. (Not a bad thing)
I’m his first boyfriend and first real relationship.
I’ve been with a few guys casually but he’s my first real relationship.
We live 4 hours apart but he lives in my home town so I visit often. 


Situation:
So basically I came home for winter break and I saw him and it was great! Although I feel like it was just neutral. We got together really fast and I feel like that might’ve dissipated the “chase” or like winning over aspect. Which is not necessary but he already isn’t romantic. I’m very into romance and very cringey romantic. He isn’t. At first It wasn’t a deal breaker but I’m kinda struggling to shift what I think is romantic to his perspective. 
(For example, him texting me normally throughout the day is his way of expressing he cares, although I would view that as the bare minimum) - [although he doesn’t Text others as much as me]

I’m just struggling with the following ideas. 
- Am I settling or holding back my feelings/needs by attempting to interpret his way of love, into mine? 
- Is asking more from him fair bc of his autism or should I view his attempts more highly 
- maybe he’ll warm up to me and I’ll understand his ways of communication as romantic once we spend more time together.
- if I don’t see myself marrying him is being with him worth it? Cause I can still learn a lot from the relationship but is it fair to do that to him?

At the end of the day I still really REALLY like him but I think the long distance + my anxiety makes me overthink and due to his inability to express feelings/romance it’s hard for me to cope. 

So really is it a question of time, effort, right person wrong time or just wrong person.","I (18 m) am struggling with processing my gay, Long distance relationship w/ my bf (18 m) of 1 month",18nazcr,1703122323.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18nazcr/i_18_m_am_struggling_with_processing_my_gay_long/,

No matter how much we talk these issues out and he says that he is sorry and is going to change he never does. 

On top of all of this he has recently started to repost some tiktok's that concern me that are red pill like i guess you could say. These posts scare me as they imply that he could possibly get dangerous with the posts saying stuff like ""women are emotional and cry while men get angry and hit things (though it didn't say people).

"TLDR is, essentially, the title.

For a little more context: My boyfriend Darren (M27) and I (F27) have been together for about a year now. I love him, but one of the things that bothers me about him is how passive he can be sometimes. Case in point- my ex texted me a few months ago at like 2 AM, and we chatted for an hour or so until he fell asleep. Nothing was inappropriate about it, but there was definitely weird energy and I felt guilty about it so I told Darren the next morning. He didn’t really have a reaction. I pressed him and told him I was sorry, and all he said was “it upsets me that you talked to him. I don’t want to argue because that won’t change anything. I’m pretty upset by this so I don’t think we should see each other today. Please don’t do it again (copied verbatim from his texts).”

It really irked me at the time how little of a reaction he had. He seemed like he didn’t even really care. I’ve always been found dominance and maybe a little bit of jealousy attractive, so I sat him down and told him this and that, basically, I’d like it a lot if he was more jealous and possessive. He said that he does feel jealousy, but it makes him feel like an ass and that he’d rather just tell me how he feels directly so that we don’t fight. I told him that it’s okay, that I would prefer it that way, and that I feel like he’s passive right now and that’s just… not attractive. He shrugged and said “fine if you say so”.

The issue is that since then, it’s been *horrible*. I can’t do anything that involves other guys without him getting upset and interrogating me. Lunch meeting with my team at work? He’s angry that I’m letting another man pay for my meal. Going to a party where guys are going to be there? He wants to go to make sure that I don’t have too much fun around them, or else he gets angry that I go. One of my friends, a guy I’ve known since high school, calls me when I’m with Darren? He wants me to put it on speaker so he can be sure my friend isn’t being inappropriate.

It’s exhausting. I’m exhausted. I know that I wanted him to be more jealous and dominant, but I didn’t want to have to deal with him trying to control my entire life. It just feels like too much and I want to ask him to stop. I’ve mentioned it a couple times in passing, that it’s getting on my nerves a little, but his reaction both times was some variation of “you said you wanted this”. Which I did, true, but this isn’t what I had in mind. How do I ask him to dial it back, or be jealous in a way that isn’t so controlling, or even just go back to how he was before?

"I've 'F27' been living with my boyfriend 'M34' for about two months and we get along well in various aspects. But I feel that no argument is constructive, we never really manage to solve problems. They always are intense discussions and we end up too hurt.

Many of our arguments are due to the fact that he has days when he wakes up super sad and I don't know how to deal with it. I also get sad, my day goes astray and we end up arguing. He says he is in a bad state, and that I shift the focus of the discussion to how I feel, I understand, but I don't know how to be in a good mood with someone who hardly talks to me and doesn't touch me.

"I(25f) am worried about my friends (22f) relationship with (nb27)

Trigger Warnings: verbal/physical abuse, talk of suicide, threats made with a weapon, stalking
TLDR: worried about my friends relationship cause of her partners crazy ex.

Fake names used. This might be kinda long. So obviously, I'm aware that this is not my personal relationship. I'm worried about my friend hailey. She's been in a relationship for about 8 months with her partner Otis. Her partner is pervously married with two kids with their ex Karen. Karen is allowed to come and go as she please as she ""babysits her kids"" and has a key to Otiss house. Karen has gone off the rails on multiple occasions. The most recent events I can recall are:
*Has pulled a knife on Otis in front of their kids
* Threatened suicide by cop if Otis called them also in front of kids. 
* has called Haileys place of work to try and get her fired.
* screams at the kids and makes them sad and angry.
*And multiple other things. 

Otis had a court case against Karen after the knife incident. but has since dropped it and is allowing her back into the house as well as around the kids. Hailey had to fake a breakup because she is scared Karen wont leave her alone and Karen is harrassing otis and the kids about where she lives. Recently tho Otis has been flaking on plans with Hailey, lying about plans, or just in general treating her like shit. Otis has given her permission to break up with them trying to make her the bad person. Otis themselves has also talked about suicide and attempted only to have Hailey stop them. 

Hailey told me today that Otis is on a criuse right now and didnt inform Hailey till the day before they were set to leave. Since Otis has been gone they accused hailey of cheating due to a life360 glitch that showed her not at work or home last night even tho another one of our friends worked with her. I'm worried about Hailey's safety and that Otis is cheating on her and projecting it back. I'm aware that this relationship is unhealthy and she needs to leave.

"I feel like my boyfriend cheated on me by looking at porn and I don’t know what to do

I (21f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been together for a bit over a year. We’ve had our issues in the past, mostly about boundaries and honesty. I have a lot of trust and boundary issues because of a past abusive relationship, and he’s done some stuff that makes it hard to trust him completely (not telling me his best friend is also his ex, lying about talking to her, etc).

I know not everyone will agree with this, but I feel that looking at porn or getting off to the thought/images of other people is micro-cheating. I raised this to my boyfriend early in our relationship, and he agreed to stay away from porn or images like that. 

Last night, we were messing around on his phone and I clicked on his recently deleted folder in his photos app. There were dozens of screenshots of instagram posts of women in bikinis and women showing off their ass/tits. He immediately realized he’d been caught and took the phone and started apologizing. 

I was so upset. I managed to get out a few questions, clarifying that it wasn’t people he knew personally, he started looking at stuff again about a month ago, it’s been every few days since then. 

A few things about this situation have really hurt me. I ask him every couple months if he’s started watching porn again and he always says no. I asked him if I had asked him that morning, would he have told me? He said probably not. 

I just feel that he’s broken my trust, and crossed a boundary I established and he agreed upon. On top of that, he admitted that he would have lied about it, had he not been caught. He has nude and sexy pictures of me that I’ve sent him and he has saved, and I’ve always told him that he can ask for pictures whenever he wants. When I asked him why mine weren’t good enough for him, why he didn’t use those and felt the need to search out other people, he said he didn’t know. I just feel now that I’m not enough for him.

On top of everything, all the women in the pictures look the same - curvy, tan, with huge breasts and big butts. I’m pale, skinny, and pretty flat chested. It’s really hit my self esteem, to think that I’m not what he really wants. 

I don’t know how to move forward. It took me a long time to feel secure and to trust in a relationship after my ex, and a long time to feel confident and sexy in my body after a long battle with an eating disorder. It feels like all of that’s been ripped out from under me.

He’s been apologetic, but he keeps saying he doesn’t know why he did it. He admits he knew it was wrong, knew it would hurt me, was going to lie about it.

How can I rebuild my trust in him?

I have been with my bf for nearly 4 years at this point but if I’m honest with myself I don’t think I’ve been the happiest with him lately and I’m starting to question whether I’m over exaggerating everything in my head or if these are genuine problems. 
- One problem that is starting to slightly bother me is that we are two very different people, we both have somewhat conflicting views on things and have very different interests. I sometimes wish that I had someone a little more similar to my personality and interests. I tend to have a more creative mindset while he has a more country mindset. 
- He is an extreme car guy and sinks about every penny he earns into it. Meanwhile every penny I make usually ends up going into him, whether it’s buying him food, buying something he wants, or otherwise. It’s always I treat him and never the other way around. 
- I feel like our relationship has an unequal dynamic. I feel like I’m the person who plans all the dates, who does everything around the apartment, I always feel like I have to take care of him or things go to shit. I feel more like a mother than I do a girlfriend. I feel like I constantly have to be in charge because he makes it where I’m always in charge. There is no chance to be feminine in a sense. But I don’t think that’ll ever change, he’s always been like that. 
- I feel like he doesn’t try romantically, he doesn’t try to impress me at all. There is no.. romance. 

These are just a few of the problems I feel like there are in our relationship, he really is a wonderful guy and he has helped me through a lot and helped me grow as a person. I really do truly love him and have tried to talk to him about problems and solutions but nothing seems to change. Any suggestions? Solutions at all?

"I know people have this viewpoint that young love is different from older love. But this girl was different.  
  
When I saw her in the hallway for the first time and saw her hair and eyes I knew I wanted to be with her. She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.  
  
First date rolled around and she came over to my house. She was so quiet and shy but I knew she had a kind heart and it was so comfy. We watched bad animations on YouTube, and walked around town and went to the gas station to get coffee. A date turned into two. One day turned into a year.  
  
Our one year anniversary was three days ago.  
  
Around March, I find out her friend was actually her ex. They showered together, kissed, cuddled, and talked about having sex. She never told me this so she could stay friends with her ex.  
  
I found out (she didn't even tell me) and I forgave her for it, because no drama was worth losing her. And months go by and it's still a little shaky because of the broken trust, but I thought it was getting better.  
  
So yesterday, her friends randomly hate me and they're throwing random accusations of me that I don't even know what they are because my girlfriend refuses to tell me. Three days ago it was ""I love you and I want to be with you forever"" and today she told me she is not in love with me anymore.  
  
I still have the handwritten notes she made me with Kirby on them because she knew how much I liked Kirby. She didn't have money so she made me flowers with plastic straws and paper. She told me I was her best friend and ""thank you for loving me when I haven't made it easy"" on those notes I have.  
  
I've never been this sad before. She was my best friend. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I'm almost throwing up because of how sad and heartbroken I am. I'm never going to get over her.  
  
She added her ex back and they're talking again. Same day she left me.  
  
I know how this makes her look, but she was always so nice and caring. She's blocked me on everything and said she never wants to talk again. I lost her. I loved her so much. I still love her. And now winter break is tomorrow so I'll spend two weeks alone and isolated.  
  
I need her back and I miss her. I miss her so much.  
  
I'll never get to hold her again. I'll never make her laugh again. I'll never be able to say I love you again. I'll never hear her voice tell me how much she loves me. I'll never be able to make future plans with her. I'll never be able to date her again.  
  
I'm ugly crying right now. I can't believe I lost my best friend. Life doesn't feel like it's worth living now. I still have the clothes she gave me. I have everything.  
  
Somebody please help me. I still will see her every single day. How am I supposed to move on knowing I'll never have that love again? There's so many other girls out there but there's only one of her. She made waking up in the morning worth it.

"Started talking to a girl a week after she broke up with her ex, although she lied and said it happened a few weeks beforehand. Two weeks in she is speaking to this ex in a bar when we’re out for a party we went as matching costumes for, she ends up walking off with him at the end of the night - despite us both admitting we like each other this same night (not sure where they went, she said her ex’s dad took her home and nothing happened). Three weeks in we went on a date after casually seeing each other a couple of times and more or less agreed on exclusiveness as she brought it up. A couple weeks later we talked about relationships and she said she didnt expect to get into one so soon after her last, so just see where things go - i told her i was looking for one here. A week or so later she “might’ve” kissed my “friend” but she cant remember as she was too drunk (she did as this friend gave me the full story not long ago), i gave her benefit of the doubt as everything was so uncertain at this point and gave her these boundaries (and to clarify this is 6/7 weeks into us seeing each other):

- full exclusiveness from this point onwards, no even entertaining other guys as i thought we had agreed on already
- i want us to think about comitting within next few weeks as itd be pushing over 2 months with no commitment
- no more getting blackout drunk - thats 2/2 times since we started talking 
- keep in touch whenever youre out drinking every couple hours

She agreed to all of it and thought it was reasonable - its the bare minimum to me honestly, i refused to even dance with other girls ive known for months when i was out lol. However we went out and looked at Christmas lights in the town a couple days after. She then cancelled plans to stay at mine the day after, did go gym with me though the following day, but avoided plans for her birthday with me. She did see me for 15 minutes at night so i could drop off her present. She cancelled gym, began becoming blunt and not replying, constantly avoided plans all week whilst taking longer and longer to respond with dryer and dryer texts - and heres the punchline, she had been sleeping with her ex she just broke up with since her birthday. He had told my friend, and my friend broke the news to me - she lied about why she was blunt all week and never admitted this.

Admittedly I walked through countless red flags here lol. Given she was just out of a relationship, was I too strict with these boundaries or am I just blaming myself here? Should I have been more patient with her or was this always destined to happen regardless?

Her degree was a 3y degree and mine was a 4y degree. So we both mutually agreed to do long distance till we both finish and move to the same city tgh. 

She finished hers and started working. I failed a few papers so I had to repeat a 1 year. But i think this degree is not for me and I wanna do a different degree. Which is gonna add 3 more years. We got engaged in March 2023. 

Because im a student and she is working she wanna do all these expensive stuff like travel eat out, activities and stuff. But I don’t have the money for that. 

Yesterday she said I really wanna do all of this stuff but we cant cause of my financial situation (she never ask me to pay for her things but she wants me to pay my half which is fair and I understand) but I don’t have the finances for that. 

So she is mad at me and yesterday she said “I wanna have fun and do stuff but I can’t cause you can’t afford it, I’m not asking you to pay for my stuff but at least pay for your part. I’m not asking you to have thousands of dollars but a normal income”

My bf and met through some mutual friends about 7 months ago.

This is my very first serious relationship so everything is new to me. Our relationship wasn’t really a decision; it just sort of happened after being friends for a few months. And it is kinda unconventional because we both have demanding careers and don’t get to see each other in person as often as we’d like.

Last time we hung out I noticed that my boyfriend has fallen very hard for me; to a point where I feel like it could possibly be an emotional dependency thing for him.

I have fallen hard for him too. But I still value my interdependence in the relationship and guard myself. Now that my boyfriend and I have become more serious, I’m trying to think more logically about the relationship.

Obviously, before getting in a new relationship you assess your feelings and basic compatibility points. But it still takes time to truly get to know someone and I feel like my boyfriend and I are at a point in our relationship where we are getting to know each other’s true selves.

I think it’s important to start thinking of new, more specific discussions that could possibly surface some hidden conflicts/ differences incompatible for a long-term or lifelong relationship. But I want to discuss them knowing my BF and I will do everything we can to make us work, but also be strong enough to end things if we ultimately can’t.

I get anxious seeing how much my boyfriend loves me. He never brings up difficult topics, just loves me so deeply it makes me feel guilty for being anxious. And I’m scared that if we had to end things for whatever reason, it would destroy him. I’m terrified he would feel betrayed or blame himself.

I have no idea how to communicate this anxiety to him without making him think I’m doubting our relationship. Because I really want us to work.

I also don’t know how to get both of us to approach difficult discussions in a way we both feel heard and valued no matter what it could lead to.

Please give advice if you have any.",My (24F) boyfriend (26M) has fallen hard for me it’s making me feel anxious and stuck about assessing our compatibility.

When I was a teeneger I did a lot of outdoor activities sailing surfing backpacking sports I really loved doing this stuff. ( late teens I got involved in the wrong crowd of people I stopped doing this stuff and almost went to jail for things I did with these people).  So I started doing these outdoor things again to get outside and accomplishing stuff in my life. I have come to really love doing these thing again and can’t get enough of it. Backpacking is something I like the most and for 2 years I have done a huge amount of it in my area I live(day hiking) I want to do overnight stuff now but further away and eventually travel my country to go further afield. The issue that is coming up atm is my partner doesn’t  want me doing overnight backpacking if she isn’t able to come with me (previous relationship trust issue on her behalf) (she also runs her own business and has very little time to do things outside her work schedule). I also have goals to travel my country (New Zealand) to backpack the South Island in the future and to do the te aroa trail(3300km 3 months hiking). I also want to travel to different country and hike also Canada USA Europe in the future. With my relationship atm and knowing my partner I will not be able to do this partners business can’t be moved around and I wouldn’t ask her to pack her business up and move because of something I want to do.

"Hi Reddit, just looking for some advice on interpretting my ex gf's behaviours recently. 

For background info, we split up 6 months ago after two years together. It was a messy breakup, she moved on quickly with another man, and i was upset and began working on myself and going no contact. Couple months later we saw each other again and slept with each other breifly before I then initated another period of no contact moving foward for 3 months.

Fast foward to a month ago. I had her blocked on all social media as well as phone number, I have met other women and dated around, and have now improved my mental health, physical appearance and have moved on from breakup, though I still hear through friends she is sort of depressed and now addicted to weed and alcohal while away at school. 

After awhile of no contact (she was blocked and I did not reach out) I began receiving calls from a burner instagram account? Turns out it was her, this was her only way of physically contacting me. I answered and we spoke for about a half hour catching up, being very friendly and laughing. I then ended the call. For the next week I got a call every 48 hours on the instagram account, and we spoke breifly over and over again, always her initiating. 

I then realized my feelings were flooding back, and decided it would be healthy to block the burner account and yet again start no contact. While this was fine for me about 2 weeks later I started recieving no caller Id calls. I finally picked one up it was her, she told me she missed me and it still felt like we were together, she asked when im coming home from school (back to our hometown) and i told her. 

Now 2 days ago, I went to the bar she works at with her friends for my friends birthday. He suggested the bar and I knew she worked there but based on our recent friendly convos i assumed this would be ok. We said hello, had a couple friendly conversations in person while she was working and I went home.

Yesterday I get a no caller Id message. It's her. She is crying. She says she talked to her mom and is distraught and needs to move on. She says it feels like I am trying to manipulate her. Her friends keep brining me up and my gym progress, she sees me all happy at the bar without her, and us talking has made her go crazy. She is now yelling at me saying it needs to be over and she needs to finally be free of me. To which i reply, she has initiated contact every single time over the last two month, and I thought we could see each other at her bar because we are on good terms. She then cut me off and continued to yell, if you ever come to the bar we will kick you out and ban you. 

Today, I wake up with two missed calls from a no caller id number, obviously her, and I did not pick up nor call back. I am so confused. Mutual friends say she has lost it and is obssessed with me, but yet she claims she never wants to talk or see me again? I am confused. Deep down I still care about her and long for feeling love again. How do I continue to move on in a healthy fashion as I have?

My (f20) boyfriend (m33) have been together for a few months, long enough to start being intimate but that's where the problems come up. Outside of this one problem our relationship is perfect, he is kind and caring and patient with me and my trauma, hes the sweetest man I've had the joy to meet. But yesterday I told him I wasn't feeling up to having sex, I wasn't doing good mentally. He said it was okay at least 10 times but then last night he kept touching me and grinding and teasing to the point I gave in so he would be happy, it was also past midnight so it was his birthday and maybe it was asshole-ish of me to say no on his birthday? I don't know how to respond.


UPDATE: Okay for the people saying the age difference is weird yes it is but mentally he isn't 33. I don't mean that to be mean but he's autistic and I tried to take that into account as well.

 I have already personally had my partying phase and he hasn’t yet which he wants to do but I want nothing to do with. I also have six bodies and he only has two and I feel like that could contribute to him feeling behind. I told him that I want him to live his life, and if he wants to do those certain things, I won’t be able to be around for that
 he also told me he thinks we fell in love on accident because I had just gotten out of a year and a half long relationship and we started talking a week later. 
 we both don’t wanna leave each other and we both love each other. I’ve never loved someone like I love him, but I think we’re different now.

That's where I had met him and Last night I wanted to be honest with him. Because I thought this was gonna go somewhere so I thought being honest about my activities with a with a guy that I was meeting that night because I had already made this plans before I had talked with him The night before that, about how he thought we should slow down on our hook ups and what not because we thought this might turn into something that could be possibly serious later down-the-line and I was like okay slow down. I interpreted that as no more taking any more hook ups or at least taking less.I had already made plans before me and him had this conversation and I didn't want to miss them and so I was honest with him about it. Because I didn't want drama if it later came out being like. ""Oh, why didn't you tell me why did you lie?"" Type shit. But he freaked out being like ""oh, if you do this, I won't talk to you anymore.This is so disrespectful"" and I really liked him and I was like I don't want that I'm i'm not ready for relationship. I don't have a lot of experience in the sexual world so I wanted to go out and do more before I thought to Settle down and I told him that and he was still upset. He never even acknowledged that. He just went back onto how he felt disrespected. That I was doing this even we were talking, he only ever said slowed down if he had told me he wanted exclusively talking. Then I would have either done that or I would've told him no, because in that moment. I really liked him and I probably would have agreed to it. But now I'm looking back at this because we weren't even dating it. And he was upset and I had already made the plans with the other guy. He was already on his way when I told him. That like he was 10-20 minutes away. So I couldn't just cancel on him, be like a sorry and have him turn around because he lives a good distance away. And so I he picked me up. I was getting bombarded with messages from my from the guy before, I'll call him Max and just making me feel like I was cheating. Eve when we hadnt even talked about any kind of exclusivity or anything like that, he even. But he constantly threatened to no longer tart talk to me he first started out with. ""Oh, if you do this, we can only be friends"" and then it evolved to never talking to me again. The more I told him like. Hey, i still wanna do this?
And like he was really upset with me. And it just made me feel awful. And so i when I got to the hotel I had to sat up there by myself in the room. Because the guy was downstairs doing something. And I was talking to Max for a good while. And he just would not stop telling me that he would never speak to me again. If I did anything sexual with him.  And I was stressed and I wound up going home. Because I did not want to lose him. And now he wanted me to get rid of everything and everyone. All my dating apps and all the guys that I'm talking to And even after all of that, I asked him. I was like ""okay so then what are we?""

I did not spend a good portion of my night sobbing and crying. Thinking you were gonna leave just so you could do this. And I even told him if I block everyone and he leaves me. Then I will wind up all alone and won't have anyone to talk to I mean, yes I can go get the apps again. But those were relationships that were built on weeks.

"My feelings get hurt easily. For the most part I do a fairly good job at working through the little things I’ll read into/take personally 

Today though I can’t shake it and I need advice on how to phrase my feelings to him

He’s been unemployed for a couple of weeks - he starts a new job in January so he’s just hanging until then. He had a friend come visit for 6 days and they had such a great time

I still work but my schedule is wonky - I have mornings off and the rest of my day is busy until 10pm or so. I spent the night last night after we drove his friend home. Today I tried to wake him up at 8:45am- I’ve never woken him up before but I wanted to hang out &amp; have brekky together before I left &amp; I thought he’d be okay with it/go along with it 

He said “please don’t” and continued to sleep. This really hurt my feelings like cmon dog you spent the last 6 days sleeping in &amp; I work in 2 hours I wanna chill!! So I kissed him on the cheek &amp; left feeling upset

 I have such a shit time telling someone how they hurt my feelings especially because I feel like it’s so small. I tried to tell him later that I was bothered by it and he said “it’s all good I just needed to catch up on sleep” but also sent me a Snapchat saying “when your girl tried to wake you up at a reasonable hour but you live that unemployed life”

I’m just really turned off by this behavior &amp; I don’t know how to talk through it with him without being so black and white about it.

"I was seeing this girl in my class for a little while, she pulled away and I just gave her the space. She started showing interest in me again after a month. I gave in and started talking with her again, but I think I messed it up because I was being a little needy/desperate.  
  
She pulled away again after around 1 week by not opening my messages for a week. I did not give her much attention in class and didn't chase her. Around 2 weeks later, for seemingly no apparent reason, she blocked me on snapchat.  
  
About 1,5-2 months later now and she has started talking with her friends in class loudly about other guys. Her friends also much more regularly talk to me and seemingly want to be around me during some classes. They don't talk about or ask me about this girl though.

"So I (18M) have a friend (18F) that I've known for 2 years. Over the past couple months maybe half a year I've started to like her. Late October I asked her on a date and she said yes. About three days before the date she expressed to me that she wanted to back out of it being a date and just wanted to hang out. Ok fast forward like three weeks and her backing out of the date came up in conversation. She explained that she wanted to back out because she wasn't sure if I wanted to date to get to know her more or date because I really like her. I wasn't sure if that was a gentle way of letting me down or her genuine feelings. And if it was what she genuinely thought then I don't really understand why that would change her response to going a date.

"English is not my first language, so please bear with me if i make mistakes. 
I have a boyfriend of almost 2 years now, but I think we are on the verge of break up. Even if we ends up splitting up, I’d like to get a third party’s perspective since we have 2 separate points of views and can’t seem to meet in the middle ground. 

So at first, everything was going great like almost every couple, but we still had disagreement occasionally. And whenever we fought, I always thought the problem was his inability to relate to my feelings while he believed I was overreacting over small things and was trying to control him. Despite that, we've had many conversations and both tried to put in effort, I think. 
The thing is, he got busier recently and that arose some issues. 
The things that are bothering me the most are:

1. When he hangs out with his friends, he stays out until late at night, but when he's with me, he always wants to go home at a set time. 
2. We agreed to not see each other two days a week to be able to rest and do personal things. Well, he gets annoyed when I call him during those days, thinking I'm being clingy and dependent.
3. He says hurtful things during arguments and I’ve let him known. 

Now, his perspective:

1. He argues that since he doesn't have many days he can hang out with friends, but he comes to see me almost every day, so he doesn’t have to stay late with me. 
2. It’s not that he doesn’t want to call at all, but after talking for a bit, he wants to have his personal space, especially during those days. 
3. He acknowledges he can be rude, but feels I pushed him to that extent.

While it might seem like I'm restricting him, we don't have much time together because he’s busy and finishes working late. At the beginning of the relationship, he made an effort to hang out with me every day, but now, we see each other maybe 3-4 days a week, 2-3 hours usually. Is wanting to call him after work too much clinginess and dependent? I'm curious to know how other people perceive this. Do I need to better understand his situation or if my demands are reasonable?

"To be clear, I am in a relationship, with a gf whom I love so much. And I used to be closer with this friend a couple years ago, but even then we never even hung out one on one. I've had a crush on this girl since 8th grade, ever since I saw her sitting behind me in my homeroom, at that time it was just a passing ""oh wow she's really cute"" and it's been waxing and waning ever since. I kinda forgot about her until junior year, when I saw her and had basically the same thought and my crush flared up again. I've always been pretty sure she's straight, and I never felt as though she was flirting with me or returned my feelings so she kinda just stayed in the back of my mind. Since kindergarten I've always had literally a list of crushes and throughout highschool I've had similar crushes, and with most of them either the crush dies off slowly or I found out their straight and they reject me ☠️ When i started liking my girlfriend I just kinda stopped having eyes for anyone else and although this girl was still kind of in the back of my mind I didn't think anything of it. But over the past couple of months I've really become infatuated with her, both physically and emotionally and I genuinely don't know how to stop it. The last two I confessed, one not by my choice lol, but obviously I can't nor wouldn't do that now, even if just for closure. I also really care about her as a friend and I don't want to lose that, even if there's not much there. I want the feelings to go away but they haven't and I feel like I can't do anything about it. This girl barely even talks to me, we keep a snap streak but that's it. She either made up an excuse to get out of hanging out or she really wasn't able to and never cared to try and hang out. I don't remember the last time she ever initiated a conversation and tbh I have no idea why she even snaps me other than maybe just politeness and being nice. And I know I probably deserve more in a true friend anyway but I just can't not. I don't know how to get over her romantically or move on or something and I feel pretty hopeless.

TL;DR: Crush on girl, but I have gf, and also girl is probably straight, plus we barely talk, but I still can't not like her, but I want it to go away, and I don't know what to do 😭","I (20F) have a major crush on a friend (20F), how do I move on?",18n9uly,1703118886.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n9uly/i_20f_have_a_major_crush_on_a_friend_20f_how_do_i/,

Okey I've read the comments and before I post the update let me address a few thing.  
Yes, I've put some info that is irrelevant. Like my built and that I'm autistic. I used to be the fat kid that got bullied and did not understand that my brain worked different then other people. Yes the math part is cool, but there are other things that you easily understand and I can not comprihent.   
Sorry for being proud of my change over the years. And like a dork I mentioned it even if it had nothing to do with what happened.   
Also when Rachel met Sophie and made the move on her, she was unaware that Sophie was married. She thought it would just be a casual hookup and nothing more.   
  
**Now for the update.**  
My Mother called Sophie and she responded with ""Mom, I know why you're calling. It is not what you think it is and we'll explain some other time. Now tell everyone to stop harassing your son, he did nothing wrong""  
Rachel stayed the night in the guest bedroom. That night the three of us had a talk. Unbeknown to us, Rachel has had her own trauma with a homewrecker. Her parentss divorced and her mother was trauma dumping on her daughter. There is more but lets leave it at that.   
This is why Rachel was soo upset when Emily verbally attacked her.   
Sophie told Rachel that she would understand if she wanted to break up now. Rachel wanted to try to fix things before throwing in the towel.  
The next morning at breakfast we were talking about what to do now. Sophie thought it was time to come out to my family. They have been her only family for the last 5 years.   
  
We decided to invite my parents and sister over to have the conversation. Rachel wanted to be by Sophie's site when she came out.   
So in the afternoon my parents and sister came over. My dad was quiet, if you know him, that's not good. Mom was crying and Emily was cussing at me.   
As soon as she say Rachel she wanted to approach her. I know my sister and how aggresive she can be so I made sure I was standing between her and Rachel at all times. Which thinking back might have send the wrong message. Emily is afraid of nothing and nobody but she also knows she can not get past me if I don't want her to.   
Sophie is a godsend, she was able to get everyone to calm down, sit down and listen.  
She told them everything. My parents were already aware of the emotional abuse she got int he church, but not to what extent.  
Sophie told them about her having to hide who she was, her sexuality. What happend at the big event, the trouble we had because of how she reacted afterwards. My suggestion for the one-sided open marriage. She took Rachel's hand and said they have been in a relationship for 6 months. I added with my blessing.

Emily started accusing Sophie of cheating and that is when I lost it. I yelt at her that this is our marriage, nobody cheated. This is the way we are happy. She doesn't have to understand it, but she has to accept it. I'm not sure Emily is convinced and on board, especially after what happened later. 

I had to explain to my mother a few times that Sophie and I are not breaking up, and that Sophie is in a relationship with two people. I'm still not sure she understands, but at least she is not angry anymore.   
Dad asked a few questions. I had to explain that my relationship with Rachel is platonic but we are close. As soon as he cracked a corny joke I knew we were good.  
Then we had to explain what happened the day before and why I was alone with Rachel who was topless sunbathing at my pool.   
When we came to the part where Emily walked in my mother asked her a question. Why did she walk in unannounced? We gave her a key in case of an emergency, not to casually walk in whenever she wanted. Turned out Emily sometimes ""visited"" our home when we were away to ""borrow"" a bottle of wine. (Sophie and I have one car, if it's not in the driveway on a Saturday it usually means nobody is home). After hearing that the key went from Emily to Rachel.   
  


tl;dr  
Told my parents and sister about my wife's poly relationship and have them meet her girlfriend  
So Dad is cracking jokes again, which means we're good.  
Mom is still a bit confused, but is trying to understand.   
Emily was still angry but she doesn't know who she is angry with.

"TLDR: boyfriend came home noticed something was bothering me. So I told him. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about how i feel loved when he would call me during lunch and after work on his way home. And, that it doesn’t feel good that it doesn’t happen anymore. He then jokingly said  that maybe it’s mental Illness. Said that not his experience and he doesn’t see it my way. Raised his voice a little and said I don’t know what else you want me to do besides be around you 24/7. We live together and have 2 small kids. Thoughts? 


I came home today after thinking deeply. I was thinking about our relationship whether or not it was satisfying me and what I would do if the relationship ended.
I started contemplating the life with the kids. I have a history of being in bad relationships. While they weren’t ever physically abusive there was forms of emotional abuse. He’s the first bf that isn’t that bad but it’s not a fairy tale either. It’s just stagnant. Like a puddle

He’s has his moments of sweetness and closeness and we have fun. However, there are times when it gets cold between us. He doesn’t wanna cuddle me. He doesn’t like holding hands. Only closed mouth kisses. He’s in the office playing games on my computer for hours. And then there are days where we watch a show together once he’s off the game.
There are days we eat together but he’ll get up when he’s done instead of waiting for me to finish. 

Today tho I just felt sad about him not talking to me on the phone. And when I did talk to him he spoke back to me in one word or two word responses. He said he was doing research on his picks for the game which is why he was like that. 

After that I just felt so lonely. I just wanted to feel loved and less like a burden. It got me to thinking what I actually get out of the relationship and whether to just end it. 

This obviously made me sad so when he came home he noticed immediately. 

I hesitated to bring it up. But I started talking about it. He noticed that the floor was dirty and started vacuuming during my explanation. 😂 I waited till he was done and continued. I ended up saying that this is something he usually did and that it stopped recently and that it made me feel loved and that I was on his mind. Now that he stopped it makes me feel the opposite. 

He started doing something in the kitchen and starts saying “do you think it’s mental illness?” I immediately was taken aback and annoyed but kept my composure. Then I followed up with an explanation on why that was rude. He rebutted and says “I’d didn’t say you had a mental illness I just asked a question.”

Despite my efforts to calmly explain how I felt. And, that I wanted him to stop arguing right wrong and whos at fault, and instead discuss how I felt. He started raising his voice and going on about what else do you want me to do. I can’t think of anything else besides not playing the game anymore and being around you 24/7.

He said that “we took the babies to the doctor, spend time in the morning on the weekends with the kids and watch tv together. What more do I want? If I had friend and I was going out it would be worse.maybe you’re just not busy enough.”

All these things just make me feel like. I want to end the relationship. There’s just way too many red flags in his response that clearly state “I don’t care for you.”

This on top of me carrying the mental load for the house and not having an equal partner to take care of the home. Sigh

"My brother has always been the agreeable type, he hadn’t really owned a specific personality, he just does what he is told to do. I hoped he would develop that over time but it never really happened.

After high school we both went to different schools and I tried to help nurture him from afar but I’ve wondered if his social IQ was entirely there, it’s mostly there but not entirely.

That said, his girlfriend, turned fiancé, turned wife of two years now, seems to be telling him to do things and he just agrees to it. She also seems to be an alpha in the relationship.

Long story short she has him join an MLM and he doesn’t recognize the flaws in it even though I try to point them out, he still thinks they’ll become wealthy if they hold on tight.

Another thing she does is she is always in the background when I call him. I can never have bro talk with him, she’s always lingering.

These are a handful of pointers to potential manipulation. Tell me if I’m wrong.

The most recent is this. Just was on the phone with him today, he seemed to be alone at work. Anyways, he talked about everyone coming home for the holidays (his family included). My mother always wants to have us over but she has anxiety and other issues herself so she can never seem to have a clean house (my dad the same but he’s had Alzheimer’s that last few years so he doesn’t really have much stuff any more cause he never uses it) so it’s mostly my moms things.

Anyways. Picture this, a small, trashy house housing a large grown up family (around 10-12 people) for a number of days. Really not desirable but I try to give my mom some love cause she tries her best.

Well naturally, in laws don’t necessarily have that same innate desire to fulfill the needs of the parent in laws.

They plan to come and I know some of my in laws drag their feet by doing so. However, my brother called and asked (since I’m here already) if the house is clean and if the remodeling is done. He then went to say that this happens every year and if things don’t change there might be “consequences”, eluding to the idea that they probably won’t come again for Christmas if it’s messy.

Listen, I understand where they are coming from. But I KNOW that wasn’t  his word choice, that was likely hers. He’s the type to want to make everyone happy and now it’s turned to making her happy, which is fine. But he seems to be in a place where he is being manipulated.

All I want to do is point this out to him and I don’t want to try to put a rift between her and him, I also know he would be defensive and might hurt our relationship.

Is there any way to go about this? I feel he doesn’t speak up for himself in the relationship, and I don’t know if I have any position to tell him this.","My brother (26M) gives me (30M) and the rest of our family an ultimatum, and I think it’s coming from his wife",18n9r2c,1703118603.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n9r2c/my_brother_26m_gives_me_30m_and_the_rest_of_our/,
"Hi everyone,

I have this friend who I've started to suspect may be interested in being more than friends with me. However, I can't quite tell, and it's causing me a lot of stress. Here's why I think that she might be interested:

- She texts me every day (although not all day, as she is very busy).
- She has once heavily implied me being someone she is ""interested"" in.
- She buys me food.
- She is very protective of me. She doesn't like me doing anything even remotely dangerous, or even being too harsh on myself.
- She touches me. Recently, we were sitting together, and she squished up to me so we were touching. There was plenty of space, so it's not like we were squished together.
- We behave very ""couple-y"" by default - we tease each other a lot, and sometimes get mistaken for a couple.
- We have a list of things to do together in the future.
- She has made comments about ending up being married to me.

This all looks fairly obvious right? However, there's one thing I didn't mention that confuses the whole thing - she already has a boyfriend. In the past, she's said he won't be round forever, but that was a while ago. She is also sometimes quite distant.

My(32F) bf(32M) and I have been together for a little over 2 years now, before we dated he was engaged to this girl who I’ll call Anna(27F).

Him and Anna met while he was in the peace corp in South America where she is from, they only dated for about a year, he proposed to her just 5 months into the relationship and from what I’ve heard from some of his friends he was completely head over heels for her, they broke up because she said she was not ready to leave everything and come to the US with him and she was just afraid of them not working out and she would be stuck and they were too different, etc; he was devastated, he told me that was the most depressing time of his life and it took him almost a year or more to fully move on from her since he tried to get back with her after a couple months and she told him she didn’t want to get back with him and she had met someone, she met this person after they were done and he believes her.

Now this all happened in 2018, fast forward to the present after he “moved on” they kept a civil relationship since he said he now understands he was asking too much from her, etc, and she is just a good friend apparently she was also a foreigner to the country where they met so they were all they had and it created a bond that lasted after the breakup.

Everything was fine with that until she moved to the same city than us 8 months ago, one of her best friends lives here and she moved in with her, she told him about it about 5 months ago and he asked me if I would be okay with all us hanging out and I said yes because I trust him and he swears they’re just friends, well I met her and this girl is a very typical attractive looking Latina, long dark hair, nice body, etc, she’s also super nice and I genuinely think that at least from her there’s no feelings towards him, we’ve hung out a couple times and she befriended some of our girlfriends that are also single.

My issue started about  a month ago when one of friends brothers met her and asked her out, when he found out Anna was my bf’s ex he decided to ask him if he was okay with it since they’re friends too, he said he was okay but somehow I feel he wasn’t, I noticed he was jealous, a feeling I’ve never seen in him, his demeanor and attitude and even his mood changed after that question, well this guy and Anna have been on a couple dates by now because they seem to get along well and my bf have completely stopped hanging out with that group of friends, he is avoiding every encounter where he knows they will be.

Before anyone asks yes I talked to him and he said it has nothing to do with that and he’s just not being in the mood to go out.

I think he still has feelings for her somehow, I mean he proposed to her after 5 months, it took him more time to move of from her than they were even together for.

I feel like confronting him directly again but what if he truly means it, should I also stop hanging out with them and find things to do with him that don’t involve his ex or should I just let it go and it might only be what he is saying?",I(32F) think my boyfriend(32M) is still in love with his ex(27F).,18n9f9s,1703117615.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n9f9s/i32f_think_my_boyfriend32m_is_still_in_love_with/,
"For context I have been dating my girlfriend for about 3 months. She married very young and divorced about 6 months ago after her husband cheated on her. I have never been engaged, but have dated long term. My girlfriend also lives in the same apartment complex as her ex husband, who she says she doesn’t speak to under any circumstances. 

Not long after us dating I found out her guy best friend liked her. I communicated that I am not comfortable with her being friends with someone who likes her, and she agreed that it would be inappropriate to continue the friendship. She says she ended the friendship, and does not speak to her ex guy best friend. At this point I had no suspicions 

 The suspicions started the other night when I was staying at her apartment. We had went out Christmas shopping and finally arrived home after a couple hours looking for gifts. I work early so I usually go to bed around 9pm while she stays up later. We went to bed as normal but around 3am I woke up to use the restroom, I decided to look at my phone to check the time, and saw a text from her saying “I’m going to the car to talk to my coworker [22F] about a case, I’ll be back in a moment”. I read this super sleepy and thought nothing of it, when I woke up later I started thinking, why would she need to go to the car instead of the living room when it’s freezing cold outside? She also had called her friend around 9pm and she didn’t answer because she believed she was asleep. The fact that she went outside in freezing cold to talk to her friend in the car about work is extremely unsettling to me. Another factor that has started to make me unsettled is that In front of her friends she brags about sexual acts and that she “loves” getting into the bed room. In the three months we have only had sex 4 times, thats almost 1 times every 20 days. Lately when I ask she says she’s too tired or doesn’t feel good. I’ve been understanding with this because she has a very mentally taxing job and understand she will feel drained after a long day. The last thing I want is to seem untrusting, but these factors have made me suspicious.

"Growing up my mom told me I was gaining too much weight every year when we went clothes shopping. She constantly monitored what I ate and often stopped buying snacks I liked because I “ate them too much”. 

Looking back, I was not a “fat” kid. But I thought I was. Her comments and constant criticism ended up making me starve myself in the daytime (when she watched me) and binge uncontrollably throughout ages 6-19. I would eat so much at night (when she was asleep) that I would feel sick. But I also worked out a lot and while I wasn’t skinny, I horrible. I have since fixed my binging problem, and I never eat to fullness anymore. 

Cut to these last few years. I have been having problems with my anxiety and starting teaching. I was basically crying every day from stress and stuff. I ended up getting an ulcer and I quit teaching a few months later. It’s been 6 months now and I am finally feeling like I can breathe. 

I come home for the holidays and my mom has thrown out most of the food in the house. She is grilling me on what I eat normally. She told me that I shouldn’t be hungry and that I am probably eating too much. She cited my bf buying the two us 2 slices of cheesecake as the evidence that my lifestyle is “unhealthy” and that she is “concerned”. She said that I have “rapidly” gained a “hefty” amount of weight since college. 

Have I gained weight? Yes. Am I plus sized? Yes. Am I proud of being overweight? No. Am I 300 lbs? Also no. But her constant comments and criticism right now are making me spiral again and as an adult I don’t know why I would have to keep taking these emotional beating that just aren’t helpful. 

But when I ask her to stop, she says that she is just being honest and that I am being so sensitive and that she is genuinely afraid for me.

"Hello everyone,

My husband and I are married almost 5 years.
In these years I have spend Christmas/NewYears holidays 1 time alone with him, 1 time with him and his family and 1 time only with his and my family without him and one time just with my family. ( I invited his family to Europe to meet my family and show them around my home country with my own budget)
I am from Europe and moved to the US for him and his job.

Since my mother has died last year I have decided to spend this holidays with my family. (I am VERY close to my family) 
I have discussed this already in August with him. I asked if he wants to join but he said no.
So I have bought my ticket already back in September.

In November he send me the itinerary of the flight of his family. Which shows they will be here for Christmas. 
I told him that’s nice that they join him for holidays and he will not be so lonely on these days. Which he replied what do you mean “alone” 

Well I told him again that I will be with my family which we already have discussed back in August.
He couldn’t not remember and that’s where all the mess started…

He has never spend one holiday (any holiday) with me and my family, which me on the other side always compromised and tried to be fair with holidays or birthdays.

He wants me to change my flight and spend at least one holiday with him. Christmas or NewYears.

For me to change my flight would cost me $450 and it’s not promised if I get a seat.
If I flight out for Christmas I only have 3 days with my families to be back for NewYears which makes no sense to me because I have spend $1300 for my ticket and the next time I will se my family is next year August. 

Side note: He doesn’t have a good relationship with my family for what reason ever there was never a fight or argument with him and them. He also don’t really want to make an effort to have a good relationship. 

So now we have decided to split since it make no sense to continue this marriage with so many differences we have. (And he called the shot to get divorce if I don’t spent one holiday with him because I don’t set him as my priority)
We love each other but we are not compatible in my eyes.

He still trying to convince me to stay for Christmas which I refuse and want make a cut from here. 

Am I wrong? Do I miss something here? I am at a loss right now because not only have I lost my mother, now I am also losing another person I love.

"Background:
I (26m) who has a girlfriend (22f) am starting to get quite close with my co-worker (31f) who is married (40m) and it's getting a little confusing/complicated. 

I'd like to firstly state that I would never cheat on my girlfriend, however, I'm unsure on where this line sits now, prehaps I am already there emotionally?

My colleague works in the same position as me, we are an extremely small management team (4 total) with a crap lead, so we lean on each other a lot.
My colleague works from home most of the time, every two weeks she comes down for 1 day.
Over the last 6 months, we have become closer and closer.

Phone calls &amp; contact:
-  First it was just long zoom calls mostly about work. Over a period of months this became phone calls, texts etc just getting to know each other every work day. 
It's now to the point that yesterday, we were on the phone for over 2.5hrs.

Her situation:
My colleague is married, when her husband (40M) is around, she doesn't contact me as much, and I notice she talks about him a lot more, and 70% our conversations are work related. They also have a child together (1f).

The issue:
Today, I drove 3hrs round trip to see her. I was due to have a day off today, but she kept asking if I would meet her for lunch. As mentioned, she comes down to ""site"" once every two weeks. So far, everytime she has come down we have met for lunch, however there's always been an excuse to meet up (me helping her with something)

Today, we had a table for two in a semi casual restaurant, she spoke about issues in her relationship and opened up about quite a few personal things to me. At this point, I'm unsure how she views me and how I view her. I do feel like I'm catching feelings for her - which I know isn't right, but I am struggling to distance myself. I am suspicious of her intentions as she is so different when her husband is home, almost a different person.
A few weeks ago at the work Christmas meal we found ourselves on a table of two in the corner, a lot of the staff were making comments that we looked like we were on a date and were getting on extremely well.

Does anyone have any thoughts? I have a lot more to say, but wanted to keep this readable.

Tl;dr; A relationship with a married colleague is getting confusing, we often meet for lunch and have long calls not about work, she is different aroundher husband and I am confused at where we are in our friendship(?),",I (26m) am getting increasingly closer to my married work colleague (31f),18n9a3m,1703117193.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n9a3m/i_26m_am_getting_increasingly_closer_to_my/,
"
i (22f) am thinking of breaking up with my bf (23m). this is the healthiest relationship i’ve had so i don’t know if i’m just self sabotaging.

we both come from different backgrounds, and everything down to how we eat and our boundaries are different. we come from different countries, background and cultures. we view respect differently as well as manners. i wash my hands a million times a day whereas he only does when they’re dirty. he barely cooks and eats out most of the time while i’m used to having to make food from scratch. he can spend money if he wants while i tend to save. he’s close to his family whereas i’m not. he’s religious, very devout, and i’m not. 

we’ve been together for a year now, and the more i think about it the more i’m unsure of whether i want to stay with him. i tend to project my own issues onto my relationships so i’m unsure if i’m just doing that and self sabotaging or if i’m right to think twice. he’s a great person, kind and loving, loyal and trustworthy, but it just feels like something is missing.

we don’t really go out on dates, we just spend time at each others places watching shows or movies, and we eat out together a lot but mostly with his family. i’ve expressed to him before that i don’t like doing nothing everytime we hang out, and he promises to do more next time but we rarely do. he does make sure to spend time with me as he’s usually very busy and still finds a way to carve out some time for us. he’s very caring and he shows me that he loves me through physical touch. he’s always holding my hand or has his arm around my shoulder or hand on my leg. we cuddle every chance we get. he always calls me beautiful and tells me he loves me. he pays for all my meals. he drives me around whenever i need to go as i don’t have a car rn.  it just feels like we don’t really do much together.

i’ve been with him for a year and it feels like i don’t really know him. he’s quite emotionally intelligent so i don’t think it’s that. everytime i’ve had an issue with something he’s said or done, we talk it through and he changes if he needs to. he’s willing to put in the effort. i just think that we’re very different people. 

it doesn’t feel like i can get through to him emotionally. things feel very surface level a lot of the time. i don’t know how to describe it but sometimes it feels like he’s not even my boyfriend.

another thing to mention is that it kinda feels like he’s just doing the bare minimum. i know it’s bad to compare but other couples express themselves and their care for each other a lot clearer. it’s like he does just enough to stay with me but nothing more than he ever needs to

it’s important to note that i’m on medication for bipolar disorder and depression so that could be something to take into account, but the bipolar is pretty much handled. i have noticed that i’m less interested in sex, and i don’t know if that’s to do with my feelings toward him or just my medication. i used to not be able to keep my hands off of him but now i find myself not wanting to do anything sexual. 

i think a large part of it is the uncertainty i feel about our future, because i know that my family and culture wouldn’t ever accept him. i do though. that’s what matters to me. am i self sabotaging a good thing here or is the connection just not there? is it the fact that the honeymoon phase is over? i care about him a lot, and i don’t understand why i feel differently now.

another thing i struggle a lot with is ruining things that are going good for me. even typing this out, i struggle to see what the problem is. am i just nitpicking, and is this just one of the stages of loving somebody?

christmas is coming up and i’ve already gotten him his gifts, i’m giving them to him either way. i don’t want to break up with him because i do love him, i just feel indifferent right now. is this part of the honeymoon phase being over or am i falling out of love?",i (22f) am thinking of breaking up with my bf (23m),18n99ur,1703117171.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n99ur/i_22f_am_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my_bf_23m/,
"So I know this guy, let’s call him K, for a little more than a year. We used to go to the same gym but he switched to a more professional one because he trains power lifting. My best friend (24m) and K are really close friends and often go out together, but I’m rarely there. I see K very rarely. He looks nice, I’ve always noticed that before, but he’s acting childish to a lot of things so maybe that’s why I never saw him as anything else than a close friend to my best friend. However, the dynamics in our conversation has always been good, he jokes most of the time and makes me laugh. 
Last Friday the three of us went out together and I talked to K a lot about a little more serious topics. I noticed that we have a lot in common, our personalities are very similar and we react the same way to some stuff. He’s very different than most guys I’ve met, considerate and gentle when he has to be. Problem is I’m not a very girly girl, I mean I do my nails and make my hair, but I don’t wear make up or sexy short dresses and skirts. And from the things we talked about on Friday evening, I got that he likes exactly this kind of girls (I mean he likes them only for their looks, after he gets to know them and sees that their personality is shallow, he drops them, so looks is not the only thing he cares about). I don’t know how I can get his attention, I tried texting him but the conversation died really fast which made me think he’s not interested at all. I’m thinking about telling my best friend so that he invites me more when they go out, but I’m pretty sure he’s gonna feel very awkward and will not be able to act normal if I tell him. Do you have any suggestions on what to do?

"So today my ex (m26) started following me (f25) on IG after years of no contact and now im wondering if i should reach out to him? A little backstory first. 

When I was 21 and he was 22 we broke up after we had been discussing it for a while there where no bad feelings involved and was a mutual decision, we just both wanted different things in our life at the time and we came to the conclusion that it wasn’t our time. Fasting forward to today I got a notification while at the bus my ex wanted to follow me on IG! We haven’t talked since the break up except a few weak moments right at the start, we both decided it was for the best for both our sanity to have no contact. 
Since then I’ve had multiple different relationships, some flings, some more serious but I can’t help the feeling of what if with this guy. 

Well now he had asked to follow me and I did some stalking as one does and it looks like he is single and we are living in the same city for the first time in years. My question is should i reach out to him? He haven’t reached out to me, and maybe he doesnt want to and I dont want to bother him, maybe he just tought that after all these years we can finally follow each other without it bringing up any complicated feelings, which for me clearly isn’t the case cause I’m sitting here writing this.

" Hey reddit, so I need yalls help as i am in a bit of a dilemma. My (26f), bf (25) and I have been arguing a lot lately and now he’s just asked to speak today about us after a couple of days of low very short and honestly, rude contact. We’ve been together unofficially a year and a half, officially a year in like 2 weeks. 

Our relationship has been defined by him having this really highest of high moods where we’re okay and in love and then the lowest of lows where even if I breathe wrong it’s a problem and I’ve stuck by it because I love him and I know how hard it is to struggle with your mental health but I’m also a business owner, a student and an athlete so I’m quite busy (sometimes were not able to see each other during the week) though we do play in the same team so sometimes we overlap, my job is both day and night and lately he’s been giving me attitude about it. He does not work as he is in a very demanding college so I pay for literally everything. I should also mention we both live with our respective parents so. I’m also struggling with some medical issues that do not allow us to have sex without pain for me so we’ve not been doing that lately and that was a huge fight about how I’m not affectionate enough (even though this is like common knowledge everyone knows this about me) but still I tried to improve and fulfil his needs for physical touch right? Wrong, everything I did was not enough. 

And so we’ve been fighting about literally everything, he’s been very cold towards me and I’ve tried my best to ignore it because he’ll turn it around and ask me if I’m okay and why am i asking such things and its just, I’m exhausted y’all. A relationship is supposed to be give and take and I feel like I give and give and give and don’t receive in return. So reddit, should we breakup today? I’m pretty sure that’s what he wants to talk about but do I give him another chance? (This would be like his 3rd one) or do I just give up on this? My parents love him, i love him but idk if enough for this situation to be my reality for the rest of my life, I always feel judged and like I have to watch what I say and do.

"Hi! :) Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, or just seems really ridiculous. I have horrible anxiety and I’m terrified of confrontation but I don’t want people to just be able to walk all over me either. I’ll try to put a TL;DR at the end

My ex and I split up a few months ago, and our lease (with both our names) on our apartment is about to be over in February. I’m doing everything I can do get away as fast as possible.

Temporarily, my name was added to his bank account because I started a new job and the account I was trying to create for myself was going to take a couple of days, so I just used his. Well we split up shortly after this, and when I asked him for my paycheck, he ignored me and told me he needed money for bills. He didn’t need this and he knew I need every cent to save up for a car because he randomly broke up with me and we shared his car, but was just being a jerk suddenly even though we were getting along fine before this.

Since it sounded like he wasn’t giving it to me, I went to the bank myself and took out MY money from the account. I also saw the bank statement of him spending money on random stuff he did not need whatsoever like Steam games, fast food and random junk. He was furious about this, said we needed to remove my name immediately and told me he did plan on giving the money to me, and that I almost made him overdraw the account because I took my money out.

Now he is INSISTING that he be there for me to take my name off of his account. I genuinely don’t see why he needs to be there other than this being an excuse for him to get attention somehow? I did not take ANY of his money, just the checks I earned from my job. I seriously don’t know what he thinks he’s accomplishing being there, if he’s worried that I’m doing anything else. He could see if I took my name off or not. I’m worried if I do this without doing it under HIS stupid conditions, he’s gonna freak out and trash the apartment or find some other way to make my life miserable. And this HAS to be done during his odd schedule that I cannot easily make time for since I’m working, packing, moving, doing job interviews and other things. Should I just go and take my name off without him being there anyway and completely ignore him, or fulfill this one, ridiculous request even though I do NOT want to see him whatsoever?

Sorta TL;DR: My name is on my ex’s bank account, he’s furious I took only my paychecks I earned out of it and wants my name off of the account, but he’s insisting that HE HAS to be there for it and I can’t easily work around his schedule.

"I really need some comfort words. 

To keep it short, me and this guy have been dating for 3 months. Things have been weird over the last few weeks, he stopped telling me sweet things and started acting colder while texting. I knew he suffered from depression and he told me that he's struggling with some emotions but that he doesn't want to break up cause everything is perfect with me, that he cares and thinks this is on him not being used to seriously committing and stuff like that (yes this is red flag, but me, a stupid, i was trying to understand him and give him some space etc). That he wants to work things out and so go on.

I asked him more times if we were being exclusive (it was my requirement cause I wouldn't feel safe otherwise) and he always agreed. When I asked last time (2 days ago), he even gave me a whole speech like ""why, do you want to meet someone new? no, I don't even think about meeting new girls, it's the last thing on my mind, i'm struggling with some personal stuff and that's not part of it"".

Short story short, a friend of mines he doesn't know matched with him on Tinder the morning right after we had that conversation about the exclusivity. I felt awful cause fuck. We slept together the night before, and the morning after he was on the app.

I made a fake account to check and yes, he's actively using Tinder. Now since this is very new to me, I have a hard time realizing why or HOW he could be so sweet with me (cooked me dinner, made me surprises etc) if he was acting like this secretly. I don't get how he could lie to me in my face about the exclusivity as he did, even asking me if it was me wanting to meet someone else. 

Can you help me processing the whole situation? He's a problematic person and always mentioned depression etc but I think he's just being a liar. I find myself asking if i'm overreacting because of all the nice things he did for me, but I don't see justifications for this???

"We have been together 5 years, both have young children from a previous marriage. We don’t live together but have concrete plans of buying a home in a town we both want to end up retiring in. Currently we live about 50 miles apart but see each other frequently. Our kids and families have all been meshed together and everyone is happy.

Although we’ve spoken about the future, marriage has not come up as in the beginning of our relationship, we both sort of mentioned in passing that it was not really important since we were both married before and it didn’t work out. Since 5 years have passed though, we know we are spending our lives together and have established a plan of where we are going to live, including all of the details once our kids are older.

I am still not set of marriage and feel indifferent, however I’m not completely opposed either.

I’m not wanting anything extravagant and not one of those girls who will ask him to take me shopping and I would choose exactly what I want. 

His friend just got engaged and he told me about it and he mentioned she had a large diamond. He asked me how much I think it cost and I looked up something similar and that sort of brought up a conversation. I told him a few of the rings online were beautiful and I would be ecstatic if I had something even half that size. Then he asked me what type of style I like (round, square, etc.). After I told him I love the round cuts, he asked “what size diamond do you think you’d like?” Then I continued to look and show him a few and he said “I’ll keep that in mind.”

Is that something that guys will just usually say, just to go with the flow of the conversation, or does this mean he may be thinking about in the distant future?

"Girlfriend deleted message and text history among many other things

My girlfriend of four years deleted histories (most recently.)
She insisted we move to another state against my will and has gone off her medication on multiple occasions despite me begging her and setting the boundary that she must tell me if she decides to do this even though I wish she wouldn't.
I also allowed her *key word allowed, to be somewhat intimate with a mutual friend of ours in the context that it was our decision not hers alone because I already knew they were flirting which she denied at first then admitted (which didn't make me feel so great.)

I cut that off once she went off her medication again.

That was also used against me..

Then recently I found out she's been telling her friends and family obviously only the bad stuff enough so that they ""have problems with me"", naturally these are friends from work, and, family that the only time I met them he was high on meth returning stolen items to a Walmart. I was looking forward to knowing this person and these people and was always on their side rooting for them. The friends I never exactly approved of because I believe separating work from personal life is healthy vs not doing so. I still was nice, and kind, and respectful to them.

So apparently for months, while working on all of this, suffering the mood swings and personality changes of my girlfriend, she has been shit talking me behind my back. I told her she could have at any point considering I believed us all to be on the same page (yet I was the only one in the dark) that all her friends should have done and should have wanted to do is talk to me directly because that is the healthy responsible thing to do.

Now she is mad at me for saying I don't feel comfortable with her spending time with these people and just that she promised to ""not talk shit"" not only do I not know what she may or may not be saying or doing, but I will never truly trust these people again considering what they were comfortable with.

I feel like I have ruined my life trusting her so many times over and over. Yes, there will be undesirable reactions to her behavior and actions, but she never tells anyone the part that was what incites the issue. And honestly if people don't care or don't take it with a grain of salt and skepticism -- if someone I don't know has a problem with me, I have a problem with them. 

There was an entire six month period where I told her, hey, you broke boundaries in our relationship with the content and flirting with people online ""for selling content."" I am not comfortable with it anymore sorry but I can't do it. You crossed lines. She continued to cross the lines then got mad at me when I called her on it. AFAIK she could still be doing so. No way to tell since she deletes things. 

I've spoken to her about all of it each thing as it happens. Never is there a compromise or solution. I wasn't even allowed to decide if we move to another state or not.

We just signed a 1 year lease. I don't know what to do. Half of me, the angry half, wants to take advantage of the lease situation since every single little thing is thrown in my face, and have people over who she doesn't know.. strangers, the same way I feel. I don't really want to do that. I want to be connected to the person I love. But apparently my whole life is a joke or a lie. 
The other part of me either wants to run away. But this was supposed to be my future. Or to give her a literal hundredth chance. I'm worried I'll wind up ""doing something to myself.""
 I never know ""who"" I'm going to get when it comes to her. 

Tell me what I should do. I've been alienated from everyone I know except for a few friends in my home state, I was looking forward tos spending time with her family and being part of the family and I've now discovered it is all lies and deleted conversations. Not to mention in all of this our cat who is like my child is dying of recently diagnosed cancer.

1. She always re-gifted gifts. Nothing super wrong with that, especially if the gift is something you never really liked. Better for the gift to go somewhere that’s appreciated and not as trash. But it kinda hurts that almost every gift she got for me was a repurposed gift? The stuffed animals that I got for her are nowhere to be found… I’m assuming she gave them away as birthday gifts to other friends.  
2. Gift-gate part 2. She always made sure that the gifts she gave were of lesser value than the gifts she received. For instance, she got me a skincare set worth $50 when I gave her a hair mask worth $75. Not really a big deal but when you see that she also regifts gifts…  
3. Doesn’t respond to texts unless I’m helping her. The minute I make a plan for us or offer to drive, she responds. The minute I ask for a ride, she takes days to respond. Really infuriating when one time she canceled on our plans to carpool when she found her other friend who could drive her to and from. Then she knew I was upset about it and fake offered sympathy, pretending to be oblivious of what happened.  
4. Literally has canceled on our plans at least for 3 different occasions. Cancels like 15-30 minutes beforehand. Somehow the plans she has with other friends follow through…  
It’s sad to see as she’s been one of my longest known friends. I just miss the old her. I’ve literally done so much for her and it doesn’t seem like it’s been reciprocated. I don’t know what to do.

"My partner (M30) and I (F28) have been together for 3 years and we have what seems like the perfect relationship. For the most part, that's true. We share a dazzling friendship. We make each other laugh every single day, we help each other feel safe to explore new versions of ourselves, and we baseline just really enjoy and appreciate each other as human beings. I know he is the person I want to be with for life, but I'm a bit nervous about marriage as I'm surrounded by stories of dying passion. I know couples that were once fiercely in love with all their emotional needs met until time and resentment eroded their romances. I'm going to therapy to break this personal fear further, but I'd love different folk's thoughts (especially those that are older or have been in relationships longer than 3 years) on how to maintain connection, attraction, and chemistry, esp after resentment has started to build.  
I've personally found it difficult to heal from these resentments if it roots from big character traits you know your partner likely can't change. My partner has a difficult time voicing his opinions and making others feel uncomfortable. Due to this, in different instances, he has failed to stand up for me or step in when I'm caught in awkward family (his) dynamics. There was also an instance when his ex messaged me horrible things and in his words, ""out of respect for me"", he asked me how we should proceed. I wanted him to take initiative on issues regarding his own ex, so this made me feel really disappointed. I wasn't sure why he was asking me to strategize our plan when this was his ex. I know he was just trying to do what I wanted, but sometimes, I wish he would be less diplomatic or passive and simply take initiative. While it's a part of him I'm trying to embrace, I do notice myself feeling resentful at times. How do you fall back in love once resentment starts to settle in? We are considering couple's therapy as we've had multiple conversations about this, some more helpful than others. I'd love to hear more tips on how to repair after feeling resentful in a fight or magnifying romance to stay afloat when things get hard.

"Issue with lacking sex

For context: So me and my boyfriend are currently in a monogamous LDR since July 2023, so we don’t have much opportunities for sex in general. 

We have been very open with eachother about previous partners, hookups, sex stories and initially hearing about his experiences, it made me believe we were sexually compatible.

I’m having a hard time dealing with the lack of sexual want and desire, because I’m finding that I’m comparing the lack of our sex life to how he’s been with other guys. This makes me very insecure because I’ve seen how he has texted them, sending them nudes, stating his desire to get fucked and suck off these other men, the frequency of encounters he’s had with these other flings, and the amount of preparation he does for them. Ever since the start of us dating, he’s never shown this kind of sexual interest towards me. It makes me feel lacking and not desired because when I find the time to visit, we won’t even have sex often. If we have sex, it’s because I’m always the one initiating/asking/trying to engage, but he’ll always come up with excuses. 

Because I respect him, I find the excuses he gives valid, but it doesn’t make me feel great in knowing that the excuses weren’t barriers that prevented him from having sex with past guys he’s been interested in. And why is it that he can go months on end without me, but he’d seek others daily on multiple occasions?

Everytime I mention this, he always gets mad at me and turns the situation into how I can’t just “expect” sex with him. He’ll then turn it into a fight because he feels discredited by the way in which he shows me how I’m special to him and how he loves me. This makes me frustrated because I’m not saying I don’t feel his love, but he lacks the sexual desire for me. The conversation always ends up with me having to apologize. 

It just really hurts me and makes me feel like my boyfriend doesn’t desire and crave me in that sexual way. And it bothers me that despite being the boyfriend that he loves, I don’t get that “special” treatment pass that other flings had with him. Recently I found out that these these “one off” hookups were people who he’s tried pursuing in more than just sexually which stings even more. The way I see it is that because I’m more than just a hookup, I should get to see more sides of him because I’m his boyfriend??? But because I’m not, it makes me feel like he’s just not that into me in that sexual type of way.

Ive also asked if this might be because I’m not that good, if I need to be more verbal or assert dominance, and have asked him for feedback on our sex. His response is always that out sex is perfect and that there’s no feedback.

Idk I’m just confused and feel like I’ve exhausted all I can to try and address this. I need advise and answers. Is he just not that sexually into me? Is there something that I’m not understanding? How do I get him to understand how much this bothers me? Is there a way for me to repair my broken confidence? How do I make him see how much this bothers me? How do I stop myself from getting bothered about this comparison? Was it wrong for me to bring up the comparison with others? Is there something fishy going on that I’m not aware of? 

I don’t want this to be an issue because I love him and don’t want to end things, but at this point my confidence is shattered and my feelings and needs are being ignored and I don’t know how long I can’t handle feeling sexually unwanted.",Comparing the lack of sex drive he (26M) has for me (25M),18n8jw2,1703115186.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n8jw2/comparing_the_lack_of_sex_drive_he_26m_has_for_me/,
"My (f24) bf (m34) have been dating 1 month. He told me from the beginning he’s still friends with a few of his exes. Recently he told his most recent ex about me, and she started sending him tons of photos of herself posing in different spots at a place she went to. Also she asked him to visit her (she lives abroad)

My bf sent screenshots of the photos she sent, telling me ‘she started sending me pics after I told her about you haha’ to which I replied why? And he said he thinks she’s just a little jealous but nothing to be worried about. I told him I don’t think they’re real friends, to which he swore yes they were. And I said I don’t think their friendship is genuine because if she were a real friend she would be happy for him, instead she’s jealous and he knows she’s jealous but remains friends anyways. He apologized to me and told me he’ll stop taking her calls, he said he thought they were genuinely just friends because she would ask him for advice for things and talk about food.

"So this is my first time posting here so kind of nervous any advice would help:) 

I just turned 28F, and my bf(39) and I have known each other for 4 years. In the beginning we were only casually seeing each other because both of us just got divorced so we weren’t in a rush into anything serious. But after a few months he told me he loves me and wants to be with me for the rest of his life. I also developed the same type of love and our relationship has been very strong ever since. 

Though out this time he asked me if I would want to marry him one day and I always said yes. I felt very safe and he did too. We even got matching tattoos and rings and our relationship is only getting stronger from what we both feel.

Recently he opened up to me about his company situation. They r being sued for the wrong reasons due to disagreements over franchise terms. So in short, his company is spending a lot of money on lawyers and other things so he’s in a very bad financial situation. He’s currently looking for another job in case the company completely goes bankrupt. I’m very understanding towards his financial situation and I’m not in anyway relying on him financially although a lot of ppl think I am due to our age differences. 
However I do realize that with this situation he stopped mentioning marriage and kids and our future for quit awhile. So I got paranoid and over the past month I’ve been having multiple serious conversations with him about this. He says he has no mood to discuss this right now as he’s almost a 40 year old man so he needs to get his financial situation sorted out first because finances r a big factor towards a marriage and his previous marriage failed largely because they were constantly arguing about money. I broke down and called him a liar for asking me to marry me before. He got very sad telling me he wasn’t lying and he’s not saying he will not marry me he just wants some more time due to the situation. He also told me it means he’s responsible that he wants to have a solid financial background before marrying me. 

I realized I was being too emotional so I apologized and he told me let’s discuss this after about a year and he reassured me that he’s not going anywhere and his actions also prove that. He has been spending more time with me and understanding my insecurities and generally just very kind and helpful so I know I’m overreacting and I keep giving him pressure. 

I’m worried now because I guess I’m at the age where I really want to get married and the future uncertainty of this happening rly scares me. I also truly feel that my bf loves me and is definitely not trying to leave me. I also know I should give him time and support him through this instead of acting like a child and giving him more pressure. I just can’t help feeling sad and insecure at times especially when I see so many people around me getting married lately.

I am a little Insecure Dependent ( now) and she is a Dismissive Avoidant.
Two weeks ago we had an emotional moment (no not physically or sexual) her fear base I think.
I failed to see the request for space and internalized the problem…and made it worse.
No contact for several days now. I plan on reaching out to out Christmas Eve. Will drop off her gift, with a note. 
Will you please read my note and give your opinion if you have studied personalities?
Thank you. As I am devastated.

E, my heart is empty this year. It’s hard for me because I am here and you are there. There is no we, I am sure you feel the same in many ways.
With that being said, some of this past year I would never change, I had you this year. Time with you, you know it was always the most important thing to me. I wish I would have been emotionally mature enough to realize it was the quality time that was the  most important thing. 
You have become my best friend, my person in this world and how could I go through Christmas without telling you how special to me you are? 
You are kind, so smart, so fucking cute. You always look out for the ones who need it, a natural leader.
I have learned how to have a conversation for the good from you. When you are done any conversation I am  amazed.
You have made me a better leader in so many ways.  If I could ever speak in the way that you do in public, I could do so much more good for others. You know my hearts desire for that. It is very clear that you care.(that is the true E factor)  the eveErything, I love that. But most importantly you have made me a happy man, thank you.
This Christmas I ask nothing from you but to accept this gift from the man you have made so happy every day.
I cannot believe 18 S, it is the most amazing place. It is the first place that I have invested in that I truly love. I know you love it as well. 
I have never told you this until now, it’s Christmas so I will share. Every time I go out on that deck, I look north and think about you working in the bank and how I would find excuses to come see you, I feel so blessed that we have had those moments as adults,I will always love that. It makes my heart warm every time.
Life is hard, it has been for both of us. I want, no…I choose to hold on to those moments that have made me happy.

"We were best friends in middle school, then with the pandemic we slowly went from talking everyday to just a few times a month. Right now we are in the same class so we see each other often in school and talk about school stuff.

Then on monday her father died unexpectably and I didn't see her since. I only wrote her a text message the day after I found out, and she replied ""thanks❤️"" (she's been replying pretty much the same to everyone that wrote something to her).
I used to go to her place often and her father really was a nice person, he always joked around and made us laugh. She has had a fantastic relationship with both her parents, they really know everything about her.

I'm very sad that this happened and want to help her, but this is such a difficult situation and I don't know what to do. I asked her other friends if they know how she is doing but they also didn't talk to her after the day it happened. We all feel like she needs space and that she needs to be with her mother and grandparents during these days, but I don't want her to feel abandoned by her friends. I don't know what is being too annoying and what is being too distant. But I feel like i should do something. I'd like to talk to her, maybe on the phone or even in person. But is it too soon? I live close to her so i could go to her place and bring something to comfort her, but would that be too much? The funeral is on saturday, should I wait until then and only write her other text messages now?

"For context: my ex girlfriend \[F25\] and I \[M26\] dated for a year and a half and then broke up in October of '22. Things weren't always perfect and we had a lot of ups and downs but our connection was very strong and always has been. We shared a lot of experiences together and planned a strong future for both of us...unfortunately she would future fake me and love bomb me after arguments instead of talking through things so I got stuck in an endless loop of highs and lows.  
  
I tried for a month or two to make things work but she wouldn't budge on the breakup. She continued to stay in my life and would reach out to hang out or talk on the phone like we would normally do and then disappear out of my life for a few days, etc. She's a flight attendant so she'd be gone for several days at a time and then would reach out when she got back in town. Around April I decided I needed to cut the cord loose and block her from everything.  
  
She managed to get ahold of me in late May practically begging for me to come back because she missed me so much. She had apparently sent numerous messages and made numerous attempts to get ahold of me. We spent a few days together and she ghosted me. This became a trend for the next several months. Block, she'd reach out, pull me back in, profess her love for me and desire to get back together, spend time together, ghost and if I reached out during this time period, she wouldn't read my text or respond until she repeated the cycle a week or two or three weeks later.  
  
In October, after not seeing me for a few weeks, she once again came running back into my life begging for me to take her back. She promised to change and not ghost or leave me again, that she had been going through a lot and had changed and that I was the love of her life and the best man she had ever met. She told me that she would reassure me that she wasn't going to leave again any time I had concerns or worries and that she was in this for the long haul with me. Talks of eventual marriage and kids sparked up again and I was hooked. We were spending time with her friends again, our families knew we were back together and things seemed to be getting better...we even went a quick trip together (an overnight that she was on and invited me on). The following day after the overnight, she had a flight to her college town on the final leg of her 4-day trip where she was going to spend the day with some of her college friends. We facetimed that morning and she told me she'd talk to me later... I never heard from her again that day. The next morning, she reached out and told me not to worry about picking her up and that she was going to uber to her parents to sleep (her parents lived very close to the airport). I sarcastically thanked her for letting me know she got back to the hotel safe the previous day; she never looked at my text. The next day, I called her twice and texted her, no response. All the signs of the classic ghosting. The following day, she texts me that she doesn't think she can do this anymore and that we can figure out a time to give each others stuff back. The following weekend I sent a text asking for an explanation of what happened. How we had Thanksgiving plans, Christmas plans, a New Years Trip planned out, how we had talked of moving to Europe together, marriage, kids etc and what could've possibly happened in the 4-5 days that we didn't talked that changed everything. No response. We were together again for a month before this all happened.  
  
Exactly four weeks had passed by when she texted me last Wednesday simply saying ""I'm so sorry"" followed by ""nothing ever happened"". I didn't respond. Friday night, she texted me that she was in Chicago (a place very special to me, not so much to her) and that she missed me. I caved in, drunk, and responded. I asked her for an explanation on ghosting me for 4 weeks and she told me she ghosted because she thought that I thought she cheated on me... despite zero accusations. Her stories kept changing and made zero sense, she even claimed that she had stayed in her hotel room all day and ate pizza while in her college town. We continued to talk through the night and she messaged me the following day like everything was fine between us. She made up a plan to come see me when she landed Sunday morning because she wanted to nap at my place before having to leave in the afternoon for a work trip. She came through despite me thinking it was a terrible idea, we had lots of sex and slept most of the morning, bringing back some old feelings. She left several of her clothes at my place (and had shared her location with me on her way to my place from the airport that morning) and continued to talk to me throughout the day. That night, the cold, distant ex that I knew reared her head and I felt like we were falling right back into place.  
  
She was supposed to come over the next day after getting home from her trip but when I asked if she was still coming she told me she wasn't and that she was going home. I never responded and then stopped sharing my location.  
  
I knew that I should've kept up NC after not responding last week but she caught me in a drunken state and used a place that was very dear to me as an entrance back into my life. I was finally in a better place, reconnecting with old friends, meeting new women and having the time of my life. The previous pain and hurt was fading and I had accepted that something happened while she was in her college town and she likely did cheat on me. Thinking that gave me the ability to move forward and then she came back once again. Each time I've let her come back into my life she has sweet talked me up like no other, talks of marriage and kids, talks of living together and endless apologies for her behavior only to go and do it all over again... I feel like I'm stuck and back to square one... I miss her and I know I shouldn't but I'm stuck in a cycle and she's so good at sucking me back in.  How do I break the cycle?

"ok so, i’ve been with my boyfriend (24m) for 9 months now. things are great etc. he was cheated on by his previous girlfriend and he sometimes feels a little bit insecure but is not possessive or controlling, which i appreciate from him as it is likely hard to do. 

i’m worried i’ve let a situation snowball without realising? i have a friend who i met as a teenager, through online gaming groups. we had a large group of people who used to hop online every day after school and just chat shit really, it was always good fun. over the years, the group has dwindled down but i still speak to one friend on the daily. nothing has ever happened, just friends. we just chat and keep up to date with each other and occasionally have phone calls (maybe once a month or so) to catch up on each others lives. 

only thing is, i realised the other day that i’ve never mentioned my friend even exists to my boyfriend? it’s just never really came up, it’s not like we meet up in person as he’s from a different country. it’s just a weird pen pal situation i guess? i’m worried now that if my boyfriend, for example, saw a notification come up on my phone, what if this made him worry and feel insecure? i’d hate for a molehill to turn into a mountain and cause issues in my relationship.  it would look bad that i text another dude most days and he never knew about it surely?

I(M 25) never thought to be in a relationship with anyone I meet online. But somehow I matched with a girl on Hinge and ended up in a relationship now. We started as casual and then the way she cares even for the smallest of small things in my life and how much she loves me made me fall in love with her. I am a guy who has never been in a serious relationship and I guess that might be because of my low self esteem even if I achieve a lot more than others. I always tend to run away from catching feelings. She is the closest ever to a relationship I ever had. But I can't digest the fact that I met her online in a dating app. And I don't want my children to hear that I met their mum on hinge. This fact has been really messing with my mind that I am losing attraction for her coz of this. I feel like a coward who is afraid of asking out someone in real. I matched with her out of pure LUST.  She must have prob done the same. Also I have slept with someone else in between when we were not in a relationship.I feel like I should stop being in a relationship with her and stop using dating apps. Dating apps have made me care less about putting in the effort to talk to anyone. I genuinely feel she deserves to be with someone who wants a serious relationship with her. Although I'll miss her and maybe even end up lonely but I think hard times will make me brave and ask someone out in real. Does anyone else have the same concept when it comes to relationships?

Whenever we are out with friends, he doesn’t take the opportunity to pull me on the side or sit next to me during a movie.
He has told all our friends and even his friends that he likes me.
We talk till 3am every night.
Last week, he told me he likes me but needs time to get to know me bette.
He also hooked up with someone a few days later but came to me the same day —- the only time we were actually alone and told me everything very honestly- that he did it because he was horny. Then I stopped talking to him for a day and he had soo much regret.
He was continuing calling and messaging.
So I spoke to him and said it’s fine because we are not in a relationship and he doesn’t owe me anything.
But I am so confused if he likes me or not.
Because why does he talk to me everyday and tell his friends that he likes me.
He gave me a reason, that in his last relationship he rushed into it and was not happy. He said this time he wants it to be a full on commitment.
He isn’t talking to any girls at all and even got off all dating sites. 
But he keeps saying he wants to take things slow.
Also, I haven’t given him any hint - he is under the impression that I don’t want to date anyone.
So does he like me or not?",M22 is talking to me (F22) but I am unsure if he likes me or what?

"My bf (24m) and I (21f) have been together for almost a year and a half now. I met him working at my summer job and I was friends with him for a few months. We confessed our feelings for each other the night before I drove back to college. This meant that we were long distance for the first 9 months of our relationship. We only got to see each other during holiday breaks, and even then it would only be for two or three days.
At the beginning of our relationship, I was much heavier. I weighed about 160, and had been struggling with an eating disorder for over a year prior. When I went back to college, I started losing weight quickly. My boyfriend told me all the time how he loved me with the weight and how he wasn’t very attracted to skinny girls. I knew that he didn’t like that I was losing weight, and because we were long distance, Im sure it was much more shocking to him each time I showed up during breaks looking thinner and thinner. I now weigh about 125. I know I’m too thin. It’s just hard to get myself to eat these days. Both because my body isn’t used to it anymore, and because my anxiety makes me lose my appetite often. My boyfriend tries to be reassuring, but I always knew that he was becoming less and less interested in me sexually. 
He finally confirmed it the other night during a difficult conversation. He apologized and explained that he still loves me and loves having sex with me, but that I don’t turn him on anymore. He said he’ll see the outline of my ribs or spine and will get grossed out. It was heartbreaking to hear. I haven’t stopped thinking about it since. I don’t feel like a woman anymore. I feel like an ugly girl that doesn’t deserve to be touched. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror right now. 
Part of me wants to eat everything in sight so I can gain back the weight and he’ll be attracted to me again. The other part of me is so hurt that I want to starve myself until I disappear completely. 
What do I do? Do I just accept it and move on? Do I tell him that it’s hurt me horribly? Do I try to gain the weight back to make him happy?",My bf (24m) no longer finds me (21f) sexually attractive and I don’t know what to do,18n7xlw,1703113493.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n7xlw/my_bf_24m_no_longer_finds_me_21f_sexually/,
"Hi!!! I am new to this subreddit (raisedbynarc and relationship advice), but when going through some of the posts, I'm starting to realize that my mother might be a covert narcissist. So first of all, my mother is a single mother even though my father still lives with us, however their relationship is strained as my father has cheated several times. I call my mother a single mother because she was the one who provided most of the expenses for me (school,clothes, gifts, etc).

  
In my opinion, my mother has always been loving and supportive, but there are some things that make me wonder if she is a narc. When I was a kid, when my older girl cousins got into relationships, there was always a moment when she intervened and kind of broke the relationship by interrogating the guy my girl cousins were dating stating things like ""Why are you with (name of said cousin)"" ""What are your true intentions?"" ""I would leave if I were you"". There were several times when other girl cousins, I am one of the youngest of my cousins, would be in a relationship with a guy and they were demonized calling them ""sluts"", ""bit\*\*\*"" etc.

  
During these times, I was confused as to why they were demonized so much, they were simply in relationships with guys. Eventually, because of what she did to them, my mother's relationship with them broke and until now, my girl cousins do not have a relationship with my mom. Before, I was a little kid and believed that they were ungrateful and were rude to break off communication with my mother. However, I am (22 F) and starting to understand why they did that.

  
I am currently in school completing my bachelor's and currently on campus. Recently, a guy (24 M), an Indian, who is a different ethnicity than me, asked me out. He took me out on a date, we started to study together in the library, and honestly, I am starting to like him. I told my mother about the guy and immediately she started to ask ""Why does he like you?"" ""There are so many girls on campus, why should he like you?"" ""Do you think he is serious?"" ""If I were you, I would not let him touch you and not continue with the relationship."" ""Always ask yourself, why you?"" Afterwards she mentioned, ""Who else on campus thinks you are pretty?"" ""Did anyone else mention that you are pretty?"" I answered her and said, yes. People do mention that I am pretty/beautiful on campus, but I tend not to believe it.

  
Due to these questions, all I could do is question myself and him. The fact that the relationship is interracial makes it harder to believe him and if he really likes me. I started to question him to the point that he mentioned that he thinks my mom is gaslighting me in a ""deep level"" and making me "" confused and doubt him"". He said, "" I am so caring and supportive, and it hurts me to think that you don't believe me"". He also said, he thinks I am letting my mom ""control me"" and I am too much of a ""people pleaser"". After he said this, I could not prevent myself from remembering what happened to my female cousins years ago and realizing that this may be a repetitive cycle.

  
I also have very low self-esteem and I think my mom could be the cause.

  
I say all of this to ask: Is my mother a narcissist? Should I take her advice, and break off the relationship?

"earlier this year i (F31) rolled up to an old friend of mine “Kia” (M32) who had lost his license 6mos prior and his car was dead in the driveway. hadn’t had a job in all that time due to the no license situation and his gf (F24) was the sole income.

i fixed the car and got the license back for him. it was a big process that took several months, lots of time and energy, and a pretty penny of my own money. he did not contribute a cent to any of it, because he was flat broke and gf was financially abusing him. i single-handedly put his life back on the rails because it was clear to me that if someone didn’t do something he wasn’t going to end well. i basically made his problem my problem and i got it done.

in the course of doing this two things came out: 1) we had deep feelings for each other for years and 2) he’s a DV victim. i witnessed GF repeatedly abuse him, she’d push his buttons and induce meltdowns which i would have to deal with. she was upset that she was no longer the center of the world. she sabotaged the car, which i fixed again. she refused to send him money for car insurance/registration/license reinstatement. things came to a head when she set off a psychotic break to the point where he almost put his hand into a running car fan. i pulled him out of his engine bay and when i looked in his face he was gone, on another planet. i talked him back to reality and when i asked him wtf was that he replied “it’s just me, it’s one of those days”. i told him bro i watched her set you off. “no no it’s just me”

that’s when it really hit me what was going on. when i told him he didn’t take it well, went into victim denial, and cut me off entirely without so much as a thank you. last time i saw Kia was early october and he treated me like dirt, literally telling me “you coming up and working on the car and the license cut in with my time with my gf which caused all the fights with her and i was gonna get back that license eventually, i had more important life shit to do like be the househusband and make sure things were ready for gf when she came home exhausted from being the sole income, and you coming and working on the car and license just fucked all that up” (i’m quoting him)

he wakes up every day, uses things i gave him on a daily basis, drives the car i fixed with the license i got back with the two year registration i paid for. oh, and what’s his job? delivery driver …. which you need a car and a license for. just saying. 

i later talked to his mother (F70s, who they live with) and come to find out (among a lot of other things) gf was hiding the abuse from her but mom suspected something was up because Kia would become an asshole (her words) whenever gf was around.

recently the situation came up with a mutual acquaintance who asked me if i had tried to contact Kia since then. he convinced me to send a short text which of course went unanswered (if that’s even his number). 

obviously there’s an entire novel’s worth of crap in this story but i’m trying to keep it short. i’m hurt and pissed at how Kia treated me after how i helped him out, and i’ve gotten validation from literally EVERYONE but him.

i guess my questions are: how do i get over this? is there any point trying to connect with this guy anymore? is connecting with him even a good idea considering how pissed and hurt i am? i’ve tried to move on, forget, keep busy with other stuff, etc etc but this has been a kick in the gut.

"This year in january, my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me.

Her reasons were that she didn‘t know if we only were together because we were used to each other or out of love. The other one (in my opinion a reason which sounded kinda like an excuse) was that I have problems with speaking our „mother“ language and she said that she doesn‘t want to have kids that don‘t speak their „origin“ language.

Context: We both were born &amp; raised in the country we live in, but our parents are from somewhere else. She doesn‘t have problems speaking their language, because she also spoke it in her childhood growing up, but I didn‘t as much and therefore struggle a bit with it. It kinda became an anxiety thing for me. This was a Problem she often mentioned and used as a threat to end the relationship because of this. I told her that I was working on it but only made minimal improvements over the years. This was always a thing that hurt me very much, because for me, I wouldn‘t care which languages my partner speaks if we can communicate properly and the love, trust etc. is there. It was especially hard for me when I would have to talk to their family members in their language and I struggled and saw how she was ashamed of me and even told me afterwards how embarassing I was.

She also said that we didn't make any progress in these 5 years. Meaning we didn't marry or move in together like other couples. This argument really made me angry because:

1. 4 of these 5 years I was studying, so I had no income to be able to afford moving out
2. Always when some of her friends got married early (1-2 years after knowing each other) she told me how ""dumb"" they were and how she wouldn't want to marry this early.
3. She completely devalues the bond that we developed between us in these 5 years by saying ""we made no progress""

Sooo basically, she broke up with me via messenger first, met me one day later for 10 minutes to give me back some of my stuff without properly discussing anything. One week later, when I finally got to talk to her properly, she told me that she had contact with a guy 2 days after breaking up and even having sex with him a several times. That shit made my world collapse. Our relationship was something special to me since it was the first relationship and first time getting intimate with someone for us both. She told me that she knew the guy from years ago and he hit her up on Insta coincidentally one day after breaking up. She then agreed to meet him at his apartment. And one of the things that makes my stomach turn is that he was almost 15 years older than her (24F !) ... I mean he could've been her dad.

Then, in March she wanted to come back to me and said that she regrets everything and that she realized that she didn't appreciate me enough etc. . I told her that I need time for myself to think about everything but over the course of the year, we somehow ended up hooking up often and spending much time together. This lead to us both basically torturing each other emotionally, because besides me not being sure if I want the relationship again, she was also unsure.

Now, 2 Months ago I finally told her that I need time for myself and don't want any contact with her until I made my mind up. She agreed and said that she wants to give me time, but doesn't want to spend half a year waiting for me, because her ""biological"" time is running up. I totally get this point but I feel like she's pressuring herself way too much here. She also said that she would accept my ""language problem"" but I don't fully believe that to be honest.

Fast forward to today - I don't really feel like I want to be with her again. I feel like I need to close this chapter in order to be able to grow myself. I want to be with someone that supports me, loves me the way I am. I know that no relationship is perfect and that there will always be some things that bother you, but I think that you should also be able to accept someones flaws. I'm also grossed out by her behavior which is another point against a continuing the relationship.

That said, I somehow still have the feeling that I'm still attached to her. Every time I see her on social media or randomly in real life, I have the feeling of wanting to spend time with her. I still remember the great things about her personality and the ""problem"" is that we still get along really well. I'm also scared that I won't every meet someone that I get along as good as with her.

"To summarize things me and my ex where together for 2 years and 3 months before we separated. We had a rocky relationship but we both loved each other and did our best to make it work because we both saw futures together. About halfway through our relationship I had a relapse on a porn addiction and my ex was very upset about it and we broke up for a day but decided we wanted to try to make it work still on the premise I would kick the addiction for good this time and we would work on it together. What followed was a very rocky year and a half where I ""relapsed"" another 2 times and she found out with the third one leading to us breaking up seemingly for good.(Relapse in quotes as one time I watched NSFW videos and did nothing to them and the other time I played a game that contained a character I found attractive that I had porn of in the past)

This breakup was in September of this year and was very difficult for us both. I tried very hard to work for us to get back together, starting therapy again,  maintaining my clean streak, and just generally improving myself. During this time my ex basically started things with a new guy J, who was the one person I had told her I wasn't comfortable with while we dated. Once she told me about the two of them I tried washing my hands of a shitty situation and tried to distance myself and move on. Around the time that would have been our 2 and a half year mark my ex made contact again and against my better reasoning I let myself get involved with her again. Now over a month later I have seen her several times from visiting st work, going to dinner, and having sex with her again. But during all of this we had some genuine nice and healthy talks where we both were open and communicating about our relationship, we both said that we still loved each other but felt like right now wasn't the rigjt time to try again. I thought maybe in a few more months once we both finished school and she was looking more at a time frame dealing in years. I do genuinely love her and we are both each other's first real relationships and while we had a lot of problems I feel that about 95% of them where caused due to the porn and mistrust it spread. 

Currently she is in Florida, visiting this guy just a week after we had sex and I'm devasted. I didn't expect us to be back together but it hurts seeing someone I loved with all my hear being with the one person I wasn't okay with during the holidays. I've been told by my dad, some friends, and my therapist the best thing to do is to distance myself again and move on and don't look back, but it's hard to do that when my heart wants her so badly. I understand why things started with her and him as he was kind in a moment where I wasn't and he took advantage of that but I just don't know what to do. I wonder if I should tell the guy what we did because he doesn't know we've been together again recently but I just don't know.

Any and all advice is welcome to me please I need the help.

"My boyfriend never talked about me to his best friend in seven months, and I don't know how I'm supposed to feel

Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit and I never post on social media but I need help because my love and social life has always been a mess (Like my first bf killed himself,  had a social anxiety so bad I didn't talked for year, got mentally abused those kind of things) and I may be nd so I don't know how to act and react to some basic situation. I'm currently searching for a psychiatrist but it's hard to find one where I live so I just want to ask for some advice here. (English is not my first language btw I'm sorry if i worded things strangely or if I repeat myself too much.)

For some context :
I' m 20 and my bf is a year younger than me, we've been together for 7 months and he is the first person to actually make me fully happy and respect me after some shorts and pretty toxic relationships. 
He has a girl best friend, which I'm totally ok with, even if sometimes that makes me a bit anxious since I've never seen her and I have no idea what their relation is, I just know that they talk almost everyday from what I've seen but they rarely see each other, just to go to the gym maybe like 1 time a month.
I never had any problem with that, but 2 weeks ago, he was casually talking about a funny anecdote that happened to her with a guy, and then said that she asked him how was it going with girls and his love life. He laughed that he totally forgot to tell her he was in a relationship with me during these past 7 months. 
I have no idea if from an extern point of view it seems like a big deal or not.

At first, I laughed about it too, like how could you forget something like that. And then it hit me. I think it's objectively weird to not talk about someone you're spending almost everyday with for so long ? And then I started being extremely sad. Because, personally, I talk about him a lot. All of my friends know about him, because the moment I was with him I wanted to show him to everyone, not as a trophy as well but because I'm juste so proud of him, I love him so much and he's the best thing that happened in my life. I try to not be annoying about him, but I'm known as the biggest simp in our friend group. I know I can't and I don't expect the same level of expression of love from anyone since I can be a bit too much, but knowing that his friend that he talks to everyday doesn't even know I exist makes me feel that it's the opposite for him. That he's ashamed of me, or that I'm not just that important. Like I know he doesn't talk a lot about himself and even less about his private life, and that maybe it would have been weird for him to just come and say ""oh I have a gf btw"". but I feel like there would at least be a moment where he would have slipped a ""Oh I did that with my girlfriend"" or something like that. I feel like he tried to hide my existence. Just this simple phrase broke everything for me.

The thing is, I don't know what to do now. I'm very, very bad at communication and I don't even know if I should talk about it to him or just wait to forget about it because maybe it's not that big of a deal. but it's been two weeks, and I felt so unimportant since this happend, like it broke the very small piece of confidence I had left, and I'm so sad that he makes me feel that way. I know there's ups and downs in every relations but I was sure that this one wouldn't hurt me like that. I almost don't want to talk to him anymore, and that makes me feel so stupid and angry at myself because I forgave people that did wayyyy worse to me in the past and can't get over something like that.

I'm also afraid that if I talk to him about it, since I have difficulties in expressing myself, he couldn't understand what I feel and it would just makes things worse. I don't want him to think that I'm jealous of his friend or something, or think I'm a narcissist for wanting his friends to know about me. I also feel that even if he understand my point, it won't make up for what happened since we can't change things. Like him saying sorry won't change the fact that I wasn't important enough to be talked about for 7 months.

Maybe one of the things that people can think is that he is cheating on me, so to clarify, it's for me the least possible option. The reason I think that is that I've been really good friends with his brother since we're in the same class. His brother was talking about my boyfriend sometimes way before we started dating or even meet each other, and slipped some conversations they had about girls and love life. They once talked about my bf's best friend, and my friend apparently  teased him about their relation like they could be more than friend or something like that. He made kind of a face of disgust, and said that they were good friends but something like that would never happen. Since I heard this story way before we were together, I think it's reassuring about their relation. I also feel that he wouldn't have tell me he didn't talked about us if he was cheating. But even if he's not cheating, it doesn't stop this from being weird and making me feel awful.

Does anyone knows what I should do ? Should I talk, keep it to myself, is it actually a big deal or maybe I'm overreacting ?


I didn't know this simple thing could break me like this after all I've been through, but I just wish I will once know what it feels like to be loved as much as I love, and that someone will once be proud of me the way I'm proud of them.","My(20f) Boyfriend(19m) never talked about me to his friend during our 7 months together, I don't know how to react",18n7t1f,1703113178.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n7t1f/my20f_boyfriend19m_never_talked_about_me_to_his/,

background info : My ex(19) and I(19) started dating the beginning of senior year and things were great up until like end of senior year when our communication was wayyy off. It was basically my first relationship but not his, he was a basketball player so he was always busy and it really didn’t bother me until my insecurities took over because his communication was lacking( he barely texted first or initiated hanging out) he made it seem like i was clingy and so i decided to end things there but somehow we always found our way back to each other( he told me he wanted to make things right and that he would communicate better , which he did ). We started talking again and never made things official even though we’d tell each other “ i love you “i found out that he was talking  one of my “friends” that goes to another school for 2 months immediately after we ended things all while he was actively trying to win me back , he claimed that it was a rebound and that she made him realize he really “loved “ me and that caused us not to speak until after graduation because he didn’t agree with my “get back” however we reconnected during the summer. after we reconnected during the summer we were planning on getting back together however we both didn’t know how we felt about long distance and that caused a lot of arguments. I found out that he refollowed my” friend” who he got with previously on instagram and i felt it was really disrespectful but he shrugged it off as oh she followed me first and then he finally unfollowed after we argued about it a few more times . fast forward a month later he goes off to college and I leave the country last min to travel . we decided to stay “friends” even though we knew it would be more than that.As i was traveling he did seem interested in getting photo dumps and things of that sort but he never  initiated contacting me so i just stopped texting him. I found out that i was blocked on instagram even though we weren’t even following each other in the first place.I also found out he started following my “friend” again. Fast forward to my birthday(oct ) i was expecting a happy birthday from the loml but i got nothing so i proceeded to block him on everything because his actions constantly showed he didn’t care about me .(I recently found out my bsf contacted him on my bd to tell him to wish me one and he left her on seen)anyways it’s been 2 months now no contact and he just unblocked me on instagram a few days ago and idk what he’s trying to do, i did tell him i was coming back from traveling end of december so maybe his angel is to rekindle with me like nothing happened or he just doesn’t care to have me blocked anymore.

"My best friend and I met almost a year ago and became best friends about 8 months ago. Ever since establishing being best friends, we have gotten irrevocably closer each day. We love telling other people about our friendship and our favorite conversations are about how we became friends / going into detail about how special our relationship is. Both of us have never had someone we consider to be a platonic soulmate and it’s something we both consider the other.

We’ve had some pretty spiritual experiences together (involving some substances) and each time we come out of the high with the most inexplicable love for eachother. This is where my overthinking and confusion comes in. I’m pretty infamous for mistaking platonic feelings for romantic ones, but that’s with my guy friends. Also, i am very secure in the platonic love I have for my best friend. I don’t feel the need to misinterpret, I’m just curious about some things I’ve noticed. 

Whenever we talk about the love we have for eachother we continually mention that it is platonic, almost excessively so. For context, we are both queer women who almost exclusively date men at the moment. We change, shower, and go to the bathroom in front of eachother and pretty much have no boundaries in that sense. MANY of my friends have assumed we’re dating and even one of her flings was threatened by me. Whenever this happens, idk i feel like we drag out the convo and laugh ab it more that normal? Anyways, recently after one of our spiritual experiences, there were a couple of hours where I couldn’t tell if we were making intense eye contact bc of the high or bc she wanted to ****. A week later she randomly brought up how she’s so glad that we would never mistake our friendship for romance bc it’s happened in the past for her. It’s happened for me too so we talked a bit about how platonic our friendship is. This is when I brought up those couple of hours and said “yea for a sec during that I was worried that you thought we were gonna ****.” She went quiet for a sec (no idea if I imagined the pause or not) and went “oh haha yea I was worried ab that too”
Safe to say that we moved to a different convo after that, but still, it never makes anything awkward.

I just don’t know how to interpret the things I’ve noticed or if how we talk about being platonic is overcompensation Bc being the kind of best friends we are, it is a relationship, just a platonic one. We know and discuss how we’re meant to do life together, but am I crazy for thinking that she sees it as possibly romantic? (Ps. I don’t think it is, I’m just observant and noticed all this so gotta make sure I’m not insane)",Need advice! I can’t tell if my best friend (21F) wants us to be in love.

"I (23F) started hooking up with Caleb (22M) a little over a year ago. Everything was fine at first, but I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and Caleb was really the only guy that I was comfortable around/attracted too and so I developed some feelings. We had numerous conversations about this and he made it clear he didn’t want a relationship. I went along with this for awhile but eventually grew a pair and cut things off. It was difficult because he was a great friend and I really enjoyed being around him. We didn’t talk to each other for awhile and eventually reconnected when I felt like I was over it. 

That was back in August, and I truly think I was mostly over him. Other than Caleb, I’d only had one night stands or guys that i’d text, and honestly lost the energy to put any effort into anything. I was fully focused on myself. Work, school, friends. Didn’t think about or worry about guys/validation/sex for months. Caleb and I stayed friends and all was fine, we agreed to no longer hook up or anything. 

Then we went to football game with his “friend” who he was holding hands with and flirting with. This made me feel awful, like all of my progress was out the window. It was so upsetting and I couldn’t pinpoint why, I thought I was over him. I told him I just needed a little space and that I’d prefer if he didn’t do that in front of me. 

Back in late October/early November, Caleb introduced me to his friend Brandon. He was nice and funny and we really hit it off and eventually we hooked up. This same night, Caleb was off flirting with some girl and so I didn’t think it was a big deal. Caleb later found out and was really angry. He ended up punching Brandon, not speaking to him, and hardly speaking to me. Me and Brandon stopped communicating entirely, which was sad for me because he did boost my confidence a bit, but Caleb was my friend first. 

This may sound so stupid, but for whatever reason this gave me false hope. Like…why would he care if he didn’t have feelings for me? I redeveloped my feelings for Caleb and never told him, just hoped they’d go away.

A few nights ago out of the blue we (caleb and I) hooked up again, both of us agreeing and being enthusiastic about it. Ever since, I haven’t really heard from or seen Caleb. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that this is not good for me, whether we’re hooking up or not, I always end up having feelings for him and he has 0 for me. I don’t know how to go about it. I could cut him off, destroying our friendship and any mutual friendships, or just go with the flow, which has proven to hurt me time and time again. 

I don’t know what to do, do I put myself first and just stop speaking to him? Should I just talking to him about how I feel? I just feel like and casual friends thing isn’t helping me or making me feel better.",I’m (23F) having troubles getting out of my FWB (22M) situation,18n7aof,1703111798.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n7aof/im_23f_having_troubles_getting_out_of_my_fwb_22m/,
"Hello everybody. My wife and I been together for 7 years total. We're having issues trying to balance the Christmas Eve traditions. It'll be easier for everybody to get a grasp if I explain the different traditions.

I come from an Italian family. Our Christmas Eve tradition has always been a major event. Extended family gathering when possible and a special formal dinner. It's the ""feast of the 7 fishes"" traditional Italian dinner, where you have a ton of appetizers and main courses featuring seven different types of fish like crab cakes, lobster bisque, calamari, shrimp scampi, oven baked salmon, bacon wrapped scallops, and so on.

To me, the tradition has always been about being together and eating delicious seafood. In fact, as I got older and stopped seeing extended family every year, my immediate family kept the fish tradition but scaled it back to eating takeout from Red Lobster, and we just ate an odd number of fish total. I'm saying this to clarify that I don't expect a full formal dinner in best dress.

My wife's family was always a lot more laid back with their Christmas Eve dinner. They would hang out together and order pizza (Cassanos, for anybody who knows what that is). They still spend the night together, but they don't put the energy into having a major meal put together, which is completely fair and understandable. The important thing is that you're spending the time together as a family and having fun.

My wife and I moved across the country and now live near her parents a few years back. The first year, we did a major formal dinner with shrimp cocktail, glazed salmon, crab cakes, and some other dishes.The next year, my in-laws excitedly announced they had purchased frozen pizza kits from Cassanos that they could just heat up in the oven Christmas Eve. There's not a Cassanos restaurant in our state, so they had to be special ordered and shipped frozen.

I have nothing against pizza as a tradition, but I specifically do not like Cassanos (I find it a bit too salty and don't care for the sauce flavor). This is well known by my wife's family, and they tease me about it regularly for having ""poor taste."" I figured that since we did a major fish dinner last year that it was more than fair they do what they wanted this time for the main meal.

Because I do not like the pizza and wanted to keep my tradition alive, I told them that I would be bringing a salmon to cook in the oven as well as shrimp cocktail and stuffed deviled crabs to share. I specified that I was bringing everything to share only after finding out that they had ordered frozen pizzas they know I do not really like.

I mean no disrespect to their traditions at all and would have just brought shrimp cocktail, bacon wrapped scallops, and calamari as finger food snacks if they had chosen a pizza as the main meal that I had also liked. I was also told that bringing food was not an issue and that I was more than welcome to trade using the oven between heating up pizzas. The only reason I brought salmon instead of all appetizers was because I knew I needed a main meal so I got enough food for medication I take. 

But what ended up happening is that MIL got upset that I ""made the house smell like a fish market"" and locked herself in the bedroom for an hour. She finally came out just to put my fish in the fridge and spray air freshener. My wife took me out to see nearby Christmas light displays because I was on the edge of a panic attack. I was diagnosed as ADHD with autistic tendencies and have a tendency to shut down and panic in high conflict settings, so my wife did amazing by removing me from the situation with a disguised excuse that was still in the spirit of the holidays. When we got back, the mood was still pretty sour and everybody just kind of went to bed.

This year, neither my wife nor I have heard anything about Christmas Eve food plans. We are going to be spending the day and staying the night with them because they are leaving to visit family in another state on Christmas day. I've been patiently waiting, but not having any communication was starting to stress me out.

I finally reached out and said ""what's the plan for Christmas Eve dinner? I can bring some seafood based appetizers for everybody if you have something already planned"". MIL responded that we would talk later and that she doesn't want the house getting smelly before they leave. That was a few days ago and she hasn't said anything since.

I'm trying really hard to be relaxed about my tradition. I would be happy bringing just one seafood dish to share as a munchie food like fried calamari. Or if we did takeout Chinese, I'd be happy with shrimp lo mein or something similar. Or we could do surf and turf. Or even white sauce pizza with shrimp on top. I'd be down for anything as long as some type of seafood is eaten with others. 

Can anybody please recommend how to handle this? Both my wife and I are stressed out and want to have a good holiday while respecting everybody's traditions, but we're unsure of how to go about trying to bring it up. 

TL;DR - I have a very different Christmas Eve dinner tradition from my wife's family, and it caused issues last year. What can we do differently this year?

Edit: I forgot to mention, the first year we were there, MIL was also hosting a cousin with a gluten allergy. I think that has way more impact on not having pizza that year as MIL hates the taste of gluten-free items. I think it was easier just to do a full fish meal and they didn't want to be rude by serving something that one person genuinely couldn't eat. The cousin was not there the following year, so we had pizza since nobody was allergic and everybody could eat it. 

Also I did not bring a huge amount of seafood. I brought 1 small container of shrimp cocktail, 4 small stuffed crabs, and 1 large serving of salmon to be eaten along the pizza over the course of 5-6 hours. I had about 3 shrimp, 1 small crab, and half the salmon with my meds. I asked MIL ahead of time on several occasions and made sure this was okay and not imposing. She was very welcoming of me bringing and keeping my traditions since she makes a huge deal out of honoring family traditions.

"Hi Reddit,

My gf and I have had issues over the 2 years we've been together. Issues about insecurities, anxiety, trust and jealousy. We really love each other, but we've had it rough sometimes, but the majority of our relationship was the best.

Last week she broke up with me, because she found out I lied to her about my ex who texted me. She looked through my phone and she saw it. There was no flirting, just that I replied to her and chatted a little bit. My gf looked through my phone and saw the conversation and was mad that I didnt tell her.

Then, a day after the break up, she hit me up. She says she missed me and I missed her too. We linked up at my place and had crazy good sex, and a deep talk. Like how much we were meant to be together. 

Now yesterday, she told me that we should have a break from each other. She said she doesnt know how long (somewhere between 3 months to a year). She said she wanted to work on herself and that she needed to rebuild herself, she feels like she lost her old-self. Which is true, I always tell her she's wayyyy too emotionnally dependent of me.

I cried in front of her, telling her I didnt want to loose her. She told me that she loves me, and it will be hard for her but she needs this time to heal. I told her that she should defintely work on herself, but that I want to stay around her and that splitting up wouldnt be the best way for her to achieve independence and stability.

She also said she didnt want us to be exclusive anymore, since we dont know how long this break will last. I feel like crap and I love her. I dont wanna rush or force her to anything, but how can I reach out to her, and find a way to keep her?

"For context, we have been friends for 7 years despite only dating 2 months. The other day my s/o and I exchanged our Christmas gifts and he gave me a rose gold opal ring. He tells me ""I was worried about giving you this ring."" Upon asking why he said ""You know what this means right... it's a promise ring."" Which I asked what does that mean to you. He gave me a whole spiel about commitment and the future. Anyways, to be quite frank it was 9:30 and I had a 4:30 am shift the next morning, so I was a bit tired and lost for words. So I just silently listened. 
After his talk about the ring, he asked ""What were the last two words of my card to you."" And I said ""My commitment?"" He was like no, so he gave me the card again, and hidden in the corner were the words ""Love you"". I somehow completely missed this. He then said it out of his mouth. And I just blankly stared with a smile not knowing what to say. I do care about him, but I'm not sure I'm ready to say those words yet. Anyways after this event he said ""I love you."" Twice when he left. And once more in the morning over text, then again when I saw him before I left home for the holidays. Since I haven't talked about it. I'm not sure what to say in regards to those three words and I am unsure of the status of this ring in which I so blindly was gifted.",My S/O (20M) said I love you to me (19F) and we've only been dating 2 months,18n78wd,1703111665.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n78wd/my_so_20m_said_i_love_you_to_me_19f_and_weve_only/,
"I am a lesbian and have been in two long term relationships.  Im masculine presenting so i feel like “stereotypically” i look queer lol. I’m recently single and taking time to do me and focusing on my career. I want to state first foremost that i don’t have a tendency to read into things, i take most things at face value so just getting that out of the way so you don’t think your advice is a waste of time. There is a younger girl at my job. She is very feminine looking shes 21 and i was into her since i first met her. Im pretty straight forward about that stuff bc i dont like to ever disguise interest as friendship since its not genuine imo. Ever since i met her, weeks in of realizing we had amazing chemistry,  i started  flirting with her. She was flirting back heavily (if not more)  and even walked me to my car after work at night and asked why i havent asked for her number yet. I told her its bc I wasn’t sure if she was into girls bc she told me she has had 1 relationship in her life with a boy and they had broken up a few months before we met. So even though i was flirting i still was following her lead bc i dont like to come off pushy or weird. So i gave her my number. That night she texted me to drive home safe with kissy face emojis and all that cute stuff. So now im thinking okay she’s atleast interested in getting to know me. As weeks go on shes watching me closely on instagram and sending messages like “are you with another girl?🙄” acting weirdly possessive over me and I actually was hanging out with another girl. She told me if i wanted to get to know her i shouldnt do that and telling me how im not really interested if i do. Being how much i am into this girl, i reeled it in, starting giving my attention to her, assuming we were both into eachother. One night she said she wanted to sleep over but was nervous bc she never has been with a girl before. I told her its no pressure and we should continue to get to know each other before anything bc i am quite older and more experienced. She never even has had any feelings for a girl before so i feel like shes scared. Anyway. Its been 4 months now of the non stop flirting and her keeping it very private and secret. She also told me her parents would never let her be gay and she would never wanna call herself gay. She seems hung up on labels and what her close loved ones will think, and I totally understand I remember being in the same spot. But her outbursts of jealousy and undivided attention to me is sort of hindering my own ability to put my attention elsewhere. I told her if shes not ready we can be friends but i said to dial back on the flirting and jealousy if shes not really ready to accept or atleast explore those feelings (not physically id never rush that) but atleast consider me as a person she would date and get to know, She said i was going too fast asking her to come out but thats not what i asked. I just basically said my feelings are involved at this point and of youre not ready to treat this as more than a situation -ship to atleast let me go, and we can be friends and i was ready to be that for her. ( ive been thru a 6 year breakup i can definitely pull away from a fling and still be cordial and friendly) but i was met with such hurt and a feeling of betrayal coming from her , as if i led her on and didnt like her anymore she told me i hurt her and used her. And thats not at all what i said. I said the balls in your court but I can’t just be strung along and be treated as a friend you cross boundaries with, because im too old and at a different place in my life. She blocked me off social media and at work she acts so angry and hurt at me. All because i wanted to be just friends and not have my romantic feelings involved anymore. I deserve better than a secret relationship with someone exploring new feelings to them. And i feel like she is resenting her confusion more than necessarily resenting me and is taking it out on me. Bc she still gives me the impression she wants me to come to her and give in and go back to the way it was. But it’s actually hurting me atp and i just want to protect my peace. Idk why shes making me the bad guy for wanting to put an end to something shes not even ready for. Advice on how i should move forward?",Advice on dealing with a sexually curious woman?

Quick TLDR for those who haven’t read it, I was in a relationship with someone with one child. I then found out via that child’s dad that she has 3 other children who she abandoned with her mother, oldest 9 and 7 and youngest just 1. She never told me this. Doesn’t see the kids and has blocked them from contacting her. Obviously a shitty person. 3 year old she has custody of (I believe because her dad has to pay so much in child support and the others don’t so they’re of no use to her) what seemed like a perfect girl, somebody who was so kind and loving turned in to a witch overnight. Can’t believe she’s the same person. Child’s father told me that she was a one night stand and she taunted him after saying she only slept with him because she knew she was ovulating and inseminated herself with used condom. Believing that’s what she did to me but no confession yet. When I broke up with her she dropped the bombshell she was pregnant. 

Had a prenatal dna test done Tuesday, paid for next day results. Some said they thought she was lying about being pregnant. Got the results, she is pregnant and I am the dad. DNA lab took her blood sample isolated fœtal DNA and compared it to my DNA which was a positive match.

She doesn’t have the results, I only gave my contact details as the report has a photo of my ID on as I had to confirm my identity and during the prenatal test with other child’s father she sent the report to random people showing his ID and personal info. She keeps calling me to find out the results and I keep declining her calls, not ready to speak to her yet. 

Not sure what to do, need to tell my parents, no way I can care for a baby without some guidance from them. She is adamant she is keeping the baby herself (custody) she won’t abort. Wants me to pay for things already like crib, pram etc. 

Spoke to her mum who is convinced the baby will be dropped off to her at some point after birth and has expressed she can not look after a 4th child as she’s in her mid 60s with an adult disabled son already raising 3 kids and working full time. She said if it happens again she will have to hand the baby over to cps, she’s very upset at that thought. 

Not sure what I do now. Do I phone her and tell her the results were positive? Do I see how things go and allow her to have custody and only take over if she drops baby to her mum? Do I file for custody and fight for custody as soon as baby is born providing statements showing she uses babies like objects and has a history of abandonment from her mum and ex? 

I will have to spend thousands in court and I’m not even sure if they will give child to me despite her history as they declined giving custody to 3 year olds dad when he went to court.

Not sure what to do, not even ready for a baby but seems I now have to decide whether I fight or try to co parent with this insane women.

TL;DR: update to DNA results, it’s mine. Not sure where to go from here

UPDATE:

I have told my parents, wider family live in New Zealand so they don’t know yet. 

Parents are disappointed but very understanding when I explained what happened and the situation that I was almost definitely trapped and that she has a record of abandoning children that aren’t of financial use. 

Mother has agreed that I should fight for custody and that if I get custody or mother hands baby over to me (which given her record and her mothers refusal to take any more kids) may be the outcome. My mother has said that she will move in with me for the first months to help me learn how to look after a baby.

"I've always been incredibly indecisive. There's probably not much in my life I was ever sure of with big decisions. From jobs, career changes to which college I'd go to.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 years. I wish it was an easy decision but it's not. And I'm not sure if it's because of my analysis paralysis or the negatives of our relationship. A marriage decision doesn't feel right but it also doesn't feel wrong..

Any advice welcome :)

**Pros:**

* We share the same values and goals. Family, finances, life-planning etc.
* We enjoy the same hobbies/leisure time
   * 99% of the time we're down to spend our free-time the exact same way and it's more fun with her vs. with others or alone.
* We make a good team. I can count on her for just about anything physically wise. Household chores, scheduling, food prep, travel plans, shopping etc. She is very accountable in that regard.
* She is my best friend. For as much painful growing we've done, we do get along reasonably well.
* She is determined, I don't ever have to worry about her commitment to something. Relationship or otherwise. She will fight and she will grow. 
* For as cold, tough love as she can be, she does have a big heart and can be very selectively thoughtful. It's a weird dichotomy.. 

**Cons:**

* We have a rocky history. Assumptions we have about each other can surface sometimes. Couples therapy has helped with this. However, sometimes I think it would be easier if we had a reset button.
* We miss-understand each other often which can lead to trivial fights. This can boil down to communication issues and again therapy has helped but I know it's just our speech, temperance, personality etc differences. It feels like an up-hill battle sometimes. I suspect I wouldn't have trouble with someone that's on my wave-length more often than her so to speak.
* My biggest fear about marriage is continuing to fight, not being heard and being unhappy.
* Her attitudes can be cold sometimes, a tough love approach, the opposite of warm. I want a warm woman and have expressed this. It's not a deal-breaker for me but again I just think of *maybe* how much happier I *could* be. A lot of ifs..

**Misc:**

* I don't think we're naive. We both understand there are probably more compatible people out there for the both of us but we share so many values and goals it's extremely hard to 'give up' on fighting for our relationship.

"We have been in a relationship for 18 months. For their duration of our relationship she has had what I would call trust issues or insecurities when it comes to other women, I think in large part due to infidelities from past relationships and the way her previous boyfriends treated her (I’ve heard all the stories and they absolutely did treat her appallingly). Anyway, the issues for us is that she simply doesn’t seem to trust me when I socialize (although she says she does). For the record, I’m highly introverted, I don’t go out very often and when I do I’m not out super late (I generally lose socializing energy earlier than most people and want to just come home around 11-12 when others want to party all night). I also am just simply not the kind of person who flirts, likes strippers, does drugs, hits on women, cheats etc. Thats just not me (I know lots of people like that, I know they exist, I don’t judge but that’s not my style). She also freely admits that I’ve never done anything like that in our relationship.

Nonetheless, whenever I do go to a social event on my own (for example a work event or catching up with my school mates without all the wives present) I always end up getting into big trouble with my girlfriend when I’ve never actually done anything wrong. It’s like she’s got a predetermined outcome in her mind and even if I’m in constant communication with her and come home at a reasonable time, she’s still angry at me and usually involves a big argument the next day(s). She says ‘all the possibilities of what I could be getting up to’ are running rampant in her mind and it’s very real for her and her feelings on this ‘are valid’ so I’m not allowed to be dismissive (or ‘defensive’ as she calls it when I try and tell her what happened or didn’t happen when i was out). When she gets upset I simply try and run through what happened throughout the night to try and put her at ease.

The latest incident though has me at a loss and I don’t know what to do. Recently I had my work xmas party. For context, work events bother her because my entire team at work are females. I’ve explained multiple times that I’m committed to her and just because my coworkers are female, it doesn’t mean I’d ever do anything to disrespect her or cheat on her. Also for the record, ALL the women in my team are married with children. It’s not some hotbed of young single attractive women. Anyway at the party I was messaging her throughout the night and I also said I wouldn’t go out after the event, I’d come straight home (which I did - I was home by 11 even though the event went until midnight). Unfortunately for me, twice she messaged me and I didn’t respond straight away, the first time I think it took me 20 minutes to reply, the second time about 30-40 minutes. In all honesty, at the time I was having a conversation with some work colleagues, my phone was in my pocket and I didn’t feel it vibrate (it was obviously a loud venue with about 300 people there). I also didn’t check my phone every few minutes because I was comfortable that I had been msging her periodically throughout the night so I didn’t think much of it, I hadn’t been ignoring her. 

Anyway she lost it. Said don’t bother coming home, I’m a scumbag etc etc (I could go on). It lead to a big argument and she was devastated and “absolutely disgusted” with how I treated her that night. She “couldn’t even touch me”.  

I think it’s pretty normal that when someone is out socializing sometimes they don’t respond straight away. It happens all the time. Also I did respond to her both times, just not straight away (and apologize both times for the delay). I wasn’t drunk, I’d had about 3 beers all night, this wasn’t a rowdy event (and I don’t get rowdy anyway as I’ve explained above). This was a very tame/professional work function.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable and I really think I’m behaving in a pretty normal way, the way most people act (for the record I have plenty of evidence on my phone of times when she was out and didn’t reply for hours, to which I was completely unbothered). 

Have I done anything wrong, am I missing something big? Or is it more likely she has trust issues and it’s on her to make some changes? The ongoing drama is causing me significant mental health problems at this point and there is strain on our relationship. She desperately wants her feelings validated, but other than acknowledging them, I just can’t get on board with it, I don’t think I can change my behavior because there’s nothing really to change (again unless I’m missing something obvious). I strongly feel it’s more in her court to work through, I’m happy to do this with her, but it can’t be an indictment on my behavior because short of duct taping my phone to my hand so I absolutely can’t miss a msg when I’m out, I don’t know what I’d change. Im also sick of not being able to ‘defend myself’ - if she wants to sling accusations and get upset, I believe I’m within my rights to set her straight and tell her what actually happened, rather than sit there and cop abuse and apologize for god knows what.",My (M31) girlfriend (F30) doesn’t trust me socializing,18n6vof,1703110700.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n6vof/my_m31_girlfriend_f30_doesnt_trust_me_socializing/,
"Please just skip if you’re going to judge. 

So I am currently living with my partner (or ex partner I guess) until Feb but right now everything is so confusing. Has told me he no longer wants to get married and no longer wants a relationship with anyone. However he wants me to stay until February like we agreed upon. I’m not happy. Sex has not been the same or it’s been non existent. 

Since he told me he doesn’t want a relationship anymore out of life I feel like I’m wasting my time. I’ve been emotionally detaching, but the more I do it seems he comes back around. He’s been speaking about future plans with me again and I’m not sure if it’s a manipulation tactic or what. He literally just talked about me selling my home so we could buy a house together (NEVER happening lmfao). Yet this is the same person that “no longer wants a relationship or a marriage one day”….HUH??? 

Besides that point, like I said, sex is non-existent and when it does happen it’s not satisfying for me at all. 

Since he said he no longer wants a relationship despite me still living with him temporarily I’m single in my eyes. I do still feel wrong for a what I’m about to do but if the tables were turned I know he would do it to me for a fact. He’s cheated on me before several times when we were long distance and honestly I’m not 100% sure that he hasn’t cheated since I’ve been living here. 

I don’t see anything long term with him anymore anyway and honestly he has a loser mentality. He says he really enjoys sex with me and it’s the best, but he’s the type of man that would sleep around and basically cheat on me simply out of curiosity and has recently admitted that. I gave so many passes in the past because I thought the issue was distance and I feel like I was manipulated into believing that’s what the issue was. 

Had he been honest about him being this type of person I would have never let things get serious at all and I feel manipulated all around. Trapped almost. 

I want to feel wanted, I want to have good sex, and I’m not getting it here any more. I don’t even respect him now deep down and like I said I see more and more that this could never be my husband. I feel like even with him chasing me a bit now it’s only because I’m not showing any emotion or longing like I used to and that is throwing him off.  

Do you think it’s wrong for me to go through with my plan? Technically I’m single anyway based on what he said but just wanting to hear thoughts.

"Last night I (24f) had my second date with a guy and I invited him back to my place. I’m a sober recovering alcoholic and have only just started dating again. 
The first date was nice and we only had a little kiss before I left- once we were back at my place on the second date he came on a lot stronger.
He has been expressing a lot of interest and often makes comments about how I’m out of his league and I can sense he feels somewhat insecure around me. 
He started kissing me and while I wasn’t so sure about it I decided to give it a go. 
We ended up having sex and he switched from being quite nervous and meek to being really dominant and quite performatively aggressively. 
He reeked of a guy who had watched a lot of porn. A lot of full on dirty talk and he even started choking me at some points and smacking me on the ass. 
We had NOT at any point discussed this prior or during and I am not into kinky stuff, I also have some trauma from abuse during my teenage years so I thought it was pretty gross that he didn’t check in with me before going for it. 
The reason I write this is because I feel quite frustrated with myself- 
I’ve hooked up with a lot of guys and a recurring theme has been what feels like a mental block to laying down boundaries or communicating what is ok and what isn’t unless I’m expressly asked by them. 
In a non sexual context, I am a very confident and outspoken person. I value justice and fairness and communication. 

I thought maybe I was finding myself in sexual situations that I’d leave feeling violated because most of my hook ups occurred when I was wasted with people I barely knew- 
Now I’m sober I feel I have so much more agency, yet I was still unable to express my discomfort to this guy. My friend suggested I tell him what he did was not cool, but the idea of doing that fills with me anxiety and dread. I wish I knew why. Maybe it’s because I know it would end in me having to comfort him for making him feel bad- which I hate. 
I’d love to hear from some other women who have dealt with this issue of people pleasing, especially in a sexual context- I want to work on this but I feel like I have such a mental block so any insight would be excellent.

Edit: also want to clarify I won’t be seeing this guy again as I’m feeling pretty gross after our last date- I also want to clarify that it’s not a case of ‘should I tell him or should I not express my discomfort with him’- I’m quite aware that I should communicate that what he did made me uncomfortable. My problem is the absolute fear and dread I’m filled with when I imagine myself confronting someone about this kind of thing. It isn’t even nervousness it’s genuine fear.

"I’ve been talking to this woman that I met at a bar a few months ago. We’ve been talking on social media somewhat consistently. Every time we talk she always ends our conversations with something like “I can’t wait to meet up and hangout with you.” Well here’s the thing. She’s shown a lot of interest up until the last few days. I’ve had a lot of depressing things going on in my life the last few weeks and I take medicine for depression. I’ve been posting a lot on social media about how things haven’t been going well and how it’s been affecting me. I’m wondering how if maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she is turned off by what I’ve been posting because I just messaged her today and wanted to see if she’d like to finally hangout and she’s seen the message but she hasn’t said anything. It’s been a few hours now. There’s still time but I can’t help but think maybe she feel like I’m not in a good place emotionally to date her.

"Me and my girlfriend have been now together for about 7 years now. We live together in our studio, which we share bills/rent/utilities. She recently a few months ago started to bartend. Which personally i have no problem with, i have supported her throughout her journey. She recently started working at a sports bar with half naked bartenders, and which i was a bit uncomfortable with. She assured me no funny business, and it would help with our small financial problems. (We both work btw,  i have two jobs and help with what i can always).  I agreed with her that it would so she took the job, first of all i was kind of skeptical about the whole thing just being half naked. I realized whatever, were young its not a forever thing. Shes been coming home with so much money, that lately shes been belittling me over every issue. We recently had an argument about a week and a half ago that i havent provided enough for her, that i should be doing way more than i am. Mind you, i dont let anything go past over due, i cook i clean i pay half and she still expected me to buy her specific things that she said were important to her like a table shes been needing for work and other material items that shes been “NEEDING”. She put me down saying im not a provider type (which i am in many other ways) and proceeded to argue about how i need ANOTHER job, how i dont make enough to buy the material things. Mind you, its xmas time. I have my own bills to take care of besides our studio. I spent most of my money this month taking care of gifts, paying my my bills. She compares myself to her in a weird way because she makes more than me and i feel so embarrassed. I literally asked her for $20 last month for gas because i needed to get to work and back and shes held that against me so much too. She said i shouldnt even be in the position to ask for money. This was after i paid my rent, i just needed to get to work. Today we got into an argument because my light bill was due last night and my direct deposit has not came in yet.. which was supposed to hit two days ago. She said today i need to make more money that its crazy that i let bills be late which was totally out of my control. We had this argument 30 min after we woke up. She said “if i knew i was late on bills i would be cooking and cleaning right now” and told me to get up and start cleaning.

"I've been dating him since 3 months and our relationship is quite unusual as it started as roomate then evolved into an actual initimate relationship. It's my first time being with someone so i'm not too knowledgable, it's probably silly to ask for advices on internet but i'll take it for now until i find a therapist. 

Anyways since we're together i've seen snapchat notifications pop up in his screen, he has fetish oriented applications on his phone like fetlife or kik, he contacts sexworkers on a regular basis, chats/sexts with other girls, etc... I know for a fact that he's cheating, once when we were watching youtube on his phone he fell asleep, so i profited of it to access his phone to confirm my suspisions and it was even worse, i just dont get how he can talk to SO MANY women at the time, it's such a time and money sink...(a few time i saw him change apps quickly or hide his phone, once i even saw a nude picture in the reflection of his glasses when he was on his phone, so it's not just one girl or one time, he sext with dozen and dozen of girls) 

 At first i was excusing it on him having a low self esteem, on having a porn/sex/attention addiction or on not knowing that it will hurt me. I didnt confront him about it but i would give hint like ""hey now that we're together we're exclusive right ?"", or asking him if he chatted to other girls or saying that if he talked to other girls i would be hurt. I tried to make him feel desirable, complimenting him, being very sexual as to please all of his urges so he wouldnt look elsewhere, but i've come to the point where i just accept it as being a flaw. 

Beside feeling hurt because my trust has been broken and that i'm a disposable thing (he told me at some point that he needed me to leave the appartement as he would be traveling for work for at least half a month, kicking me out in a way. Turned out he just found a east european girl that wanted to stay with him , giving him sexuals favors in exchange of the austrian nationality ( is it sex trafficking btw ? ), it didnt happen as she apparently found someone better from what i've read, but i doubt that in the first place she was real are the pictures she sent looked AI like). 

The thing is that altough what he hides is not good, he's an amazing boyfriend to me. I can't count the numbers of time he comforted me when i was sad and ugly crying for hours on end, how he never took advantage of me and let me explore my sexuality at my own pace (he never pushed me), how he often brings little surprises or gifts... the list is long. I'm currently officially jobless (i only do a bit of sexwork on the side) and he helped me a lot to do my resumee and recommended me to his compagny, he lets me live rent free in his appartement and helped me get into shape, get healthier, be more happy and he helped me a lot to go out of my very suicidal phase.

 I'm applying for jobs and i currently either have one in the compagny he works at where i could still live with him, having the peace of mind of having someone to be confident with, sharing a lot of living expenses and having the pro of shared chores and peace of mind, or either i take another job where i would have to change country and then i'll have to cut tie with him and be more independant. My affection towards him is very ""logical"", in the way that i'm not blinded by having butterflies in my stomach and feeling all lovy dovey, i just appreciate what we are able to create together and the satisfaction of being helped and of helping someone. My biggest fear currently is that i get remplaced, that he finds someone more sexual than me like what almost happened with this eastern europe girl.

","Putting more value on a relationship rather than respect for myself ? My (18F) boyfriend (28M) cheats on me since we began dating, but i dont mind anymore",18n6khv,1703109879.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n6khv/putting_more_value_on_a_relationship_rather_than/,
"   Throw away for obvious reasons. Me (21F) and my BF (27M) have been dating for a little over 2 years. He is also my first relationship ever. We met at a fast food job and a month after we started dating I moved in with him to escape my toxic father. When we first got together he did a lot of drugs and we fought every day. It's gotten better over the 2 years we've been together, but we still fight about once a week. 

  
3 months ago I moved out of state for a 6 month internship for a huge media company. I'm not going to say where, but internships here are very rare to get and I've been applying for one since freshmen year of collage. I'm in the second year of my M.A., and I figured that the opportunity was too good to pass up and it wouldn't interfere with my schooling as most of it is online and I can use my internship for class credit. 

  
For the most part my bf was supportive. He helped me find a place to stay and helped me pack for the trip. However, for the three months I had to prepare for my internship he kept saying that I would break up with him once I moved away. He said that I would find someone better and I would realize that I didn't want to be with him. It was a major trigger for him and the first month I was here he called me 24/7 to see what I was doing and who I was with. I tried to help him the best that I could, but now that I'm here I think he was right.   


I haven't found someone new but I really really like being away from him. Since day one of our relationship we were fighting and now I don't have to worry about waking up to a fight or having to go to bed before he gets home so we don't continue a fight. I don't have to constantly pick up after his messes or clean up for him. I don't have to worry about what I can or can't buy because all my money right now is my money. I've started eating healthier and even went back to being a vegetarian because I don't have him starting fights with me about how I don't eat right or eat enough protein.

  
For the first time in 2 years I haven't had to worry about if today was going to be a good day or if I would do something to trigger him. It's just, we never even had a romantic or honeymoon stage of our relationship. We immediately went from going on 2 dates to moving in together. Instead of worrying about what I would wear to a date with him, I had to worry about making rent with him. Like I said, I'm not looking for anyone new, but being away from him has got me thinking about how abnormal our relationship is. There was no courting period, no period where he would pick me up for dates or buy me flowers, our relationship just became super serious very fast and I feel like it's the reason we fight so much. Before I left he kept talking about getting engaged and he keeps talking about it. But the longer I'm away the more I realize that I don't want to be in a super serious relationship. I don't want to be 21 and playing maid for a man who can't clean up after him self. I want to be 21 going out with my friends and going on mini vacations and going to book stores and spending too much money on coffee and books, all things that I get to do regularly now. I don't have to worry about him starting a fight because the lavender in my chai costed .99 cents extra or that I don't need a new purse because I already have one because he isn't here. I feel like for the first time in my life I really get to live. I never got to do anything living with my parents because we were poor, and I never got to do anything with my bf because my money always went to bills and my time went towards cleaning the house and working. I'm making a decent amount of money right now and I live with 2 amazing roommates and everyday is amazing. We pay the bills equally, clean up our messes, and everyday we do something new. I can do what I want when I want. I can decorate how I want. I can go to every place I want without having to consider what my bf wants. I 

  
I feel awful because everyday he calls me and says he misses me and I don't feel the same way at all. I'm dreading coming home and even chose to stay up here for Christmas. I don't know what to do because I feel like I will be making his worst fear come true. I'm not looking to date someone new but I know that's what he is going to think. I'm not sure how to break the news or how to deal with this at all. I know he is going to be heartbroken but I am so happy being alone.

I'm just not so sure how the future is going to pan out with her as I don't want to be in resentment and of course make things worse for her. l've been dating her for roughly a year and a month now and it's been great with us, she has had an amazing connection with my family.. but i haven't had the best interactions with hers, her mother has said quite a few nasty things to/about me and hasn't been welcoming at all for example.

 She told me I was ruining her family simply because she stayed round my house for a couple days and her Dad was being disgustingly abusive to everyone in that family.. in May I took her on her first holiday to Greece and she tried to be controlling saying it's disrespectful that l've done that without her permission.

Her dad has made comments like ""I will not even touch your guys baby"", ""he is from a horrible country"" - bearing in mind her and her Dad don't talk being is a nasty guy.. but still. She says ""my cousins really like you"" ""my siblings really like you"" but after a year and a bit I don't have any type of relationship with anyone, I don't talk to anyone, l'm not even allowed in her house for dinner or do a toilet cause of her Dad.

"Hi. As the title gives away I am in an age gap relationship. We have been together for 3 years. I am the younger partner. My SO the other day said that they wanted to make my life better than theirs had been when they were my age (we are both adults and only about 12 years apart so not a huge gap but still a gap nonetheless). 

In return I said that I wanted to make the future of their life better than they’d experienced before too. They kind of paused and said that they felt like they could do more for my future. I didn’t ask what they meant further but I read between the lines that they meant it was because of their age. (I know it is not really a financial difference but we both make good money at our jobs and share our finances. We are living as though we are married). So this was a bit confusing for me.

I felt that it was intended as a sweet gesture (that is how it came off). But I couldn’t also help but feel that maybe they felt I couldn’t bring as much to the table for them for some reason.

"This started a week ago and ""concluded"" 2 days ago and I'm not sure how to feel about it. Basically, last week our 17 year old son told us about having a girlfriend (17 years old). 

We did tell our child not to dabble in relationships up until he was 14 years old and then stopped reinforcing that rule, mostly because we decided that he should be mature enough to make his first experiences starting from that age. He seemed to have interpreted us not actively reinforcing it as us expecting it without saying, however.

When he told my husband (I was at work at the time) about his relationship, he apparently was uncharacteristically timid and shy about it, as if he had to inform him about a huge mistake he made. This rubbed my husband the wrong way, because he thought it should be self-explanatory that our son gets to make his own decisions about (normal) relationships at that age.

Somehow this made him decide to actually disapprove of the relationship and tell him he's not mature enough to have one. Son allegedly gave a bit of resistance but after husband raised his voice he became quiet and went to his room. 

I had a long discussion with him because I thought his behavior was out of line, but husband told me that we always treated our children with respect and there was never a reason for them to fear us (the most we do is take their electronics away if they misbehave or raise our voices) so he doesn't understand why our son doesn't have the spine to stand up to him and simply inform him of his relationship, rather than meekly ask for approval as if he's not his own person.

Husband says that this isn't how he raised him and if he isn't ready to stand up for himself he's not ready to have a partner. 

This drama went on for multiple days which really stressed me out and resulted in more and more ""encroaching"" behavior from my husband towards my son, even demanding to go through his phone (something he never did before). We both agree that our son deserves privacy, but husband said that he doesn't like how our son doesn't put his foot down and demand respect. 

Eventually it all ended with our son snapping, screaming at my husband and telling him he doesn't care what he think and taking all of his stuff and getting ready to leave the house.

This was after my husband, for the first time ever, put his hands on our son by lightly pushing him against the wall, saying ""you're my son and live under my house I decide the rules"". 

Afterwards, my husband dropped the bullying and told son that if he had stood up for himself from the beginning, he might've thought he was mature enough for a relationship.

They hugged and and husband said that if son genuinely believes he is being wronged, he should stand up to anyone, be it his friends, parents or even God.

I found this whole ordeal really toxic but husband insisted that this way, son will never forget about the lesson and that this moment is gonna be a part of his ""foundation"" for his self respect.

Things normalized again and their relationship is seemingly as good as it has always been, despite husband not wanting to reveal to our son that he was testing him.

This wouldn’t be as bad if we were together for a long time previously AND THEN the distance came, but it’s always been long distance lol and I’m just worried it’ll be really hard but I’m desperate to make it work because she’s amazing to spending time with.

Ever since she got a job, we haven’t talked as much/ often because she’s busy and overwhelmed at the end of the day (which is understandable) but on the bright side more money = more dates?  Btw we’ve been on a date since her getting the job, but it was really short because she had uni work to do


Here’s the thing: I’m clingy asf and I constantly want reassurance tbat I’m still liked by you etc (partly bc I have an anxiety disorder) but I’m afraid to ask for the reassurance incase I seem attention seeking, so of course the lack of communication is torturous but I just feel bad being sad about it since everyone needs space etc.

"My Ex gf(20F) and I(20M) broke up very suddenly. She’s been going through a lot in the last few weeks leading to the break up and she claimed she wasn’t ready for a relationship heading in a serious direction. So she asked for space but told me to text her still. Well it sucked and I was devastated but I get she needs space, we’ll I got scared when her friends all unfollowed me and it freaked me out so i messaged her asking if we could talk, and she sent a nice message back but said she still needed space. I got upset and said some things I regret and didn’t mean and she responded nicely and was sweet and said she still cares but needs that space. And now I’m blocked and so scared she’ll never unblock me. When she called it she had all this stuff happening in her life, like this big surgery and her future and her family life and I don’t understand why she wouldn’t talk to me about it, the week before this we talked about everything and I knew exactly what was going on but when it ended she just couldn’t talk to me about anything. And I’m so sad. I just wish she’d look me in the eyes and say she doesn’t care. Cause then I can at least know it was never about me. It’s been 19 days since I got blocked and I guess I’ve hit the point where she’ll never unblock me and she’ll move on. And I’m just so scared that someone I love has given up on me and us and I just wanna be okay. I just want her to be okay, sadly without me. I guess my question is Am I in the wrong for caring?

"Okay, so for starters me and my boyfriend have been dating for 4 months now, we met in freshman year of high school but didn’t start dating until we graduated. Ever since we have actually gotten into a relationship i’ve noticed how insecure and sensitive he can get. For example, He got mad of me for making eye contact with a guy in a coffee shop for too long. And another time when we were out to lunch with friends and one of my girlfriends mentioned how he looked like a character from a video game, i laughed. He didn’t. He got very upset with me over the fact i didn’t “defend” him.  A bunch of situations like this happen a lot and especially over the course of 4 months.

During our 3 month he got weary over this trend on tiktok called the “3 month rule” in relationships where people apparently loose feelings around this milestone of the relationship. He brought it up and asked if i was loosing feelings. I told him no. But now i’ve been thinking back on it after a month and slowly coming to a realization my feelings on the relationship aren’t what i thought they were.

"Let me preface this by saying I'm pretty sure it is never going to work for a multitude of reasons, I know that, I'm conscious of it, but it doesn't stop me from feeling what I feel.

About 10 years ago I got into college halfway across the country and met a girl I fell in love with and dated for about four years, let's call her ""Laura"". Since we were together for so long, she met my family and friends as I've met hers. Enter ""Courtney"", Laura's best friend. Immediately we hit it off and became close friends (we are both big nerds). When problems started to appear in my then relationship, we became a lot closer and she gave me a lot of support because the problems I was having with Laura were some of the same she had as well (like money, Laura is way wealthier than the both of us and does not understand the concept of ""I don't have any money"", she's also a social alpinist and tends to leave friends behind). Still, one of the reasons I ended things with Laura was because I was falling for Courtney. After the brake up, we started going out as friends, but we flirted a lot, so much so our other friends started to notice and comment. She'd always answer with ""Oh we can't, because of Laura"".

We graduated, I moved back to my home-state and Courtney and I stayed in touch. Covid came and we became even closer. We would talk all day every day, and even had some long-distance ""dates"" watching movies, drinking wine and face-timing. She supported me when I changed careers, I stayed awake with her when her mother got sick, she became my band's biggest fan, 'till this day we exchange gifts on birthdays and holidays, etc. After the pandemic was over, I decided to travel back to my college town specifically to see her and make my feelings known. But I froze, just couldn't do it. We hung out but that was it.

Recently she came to visit me for a weekend. It was amazing, we naturally lean into each other, we make each other laugh and we can talk for hours without being bored. She gave me a little personalized bracelet that she made herself and I baked her some homemade croissants. I wanted to kiss her so bad, but again, just froze. We said goodbye and that was it.

It's pathetic, I know. I've had other relationships in this meantime as I'm sure she did as well (we NEVER talk about other people, it's the only topic we never touch on), but I always come back to her as nobody has ever grabbed me like she does. I've sent friends prints of our conversations to check if I'm seeing things where there aren't any, but they all confirmed that yes, she is flirting with me, and she does seem into me as well.

I just don't know what to about it. There are some many factors going against us: the distance, the history (even though Laura is happily married now, they are still friends), but I can't get over her. I'm thinking of planning another trip but don't know if I should just forget about it, or maybe it's safer to just confess through chat? But it seems so impersonal... What to do?

We have had two children back to back Irish twins both these pregnancies we’re not planned and do birth control failure. I’ve always been hesitant being a mom and struggled with the idea of having two small babies to take care of one time after my first son was born I had found online profiles of my partner, actively trying to flirt with women, showing inappropriate provocative pictures and offering money, we talked about it and eventually got over it because I understood the intimacy was just not there after giving birth, and that I needed to show more interest in our sex life and being immersed into being a new mother fast forward a year later after giving birth to my second child I get a notification from a woman claiming she has been seeing my boyfriend behind my back, and he has told her that we are not together, and why I was so interested in being with him if I had another child with a different man it’s up into a huge altercation because I had literally just given birth and he left the hospital after my C-section to go be with her and meet up. She ended up posting pictures online making a Facebook group, inviting about 2000 people randomly to share her side of the story, I was so humiliated because not only did she add all of my coworkers from my work, but also my family members dealing with postpartum and all this drama really took its toll. I didn’t have anywhere to go and felt like I was trapped. I love this man so much I had to give him two babies. Yet, he said he was so unhappy and then I was not giving him enough  attention sexually that he had to look for it elsewhere two months after this incident we decided that I would stay at my mom‘s house and try to figure out what we were going to do within two days.

I don’t know what to do a part of me believes once a cheater always a cheater the other part of me wants to just forgive and forget but now it’s so hard to get intimate.

Me 21M and my girl 20F now seem to be in a near sexless relationship

My girlfriend and I met when we 18 at the start of university 2 years ago and at this point we were sleeping with each other everyday night and most of the time multiple times a night. It was the reason she started going on the pill. 

Fast forward 18 months and it started to plateau which is expected but then within the last 8 months it’s been 1-2 times a month which resulted in her coming off the pill about 5 months ago. 

Since then nothing has really fixed and I’ve asked her if all is okay and questions like is it me but she just never seems to know why or what’s happening. I never get angry when she says no but it’s just upsetting. I’m not asking to go back to how it was but just more than it is now.

"A few years ago, I found out my husband had a double life and I was messed up from it and vulnerable after I left him. Someone I had always known of - Todd, 30, pounced when he found out I was newly single. We formed a flirty friendship that lasted about a year. I developed feelings, however I was still healing from my marriage and needed time, I respected him based on how revered he was in his career. As we got closer, he would push for sex, which I wasn’t ready for, but he kept putting me in sexual situations by having me sit on his lap while he kissed my neck or see his erection, telling me i was boring for not being sexual with him and how badly he wants me. He was grooming me. He worked on me sexually and eventually I gave in to the pressure. 

So Todd ends up using me, we didn’t have sex but did everything else. He then organised a special date for us, called me every day for a week to make sure I don’t forget about our special date, and then ghosts me to be sexual with my best friend instead. He played me, groomed me sexually, and took advantage of me at such a vulnerable time when I had no self esteem. My trust in men was so thin already and he absolutely destroyed it and it changed me. I was traumatised for a long time by how badly I’d been tricked. 

Fast forward 4 years later, I began dating an amazing man, James. We are now 12 months in and pretty serious. Months into the relationship, James confesses that he’s actually good friends with Todd and didn’t want to tell me at first because he didn’t want me to run away. I feel so much shame and trauma from the Todd situation. So now Todd is engaged, and has an agreement with his fiancé that girls from his past aren’t welcome around them. They have pool parties and events that only my partner is invited to, while I’m not welcome to come because of the history of him playing me. Todd calls James during our dates to talk about the events he doesn’t invite me to. James has confirmed with me that Todd confided that his intentions with me were bad, and James uses this against me in arguments, saying it’s my fault for being easy and getting played.

While I understand we are seperate people, I feel so triggered that James remains friendly with someone who tricked me, hurt me and traumatised me when I was down. I think my bf is a coward for not telling Todd that their friendship is now inappropriate, or at least just quietly letting that friendship go.

"I’ll try to make this as quick as I can. 

  
Here’s a little background on me and my situation. I’m 32f living in LA. I’m from the US and met my now-wife (40f) almost 8 years ago here. Long story short, she had to go back to Mexico 4 months into things and I took a risk and moved there so we could be together. I actually learned Spanish to speak to her mom and sister because they speak no English despite both having lived here various times for years. 

We had like no money when we first lived together. We’ve both done pretty well for ourselves but as my wife now has a law degree and we moved to the US since getting married, she makes about twice what I do. 

My MIL and SIL do not work. My wife and I pay for our house in Mexico, which they live in for free. My wife also encouraged me to contribute $700 USD/month for them as “that’s family and it’s what we do”. Mind you, her brother who’s my age does not do that, but she says I”m her wife and she expects more out of a partner than anyone else. 

My wife pays about 70% of the rent, which I did not want to do. I wanted 50-50 but she didn’t want the 1-bed that allowed for that. She wanted the 2-bedroom. Just an FYI I’m a professional DJ/music producer and I also do freelance writing when I’m not touring on the weekends. The second room was supposed to be for my livestreams, practicing, producing, and writing. My wife said we could get a pullout couch just for when visitors come. 

I’ve had visitors come once, who were so pristine like you’d never know they were even there.  My wife’s mother and older sister are currently visiting us, and this is my issue: 

\- They literally NEVER ask me for permission for anything. Only my wife. My wife never consults me. 

\- While here, I do not get to use my desk. I tried using the table and they yell over the TV that they play, they blow their nose on napkins and don’t wash their hands, they watch TikTok super loud, they sleep on the couch. I can’t work like that - even with headphones on. 

\- We have a steam shower in our bathroom which connects to the master bedroom. My MIL will ask my wife if she can shower in it and my wife says “yes” all the time. I’m not ok with this. 

\- She cleans our bedroom and bathroom. I feel that these places are private places for a COUPLE. I feel that as we’re both women, it’s not taken this way. My MIL loves to call me another daughter, but I almost feel like it’s done so that she can boss me around the way she does my wife and SIL. With my BIL she actually listens, and listens to his partners.

\- She’ll drink my coffee without asking, and drink the last of it. Nothing is mine or for me. 

\- They’ll invite literally whoever they want over. It’s an absolute shock to me every single time. Literally no one asks or communicates this to me. 

\- They’re staying for a month now, but my wife told me when my MIL comes back to start her process for getting a permanent residency here, she’ll be staying with us the entire time which could take up to a year. My MIL will not be contributing in rent and will be staying in our second room/my office.   


My wife has told me that her family will be sharing in everything we get together. That they have helped us so much by keeping our house in Mexico maintained that they deserve it all. My MIL loves to force her opinions in about EVERYTHING. She chose literally all the decor in our house because the 3 of them would talk about it and then after the fact my wife would say, “Oh wouldn’t you like this, babe?” with a smile on her face.   


Anyway, I really need some advice here. I’m short on $ at the moment because it’s a slower season for my writing and touring, but I’m so close to calling it quits and just figuring out an airbnb or something for the next month. We’ve been married 7 years, but I truly feel so disrespected and like I don’t have a place. I feel like my opinion should be worth more than theirs when it has to do with my home, but my wife reminds me she pays more.

"Posting this on a new account for obvious reasons, and apologies in advance that this may be long and come across ranty in places, I guess I’d just like to hear other people’s take on this, and what they would consider doing about if it they were in my boots. If the title sounds like I’m being petty or immature, please reserve judgement until reading the full post. 

We have been together for almost 8 years, married for the last 2 and a little bit, I was her first partner ever and she was my first serious/regular partner. In the beginning our sex life &amp; sexual chemistry felt very good; despite the obvious challenges of both of us still living with our parents at this stage of our lives, it seemed that we had sex reasonably regularly - often trying new/different things (be that positions, toys, ways to pleasure each-other, etc) and key to this post she regularly &amp; enthusiastically gave me oral, which I enjoyed very much - to be honest more than actual sex. We would regularly send nudes to each other/sex when apart. 

However since buying our own place together and getting married our sex life seems to have just gone progressively downhill to the point I am at now. I first noticed I was feeling dissatisfied probably at least 4 years ago and it has been a source of friction that rears its head several times a year ever since. Basically she has gradually stopped initiating anything, become less adventurous, started outright refusing to do anything with her mouth and has just generally made me feel less and less wanted or desired in a sexual way on her behalf. Every now and then we will have a huge argument about it and things will improve slightly for a while but then will gradually tail off to what feels worse each time than before, to the point we are at now - where even though the frequency is not downright horrible, probably once or twice every 2 weeks (don’t get me wrong I would like it to be much higher and see no reason it shouldn’t be), it just feels SO mundane and low effort on her part, pretty much the same routine every time, totally unwilling to do any position other than missionary (even when our sex life has been less than ideal over the last few years this want the case then). It just totally feels scripted &amp; like going through the motions every time we do it 

This all upsets me very much but it’s a really big deal to me that she won’t give me oral (I do for her probably 9 times out of 10 we have sex) at all, and if I ever bring this up she is really belittling towards me and makes out that I am making a big deal out of nothing. She won’t even entertain talking about why not, just giving the reason she ‘doesn’t like it any more’, she won’t reason about it or listen to my feelings and I feel like she makes me feel stupid for being so bothered. The thing is, I am bothered and I am started to really resent her for it. I feel sad, hurt &amp; angry all in one - sad &amp; hurt that I feel unwanted/rejected, and angry that I feel so badly like I am missing out on something I enjoy so much, that everybody else (as in my friends/workmates, not everybody else in the world lol) gets from their partners without issue. I try to ignore it but every time I don’t think of it for a while, the next time it starts getting me down it just seems to be worse and last even longer before I get over it for a while again.

I love my wife but I can’t lie, I am terrified of being sat here 10 years down the line, nearly 40 and having wasted the best years of my life to be in the same or an even worse position. We are very compatible in other ways but this is a huge deal for me as much as I try to suppress it. It sounds pathetic but I just want to feel as though she gets as excited about me as I do about her but it just feels as thought she has become more and more indifferent toward anything sexual. 

I have considered being unfaithful in the past when I have been having feelings similar to this, not that I have ever made any serious attempt to be, but I do worry that I will invest more and more of the best years of my life into this and nothing will change in how either of us feel just for me to end up resenting her &amp; this relationship and either leaving or cheating when I can’t take it any more. What are my options/what would you do? I love her &amp; I have invested a lot in building a life together but this strain at times feels unbearable. 

TLDR; mine and wife’s sex life has been getting progressively worse to where it is now over the past few years. To the point where she seems totally uninterested/indifferent to sex even when we do have it. Refuses to give oral but used to do this frequently &amp; this is a big deal for me, makes me feel stupid &amp; like I am missing out on what others have.",What next?

he moved into an apartment around his birthday so I got him a microwave, toaster, silverware etc.

his most recent birthday I got him an at home golf set because he recently became obsessed with golf, it cost more than expected but I was happy to give it to him.

Our first Christmas together he gave me a video game and the money he owed me. For my birthday he got me another video game.

My birthday and Christmas is coming up (same day) I bought him a signed Steelers football because that’s his favorite nfl team, he just told me the gift he got me and this might be dramatic but I had to stop myself from crying.

He went on a solo vacation earlier this year and my ""birthday present"" is that he printed the pictures from his vacation and put it in a photo book. This is his gift to everyone his mom, sister, brother, friends and me. He mentioned it before and I politely told him I did not want that gift. I actually told him I would hate it and he laughed it off.

I've been telling him since we started dating that I like jewellery and would love that as a gift. He tells me he hates going into jewellery stores and more recently a couple days ago said ""you already have so much jewellery why would I buy you more?"".

"Husband sounds flirty with certain coworker

Me (37F) and my husband (36M) have been married 7 years this May. We know each other inside and out at this point and we have a generally healthy relationship. However - he started a new job a little over a year ago. His work is very people oriented so it’s normal he talks to a bunch of people - but a certain coworker calls him probably once or twice a day. He is a loud person but on these calls he talks very quiet, and mostly just giggles like when he hears a dirty joke almost the whole phone call. Maybe I’m crazy but my husband has like a naughty laugh he ONLY uses with sexual stuff. 

He doesn’t have the time to carry on a whole relationship with someone - but something is off. He’s been working from home for the holidays and talks to probably 10 different people per day. Most calls are just normal work stuff, but a certain coworker he doesn’t name who “helps him” calls him. These calls are just weird because nothing my husband says sounds related to work, mostly just “thank you for all your help this week”, 2 minutes of him not saying anything but having naughty giggles - then all he says after giggling is “I just can’t thank you enough for your help”.

It’s been a few months and these calls have been itching at me - we are close enough we can have talks but I can’t seem to ask him head on. This week the calls are so weird and frequent I’ve just walked through the room, he knew I was upset and got very defensive.

"So this has been bothering me for quite long evidently, we have been in relationship for nearly a decade. And we got into relationship in early college days because we both were physically very compatible and were extremely passionate about sex and it was one of the main foundation of our relationship. We had a very good time but since the beginning of 2022, we have not had sex. We are working professionals living far away from our native city (we belong to same city). We have gone through long conversations regarding this, she is loyal, wants to marry me but her family doesn't like my kind. Regardless of this, she has stood by me against all odds. But a sudden stoppage of intimacy has taken a huge toll on me mentally. Regarding this, she has said that she been through a lot of stress relating to work and family. She said that this will get fixed in time by itself. But it has been more than a year of me patiently waiting, and when it comes to physical intimacy, things have not moved one bit. We dont kiss, touch, caress anymore. We sleep in same bed and Nothing happens, it just messes up my mind. 

Now due to this, frustrations are building inside me and that leads to mild arguments time to time. And due to those occasional arguments, things are goijg downhill in a vicious circle where whenever i express my concern, it turns into a case of me not understanding her situation, and further leading to nowhere.

I understand that she may have lost interest in these as things in her life is stressful. But also I am losing my mind slowly and I can't seem to understand if I'm wrong to be longing for a intimate moment. I dont know what to from here at this point.

There is no affair angle as far as I know, I don't know how to carry on like this anymore.

"Wife (40F) continuously gaslights me (41M), never takes accountability and never apologizes for anything

My (41M) wife (40F) and I had a disagreement in February because we were going to go on a cruise in 2024 and needed somewhere for our daughter (4) to stay. She randomly told me that she wanted to leave her with our daycare provider for the 2 week cruise. I told her that I didn’t know how I felt about it and wanted to think about it. The next day she said I was controlling and made her feel stupid because I didn’t trust her opinion. I said I just wanted to think about it and look at the options because I felt like it was a lot for our provider to do for a trip we were choosing to go on. She said she wanted a divorce the next day and she went and filed papers. I told her that if it’s what she wanted I will sign the papers. After she filed papers I mentally moved on and lost love for her and began starting to live my new life and started being happy about my future w/o her. After about 2 months of us being separated she told me she only wanted the divorce because she felt like it’s what I wanted (I have never mentioned divorce ever). 

So in May she wanted to move back in and I wasn’t ready for that yet but felt I didn’t have a choice. We talked and decided to work on things. I lost a lot after the situation and wasn’t attracted to her like I had been in the past and had very little hope we could get past it. I put in work to gain my feelings back which did happen over the summer and I reinvested in the marriage though was struggling with the attraction but I was working on it.  

In September I asked for some help I didn’t ever have any free time but I only asked if I could sleep in every now and then because I get up with our daughter everyday so she can sleep because she works night shift. This turned into an argument and I rarely if ever raise my voice but when she called me lazy I didn’t scream but I raised my voice in frustration. She said I have some audacity, called me lazy, said she was leaving again. When she called me lazy it hit a spot as I work full time and 5-10 hours of overtime a week, I serve our church usually 2-3 days a week, I am a full time student, keep the yard mowed and neat, and have our daughter on my days off and most of the time during the week (I don’t consider this a chore just stating how it takes up a lot of time and prevents me getting a lot of other and extra things done around the house). I tried explaining my point of view to no avail.  

After about two weeks of no contact she wanted to talk and I obliged. During this time she pointed out all the things I do wrong and has never apologized for any of her actions throughout the year. She has me questioning my reality and making me think I am a terrible husband but wanted to try and work it out. Every time we talk she makes me feel terrible about myself and basically says our marriage is being ruined by me.  She distorts reality and when she came home in May it was to “give me another chance”. I don’t know what I should do I feel emotionally abused, exhausted, defeated,and like I am the world’s worst husband. I have my flaws and I accept them as she continually points them out and have been working to be better but she never acknowledges that I am working on them. When I point out her flaws which I do in a very very mild way so she does t flip out ( I feel like I walk on eggshells and can’t truly say how I feel) she turns things around on me to say she does the flaw because of something I have done in the past. 

I have lost hope but feel like I am stuck in a trauma bond. For the record I am not ugly and am in excellent shape I’ve been working out for two years lost some weight because she called me fat and disgusting (her words).

"I’m a 25yr old female, and I’ve been with this guy, a 22yr old male, for a little over a year now. We met online in a video game chat room, talked for a few months before getting together and instantly clicking. Things were perfect. We never had any big problems, any time we had an issue we’d get together and talk, address the issue, find ways to fix it and work through it. I’ve been to family events, we used to see each other weekly (we live about an hour away from each other), everything was just magical. Then, he asked me if he could move in and I said yes. We spent over a week preparing; buying things, remodeling the apartment, and him bringing things over. The day he moved in and he told his family, they flipped out and blamed everything on me. I’m a manipulator. I’m a bad influence. He’s too immature for a relationship because he’s not thinking. On and on and on. Mostly his mom, his dad just sat there. Despite this, he still moved in. I thought things were okay but I could tell he was off. The next day, he told me he was moving back home, and we were over. Out of nowhere. No warning. No signs. Nothing. He just left. After talking for a few days he decided he was being emotional and irrational, and we got back together, agreeing to make things work, even if his mom didn’t like us being together because “it’s my life and it’s my choice”, he said. For about a month after that, it was back to rainbows and butterflies. It was like the breakup had never happened. And then I found out I was pregnant. We got together and discussed what to do, what our options were, etc. Towards the end of the night I mentioned I was leaning towards keeping it and even though he was upset, he rubbed my belly and kissed me, telling me he loved me and promised he would be there with me through this. That we would make this work. Well..about four days later he sat his mom down and told her. After two hours of no communication from him on text, call, etc., he called me and told me he would be around to coparent, but didn’t want to be with me. When I asked for a reason, all he said was his mom doesn’t like the idea of us being together, and that he’s noticed he depends on me emotionally when he gets depressed, and that it was unhealthy. Once again we sat down and spoke. I explained that a partnership is a codependency as well as a friendship, and that it’s healthy to depend on each other sometimes, that we’re allowed to build each other up. That it’s okay to want a hug from me or to hear my voice when he’s sad. That we’re having a child now, and if anything this is even more reason for us to try. He agreed, said he does love me and he does want us to work, but his mom doesn’t like me, that she comes first, and that he’s scared and doesn’t know if he’s ready. We are back together now, but he’s being distant with me, and as much as I love him I’m scared of letting my guard down again. I want to give my current partner the opportunity to be a father like he said he wants to be, and to prove his word of staying by me, but I don’t know if I can deal with constantly being blamed for his choices, being put behind his mom, and him never defending me and making choices about our life based on what she wants. (Example: he accused me of baby trapping him because his mom told him the ring, our form of contraception, “doesn’t just fail”, and didn’t believe me when I said it’s only got a 93% success rate and contributed that as a reason for us to break up.) I love this man, so much. I want so much for us to work, and I want to believe him when he says he’ll stay with me, and be a father to this child that he now wants me to have.

"I am beside myself. My boyfriend of 7 years has apparently been cheating on me for 2 years. We live together and he’s paying for my master’s degree. I don’t have a job currently. My family is 1000 miles away.

So, what happened was the other day I got a Facebook message from a college aged girl. The message started out with her apologizing and saying she didn’t know about me until recently and that she felt very bad. Then it moved on to trash talking my boyfriend for putting us both through this and then it moved to an explanation of what happened.

I’m 29f and my boyfriend is 28m. My boyfriend and his friends from college have been getting together every couple of months and driving to a state university where one of their friends is going to medical school.

I was told they drink, watch sports etc. I’ve seen him hang out with these people before and that’s what they seem to enjoy doing, so I never questioned it.

My boyfriends has never given me a reason not to trust him.

Also, most of the guys are married. Some have kids. Given this, I didn’t even think that they would be interacting with college girls. 

Come to find out that he met a girl while there. I saw her profile- she’s pretty, seems nice. He message to me was very kind, honestly.

He would meet up with her and do whatever. Eventually they would end up having sex. He would see her each night he was there. 

Some of his friends cared and told him that he was an asshole and other friends of his didn’t seem to care at all.

Keep in mind that all of his friends know me. We all went to college together. I’m friends with their wives and girlfriends as well. 

The girl told me that when they didn’t see each other they would text and sext. This went on for 2 years until some how she found out about me and all hell broke loose.

There were some things that she told me that made me think that he really cared about her. She told me he told her about trips he went on. How would she know that if everything was a fling?

She told me about a photo he sent her that he also sent me of something he was proud of. Fling?!

She told me that she would never speak to him again and she wished me well. 

She also told my boyfriend to stop contacting her.

I saw in the screenshots that she sent me that he was being very apologetic to her. Feeling sorry to have upset her. He even said to her, “You’re such a nice person. I wish I never involved you in this.”

My boyfriend doesn’t know which one of his friends betrayed him so on top of spiraling, he’s paranoid.

My life has been shattered. We have been together 7 years. We were going to be engaged in a few months. He has a ring. We were supposed to be engaged months ago and I don’t know if she’s been the hold up?

He insists that it only happened a few times. That he never cared about her. I wanted to know every detail but I know that this has been really awkward for the girl and all she was trying to do was the right thing.

My instinct tells me that he has a sadness for her though. No matter what he says. I feel like he loves her.

I don’t know what to do?

UPDATE:

I’m moving out, but not back home. I started applying for jobs yesterday. I haven’t told him this yet. He has promised to cut off all of his friends except for one? He said none of the other guys cheated. He said he was going with the moment and was being stupid. Typical stuff cheaters say, I presume.

He admitted to liking the girl a lot, but he’s saying that it wasn’t a relationship. He told me that the actual sex only happened a few times? He’s trying to make it sound like it was less of a big deal. I’m still thinking that he’s in love with her and that’s why he’s playing it down so much.

He knows that I am likely to leave and that she’s never speaking to him again. He’s panicking. ",Boyfriend 28m Cheated On Me 27f For 2 Years,18n5bya,1703106676.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n5bya/boyfriend_28m_cheated_on_me_27f_for_2_years/,
"I 21M and my gf 21F have been dating for around 8 months now. I a concerned I made the wrong choice by breaking up with her last night. Here's the story.

  
In the beginning, she was pretty ""ok"" about jealousy. I had a female friend for a long time who I considered to be a good friend. She did not like that and I understand it is uncomfortable to some people so I blocked her and her friends so they couldn't contact me, per my gfs wishes. She would always ask me if I was talking to other girls, if girls tried to talk to me in school, literally anything involving a girl (even if I would hold a door or do any act of kindness I would normally do for a human regardless of gender) she would get upset. Recently it has spiraled out of control. She searched through my phone while I was sleeping and read texts messages and scrolled up back to 2018 to find pictures and texts from me and past people I have been with to try and make herself feel better? Idk. Just everything that involves a woman even if it's someone I knows gf, she gets upset at me just for being around them. Throughout this relationship I've severed a lot of ties, unfollowed every woman on social media, I honestly haven't even talked to any woman unless it was absolutely neccecary for school or ordering food or buying something. But still, the jealousy persists about my past.

  
I will admit I did hangout with one of my exes about a week after I first met my gf. When she found this out, she got very very upset. When I did hangout with my ex, we didn't do anything (nothing sexual, no touching, nothing at all). That has been an ongoing problem throughout our relationship. I have caught my gf texting men and saying unusual things and texting her exes months into us being together vs me hanging with an ex less than a week after I met her. Im sorry if this all sounds confusing, I'll clarify anything you guys ask. Im just kind of torn about all of this because I really do love my gf.

  
Any advice here would be much appreciated. I broke up with her yesterday after she flipped on me for having an ex gf before her. My gf told me she would NEVER stop being jealous and either I have to learn to deal with it or we break up.

I met my boyfriend [25M] 2 years ago and he's a huge breath of fresh air compared to my last 2 boyfriends who constantly raped and abused me. He's funny, smart, very caring, and sweet. I even heard he's planning on proposing to me in 2 weeks from a friend of his.

The issue throughout our relationship is his brother. My brother is a respectful Democrat but his brother is extremely far right and msygnostic. He would frequently make fun of me and implied that my beauty is the only reason why he's with me. He even tried groping me 2 times and I quickly knocked him away.

I talked tonmy boyfriend and his parents about his behaviour but the issue is that they think this is an issue in which we need to get along and work together. It's gotten to the point where our christmas party in 2 weeks was meant to just be us and his parents.

However, his brother invited himself and my boyfriend is just telling me to play nice and work on the issues between us together or stay home. I understand that his blood family always ranks above girlfriend's and wives but it's getting sickening about how his brother harasses and bothers me.

"Hey everyone, so basically, I [19M] started staying at my [24M] friends house for the past 2 months, he has a girlfriend, and she has a [18F] sister, let's call her Amy.

Until about a month ago, Amy and I didn't really speak much, until one night, we both just started breaking the ice with eachother, we spoke in the lounge until about 2 in the morning even though she had finals at 8 the next morning.
From there, we'd been starting to speak more gradually, we'd basically speak in the lounge while watching movies or whatever until 12-2 in the morning, we realised we both have quite a lot in common, we have the same personality type, have a fair amount of interest in common, I've started teaching her how to cook, she even started watching football with me and seems really into it. 

At the time, I had been a month out of my 3 year relationship, so I wasn't really looking to getting into anything as I was still quite hurt from everything. 

While speaking in the lounge until late, I've noticed her body language is really towards me if that makes sense, she faces my way and brushes her hair a lot, not sure if that means anything though. She asked me why I stayed up so late, I told her it's nice speaking to her, she said it's mutual.

Shortly after, I found her Instagram account and saw she has a boyfriend, so I was a bit confused to be honest. She did bring him up not too long after that, so it's not like she was planning on hiding him from me. She saw him for that weekend, and before, she mentioned she didn't really feel like seeing him, since they hadn't seen eachother for 3 months, and their texts were one worded. 

Fast forward to last week, I went out to a club with my friend, his gf and Amy. When we got just above tipsy I noticed she started having more physical contact, such as playfully hitting me and things like that, which she doesn't normally do. This is where things started becoming really confusing to me, so my friend and his sister decided to go home, with the car, so we stayed there a bit longer. When we did decide to leave I asked Amy if she wanted to Uber, she said she would prefer walking (which was a 30 minute walk at 2). We started walking and we randomly started holding hands, she asked if it's weird, I just said no it's all good. Maybe it was because she was drunkish or scared I'm not sure, but the fact that she has a long distance relationship boyfriend and did that started making me ask questions. 

And what makes me question it more, she has a male friend who likes her, and especially recently he has been seeing her more and visiting, he admitted to liking her 2 weeks ago, she told him she doesn't like him and has a boyfriend, they agreed to continuing being friends, and shortly he came over and we were watching a movie with the family, and he was sitting next to her, and was holding her leg, I saw she was uncomfortable. She told me the next day that she didn't know what to do in that situation, and she was very uncomfortable with everything, which makes me wonder why she wasn't uncomfortable with holding my hands for 30 minutes, maybe just the alcohol?

We've still been speaking for the past week, and didn't bring up anything about holding hands, so I'm not sure what to do with that, because I feel like I want to know from her why she did that, but I don't want to ask her directly because it might make things awkward between us, so I'm trying asking her if how her boyfriend would feel about the situation by starting the conversation.

I am only in contact with a few, but one of them messaged me several days ago and I have yet to respond because my boyfriend says he “is only interested in screwing me”. I have never been unfaithful, whereas he has cheated on me a handful of times :/.

"So, long story short, I met this girl, let's call her Julie, 16 years ago at University, she was dating one of my house mates, I would hang out with both of them, or sometimes just me and Julie where we would get some food and watch a movie or something.

So I've stayed in touch with both of them over the years, spending time with both of them, either together or separately, there was a few times where they split up for a few months but would eventually get back together, until a few years ago when they split up for good.

My mate met a new girl on Tinder, and they just got married back in September, he's moved further away now and we don't stay in touch as much now.

At this point, the last time I had met up with Julie, was 3 years ago, she has since been in a relationship with a guy, that is now over, and we are both single.

I hadn't really talked to her this year as I found the whole situation awkward, especially with me going to the wedding, so at Halloween I went on holiday for a week, as I was sitting in the airport on my way home, she texted me out of the blue, just saying it's been so long, how have I been?

And we've basically been messaging every day or so since.

After a couple of days of texting, I say we should meet up again soon, she agree's straight away, and we go about organising something, she lives nearly 60 miles away, so we agree to meet somewhere in the middle and go for a hike in a park then get some dinner afterwards.

So we meet up on a Saturday afternoon for the hike, spend a couple of hours walking and talking, it gets dark so we head to the nearest town for some food, have a lovely meal, spend another few hours chatting and laughing, then we spend a bit of time in my car chatting and listening to music, then I walk her back to her car, we hug goodnight and she leaves.

A few weeks later, she sends me a voice message, asking me to meet up again, this time just for dinner (at a place in the same town as last time, that she wanted to go to but was too busy), I agree and we get everything organised, a few days later we meet up at the restaurant and have just the best time, laughing the whole 2 hours we were at the restaurant.

The bill comes and she offers to pay, ""I'll get this one!' she says, then we leave and go for a walk, we eventually end up at a bar nearby, where we spend another 2 hours chatting, much more serious though, she opens up about the relationship with her ex (my mate), how it didn't start off well as unknown to her, he was still seeing his ex, and that he proposed to her twice during their relationship.

Anyway, we left the bar and I walked her back to her car, then she drove me back to mine, we chatted a bit, then I left.

We have arranged another 'date' in January to go and see a show in a city closer to me.

We have also talked about travelling together, going away for the weekend somewhere.

So at this point, I'm not sure what this 'relationship' is? I think now we are the closest we've ever been, certainly I felt some attraction between us during the last 'date', I'm just worried about making the first move when she's not ready, or it's not what she wants?

"So to add some context my (25f) parents came to visit us a few hours away from where they live last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. We had dinner at my bf’s (28m) mom’s and everything went well. They didn’t want to come for Thanksgiving this year because they came last year and wanted to spend it at home. Not to mention it is a little awkward for them because my bf’s family barely talks to them or has conversations with them while they’re around. They ended up not coming for Thanksgiving and my bf’s mom took it *very* personally and asked me if they were mad at her. My parents honestly have way too much going on to be mad at her and I barely feel like they care about what I’m even doing most of the time, so I tried to explain she doesn’t need to take it personally. Also, she never explicitly invited my family over and just assumes they’ll come to visit for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Now the issue is Christmas. They were planning on coming up here, but as of last week they cancelled for numerous reasons. I guess my bf’s mom texted him this morning to ask if they were coming and she apparently got really upset when he said they weren’t. I didn’t see exactly what she said, but my bf suggested maybe getting an AirBnB close to my parent’s house so his family can visit mine next year for the holidays. I already know my family is not going to want to accommodate or cook for that many people when they barely celebrate the holidays as it is. 

Is it normal for your partner’s parents to go over to the other’s house for holidays? I’ve never seen this expected of the parents of any other couples I know.

21F 37M I want this to be real but not sure if I’m being naive. Advice please? Am I overthinking?


He told me when we met he wants family, marriage.  And this has always been something he seems to bring up. He’s buying a home 
We are long distance and meet once a month but text everyday. He was my first kiss, I have never been with another man.

We started dating in 2020 but had a break after a year as I was not in a good situation with my mental health, I had anxiety which I was unaware of and I think I was still in child mindset rather than a woman.
We started dating again in 2022. He always tells me he loves me, he is very sweet and helpful with any problem I have. I feel so safe and he acts like a little kid around me. I forget the age difference.
I used to go to his apartment in lockdown but now he books us a hotel when we meet. This is the only red flag I can think of… I am wondering if he is doing it because a hotel is nicer.. he says there is construction on his apartment. But maybe he doesn’t want to take the relationship to the next level? Maybe he is dirty? I have no idea

I ask him if he is serious about a future with me.  don’t want to waste my time and end up alone if he decides he doesn’t want me. He tells me he planned for the future in the past with marriage etc. and things didn’t work out and he ended up in therapy.  He explained to me before he doesn’t get excited for things to prevent being disappointed. 

I would love for him to atleast talk about how our future  together will be but he doesnt show interest.. perhaps it’s a girl thing.. or maybe the age difference? 

I do trust him and I do love him very much. He is pretty nerdy which I love. He plays video games and works so hard. He is perfect in every way but I have not met his family, I have seen pictures.

His family are very close and he looks after his mom and sisters. He told me before he wouldn’t introduce a girl to his family until he was ready to marry them. I haven’t met them yet and he puts off meeting mine.
Please tell me what you think from this scenario.

And no he is not married!

"Having problems with a person who lives with me.

I’m a 24f, I can’t tell you how old this person is, but they’re a little older. He’s a ?m.
We have been living together for a while now and of course in 2018 we all went through Kundalini Awakening. Of course. And so ever since then, not that I wasn’t having problems with this person before, but things just changed and they still weren’t good.
Last night I was struggling with this dude. He makes coughing sounds that I know aren’t real, and he makes sounds like a girl, just to get on my nerves.
I had similar problems with this person, I have posted about before, we have two bathrooms and every time I went to the bathroom he would go to the other bathroom in our place that is only divided by a wall. Ok. That issue has been resolved but of course not the entire problem.
I’ve told him before, dude you need to stop. I know you don’t have a cold. And now we basically have coughing battles.
I’m in a good headspace right now but I have resorted to Reddit because that’s what I did for the bathroom problem. Clearly, obviously someone trying to get on my nerves and lying about it.
So when I fight back for a few days by also coughing every time he fakes coughing, then he comes to me with coughing medicine and says, “I have a cold so I bought some cough medicine, I’ve noticed you’ve been coughing as well.” I say sure, maybe I have a little cold because it’s December and that’s why I can’t take or stand your incredibly off antics.
So we share this cough medicine… yet it doesn’t help the coughing.
I have had problems with this person so severe, and the only relief I’ve had was this year in January when my boyfriend and I could get away for a month.

Here’s the thing. I’m tired of having cough battles with this person day in and day out. Last night the problem I was having was that I couldn’t go 10 seconds without coughing back at this person without him coughing or making a girly sound and it makes me feel degraded. Just to know that he’s clearly faking it and doing it to bother me and won’t stop doing something he doesn’t need to be doing solely because I have asked him to stop.
So, thanks for letting me rant. It’s a real cough battle. And I’ve reached the point many times when it has actually made me sick, I’ve also reached the point many times when I’ve coughed enough and I don’t want to cough back at him anymore, I just want him to stop. It’s not a fun game, leave me alone. You need to effing shut up, no one can work like this. And of course I would never let someone actually degrade me like this, or do anything to degrade me.
Am I coughing back to degrade him? No, I just don’t know what else to do. It helps to not feel extremely intruded upon, by a stupid lie, to cough back. But obviously I don’t want to cough back, it could make me sick.

I haven't been truly happy in this relationship for a long time. I find myself biting my tongue on things we disagree about because i don't want to start a fight. I find myself ignoring my own hobbies because she'll ask me to do things, and if i don't do them right away she gets mad at me. I've found myself just starting to go through the motions, and I'm just not happy with the way things are. I think I want to be single.

The problem is, I know she couldn't afford this apartment on her own. She's deeply in love with me, and we've talked about marriage and kids down the road. It's really not too bad, its good enough, but I still find myself wanting and wishing I was single so i could have time to figure out what I want and how I want to live my life. 
Part of the problem is that I feel too old to begin a new relationship. I feel guilty about wanting to leave her when she's so in love with me. I feel guilty wanting to leave when we've both invested so much into this relationship. I find myself wondering, what if nobody else loves me like this? What if this is the best relationship I get? What if, in 10 years, i look back on this and regret ending things? It's easy for me to overlook the negatives when I think about those what ifs. I just need advice on how to move forward, how to handle this situation, how to love myself again. Ultimately, I think our life goals just don't align. I haven't really been able to talk to her about any of this because I don't want to hurt her. I don't want the veneer of the ""perfect relationship"" to crack. Her parents love me. Her friends like me. It's just hard to imagine hurting all these people for something I'm not certain about. It's made harder by the fact that there's nothing really ""wrong"" with the relationship, I just feel this sense of unease and like I feel myself slipping away.

"Background info, we've been dating for 2 and hung out for 3-4 months before that. Basically, found out a few days ago she hooked up with her ex (which they continued to talk and text as ""friends"" after we started hanging out) 2 weeks before we'd gotten together. My friends told me about it but I didn't think much because they'd dated 4 years before as freshman's. My problem is that she had told me before we got together she hadn't hooked up with anyone in a year. I found out later she had a one night stand a month before that, which it was my own fault for not talking to her at the time. I'd known she had a crush on me. Then later found out about her ex. When she told me this, I called her out on her lie. She said it was a one time thing and it was weird and established it wouldn't happen again. My issue is why say that in the first place that you hadn't hooked up with anyone? It made me look stupid cuz I denied everyone else telling me there was something going on with her and her ex. And then continue to text after. Another issue I have is that she was crazy about a girl that thought was hooking up with me (which I wasn't), but that girls ex boyfriend is also my currents gf's ex. So basically she caused a lot of issues with this girl she thought was hooking up with me but she was the one hooking up with that girls ex. Is this break up worthy or am I being overdramatic? She just doesn't seem as wifey to me anymore, however I do know for sure that she has been loyal to me since we got together.

"We were high school sweethearts, I was 15 (F 41) and he was 16 (M 42). We have 3 beautiful children 18, 15 and 11. For the first time in our relationship, this year was the worst and we almost got divorced. At the beginning of the year we were shifting apart, not being interested in each other and almost no intimacy and communication. It rock bottomed when I discovered that he was having a secret online relationship with a young woman from another country, that we met when we travelled to her country. He promised her love, sent her money and was even telling her that his best life would be to find a way to be with her and our kids. I found all their communications and never has something hurt most than reading that. She lives in a country where people will just do and say anything to be able to immigrate, so I don’t believe she was really in love. This was in May. We tried to get back together this
June, but he never told me everything about his online relationship until I found the everyday conversations, pictures etc they sent each other. So I kicked him out, and he was begging me to take him back, assuring me that he was in a big middle life crisis. I took him back. We started therapy. Then, I have this gut feeling, I almost feel crazy, thinking that he still communicates with her. One night, at a family party he gets really drunk, and texts her in front of everyone. This time I was going for divorce, but he crumbles apart, posting on every social media that he doesn’t want to live anymore. With my help, as I have struggled with mental health for many years, he starts a therapy and medication and I accept to take him back as he shows a lot of positive changes.

"Help… 
I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half now. 
My boyfriend and I were exchanging some pretty naughty texts and sometimes he will refer to me in the third person as a bit of a cheeky joke (I.e. “need (name) to ___ me” [I know we’re cringe lol]) but this time, he said LIZ… which is not my name.
He knows I’m very insecure so he tried to cover up the mistake at first because he knew I’d have a bad reaction to it (i definitely cried) but after I kept prying about who Liz is, he told me it was short for his ex’s name.
I don’t doubt that he’s sorry as he sent me many many heartfelt messages apologizing to me and feeling down on himself for letting himself slip up that badly, saying he can’t imagine being with anyone but me, and he’s adamant that he was not thinking of her and that it was a cognitive/muscle memory/brain fart type of mistake as he would do the same referring to her in third person thing when they were together. The thing I’m struggling to understand is how he could have been not thinking of her but typed her name. I asked him if he was actively ‘doing the deed’ so to speak and he says no which is at least some peace of mind knowing that he wasn’t actively pleasuring himself and accidentally typing her name… 
Does anyone have experience with this?? Could he really have not been thinking of her?

"My best friend is a very opinionated guy. I love him and love having conversations with him, but if I ever disagree about anything I can't say anything without him thinking I'm arguing with him. I try my best to stay light about it, I keep a level tone because there's no reason I'd be angry, I occasionally say ""I agree about x but I'm curious about why you feel y"" so he knows I'm not just saying he's wrong about everything. 

Despite this, he gets increasingly frustrated and snaps back about everything, and then tells me to stop arguing and says we're never gonna agree about it and that I'm being antagonistic. I told him I'm not arguing with him and he says ""You literally are"" and then yells at me if I say anything else after that. 

I don't understand why he feels we can't discuss anything without it being an argument. These are topics I'd have NO reason to argue with him over (they arent political. It's about movies or games or people we know) and I just want to talk about why he sees them the way he does and why I feel differently. I don't get why he gets so heated. But discussion is an important thing to me and I enjoy seeing things differently.

"We're coming up on our 6 year anniversary and I just feel so sad and lonely in this relationship. We've had a lot of ups and downs in life, and we both come from traumatic family backgrounds. 

We are also both Autistic, and I have ADHD. 

We met at work and got married after dating a year. Our marriage was more one of convenience, though both of us love each other. We got the paperwork and signed it, no fanfare. I feel like I had to beg him for a ring because that kind of stuff matters to me, and we ordered one, but he never made a big deal about it, and it was like I ordered some socks. 

Our relationship feels mostly at odds. I love holidays and birthdays, I love celebrating the moment, I'm a very creative and passionate individual, and I am a people pleaser (from traumatic background). He doesn't care about any of that, and it's like pulling teeth to get him involved in things I like. I feel that I am often compromising to what he wants because he is very stubborn. Whether its food, games, movies and tv, it almost always feels like its more something he wants. If I make a big deal about it, he just talks about the last time he did compromise for me, and I just come away feeling angry and upset because its like he always has a reason and it's hard to argue with. If I continue to make a big deal about it, like I really want something, he eventually gives in but its very low effort and it makes me feel horrible, like I'm just forcing him. I talk to him about it a lot and eventually every 6 months or so, I have a big breakdown about how awful I feel. I talk about how unfair our relationship feels and how I feel my needs are not being met, and things get better for a few weeks, but then he always slips back into the same old habits. I once had to tell him I feel more like his mom then his wife. I know I am an overly caring individual, and taking care of others is how I show love. But it feels like he just takes that for granted. I want to be cared for and pampered too, but if I have to ask for it, it loses its meaning and it just feels fake.   

Even our sex life is at odds, I am more of a kinky individual, and he is very vanilla. I've talked about how unsatisfied I am in the nicest way possible, and gave lots of examples of things we can try, and we are sort of trying new things. But mostly he blames the fact that I can't be satisfied on me, because it takes effort for me to be satisfied. We also live in a roommate situation, and neither of us like being intimate when they are home bc I am very loud, so we have rare opportunities to be intimate.  

Lately we have both been very stressed, I lost my job in June and haven't been able to find another one yet. He is finishing his Bachelors, and does have a job lined up in January. His stress often becomes my stress as I am very empathetic, and we both struggle with emotional regulation. So we've been mostly sexless, stressed, and feeling really strung out by life. We live in a very expensive state, and we're both really worried about our future living situation, as our roommates plan to split off at the end of our lease in August. He wants to live with more friends, I really do not because it puts a strain on our relationships (us and our friends). 

I feel like were always just on the cusp of things getting better, that things will start to be fixed once we're financially stable and have our own space. We can start living the way we want to. But right now I'm kinda miserable and have been considering leaving more and more. But I am scared, because it could still get better, and I don't want to leave the best thing that's happened to me. I know marriages take work, and that life has a lot of ups and downs (mostly downs for us lately). Marriage is about choosing to love someone, not just some happily ever after.

"I’ve been seeing my boyfriend seriously since 2020. I went away for two months on a paid artist residency. We visited each other on weekends sometimes over the two months. He complained about how much he missed me very often. I’d been living with him before I left for the residency. He has been telling me how much he wants me to fully move in with him (move all my stuff to his house). 

I got back from the residency 10 days ago. I noticed that over the last few days he kept suggesting I go back to my hometown to visit with my niece for a couple days. I didn’t want to do any more traveling but then I noticed that he had suggested I go back home for a couple days about 4 times. He then said last night that he needed alone time and that’s why he had been saying that. I said that it hurt my feelings that he wanted me to leave for a couple days and how am I supposed to move in here if he pushes me to leave for different weekends. In the past, he has also wanted me to leave for multiple days for his alone time or if he has a friend coming to visit from out of town. I’ve done it in the past and he knows I don’t take it that well. I try to be understanding about his needs for alone time to decompress, but I feel like asking me to leave for multiple days is just hurtful to me. It feels like this really isn’t my house when he wants me to leave for multiple days for his alone time. Also I’ve been gone a couple months and it makes me sad that he wants me to go for a couple days. He said he has trouble getting used to living with someone after living alone for a while. 

I’m depressed about it all. After we discussed things last night, he took in my feelings and agreed with me last night but hasn’t texted to me all day, which is abnormal for us.

"I moved to a new city two years ago (3 hours from my hometown) after my mother died. My mother's best friend and her husband and I have always been close, and we got closer after my mother's death, we often say we're family because I've known them almost my whole life. This married couple are very frugal people and work paycheck to paycheck, and even though they built their own house a few years ago (with the help of loans), almost all the building materials were second hand (none of the doors and windows match), it's unpainted and all the plumbing + electrical was done by family. Suffice it to say, they are people used to having very little. I didn't grow up much better (only child of a single mother), but it wasn't as bad as them. I lived with my mom until she died.

Now I'm in a LCOL city (relatively) and my online business has picked up enough so I can support myself enough to not need financial help from anyone. Last year I planned a road trip for March 2024, giving me more than a year to save up what I need. I visit my hometown every few months, and when I do, I often take my married friends out for lunch on me. Last month we were talking on the phone and they mentioned they'd love to visit me here. I was ecstatic and we ironed out the dates (15-20 Dec). Fast forward to the end of their stay, I am gobsmacked at what they were like to have as guests and I'm feeling guilty for the events that unfolded:

1- Over their stay, we visited 5 restaurants (decided on as a group, also deciding whether to eat at home, fast food, or restaurants). I paid for everything. When the bill came, there was no conversation about splitting it, divvying up the activities, or any mention of money, and because I have anxiety and confrontation scares me, I just paid.

2- They didn't clean up after themselves, not even so much as a teaspoon. I was constantly cleaning up after them.

3- One of the activities they wanted to do was a carnival in town, which we did (again at my expense, they didn't even bring their wallets with). One of the stalls offered prizes and I gave my one friend (the equivalent of) $2, and she ended up winning the grand prize (a lucky draw) of $50. They then went to the casino and gambled it all away.

4- One day, I  wanted to bake their favourite muffins, but only needed an apple. The husband and I went to the store because he wanted some beers as well (which he paid for), but couldn't even offer to pay for the single apple I had (which sounds entitled, I know).

5- On the last day, we all woke up feeling under the weather. I went to the pharmacy to get medicine (not cheap as I don't have medical insurance), and it immediately became the communal medicine. Now 24 hours later I'm all out and need to go buy more.

6- On the second day, they bought a set of motorbike tyres for their son (understandable, he needed them) and a good mid-range movie projector for their house that costs half my rent, yet no effort was made to pay for anything else we did together.

7- We went everywhere in my car, and I had to refill gas twice with all the driving we were doing.

8- On the second day, I mentioned in casual conversation that business had been tough the last few months (I'm self-employed, so my income is irregular), and that if I didn't have my road trip savings, I wouldn't have made it. But luckily business in December has started to pick up again, so hopefully I won't have to cancel the trip. They responded with kind sentiments and shared that the husband had just gotten an annual performance bonus.

They left this morning and I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a messy house. It's hard to explain to people who don't know them, but they are literally the nicest people anyone I know has ever met. Like Mother Theresa. The kindest most selfless people out; no one can say a bad word about them. That's why this has shocked me so much. I know it's my fault for not speaking up, I just assumed they'd have some sort of self-awareness as some point. I feel like my trips back home and taking them out to lunch here and there has set a precedent that I'm rich, but I'm just terrified of the awkward money conversation. How do I ensure this never happens again?

"Boyfriend (45M) of 5 years and I (40F) have had a rocky relationship and after him breaking us off multiple times, I finally walked away.  He came back in a big way, after having had months of therapy (and continuing therapy), saying and doing a lot of what I previously had asked for.  He's really impressed me with his changes and effort.  He's quite a goodlooking man and very smart and accomplished.

We decided to try again a couple months ago.  We've been making nice plans for the holidays.  I feel a bit differently than I used to though.  I seem to be less physically attracted -- before I thought he was the hottest man on earth, now he looks quite worn to me.  I notice things I didn't before.  

Also, his jokes annoy me much more than they used to.  He was never that funny, only rarely, but he'd often make sexual jokes like if there was a package to pick up he'd say, ""I'd pick up the package, and maybe later you can too"".  I used to think they were kind of weird but would try to play along, however now I feel grossed out by them and don't have it in me to entertain them, I'll just kind of change the subject.

I know I definitely still care for him.  I guess I'm wondering if these signs might mean I'm over it? I want to build something, my love life is the area of my life I most want to improve as everything else is going great.  But I'm not sure if these might signify I'm over him? Appreciate any advice to help me clarify for myself! It's so hard.

TDLR: I (40F) am trying again with my previously fickle ex (45M) but I don't see him in the same way now.

"My fiance (30M) and I (26F) have been together for 3.5 years now and his sister (26F) has been a constant source of turbulence in our relationship. Some things she has done over the past few years:

1) Said I was “barking at her” 
2) Drunkenly yelled at me and my fiance to never show any PDA in front of her at her birthday in front of her friends 
3) Yelled at me separately which caused a panic attack for me and posted selfies 20 mins after I left their home crying 
4) Opened gifts I gave to my fiance 
5) Read my text messages with him 
6) Lied about things in front of his friends
7) Sharing things I told her in confidence to my future MIL who I barely know 
8) Makes constant condescending comments as “jokes”

Everytime I have taken these things as signs of immaturity and my fiance and I have sat down with her to understand why she acted a certain way and worked towards resolving things. 
In addition, my fiance has talked to her about not exhibiting this behavior since they’re super close and he would like for me and her to be friends. 

I’ve let bygones be bygones but now that we are engaged, she caused a scene on the day of both our families meeting and gave unsolicited advice ruining this important occasion. 

I am considering ending things with my fiance because although I’ve tolerated all of this I’ve told him that I cannot be friends with her and can only remain cordial and he is not ok with that and still wants us to pursue a friendship. I also question his parents and how they will treat me because they have created an entitled daughter who continues to behave this way.


 It is clear that one of two things is occurring:

1) My fiance is not communicating the gravity of the emotional toll this is taking on me 
2) She does not respect him enough to change. 

In either case I come from a dysfunctional family and I had hoped to build a better relationship with my in-laws and given his sisters personality and the lack of ability of my fiance to enforce boundaries and protect me I am ready to end things. He has promised me that he needs one last chance to communicate with her so she fundamentally understands but I am at my wits end and don’t have any capacity to wait.

"My husband needs to leave on a work trip days before Christmas. I said ok and told him I wasn't happy about the short notice and asked if he could ask work to give advance notice in the future. He told me there was nothing he could do and he already tried his best. I pushed him to see if there was anything he could've done differently, and eventually he said ""you just want the benefits [from this job] but not the cost."" Recently, we both agreed for me to quit my corporate job to pursue dream of writing professionally. It's only been 1 month and he's talking to me like I'm completely out of touch with the demands of corporate. He won't tell me what he means by saying ""you want the benefits"". It makes it sound like I’m demanding a lot from him and am using him? I am very confused and offended. I don’t know if I’m being overly sensitive. Should I drop this issue? How should I frame this issue so that he understands how upsetting this is to me?
 
Context:
 
My husband has sensitivity to imposing on others. He refuses to ask the cleaners what time they expect to arrive at our house because he thinks it will be harassing them. We work for the same company. We are both career driven people who have been promoted consistently throughout the years. He is one level above me. Despite our level difference (senior vs principal) I work with other principals, directors, and VPs, and I know that our company respects family considerations and it's up to him to set boundaries around when he will work and advanced notice for travel. Especially since we are both ranked top talent in the company for multiple years, I know that work bends over backwards to accommodate.
 
Some other details that increasingly boggle the mind:
- We both agreed to me quitting my job to pursue my dreams and eventually stay at home with the kids.
- I am not forcing him to be in his current job. 
- He enjoys his work and even if I didn't quit my job, he would still be in his current job. He is in fact so good at his job, he plays video games for 20% - 40% of the day depending on the week and still keeps management happy about his performance.
- We are thankfully well off. He frequently brags about having $2M put away. We have plenty of money after mortgage and expenses (even without me working). He makes $500k and I used to make $250k. We have a lot of savings.  
- I am expected to and gladly contribute thousands of dollars from my own savings for big fun expenses (such as trips to japan etc).
- We don't have kids yet. So we don't have to deal with any of that added stress.
- I do not put pressure on him to strive for the next level at work. He was recently promoted after all. I just let him be. 
 
We are planning on having kids soon. I have a lot of trauma about my parents physically and emotionally abusing me because I was a financial burden. What he said horrified me because our lives are so easy today. I can't imagine what would happen if we actually had to reckon with something difficult.

"My best friend and I (22F) met almost a year ago and became best friends about 8 months ago. Ever since establishing being best friends, we have gotten irrevocably closer each day. We love telling other people about our friendship and our favorite conversations are about how we became friends / going into detail about how special our relationship is. Both of us have never had someone we consider to be a platonic soulmate and it’s something we both consider the other.

We’ve had some pretty spiritual experiences together (involving some substances) and each time we come out of the high with the most inexplicable love for eachother. This is where my overthinking and confusion comes in. I’m pretty infamous for mistaking platonic feelings for romantic ones, but that’s with my guy friends. Also, i am very secure in the platonic love I have for my best friend. I don’t feel the need to misinterpret, I’m just curious about some things I’ve noticed. 

Whenever we talk about the love we have for eachother we continually mention that it is platonic, almost excessively so. For context, we are both queer women who almost exclusively date men at the moment. We change, shower, and go to the bathroom in front of eachother and pretty much have no boundaries in that sense. MANY of my friends have assumed we’re dating and even one of her flings was threatened by me. Whenever this happens, idk i feel like we drag out the convo and laugh ab it more that normal? Anyways, recently after one of our spiritual experiences, there were a couple of hours where I couldn’t tell if we were making intense eye contact bc of the high or bc she wanted to ****. A week later she randomly brought up how she’s so glad that we would never mistake our friendship for romance bc it’s happened in the past for her. It’s happened for me too so we talked a bit about how platonic our friendship is. This is when I brought up those couple of hours and said “yea for a sec during that I was worried that you thought we were gonna ****.” She went quiet for a sec (no idea if I imagined the pause or not) and went “oh haha yea I was worried ab that too”
Safe to say that we moved to a different convo after that, but still, it never makes anything awkward.

I just don’t know how to interpret the things I’ve noticed or if how we talk about being platonic is overcompensation Bc being the kind of best friends we are, it is a relationship, just a platonic one. We know and discuss how we’re meant to do life together, but am I crazy for thinking that she sees it as possibly romantic? (Ps. I don’t think it is, I’m just observant and noticed all this so gotta make sure I’m not insane",My best friend (22F) and I (21F) are strangely platonic,18n42f0,1703103348.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n42f0/my_best_friend_22f_and_i_21f_are_strangely/,

"I’ll start by saying, this is somewhat long distance (about 3 hours) and we’ve never met in person. She and I met online about 6 months so. She’d been going through a breakup with a toxic ex, I’d been going through a divorce. We talked daily just getting to know each other. We knew we were attracted to each other but neither of us was ready for a relationship. During that time I was trying to talk her through a lot of issues with her ex. He was pretty abusive and unhinged so she has a lot to deal with. I got her gifts when she was sad, a security system for her house (crazy ex), all kinds of stuff. I really enjoyed getting to know her and she said she enjoyed getting to know me, but there was always some emotional distance there though. She said she’s never been in a healthy relationship where she felt close with the other person even though that’s all she wants in the world. So of course it didn’t take too long before I started to feel like I was putting far more into the relationship than I’ve been getting out

Fast forward a bit, she’s been my gf for the last couple of months. I know it’s dumb, but I’d hoped that things would improve a bit afterwards. That maybe the label would change things for her but it hasn’t. She will often disappear for days at a time and not say anything at all. Make plans to call me and not follow through. Recently she was getting a small procedure done at her doctor’s office and was nervous about it. I offered to drive the 3 hours down there to be there with her and she accepted, so I was excited. Then her doctor got covid and had to reschedule. I asked if she wanted me to still come and we could hang out and she said yes. I told her to make sure her day was clear and she told me she would, but then filled up most of her day with work stuff and told me to just come after. I didn’t make a big deal and said ok. Booked a hotel, called off work, etc. She doesn’t text me the whole day of, but I’m thinking she’s just getting ready. Then while I’m 2 hours into the drive, she tells me she’s sick (which I’m still not sure I believe) and I should go back home. I wasn’t mad about what I’d put into it, I was just upset that it’s like the 2nd or 3rd time we’ve made legit plans that she didn’t follow through on. Monday night we texted for a while about a vacation I’ve been planning for us. It’s at the beginning of January. I asked her about a few things she might like so I can take care of them and she told me she’d get back to me. That was at like 9pm. I texted her Tuesday morning and then again at like 4 asking if she was ok and she just says “Hey!” I messaged her back to say hi immediately after and she hasn’t messaged me again as of posting this. 

I’ve told her that it doesn’t bother me if she’s really busy isn’t in the mood to talk for a couple days and needs space, but she needs to let me know. It would be the courteous thing to do, but also her ex has literally threatened to have her killed so I just need to know that she is actually ok. Sorry this is so long.

The girl (we'll call her Anna) found me on one of my social media accounts and asked if I was dating my BF. I told her that I was dating someone with that name but I wasn't sure it was the same person she was referring to. She replied by saying it's the guy in my profile picture. Anna told me they had been texting and being flirty for a couple of weeks now and that I had popped up on her feed as someone she may know. She told me she had confronted him and he told her that I was an ex who basically couldn't move on. I asked her to confirm his number and she sent a screenshot of there texts with his number visible. I was heartbroken and couldn't believe it. I cried and asked her to send me more then cried some more. I was so hurt. The timestamps and dates were from a week ago and he would text her right after talking to or hanging out with me. He told her she was amazing and it was the first thing he thought about when he woke up. He invited her on a getaway to a cabin. He called her beautiful and it hurt so much to read.

I of course confronted him and he attempted to play stupid and lie. He then tried to play it off like that wasn't what was going on and he was talking to her in a friend way. Basically tried to say I was reading into it wrong. I didn't let him convince me and told him I'm not stupid and I know what I'm reading. You can't play off a getaway invitation to a cabin as being friendly.

We ultimately talked about it last night and I told him that if it happens again I'm done because I don't deserve to be treated this way. Unfortunately, I'm feeling insecure and like I don't want to be vulnerable. I'm scared to open back up because what if it does happen again? I'll be even more hurt. I want to be able to run to him and hold him and tell him about my day. I want to trust him and know that I can turn to him, but this has really hurt me. This is the first relationship I've ever been in and I feel played because I was just telling my grandmother how I want to marry him while he was doing this to me. Sure things never got physical with them, but it's still cheating in my book. He was forming a relationship that was more than just friends with another woman.

Me and my gf live far away from eachother and can't meet all the time so sit together on call while doing numerous stuff such as homework or gaming, we spend alot of time together on call. We usually have a great time and we fun talking with eachother but whenever things get quiet for around 10 minuites she gets mad, and I mean pissed off type of mad. Suddenly those 4 hours of talking and fun we had together is all forgetten and she says ""Are you just gonna bore me again? We have already talked about this, I hate it when u're just quiet"" and then she goes on with her rant and leaves the call and ignores me or does something else. And it's not like she is leading the entire conversation, I'd say I contribute as much if not more to keeping conversations alive. I am quite happy to just sit and have her in call as we're both doing our things.

"I have recently decided to leave my girlfriend. That part is certain, it needs to happen, that’s not why I’m here.

What I need to know is how do I do it. It is currently 12/20, Christmas obviously is coming up *very* soon and she is also going to be moving halfway across the country (back to her hometown) without me on 12/29, but as far as she is aware I will be joining her in a few months.

I currently live in her house (as in her name is the only one on the lease) with my son, who is going back with his mom (also across the country from me) on 1/8.

If I tell her now, I will be almost guaranteeing a horrible Christmas for all of us, and potentially her causing issues with me continuing to live in the house. If I tell her a day or two before she goes away, then at least Christmas happened, but there’s a lot that can still go wrong.

That brings me to what feels like the last option, if I wait until she already leaves then my son doesn’t have to see any of the drama, not to mention I get to have a bit of control over how much drama I have to deal with in the sense that I don’t have to sit on the phone and let someone try to yell at me or anything like that. The problem with this is I know that it’s a fairly shitty thing to do as far as her feelings are concerned.

So I guess what I’m asking is this: when it comes down to it, is it more important to do what I need to do in order to keep my and my son’s peace, or to listen to the empathetic/people pleasing voice inside my head?

I should also add, she wants to move back home anyway, and she already has arrangements made for her to be safe going out there, so I wouldn’t be putting her out in that sense.",How do I (29M) leave my girlfriend (23F) of a little over a year?,18n3w0h,1703102885.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n3w0h/how_do_i_29m_leave_my_girlfriend_23f_of_a_little/,
"GF and I do not live together. She comes over to visit ever few days. A few days ago, my GF accidentlaly left herself logged into facebook on my computer and went out. A message popped up and I just assumed it was for me, so I opened it. It was a conversation between my GF with some  guy named Robert. They were very flirtatious, bantering with sexual innuendos all through it. He asked to go for ""coffee"" and made jokes about how big his back seat was. They went out for coffee at 3 am. He dropped her off at 5 am. She said ""Thank you so much for everything!"" When I confronted her with the evidence, she claimed he was just a very old friend and they always joke like that, but absolutely *nothing* happened. She's not even interested in him that way because she loves *me*. She said he was feeling down because his son was sick in the hospital, so she wanted to keep him company and cheer him up.

And then she turned it around on me, saying she'd dated jealous guys before, and she was *not* going to put up with wild accusations, and how dare I go through her private conversations, etc. etc. I told her, if you're not hiding anything, why are you always so careful to log yourself out of your facebook. I don't. She knows my phone code. She can go through all my convos at any time. I'm not hiding anything. But her whole life seems to be on lockdown. Strange, that.

The evidence seems pretty clear and obvious at first glance. But she was so sincere in her denials, that I don't know what to think. I could be being gaslighted about it, but I'm not sure. She was never abusive or manipulative toward me before, otherwise I wouldn't even *be* with her. I never had any reason to suspect she would ever cheat on me, because she was over the moon for me for the longest time. I was a ""dream come true!"" etc. etc. She wanted to marry me someday, etc. So now I'm second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm just being a paranoid asshole. On the other hand, the evidence seem so obvious, you'd be a fool to believe her bullshit.

Anyway, a seemingly dream-come-true relationship has suddenly turned into a hell of self-doubt and pain and paranoia. Thoughts?

**Edit/Update:** 

Just had a chat with her sister. I wasn't replying to her, so she got her sis to msg me. We talked for a while. Apparently, her and this Robert guy were dating back in the late 2000s. She didn't mention that part when she called him an ""old friend"". I guess it's some small consolation that he wasn't just some random fling. 

But I'm probably not going to continue this relationship. If she's as ""devastated"" by losing me as she claims to be, I guess it'll be a lesson learned. I'm pretty sure she'll have no trouble getting over it.

"Hello. 

After a long stint of celibacy and no dating, I’ve finally decided to have a go at it again. I’m 24, AMAB, but non-binary. I’m demisexual, which if you’re unfamiliar with the term, means that I need a pretty strong emotional bond with someone before I can be intimate with them. 

I don’t lack any significant experience when it comes to sex and relationships, but I REALLY like my new partner, so much so that I still get nervous after knowing them for eleven months and six weeks of official dating. I feel ready for intimacy at this point, but I know first times are usually at least a little awkward.

Full disclosure: we’ve tried sex once, but I started thinking too much, lost arousal, and then gave up for the time being. I guess right now I’m worried about our first time being egregiously awkward, or potentially getting performance anxiety again. And I wanna maybe explain the way I’m wired to my partner, but it’s an unusual thing and I’m afraid it’ll make me seem less attractive.

We’ve been having issues with his family because they aren’t very nice people, his mum has been rude to me on numerous occasions and they’ve been bitching specifically behind my back about boundaries we have in place with our baby. Typical boomer parents, but my fiancé just excuses their shit behaviour all the time. We are having a lot of issues between us because of them at the moment and he refuses to go therapy. 

The reason why I don’t want to see the boyfriend is because he and my sister in law missed my birthday coz they were busy which is fine, but I was never visited another day to make up for it. We are missing her boyfriend’s birthday because we are having my family’s Christmas lunch at the same time so can’t make it. 

My fiance said he wants to go see him another day because we are missing it, I said well I don’t really want to go because the same effort was never made for me. He got really mad at me, starting insulting me by calling me a bitch, an asshole and this is why he never wants to spend time with me. Literally yelling at me whilst I hold our baby and I have told him before to not yell at me when our baby is there. I don’t want him to hear his parents arguing.

I told him that he has double standards and his family can get away with it, but if I do the same I’m yelled at. He said I’m disrespecting him by not going, I said no it’s got nothing to do with you. This boyfriend has never visited us, he’s always had 0 interest in our baby and my fiance wants to take our child there as well. I said no go by yourself. His sister has barely seen her nephew too.

I feel like this is so minor in the grand scheme of all the issues with his family. There’s so much more, but I’m over this. We get married in March, but how are we supposed to happily get married when we have this in between us. I can just see an argument occurring before and then walking down the aisle to him while I’m pissed off at him will be weird. 

I don’t know what to do anymore and need advice. Am I in the wrong or should I keep standing my ground?

"Me and my boyfriend has been going back and forth lately. We always talk it out but there's been a few times where he would grab me to talk to me, but he grabs me  and I'm pregnant. I told him that he was hurting me and he said it was because I was twisting and turning. He blew up and embarrassed me today at a resource center. I told him if he's going to argue with me and talk crap about women all the time and complain how there's no resources for men, then it's best he doesn't be in the child's life. I think ended things because I said I was “done.” Is grabbing wrist and grabbing the waist hard abuse? Should I completely let this go and move on? I would need his help with the child.

My boyfriend of over a year has made it pretty clear he doesn’t want to spend new years with me. He said he rather be with his friends, when I suggested that what if I just came along he said it would be weird and I probably wouldn’t be invited cause I don’t know his friends that well. I suggested why doesn’t he come out with my friends and he can bring the friends I do know. He said he didn’t want to do that either. I suggested him spending the first part the night with his friends and midnight with me and my friends. Nope too. I’m honestly really hurt and we’ve already had a fight about us not spending time over the holidays together so this on top of it makes me feel so much worse. 

He insists that he does want to spend it with me but that the plans are just too complicated. I don’t really know if he’s just saying that to make me feel better and he just doesn’t want to spend it with me. I told him it means a lot to me as it’s a couples holiday but he said spending it with me and not his friends would be weird. He also gave the impression that his friends would make fun of him for spending the night with me as well. 

So what should I do to address this and should I even address it?

"I'm looking for advice on how I should go about addressing or getting myself to adjust to my partner's voice .

There are two factors to the issue I'm having:

1. From my side, I seem to have exhibited the tendency in past relationships to start ""taking off the rose colored glasses"" specifically in regards to voice/mannerisms/etc., where I'll start to find my partners voice annoying at times. I think this is pervasive to all relationships in some way, just putting it out there.


2. She sometimes sounds like she is sad/tired/whining, but is actually none of these. I've tried to express to her that it is okay if she feels+sounds like these emotions sometimes, but it's hard for me talk to her if she just sounds that way and is otherwise happy. I've noticed I end up absorbing her tone into myself and it sorta brings me down before I realize it.

I love the way her vocal chords sound innately, so I don't think that's an issue. I also understand that relationships don't have to be 100% positive all the time, and spending a lot of time with a person there are bound to be some hiccups somewhere.

"Hi, I am asking for some advice on this situation and how to handle my emotions. This is my first post so I apologize if it sounds confusing.

My girlfriend (F27) and myself (M33) work at the same company but in completely different departments. We basically just work on the same floor. She has been at the company for much longer than I have.

Anyway, we have a company happy hour in our office, and then she is planning another get together in advance after the company happy hour with few of her work friends. I know and have gone out with her work friends as well in the past and I chit-chat with them in the office. My girlfriend previously told me she will invite me again to get to know them better when they have another outing. However, I was not invited to this outing and was just told she has set it up and I can go home. I felt a little uneasiness/discomfort that she did not invite me or asked if I was interested when she previously stated she would.

I have not discussed my feelings to her at the moment and would like to seek some advice. It is okay with me that she wants to go with mutual coworkers, but I just felt hurt that she did not offer if I wanted to go. I also do not want to step into her boundaries. I am not sure if I am just being dramatic or should I talk to her about how I feel? I do know she is having a rough time at work.  I appreciate the help.

TLDR - GF and I work at same company. GF setup get together after company happy hour and did not invite me or offer an explanation why? Not sure how to handle the situation.

"I (41M) work full time and earn a fairly decent wage. Enough to ensure my partner (40F) doesn't have to work whilst being able to afford the luxuries we want (in no way am I rich however). She stays at home and takes care of our 2 kids (we actually have 3 but 1 is older at school) to save on nursery fees which I appreciate is a hard task. 

I have a gripe that she does no chores around the house and constantly uses the kids as an excuse which is frustrating to me. I seem to be the only one cleaning, washing and ironing which I normally have to do after the kids are in bed because, as soon as I finish work (I work from home 99% of the time), I have the kids thrown at me including the eldest who is back from school as my partner has had enough of them (understandable) and needs a break, but again nothing around the house is done. What is most frustrating for me is that when I watch the kids when I am not working (weekend for example) I can comfortably keep the house relatively clean (kids are kids at the end of the day so mess happens) by keeping on top of it and keeping them entertained, fed etc. Please note I am not casting doubts on her parenting, I think she is a great parent, far better than I for sure! 

I am not sure if I am wrong for wanting her to do more but I do know that if the situation was reversed, I would be bending over backwards to ensure that I kept the place clean on top of seeing to the kids, shopping, ironing etc.

I am getting a bit burnt out now, to the point where I loathe taking holidays as I just get lumbered with everything and never actually get to relax (please note I love my kids including spending all my time with them, but equally my job involves a high level of stress so a bit of downtime other than the hour before bed after working, cleaning, seeing to kids and washing/ironing would be appreciated).

I've tried talking to her but it's just met with arguments, so much so I now just give up saying anything. It's getting quite bad now that I am constantly loathing her for being lazy over this.

She’s told me she hasn’t felt like talking about it but she is blaming all the blame on the guy. The guy was really into her, emotionally, really emotionally attached. Like head over heels and she never felt that way about him. She allowed him to cuddle and sleep in her bed together. Not saying friends can’t do that, but they were both on different wave lengths and she kinda put her neediness first. Like the other night, she said they cuddled and she did not feel anything from it, I said did you communicate that to him and she said I don’t have to. My jaw kinda dropped. Communication is a key to life. 

So the guy admits he is emotionally attached finally and she got on him for that. I know she never talked to him about anything, and I kinda feel bad for the guy.

I 18(f) was asked out by my manger 25(f). He is an extremely nice guy, and due to that I decided to say yes. I hoped that I would eventually develop feeling but I haven’t. It’s only been a week or so since he asked me out, and only a few days since the date, but I think he’s planning to officially ask me out. He got me flowers and tells me how pretty he thinks I am, but I feel nothing. I don’t think it’s fair to continue acting as though I am interested when in reality I am not. But as I said before he is very nice and I don’t know how to tell him that I’d like to remain friends. I want to do it in person as he deserves at least that much, but I have no idea how to phrase it without completely crushing him, so in short how do I tell him?

*UPDATE*

 He took it well. He was very mature as I expected but still hurt which I knew was unavoidable. He said that he appreciated me coming in person, and though he was disappointed he understood where I was coming from and asked that we remain friends so long as I am comfortable with it. I would also like to clarify that he in no way pressured me into this relationship, he asked me once if I’d like to have dinner, and in no way made any moves on me despite holding my hand and hugging me when we said goodbye, no predatory behavior whatsoever.

"I'm a 32 year old nonbinary person and I've been with my wife Sarah for the past 12 years. My mom and siblings are fine with our relationship, but my dad has never liked Sarah for some reason. Maybe because I was previously engaged to a man that I left for her? Maybe because Sarah was a foster child who grew up in poverty while my parents have always been middle class? All I know is ever since we started dating, he didn't like her and he's made that very obvious. 

Lately the excuse my dad's started making for why he doesn't want Sarah coming to family events is because he's convinced she robbed his condo. Up until a few years ago my parents owned a condo the next town over from where me and Sarah live so the family had somewhere to stay when they were in town (my parents and brother live 4 hours away from me, and my sister lives 2 states away). They have sold the condo now, but before they did my dad stopped by my house one day to give me something, and while he was there he chatted with my roommates. During the conversation he mentioned that there was a T-Mobile hotspot in their condo. Then he left and headed back home, but later that day the condo apparently got robbed and one of the many things that was stolen was that hotspot (along with, you know, every piece of technology in the house). 

I was at home all day and night and so were Sarah and our roommates. But my dad is convinced that Sarah and our roommates must have been the ones to rob the condo because 1) he mentioned the hotspot to them earlier that day so ""it can't be a coincidence"" and ""obviously they must have gone there to steal it"", and 2) whoever broke in didn't break a window or the door or anything so ""they must have had a key"". But first of all, I'm the only one in our house who even vaguely knew how to get to the condo (and even then I barely remember how to find the complex and I don't remember the unit number at all). Sarah had ridden there in the car as a passenger once a few years before that but that's not enough for her to remember how to get there, she's not Adrian Monk. Second of all, NONE OF US HAD A KEY! I reminded him we didn't have one and tried to explain to him that whoever broke in probably just picked the lock, but he laughed at me and said that was ridiculous. Even if his logic was it had to be someone with a key, that already excludes us because we never had one. 

I've tried explaining all of this to him but he always just insists ""it can't be a coincidence, there's no such thing as coincidences"". But if coincidences didn't exist, we wouldn't have a name for them now would we? The condo was in a bad neighborhood that's probably full of burglars who know how to pick locks. We've talked about this whole thing a few times and at this point my mom has asked us to stop talking about it, even though she seems to be taking my side but knows my dad won't budge. But now we have Christmas coming up and we're supposed to have a family get-together, and even though Sarah hates my dad too I still at least want her to be invited so she has the option to come if she wants to. Is there any way I can convince my dad that Sarah had nothing to do with the burglary?

I came home early from a work conference on Thursday (I wasn’t supposed to be back until Monday next week). When I came home my husband, who should have been at work, was laying in his chair icing his crotch. After I ask him wtf is going on, he told me had a vasectomy! I was absolutely livid!

"So my (28F) best friend (28F) since before kindergarten came over my new house where my boyfriend (26M) and I now live for a housewarming party. We've been dating about 5 months now and it's been absolute fireworks, we're madly in love.

As backstory, I'm fairly recently out of a 7 year relationship that fizzled into essentially a friendship/housemates situation at about year 4/5 because early in the relationship I fucked up and was flirting with another guy when I was drunk when I was about 22 who I then tried to keep as just a friend. Weird, I know. I didnt have a lot of friends and I recognize that was a weird way to try and make one. I spent a lot of time trying to prove I was sorry to my ex but I ended up mostly playing housewife for someone who didn't really love me anymore. I would compare it to being divorced without kids honestly. When we finally officially split, I was pretty heartbroken at first but within a couple weeks I was already moved on. The relationship had died so long ago, yknow? So going back to dating made me realize I had been emotionally single for a long time. 

And then met my boyfriend. Instant connection. Not wanting to waste his time, I told him everything right away, didnt hide it, and like a saint my boyfriend recognizes it was a very long time ago and accepts its not the type of mistake I would make again, especially now that I'm so much older and already learned the hard way how much pain something like that causes. We've talked about it a lot so rest assured he has considered it very seriously and he very much had the chance to decide if he was okay or not.

So for the housewarming, we have multiple friends over in our small den around the table, loud music, drinks, etc. and during the course of the party we can tell my friend is really not having a good time and she's been very standoffish to my bf in particular. My boyfriend, outspoken as he is and knowing I've been having some issues with her lately, leans in to ask why she doesn't seem excited for us. She says she doesnt know what he means, and he continues to try to explain. The conversation progresses into a heated discussion within earshot of whoever felt Iike listening, and during that my best friend tells him ""You know she's not 'reliable', right?"" and rolled her eyes, clearly referencing my history of cheating. He got mad on my behalf and he outright hates her now.

I don't blame him, and I'm really hurt by her. I don't know what to do or how to feel. It really seems like she thinks I'm still that drunk 22 year old who never had a serious relationship. I proved my ""reliability"" for 6 more years with my ex. She knows all my ups and downs about that time. And also, she's known me for so many years and she doesn't seem to like him so why would she warn *him* about *me*? Does she think so little of me that she would warn a stranger? And what if I hadn't told him yet? It comes off like she doesnt trust me and would rather destroy my life herself if I so deserved it. It feels like a weird possessiveness because she's single and maybe she was excited for me to be out of that 7 year relationship for more time so we could like, be single and party together or whatever.. but I got lucky and met someone I really love and loves me back with ferocity. Even strangers have approached us about how happy and in love we are. So of all people, how come my best friend can't accept my new life? Shouldn't she be proud of me for moving on and finding someone who loves me as I am, not begrudging my past? I have so much history with her and she knows all my worst mistakes... Not to mention I've already been distant lately because I've been sensing this from her, this like, unwillingness(?) to be excited for me. At that party, it was doubly confirmed something is very wrong. Do I talk to her? If I even talk to her, what do I say? I'm at such a loss and feel so betrayed by her. I don't know. I really don't want to lose someone I've known for 25 years, basically my sister, I want to just ignore it but I've been trying to learn to stop putting up with people who don't actually love me. Funny how thats come full circle in a very personal way. 

TLDR: My best friend of 25 years warned my new boyfriend who she doesn't even seem to like very much about how years ago I cheated on my ex... and she said it in front of all our guests at our housewarming party. My boyfriend and I are both offended and angry about her behavior. How do I handle this betrayal from essentially my sister?

It's not like his mom is toxic or anything, but I just don't feel comfortable. Knowing this, I'm less comfortable sharing things with him knowing that he will talk about it with his mom.

My girlfriend (23f) and myself were in a long term relationship for past 5 years, along these years I just pampered her a lot and she too got very comfortable with me , until she lost her father.
Everything started to change to completely, we fought a lot but i didn't want to leave her at any cost she too thought the same and gave me many chances to change things and make her happy but i felt something was missing never once she felt the same for me , after two years of losing her father she said she wanted to more bold and independent but instead she turned to a stuck up girl , she never hears me out or listen to my problems, she would tell me that I am blaming her if I approached her . I made a lot of efforts for the change she asked.Eventually she broke up with me and said I am fed up with you blah blah . Now she wants to stay as friends she has moved on completely. 

But whenever I talk about relationship she would just shut me up or ghost me and whenever she feels better she will come and talk to me . What should I do?
I still love her but I want her see how bad she is behaving?

"My boyfriend and I uploaded videos of us onto a popular porn site a little over a month ago, and since then it’s gotten a good amount of views but has tapered off over time. I am not really interested in continuing to post content online as I don’t think it’s for me, but he’s quite into it. We only posted content in the first place because of financial difficulty, but it isn’t worth it to me. 
On top of struggling financially right now I’m also in a bad head space and am going through a depressive episode. Last night I had a particularly bad night that ended with me having a panic attack and eventually falling asleep. This morning he texts me from work and randomly asks me if I had checked the site lately, so I went and checked it. There I found four comments from an account name that had his exes birthplace and birth year in the title (think something similar to  “AZThick95”). The comments were under each video saying things like “fuck me instead of her😭” “God I wish I was the one sucking it instead🥺” and comments about how hot he is. I immediately knew it was him because it’s a similar text style to how he types, and for the obvious context clues. I texted him a few hours later and asked him if he wanted to tell me anything and he said no. I gave him a hint, which was the website, and that’s when he proceeded to tell me to ignore the comments and that he made that account last night so we could get more traction and that he knew I’d know it was him and he wasn’t trying to be toxic. He said that he was going to “drop the bomb” tonight if I didn’t confront him about it and that he didn’t mean to upset me. So he made that account while I was asleep next to him after having an awful day and commented those things. 

 I basically went off on him and told him that I thought it was a terrible thing to do and that it hurt me deeply, especially the account being named what it was. I kept asking him to admit that he was doing it to make me jealous but he’s adamant that isn’t the reason. We’re now in a huge fight because I’m hurt and he thought I would find it hilarious and call him dumb. He says he only used the name and made those comments to make it “obvious it was him”, but I’m doubtful. I have since deleted all of our videos and am working on deleting the account as well. At this point I don’t know what the real reason is or what to do, and I need help figuring this out. Do I believe him or is he just not wanting to admit what he did, and how do I navigate what to do after? Please help 😞

So this m(22) and I, f(24) have been mutuals on social media since 2019 after I added him on tinder to find a plug on vacation. We live across the country from each other. He would reply to my stories giving me compliments, etc. but we never talked seriously up until about 2 months ago. We started texting and sparingly FaceTiming.

For some context, he is in the navy studying muscular reactors. From my understanding he has to serve 2 years after he completes this program. I’ve been graduated from college and working since I was 20. 

Right off the bat he was professing his love and admiration for me and I just took it as some sort of infatuation and or love bombing. I set boundaries right away of less frequent texting and getting to ACTUALLY know each other before talks of marriage and living after we meet irl. I don’t see it to be necessary or healthy for either party to start expecting constant communication like that. Especially when he doesn’t even know me. 

Most of our conversations consisted of these compliments and askings of how our days went. It didn’t get much deeper too often because I didn’t know how to respond to said compliments and talks of the future without hurting his feelings. Again, how do I confess feelings for someone I barely know anything about 

He has been doing everything I would want in a partner. Write me hand written letters, send me money for nails, reply thoughtfully to everything I say. I just couldn’t accept these things as genuine because I thought “he literally doesn’t know who I am”

A couple days ago I decided to tell him that our long distance wouldn’t work out. I told him I felt bad for not returning the attention dtion and energynergy he has been giving me and that it would be wise for him to focus on his schooling and finish his program. Maybe we would meet at another time

My whole family is pretty distant as is. I don’t know a lot about my dad, but I know his dad remarried several times and this is the woman who ultimately raised him. My understand is she also has a bit of a learning disorder.


I remember going to visit a couple times when I was younger but otherwise never saw or heard from her. She never reached out to me at holidays or milestones.


She added me on Facebook recently and has been asking me to come visit (I moved to a city that’s about 2 hours from her, before would have been about four. I don’t think she can drive (not sure though). She’s also requested I call her grandma. 


She’s clearly super depressed and lonely and I do feel bad for her. However, I don’t really know her and a two hour drive in my old unreliable van feels like a lot.


 It kind of feels like not my responsibility to keep her company when she made no effort to have a relationship w me when I was growing up. However, she is also technically family..and with a learning disorder I don’t know how difficult it is for her to reach out?


Might also note my dad visits her every couple years.

Background for info, my mom threw me out April of this year into a property she owns, I didn't want or ask for this, but I made the best of the situation I could, during me living there the upstairs tenant (not related to me) harassed my brother and I, and ended up cutting her lease short and moving out (relavent later) my older brother works part time and under the table, so if something comes up short or we need anything it falls on me. Recently my older sister and younger brother who own their own home have offered for me to move in with them, which would save me thousands compared to the money im currently bleeding subsidizing the cost of living for my brother whos old enough to be my dad, I let my mom know the 15th of December that I planned on moving out by the end of January, which should be totally fine considering there is no lease and we're doing a month by month rent, but after I told her that instead of a rational response she flipped out, claiming she ""threw out the upstairs tenant for me"" (not true, she left by dissolving her lease), that I'm ""abandoning my commitment "" and that my older brother can't support a house on his own, (I think 30 days is more than enough time for an adult man to pull his shit together) and that she's not okay with me moving out at all, and is trying to use scare tactics like empty threats to force me to stay there, I'm curious as to what I could say to get my piece across without coming off attacking her

Here are the texts for more context

Me: I'm not really sure what I'd want honestly, but I wanted to let you know that I've been talking with [older sister and younger brother], and I'm going to end up renting out the downstairs with my girlfriend once their tenants lease is up in a few months, but until then they've offered for me to rent out the third room, so i planned on moving out of [my current apartment], I can either be out the end of this month, or the end of January if that helps out with [older brother] having more time plan, buy things, and have bills split another month 

Mom: You realize that I kicked my tenant out up stairs because you were freaked out about her  so I'm not getting rent 1, 100 dollars a month 
So it's not really an opportune time for you to abandon your commitment on [current apartment ] 
[Older brother] will not be able to pay for that apartment alone  
He will need time to find a roommate. And we can't support that whole house on his half rent 
The adult thing to do would be be to move out to [new apartment] once their downstairs tenants lease is up.

"My partner and I have been together nearly 3 years and living together for  over 2 of them. We both moved to a new country where we haven’t many, if any, friends. We’re both incredibly lonely.

Yesterday, my partner vented about this offensive thing their sibling said. The online chat to which they posted in was really comforting and supportive. One guy, who has been mentioned before a while ago for being really nice, apparently experienced similar issues with their sibling. As a means to show his support he offered to go out for dinner with my SO to chat and cheer up.

My partner has only described this person as being “in their late 40’s” and that “they have kids”, as a sort of reassurance factor. To me, this means nothing as I don’t see how a ten year age gap - or being a parent - is an automatic non-threat.

I’m confused as to how to process this, initially I felt anxious and suspicious but I’m not in a good place either so cannot trust my thought patterns. The main thing weighing on me is that my partner never wants to go out for a dinner date with me, saying it’s their anxiety or too loud or just they want to stay home. Which I sympathise with and brush off, they’ve rejected my offer multiple times due to these reasons. Eventually I stopped asking and chose to wait until they suggest it.

But then this random online presence comes along with an invite to dinner which my partner accepts with no second thought.

am i wrong for feeling like she should’ve had an in person conversation with me about wanting to try this before we did it in person? i am assuming because we texting about wanting to do it she assumed i wanted to next time i saw her and that’s why she did it. if she were to have asked in person about trying it before we had sex that day, i would’ve said no because i just wasn’t feeling like it. i have been very clear about needing clear verbal consent during sex before she touches me or tries something new in the past, and she has listened, so i’m very surprised this happened.",my ex (f23) hit me (f21) during sex,18n2p3n,1703099810.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n2p3n/my_ex_f23_hit_me_f21_during_sex/,
"So I was dating my co-worker for a few months. She was my first date and my first kiss.

I was practically quaking in my boots when I asked her out, because I’m afraid of making her uncomfortable. I literally practiced in a mirror like a goofball.

“Hey AJ. This is kind of sudden but I just think that you’re really cute and funny, and i was wondering if I could take you out on a date sometime? You can totally say no.”

She says she thinks I’m really cute (woah) but she’s going through a bit of stuff at the moment.

“Okay, I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable or anything.” And then run to go change my metaphorically soiled shorts.

A few months later, after getting what I think was a hint I ask again, and she laughed, and said I took way too long to ask her out again, and couldn’t read between the lines. I blamed my autism.

We dated for a few months.

It was just a few months, but we talked about a lot. She mentioned being a sex worker before. I mentioned being abused when I was little. Stuff like that.

She admitted to lying and gaslighting people, and telling half-truths to make her lies more believable, which I thought was kind of strange. It did explain a lot of weird little contradictory things she said and did tho. But she’s really nice, and a really cool person.

She said that while I was cute and she really liked me, she doesn’t believe in  monogamy and she wasn’t looking for a relationship yet. I tried to read between the lines again, and I asked if she wanted to be FWB.

She smiled and thought for a bit and went “Well…”, but turned it down, all good tho.

I guess she still really liked me as a friend, and I could make her laugh, so she wanted to keep being best friends at work. She would always come sit next to me at lunch which was cool.



So these are sort of the building blocks of what happened…

-She scrolls through sex ads while work, and talks to me about answering them

-Says that she misses doing sex work

-She thinks sex work is a fine thing to do

-She said she’s in a place where she doesn’t have to do that for money if she doesn’t want to

-She said she would totally answer them, if it weren’t for being potentially murdered by a stranger

-She repeatedly stated that she wasn’t joking

She said she would lay on her back in a club, and let 200 guys have at her for $50 each. I laughed but she said she was completely serious. It’s just sex, and she’d just make them wear condoms. I was like, you know what? Fair point. Maybe I’m harboring bigotry towards sex workers. Just because I’ve never had it doesn’t mean it’s a big deal, right?


So this went on for several days.

So on what ended up being my last day at work, she says “hey look, someone will pay $200 for me to do XYZ, etc.”

I say I’d pay her like a grand for that. She called me out for saying that. I apologized, and told her I’d quit my job to help her be comfortable again. This led to her going to HR and getting me flagged for sexual misconduct and fired.

So a little over half a year later, my therapist suggests I reach out to see if she’s willing to talk about what happened. I was hesitant, but my therapist said that if she didn’t want to talk, she’ll tell me.

So I ask her if she would like to talk about what happened. (I text her first, saying that we don’t have to talk at all if she doesn’t want to, since I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable by just showing up. She says yes she wants to talk.)

She doesn’t reach out for a week, so I go and ask if she still wants to talk. I tell her that my autism makes it difficult to read cues, and it’s totally cool if she doesn’t want to talk or ever see me again. She says sorry, and that her ADHD made her forget, and that she really does want to talk, and she’ll reach out in a couple of months.

So life goes on. I have a mini-stroke. A bunch of other stuff.

I remember we were gonna talk, and come back ~3 months later to see if she wants to talk now, or if she changed her mind and wants me to go away. She says yes let’s talk, I’ll text you later.

She sends me a text saying she thinks its wrong of me to keep trying to talk to her. I was so confused. I guess I just felt like if she wanted me to go away, she wouldn’t stop me from saying I’ll never talk to her again, and wouldn’t tell me that she wants to talk and to keep in touch.

So she tells me to just text her everything I want to say to her.

And I went overboard…

I brought up the time when she herself admitted to frequently lying and gaslighting people, and how she told me she that she also intentionally tells half-truths in order to get people to believe her lies. And about how she lied about sleeping with another co-worker. And how I said she never has to see me again if she didn’t want to, but she kept saying she wanted to talk, and dragged it out for nearly 6 more months, and how much that sucked because I wanted to be done and over-with…


So I basically wrote one long-ass text both apologizing for what I did, and…chewing her out for the other stuff that I didn’t do after we broke up. Which was unfair because it was suppose to be an apology for my fuck up. At the end of it, I wished her the best, and I said that I never want to be friends, and that I don’t want to talk to her again.


She texts me back her piece saying she didn’t want me fired at all, and tried to tell HR afterwards that she actually didn’t want them to fire me or anything. She says I’m harassing her, and that if I reach out again, she’ll call the police.


I didn’t respond. I had already deleted her off my contacts. I will leave her alone, that’s what I wanted to do in the first place. I didn’t want to be friends, I even told her that I don’t want to know her, I just wanted to see if she was willing to talk about everything that happened.


I feel awful about the whole thing.

My therapist keeps saying I didn’t fuck up, and called her a sociopath, but I’m physically feel nauseous and I fucking hate myself. When I was little I got abused, so I wanted my first time to be with someone I was comfortable with, but I was so fucking selfish that I was willing to pester someone else for something like that. I feel like an irredeemable piece of shit.


TL;DR - I’m a selfish fucking asshole who hurt the only person to care about me in that way.



My advice request is:

How do you move on from the guilt of past relationship fuck-ups, and strive to be better? I’m afraid. Someone’s showing an interest in me, and I’d like them a lot, but I feel like I don’t deserve to get a second chance with someone.

"Hello, all. I am seeking advice on a situation I (24M) am in with a (29F) woman. Up until a week ago, I knew where I stood with this woman, I knew where it was heading to, but now I am confused. We saw each other a total of four times, the last time being the fourth time.  
  
I officially met this woman in February this year, when I randomly signed up for Spanish classes online, and she seemed like a person that I would understand well. It was nothing more than professional at first, and then it became more and more platonic as it went on. She lives in Peru, and in June, she flew to visit her family in the state of Colorado. In July, I joked with her that she should visit me in New Jersey for a festival happening in September, and to my surprise, she soon bought her ticket to see me (1st time). At that point, we still didn't talk much, maybe 2-4 times a week, and not extensively.  
  
She came to see me in September, and it was a beautiful time. We had great conversations, amazing intimacy, and it felt like we knew each other for a longer time. It really was great. She had to fly back a week after the first week of September, and after that, we continued talking every day. We flirted more, had deeper conversations, the standard. I had bought my ticket to see her in Colorado at the beginning of November, and the great conversations continued. My visit (2nd time) was just as great, but two days after my arrival, I had a family emergency and had to fly back. She was very understanding, and the trip was cut short.  
  
Not even a full week later, she told me she had days off from work and would like to visit me again in NJ. I found her a cheap ticket, and she came to see me for a full week (3rd time). This time was truly amazing. I took her on dates, we went to see a Broadway show she had always wanted to see since she was a child and never had the opportunity, and had even deeper conversations about our relationship, and it was overall perfect. When she left, we had one last conversation in which I made it clear that I want her, that it feels great to be around her, and that I don't want to deny myself an opportunity to be happy with her. Previously, she told me how she was scared because she got really hurt in a previous relationship, so I told her that I don't want her to feel scared and stay in a place where she feels she has to be alone. She reciprocated everything, saying that she would really like to try being with me the right way, that she knows we have *something* and it is *formal*, and I knew where I stood with her. I was more than sure.  
  
After a few days, I noticed I had some more days off from work that I could either use or lose before the year ends, so I decided to fly to see her again and she was thrilled. While I was not planning to make anything official yet, it was in my plans to do so in January, after we talked about how much we wanted to go to Florida. That was my plan. On this visit (4th visit), everything was great. She had to work a lot this time as she had no more vacation left, she was stressed about it for not having more time off, but overall we spent time quite beautifully. Up until we had one last deep conversation, which I am still struggling to understand after getting back to NJ.  
  
The day before, we were a little drunk and talking about many things in life, on which we were not in the same position. It was nothing negative, it was about careers, life choices, what matters in life, things like that. The next day, I noticed something was odd and randomly brought it up. She said how sometimes she feels she is not 'ready for a relationship'. That what we have in 'knowing each other more' and 'learning more' is great because sometimes she feels that she thinks differently than I do, and it makes her think. She said that hopefully, if we are not meant to be together, we can stay friends, which was very painful to hear. She said she sometimes feels like she is older than me (obviously) in the way she thinks and does things. At that moment, I didn't say much, because quite honestly, I did not know what to say, so I just agreed. However, the next day, she noticed I was off and asked me what was going on. I told her how I feel, that I feel extremely confused about what we are, that when she was visiting me the last time, everything seemed great, she made it clear that she wants to take it a step further, that I am a part of her plans, that we can build something beautiful.  
  
However, now, I feel like she said something completely out of the left field and I genuinely don't know how to think. She looked at me, started crying, and apologized, saying that she understands I am confused and it may hurt and she feels horrible, but that she does not want to lose a great person. We went on a hike before she had to work, where we both cried. I told her how with the first visit, I didn't think much about it, but with every visit and every conversation, it felt like we were going in one direction, and that I was starting to build an illusion with her, a good one. At that moment, I had it very clear in my mind. I told her that if this is how she feels, not sure, doubtful, that I prefer for this visit to be my last because I don't want to hurt myself further. I don't want to keep an illusion with her that she might be sure in the future, or might change her mind, or I'll have that illusion but later she will simply tell me she doesn't want it. I told her I don't want this, that maybe it was a mistake to build this illusion, that I don't understand why she would say one thing one visit, then another the next. She then went to work.  
  
After work that same day, I picked her up in the car, and we started talking again. She asked me how I feel, I told her the same. She told me how she kept thinking about this all day at work, that she thought about seeing me for the last time ever, and it made her feel very sad. She apologized for what she said before, saying that this visit is different because she is constantly stressed at work and cannot spend more time with me, unlike her last visit which was pure vacation for her. She told me how she really was sure when she came last time that she wants to take it a step further with me because she had no worries about work and such, that she does not want to lose me. I told her I want her but I don't want to hurt myself with an illusion, she responded by saying she wants to be with me too, and that if we are meant to be together, then we will. She proceeded to tell me she has not gotten this emotional in a very long time, not sure of the significance of saying that.  
  
Right before I left, I told her that I want her, and she said she wants me too. We haven't talked about it since I came back to NJ a few days ago, our conversations are the same, but I am still thinking about this and trying to understand it. Personally, I think she is a great woman. She is warm, radiant. I told her she is the happiest and most thankful person I've ever met. Outside of what I mentioned, using today's terminology, she is a walking green flag, motivated, organized, loving. A part of me feels that she is not so sure. Another part of me feels that she miscommunicated her thoughts as she told me, and I should take her words as the truth.  
  
I know she got hurt in the past, she was in a 6-year relationship that did not necessarily end badly, but she suffered a lot and went through therapy. She mentioned to me a handful of times before that she is scared of falling in love because she doesn't want to get hurt. I have all of these thoughts in my mind and I can't organize them well enough to see what is happening. I would appreciate any input anyone has, especially if you might have gone through something similar?

&amp;#x200B;",I (24M) am very confused on my relationship with a girl (29F).,18n2m42,1703099605.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n2m42/i_24m_am_very_confused_on_my_relationship_with_a/,
"So, for context, I’m 9 months pregnant. I’m sure it’ll be suggested, but I don’t think this is the issue or related to it. My husband and I have been married a year and a half, and honestly, it’s been great in most ways. We have the occasional ups and downs but he is a kind, loving partner that truly cares for me. It’s one of those things I hear a lot from the outside world, that it’s obvious how much he loves me. He is one of those typical quiet tough guy types, but obviously shows the world I’m his soft spot. He takes good care of me, he has a great heart, he assists with house work and takes an active role in most things in our life. 

For all the years of our relationship, we were a fun loving, goofy, very sexual couple. This part has feels like it’s died. Most nights we sit on the couch quietly and watch TV or we go out and see our families/friends. If we go out to eat, it’s obviously for the purpose of just getting some food, it’s rarely a connected activity. He spends most meals with his phone in one hand and eating with the other. We get through all the responsibilities in life as a team, he’s a great support in my life, and he truly does love me to death and it’s so obvious, but there just feels like there is nothing fun or passionate about my marriage. I am so damn bored of him and us. We’ve had sex twice, maybe three times since August. Nothing feels flirty, or sexy, or light and fun. I’m naturally all of those things I think, and usually when I radiate that energy, I get met with his mundane-ness and disinterest in it and I feel the need to tone it down. For example, I might hop on him, try and kiss him passionately, try and flirt with him, try to turn the sex appeal up, get dressed up hot, put on some lingerie, anything. And it never really gets much attention or he looks awkward and uncomfortable and has this face on of “oh god I hope this stops soon”. It’s obvious he tries to fake it and seem like he enjoys it, but everything about his body language is so off putting. 

Baby is coming soon, and I know all of this is about to get even worse. I’ve talked to him about it, he seems to acknowledge I feel this way and he’s sorry, and I think he starts doing more each time, but none of it is bringing back that SPARK. Like we’ll have sex cause I brought it up and that sex will feel awkward. Or he’ll plan a date and we’ll just be bored together. I also think we both have dramatically different energy levels and this makes a big difference. After work, he’s usually totally spent and just wants to relax quietly. And you can tell by the energy that if I try to have a conversation, he gives me all of his attention, but he’s just waiting for it to be over so the TV can go on. I’ve expressed my concern about totally losing the marriage spark after the baby, and he just explains that it’ll be fine and we’ll figure it out together. 

Edit: I feel like this is important information even though it feels weird putting this out there, but my husband has always had a really strong pregnancy kink. I’ve even bought a fake belly before for bedroom use. It’s why I don’t think it’s the pregnancy

Any suggestions on what I can do?

TLDR: Lost the spark in the marriage. Now what?","What to do when my (28F) marriage with my husband (36M) is otherwise awesome, but the spark is just gone?",18n2iw4,1703099387.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n2iw4/what_to_do_when_my_28f_marriage_with_my_husband/,
"I don't work so I am home a lot of the time, but I do go to school some days of the week and i'm gone for 6-7 hours. I haven't found anything big, just a few bobby pins and ponytails that I know are not mine here and there and today I found directions from a new box of tampons sitting on my dresser. (I am on my period, but haven't bought a new box of tampons, I just took some from my moms house) I asked him if he knew where that came from and he said ""I have no idea"" fair enough, I guess. 

beside just having that gut feeling, he's also been 1000x more lovable than about a month ago. but only with his words and not his actions. he's been complimenting me more and acting happier than usual at the fact that ""i'm his girlfriend"" and the other morning before he went to work he leaned over to me and said ""I love you, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me and I don't know what I would do without you."" he has..*never* said anything like that before to me. now, I know what you're thinking. this is all good isn't it? 

and I mean, I guess. It just feel like he's over-compensating for something. again, he's only acting this way with his words and when it comes to actually spending time with me, he's not doing that. he's been spending everyday after work either at his friends house or on video games with his friends. (I do have his location, so I do know he is actually there. they're definitely the type of friends to let him bring another girl over there tho and help him lie about it...but I'm definitely thinking way too much) 

when he said he was going over to his friends house for the 3rd time in one day I shot him an exhausted look to which he pretty much replied ""hey I could be out cheating"" and that really caught me off guard. like what? I just responded ""you could also be spending time with your girlfriend"" to which he replied we were about to eat dinner together. (woopdiedoo 😐) 

idk, just feeling neglected physically but he thinks he's doing enough because he's using his words. at the same time I feel like i'm just being walked all over and stabbed in the back. he's been hiding his phone from me more and has also been getting regular and frequent emails which is unusual. just confused and talking to him doesn't help because he just gets defensive or mad that i'm questioning anything. it does not matter how kind of un-accusatory I go at it. he doesn't like that I would even think those thoughts. and refuses to talk about it.

"I am not sure how to approach this situation and could use some advice…

My girlfriend (29F) and I (30M) have been dating for a couple of months now. We are compatible and think similarly on a lot of things; however this particular topic has caused some tension between us. She doesn’t seem to think that there is anything wrong with staying friends or answering DMs from guys she had either hooked up with or dated in the past. I normally would be more understanding even though I don’t talk to my exes or people I’ve hooked up with, but they sometimes say to her that they wish they would hook up again or miss kissing her, which makes me really uncomfortable and insecure. My girlfriend reassures me that she ignores them when they say those things and that she only replies to them when it’s funny memes or tiktoks, etc. But I find it disrespectful that she doesn’t tell them that she’s uncomfortable with that or mentions to them that she is dating someone and if they want to continue to talk to her that they have to be respectful of her relationship. 

I’ve tried to understand the root of my problem with this and why it makes me so uncomfortable and this is what I think. My ex ended up cheating on me with someone that she dated for 1-2 months I think 7-8 years ago. When she first told me about this person, she would just gossip and tell me that they are going through a divorce and she was just being supportive. I later found out that she would talk to them daily and even would go out to grab food without telling me. She even told them that she loved them and never wanted to let them go again. The sad part is that I found out a month before I was planning on proposing to her. Safe to say that I was beyond devastated and it caused me to become extremely insecure and untrusting.  

I know it’s not fair to compare my ex to my current girlfriend, but perhaps I just haven’t completely healed. Am I being unreasonable? How would you feel in my situation?

"Ugh so I just found a butt plug in a secret pocket in my boyfriends coat. I am not sure if I should bring it up to him or not. 

We have been together for about 3 months now and have previously found a bag full of drag clothes &amp; accessories (lashes, lipstick, boob tape, bra padding, wig &amp; wig caps) to which my bf said he is safekeeping for a friend who does drag. I know this friend exists as I have seen a video of theirs, but I am not convinced the bag is theirs… they were quite petite and most of the clothes are a women’s large… just about the size that would fit my bf. When I found it I was sure to be open and accepting so he would feel comfortable opening up to me if it was his. I have also seen a picture of him in the wig saved to his Snapchat and camera roll (he even had an album titled “Whore❤️” with the pictures of him in drag). He said the pictures were a joke he sent to this drag Queen friend for their bday and maintains the bag is not his. I am not so convinced. I have smelt the clothes in the bag and can tell he has been wearing them recently. I think he may wear them at night when I am asleep (he has sleep problems so often gets out of bed once I fall asleep). It smells like he may have worn them last night.

I have also found a dildo and lube in his work bag previously… he told me this was part of a long standing joke with his friend where they mail each other sex toys to mess with each other. He told me not to use it as the dildo is marinated in some spice as part of the prank. I have not confirmed if the dildo is indeed marinated. 

I accepted all of his explanations but maintained the stance that if any of it was his, I would not be upset, I only want him to feel comfortable opening up to me about such things. He has not budged in his reasonings but after finding this butt plug I am questioning it all and wondering if he has really been truthful with me.

"I moved out from my parents house a little more than a year ago. In that time my boyfriend lived with me for about half a year and because my parents pay my rent they didn’t wanted him to give them any money so he lived there for free. It was great i really liked living with him but in fall he moved out again to study in a different city. Since then we almost always only see each other on the weekends (Fr.-Su.). And because I also study full time i only have time to visit my parents on the weekends too. At the beginning I thought it still would go well, that i can visit my family and see my boyfriend, because my parents like him very much and he could just come with me to their place. And until a while ago he also liked them but he then started to not like them as much anymore, actually only my dad. It’s especially because my dad has very different views in politics than him but my dad doesn’t really show his political position, my boyfriend knows it because I told him.
It started that he didn’t want to come with me to our family gaming nights and in general didn’t want to visit my parents anymore. Of course I was not the happiest but i didn’t want to pressure him into coming. Afterwards I started going to my parents house less because I still wanted to spend time with him but also with them. Especially because my mother is a really big family guy and it’s really important for her to hold together as a family because her side of the family is completely broken into pieces. And i still really like to visit them and also my little sisters. 
And today he told me he would come to my place tomorrow which obviously i was very happy about but then I told him that i plan on leaving on friday evening to go visit my parents because christmas is going to be here soon. He then got angry that I would only stay with him for one day and I told him i could also stay till saturday because I really wanted to see him but he said that it’s too late now and told me that at some point I have to decide if I wanted to see them or him. Now he doesn’t want to see me anymore and is staying at his parent’s house.
I don’t know what to do anymore because from his perspective it probably looks like I can’t let go of my parents but I just really like them and I don’t know how to see him and also have time to visit my parents without him getting angry at me. How could I manage the time better? Do you think there is a way for him to like my dad again? My mother already misses him joining our gaming nights.
Or any other solutions? How could i get less attached to my parents if you think thats more the case? I’m open for any advice.

"First of all, english is not my first language so bare with me. I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (20m) for 2 years now. We are going to call him Leo. We are long distance, he lives 4 hours away in a different city to go to college and i live in the same city that his mom (where we met). Let's just start saying that i'm not his moms (58f) favorite person ever. She is very religious and very conservative, so her son having a serious girlfriend is a sin for her since according to her ""you should not trust a women that gets in your bed without being your wife"". She has always said that he is too young to tie himself up and that he can get whoever he wants because he has soooo many qualities blabla. And i think the fact that they are a very wealthy family and i'm middle class have a lot to do with her attitude (she thinks im a gold digger). I've never understood very well why she doesn't like me when she hasn't tried to get to know me a little but well. He usually just ignores her because they are not really close but when she crosses the line talking about me he defends me and i think that pisses her out even more xD. The only good think ig is that she has never said any of it to my face, i only know that she doesn't like me because leo tells me what she says. Onto the story, Leo was studying civil engineering in college at his father's request but when he passed away last year he wanted to change to another career because he had never really liked it. He is studying in another city so he doesn't live with his mom and he knew that if he told her that he wanted to change, she was going to force him to live with her again and study in our city. So he stay in it but eventually he switch in August without telling his mom. He decided to switch to industrial engineering (the same career that I study in college). I knew that when she found out that he had changed to the same career as me, she was going to blame me because according to her everything wrong he does it's my fault. And that happened today, he finally told her that he had changed and oh surprise, Its my fault because I have corrupted him a lot, i'm a bad influence, that he needs to enter the path of god again and stay away from my sinners influence, that she doesn't want to see me in her house anymore, etc. The problem here is that when he comes to my city we usually get together at his house and Christmas is coming so we had plans to spend it together. But whatever, we don't really pay attention to what she says but i know eventually her not liking me it's going to affect our relationship because we have had fights about her. I don't really know if i should try to have a conversation with her or tell him to do it. Like is she ever going to like me if i try hard enough?

"I debated whether or not to post this, but I'm in a lot of pain and need some perspective on the situation.

Me and my now ex (let's call her Susan) had been together for almost 2 years and had been living with each other for most of that time. Being with Susan was the happiest I've ever felt and the most I've ever trusted anyone before. The entire relationship was nothing but sparks and joy. We hardly ever argued, always communicated with each other, had the exact same sense of humor (every day was full of genuine laughter), and for lack of a better way of explaining it, she completed me. I was even saving up for a ring despite me never wanting to get married previously. 

Before I met Susan, I had a huge lack of faith in relationships due to a terrible family life and previous partners who abused and cheated on me. Thanks to Susan and I's relationship, most of these issues stopped being 'issues' and I finally started to feel like I could trust someone fully for the first time. After all of the failed relationships we'd both had before, Susan and I both knew that we were extremely fortunate to have each other. I can say without any doubt in my mind that she loved me and I loved her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the story. Despite how perfect everything seemed, at the beginning of the relationship Susan had me meet her friend ""Kevin"" who she was close to. She had known Kevin for about a year up to this point. We had drinks, talked, and had a good time at the bar we attend frequently, but on the way back home Susan dropped the bomb that she previously had a fling with Kevin. This was alarming to me because she hadn't told me that initially. On top of this, I've heard several of Susan's friends talk about how Kevin was manipulative, controlling, and overall not an honest person. There were so many red flags with this interaction. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first however, I tried to look past it and didn't want to be the guy that prevented her from having friends, but over time I grew more and more uncomfortable with it. She would text Kevin frequently throughout each day, and I couldn't shake the question of why she would keep their previous relationship from me. Eventually I confronted her and said ""If I was talking to an ex or someone I used to sleep with every day, how would that make you feel?"". This seemed to spark a realization in her and so she agreed she wouldn't talk to him anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to over a year of us being together. Susan and I share an iPad, and as I was scrolling through the photos on it I found a screenshot of her messaging Kevin happy birthday. I was obviously not happy that she would go back on her word to not speak with him anymore, and when I confronted her she said she just wanted to know how he was doing. Again, because of how perfect everything felt, I forgave her and moved past it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another time, when I was out drinking with some friends, Susan drunk messaged me asking if she could talk to Josh again. This was concerning because I couldn't understand why she would want to so badly. I told her absolutely not and when I confronted her the next day she said she really doesn't want to talk to him and that she simply had too much to drink. Once again, I forgave her and moved on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward one more time to about a week and a half ago. As we were laying in bed, and when I assume Susan thought I was asleep, I saw her looking Kevin up on Facebook and Instagram. I didn't say anything in the moment because I wasn't sure how to react and just went to sleep.  The next night, Susan and I were drinking together, dancing, having a great time, but all of a suddenly my thoughts turned to Kevin. I asked her point blank if she had been talking to him, to which she just stared at me blankly, unsure of what to say. After an awkward minute or so she said ""How long have you known?"". My stomach dropped and my chest started feeling heavy. Hearing her admit it was the worst part, as if it removed any bit of doubt left in my mind. I told her to sleep on the couch and went to bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I couldn't even look at her. At this point, Susan knew she had screwed up bad and would come into the room I was in to either make me food or apologize and say she loved me. After some reflection I went to her and told her to give me her phone. The first thing that popped up was a conversation with her and Kevin on some kind of alt accounts, with all the previous messages deleted. The first thing Susan said to him was ""Did you tell him?"". I also saw them talk about how they hadn't done anything physical, but otherwise Susan was confiding in him that she couldn't lose me and was freaking out. I opened her Photos app and found some pictures of her in her underwear. When I asked her what those were for, she said ""For you"", even though I've never seen them before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told Susan to pack up and leave. She isn't on the lease, so in the past week she's completely finished moving out save a few small items. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm posting here is because I'm unsure whether or not I did the right thing. I've been through a lot of relationships and I've never felt any kind of connection this deep with someone before. I know how rare it is to find a soulmate, and if there's anything that I am sure of it's that she loves me deeply. I have a lot of friends who have all said that I need to break up with her because I'll never trust her again, but I can't stop thinking about how dumb I was when I was 23 and how hard it is to find someone with this deep of a bond. It felt like Susan and I had something so perfect besides the Kevin stuff, we trusted each other deeply, laughed every day, and didn't have any doubts that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing and hearing (from her friends and family) how broken she has been since this has all happened tells me how deeply she regrets her mistake and would do anything to take it back. I just don't want to miss the chance to be with someone that I may never find again, despite the immature decisions she made. Is this something we can work past or should I consider this over and done?

"So, for context:

My parents \[58M - 57F\] had very messed up ideas of parenting when raising me. There was a lot of beating, when I stood up for myself about the physical abuse, they turned it some pretty good emotional damage. In essence, they were very strict adn religious, and I grew up with a deep fear of disappoint them with every little thing I did. 

All that resulted in anxiety and depression, that took me years to work on and required me to leave their house as soon as I could just so I coudl heal. 

I've never strained my relationship with them, learned to tell them the issues they've caused me, and have always felt like it was my duty to help them raise my little sister better or at least help her manage the situation with them better. 

Fast forward to five years since I've left the house, my sister is now about to turn 18, graduated high school and is applying for college. She's a good kid but very spoiled (by me as well), to the point where she doesn't really appreciate the things we do for her. 

Now I'm also in a completely different time of my life, soon to start living with my partner, making big ""adult"" plans, and just tired of my parents relying on me to deal with her.

"I recently started this new Job as a cook.. I started 3 months ago and so far it's been going great. I don't have my own transportation as it has been needing repairs for months and I haven't had a chance To start fixing it yet.
So I've been relying on my fiancé to take me back-and-forth to work. It's only a fifteen minute drive.

About a month ago,
We had Someone new get hired as a shift lead training to be manager. At that time I didn't have a phone number. I had lost my service due to non-payment.
So to keep in contact with this new hire When I needed to talk to him, I just gave him my fiancé's number and told him text her when he needs to talk to me.

I then told my fiancé that I gave him her number and told her the same thing that when he texts Please let me know because when he texts you. He's going to be texting to get hold of me, And I want you to let me know.

The next day he texted and she didn't tell me at all and instead of her taking me to work. She had texted him and asked him if he can come and give me a ride which made me absolutely mad. Because she could have easily taken me to work and didn't tell me until he was already here pretty much.

I got mad at her and told her to delete his number and stop texting him and 3 days later. I went and bought myself a new phone I went to work and gave him my number and told him he didn't have to text her anymore because I got a new number and he said okay.

A month later I thought she'd stop talking to him. But here we are, she was texting him yesterday. And didn't tell me, I don't know what they were talking about. She deleted the chat before she picked me up from work last night.
She then texted him when we got home. But she says she's not trying to cheat. She just wants a friend that she can talk to. Because she has no friend.  She doesn't get herself out there. She's not social in any way. She really just does uber eats and then comes home aside from occasional shopping. But I had told her. I didn't want her to talk to him solely because of her past multiple times throughout our relationship. She has talked to other guys and it has gone a bad direction every time. That wasn't good for our relationship.
But somehow we prevail and we're still together. After everything she's done to me.

My trust for her has been in shambles for a while. She never talks to me anymore. But jumps at any chance she gets to talk to another guy. So when she starts doing things like this again? I just don't know what to think my mentality runs rampant. 

I had told her last night that I didn't want her talking to him Again. I grabbed her phone and she immediately jumped up and tried to take it back when she saw that I was about to click on the messages. I told her if she would have just laid there and let me read them. I would have had a problem with her Texting him again about our problems instead of her coming and talking to me about them. I said the fact that you jumped up and tried to take your phone from me after you saw me clicking messages After telling me that you are comfortable laying down makes it an issue. Because the fact that you did that means you obviously see something wrong with what you're doing.
Otherwise you wouldn't have tried to leap up like that and take your phone.

She says she didn't want to make me mad. She's been trying to avoid that.
And that's why she's been hiding it.

I didn't want to but I gave her an ultimatum. I told her that we would be over if she continued to text him, then I asked
Are you going to continue texting him.
And she just says will you be mad if I do.
I tell her yes and she just sits there in silence like always.
I tell her that my answer is no when she asked if she could text him and she's just not taking no for an answer. She has some dying need to text him it seems.
She said she is still gonna talk to him 
And I said we can't stay together if you can't do this for us

"My fiancée of 10 years has had some history of quitting jobs. Ever since she started working, she would quit a job if she didn’t like it. Some jobs was one shift. There’s been at least 4 jobs where she didn’t last a week. 
Lately she was at a job for over a year that was in her field but had a toxic work environment which she decided to leave (and which I fully supported). She was able to find a better job in the same field, only to quit two weeks later. As we’re planning for a wedding, it’s been difficult to keep up with all of the expenses of daily living without two incomes (and of course for a wedding that’s been mostly planned out). It’s been a month now since she’s been unemployed, and has only been applying to a limited amount of jobs, not understanding the urgency of the situation at hand. Any attempt of a conversation to encourage her to find a job results in anger directed at me. 

I have asked her to find a passion project or hobby before taking a step of working a new career, or a simpler job that maybe doesn’t pay as much but will keep her busy, but that hasn’t resulted in anything.

Additional context:
- - - 
She is someone who struggles with anxiety and has been on anxiety medication for several years now. When she was at her original year-long job, there were very few instances where she brought up her anxiety, until the environment became toxic. Yesterday, she informed me that she may return back to said job because they are hiring again which has really confused me because she had initially left because of the work environment. 

We are not well off by any means, and don’t have any financial support in terms of housing, or wedding expenses. She is also still paying off student loans.

Without being too vague, I’m hoping to get some advice on my next steps. Should I be more persuasive in the urgency of finding work? Should I be more patient and allow her time and space?

TL;DR: My gf vented about My past mistakes and relationships problems to an old male friend and lied to me about meeting him for a coffee. I confronted her and she told me nothing happened and she never had feelings for him.

As the title says, i have this gut feeling that My gf cheated on me, not phisically, but emotionally.
4 years ago (6years into our relationship) i started feeling that something was off by the way she was messaging. After a while she tells me that it’s been a while since she wasn’t happy with the relationship, that she felt that i wasn’t putting enough effort (that was real, i’m a surgeon and had to study a lot) and that she could not continue that way and needed things to change. I understood how she felt and promised her that things would change.

Some days later she tells me without any context that this old friend of her (last time she saw him or talked with him was when we got together) added her on Instagram and she wrote him to know how he and his girlfriend were doing. From then i had this strange gut feeling and i asked her if she wanted to break up with me because she started to fall for Someone else. She told me that he was only a friend, they were talking for a month and a half at that point and that he was venting with her because he was having problems with his gf (he felt that she wanted to break up with him).

Things between us started to improve, but this gut feeling was there and they were still in touch, so i tried to read the chat, but was only able to read one message (she told him “you should do what i’ve done, tell her to change her behaviour or you should leave her”).

I then asked her if i could read the whole chat, she got very defensive and told me there was no thing between them and that i should believe her after 6 years together. There she confessed me that after a while of him venting she started to vent too, telling him she was unhappy, that she felt unloved and that it seemed i dind’t care about the relationship. She even told him past mistakes i made.

I believed her, but this gut feeling came back again, so she cut him off completely. (They talked for about 3 months in total)

Time passed and i kept thinking that she was hiding something, but she kept telling me that they only vented for a while and there was no thing else.

After 3 years i could not hold it anymore, so i gave her an ultimatum: “tell me what you are hiding, if i discover anything later it’s over”
There she confessed that he invited her for a coffee, and she accepted without telling me because for her it was not a big deal and didn’t want to argue over a coffe with a friend. She later realized the mistake she Made, but didn’t tell me because she thought i would end the relationship.

She then told me that this friend tried to contact her after his gf broke up with him and she replied to not contact her again because it Made me unconfortable.
At that point (it was one year ago) i wanted to read the whole chat, but she deleted everything.

A year passed and i still think about this and always think “what if?”.
Now she started a new job with a lot of male co-workers and keep thinking that if she vented with that guy it will happen again since she believes in male-fermale friendship and i don’t.

I don’t know if i can live with this, i feel like i get up everyday and have to forgive her everyday. I don’t know if i can trust her.

She has always shown me how much she loves and cares for me, supported me even when i was depressed and had panick attacks. The only mistake i can think of is this one.
I feel like she crossed a boundary as i always told her i don’t like her spending 1-1 time alone with another men.

I confronted My gf about the issues i have.
From her POV, talking to an old friend was not a big deal and she just wanted to know how he and his gf were doing. Initially he vented, after a while she started venting too because she felt neglected for some time in the reationship.
She told him old mistakes i Made and never told me because she was scared of my reaction and she didn’t want to lose me over an arguement. From what she told me he was in a similar situation so from her POV she was just talking to someone who could understand her.

The thing here is that i really find it difficult to take her words for granted since she hid and deleted the conversations and lied about going out for a coffee with him in a public place where they talked about their problems in the relationship.

The thing is i was never confortable with her spending time alone with a new friend (i don’t mind friends that were there before me), not because i don’t trust her, but because i don’t believe in male-female friendship and i think he was trying to monkey-branch because he knew his gf was going to leave him sooner or later.
(This was later confirmed by the fact that he tried to contact her again after his gf broke up with him).
So from My perspective this was a clear boundary, from her perspective, she just wanted to be free to get a coffee with an old friend without me being jelous.

The thing that bothers me is that she told me she needed changes when his friend was having issues in his relationship and i immediately thought she wanted to leave me for him.

Now i really don’t know what to do, a part of me wants to believe her because in 10 years she always showed me how much she loves me, was always there for me and always supported me. Another part of me thinks i’ll never be able to overcome the trust issues.
I talked about this with close friends Who told me this seems like a minor issue, but it’s been eating me from the inside for 4 years.
Any suggestion? Currently going to therapy to try and fix the issue, but i like receving opinions from the outside and writing things down helps me.

"My boyfrined of over 3 years told me that I don’t suggest paying for us, and that I don’t even bring money with me. He said he don’t mind paying for me, it’s just the fact that I ,,basically expect him to pay"" and don’t suggest paying for us or just for myself.

 I don’t know how to handle this situation, it shocked me, since it is not true at all. Whenever he paid for something, I always wanted to pay the next time.  I never had a problem with paying, on the contrary, I actually loved treating him and wanted to make our expenses as equal as possible. I made sure I’m making it equal even tho I am a student with no regular income and he works full time job AND has literally ten-thousands of euros/dollars on his bank account.

Would you tell (or even think about) that to your partner who you plan to settle down with? Do you think this mindset (a complete contradiction to actual reality) of his could be later projected onto other things? Cuz I am worried whether he views/understands other things in our relationship the absolute opposite way.

I am a 23M dating a 21F. I recently accepted a job as a manufacturing engineer at a company near where I graduated from and where she is still attending. My partner is a very hard worker and managed to get an internship with a company and worked part time throughout the school year and made enough money to pay for all of her needs and send some money home to her family. From some previous internships I made enough money to last me through the school year and into the summer 


When I graduated from college I didn’t really   have any promising full time work lined up within my field of study. I took about a month off just to relax after completing college. I had a few trips lined up to see my girlfriend seeing that our homes are on opposite sides of the country. After a month I started working part time at a Walgreens and started seriously looking for full time work once again. During this period of time things were a little rocky between us because this was the first time we were truly long distance. Then a few unexpected bills came up and my savings dropped pretty significantly and since I was working a minimum wage job I was having trouble building my saving back up (for those wondering the company I previously worked at had recently cut there work force in half and wasn’t nt planning on hiring at the time). I was open with my partner about this and they informed that it was alright and they didn’t mind taking more of the financial burden when it came to visiting one another. So we continued seeing each other about once a month. This whole time I worked at the Walgreens as many hours as they would offer while still looking for part time work. As the months went on a topic of conversation that kept being brought up was my partners desire for me to spend more on date or treat her to more things and I would explain that I would if was able to as well as meet my personal and our relationship financial goals because we were planning on going to Disney for our anniversary. As we got closer to the trip I noticed she was starting to get annoyed that when she would ask how I was feeling I would be honest and say that I didn’t like my work and I was stressed because more expenses were coming in but the amount I was making was not increasing. She told me that she felt I was ignoring how she felt and she was right. During this time she still kept bringing up about me paying for dates and I answered the same as I had been. Eventually 5 months after graduating I had a promising job offer (actually the one I have now) but something happened and it looked like I wasn’t going to get the job. When I shared the new we both shared how we felt about this. My partner made it very clear she was upset about having to continue to bear the financial weight and she was tired of hearing about how jobs weren’t panning out for me. This resulted in us not talking very much because I worked so much and didn’t have a set scheduled more than a week out so I couldn’t really plan much to do I am also more of a home body she isn’t. Eventually I got my job and she was happy for me. After that point she wanted to talk more about how I felt. Unsure of how to approach this I hesitated to answer at first but eventually told her. I felt like a horrible partner for months because of my financial situation. She apologized as I got closer to my start date I told I was contemplating taking out a loan about as much as 1.5 of my paychecks so I could pay it pretty quickly and get my affairs in order. I was told about how irresponsible I was, and how she couldn’t believe I considered that, etc. before not really talking with me for 2 days. Eventually when I got a hold of her she admitted finances were a trigger for her because for a time she was homeless and her family took out loans just to feed them. I didn’t know this and reassured her I would get the money from a few friend and pay them back. As well as letting her fears and trauma were valid. I just don’t know what to do she doesn’t like to talk about her past more so the bad or traumatic things this often results in interactions like this and they get worse everytime. It feel like I am playing minesweeper with no indication where the bombs are until I step on them.

My husband is an alcoholic. 
Today is his birthday. 
Two weeks ago he scheduled an appointment, with my help, to see a doctor to get prescribed anti anxiety medication, that would lead to a better state of mind and therefore hopefully help him stop drinking. 
I had an interview at 9am today, his appointment was at 11am (mountain time). I come home from my interview around 9:50, ready to accompany him or see him off only to find him upset about the manager group chat at work and absolutely hammered. He started screaming about various things and smashing his bedside table, said everyone could fuck off including me and said he was too drunk to go to the appointment he's been looking forward to for weeks ( he's never had any sort of medication or mental health assistance and I found out this was free with his insurance). I called and found out there are no new patient appointments at all for months to come unless we drive out of our way to do so, so rescheduling is not really an option.
He then said fuck it I'll go and got dressed, followed by collapsing on the floor minutes later and apologizing saying he was going to throw up and physically couldn't do it. I took off his shoes and jacket, carried him, laid him down on the couch, gave him a trash can, and covered him up. He then began to apologize and told me if I wanted a divorce he understands and he's sorry he couldn't be the man I needed. I called and cancelled the appointment.

He's literally been pulling most of the financial weight since I lost my job in June, I get my much needed medicine through his jobs insurance ( that he is starting to hate especially after this mornings curfuffle in the manager group chat) and overall yes he has anger issues and alcoholism, but he does his best and I'm appreciative of that. 
Regardless we have been through a lot of REALLY bad arguments, some physical, this is on both sides, though moreso from him, and I will not go into detail.
I know it stems from a combination of mental illness, substance abuse, and neglect in younger years, but..... Yes. I am tired. I want him to get better so bad and I want to be there for that, but I don't know how much more I can take. I have a surprise party planned for him later today and I don't know if that will help or hurt things at this point. He feels like I deserve better, and I feel like he is capable of being better with proper love and support and help, but I don't know if I'm the one for that anymore. I love him to death, but I'm tired of seeing him hurt himself and then me as well. I don't know what to do anymore. 
I fucking hate alcohol.

Why did he get THAT fucking drunk before something HE wanted. I get if it was an appointment for me he was just tagging along with, yeah I'd still be upset, but in that case it's more for me than literally to help him overcome years of anxiety and depression and substance abuse.

Why am I still here? Is love that powerful? Am I an actual fucking idiot? 

What do I do? Leave and let both of us heal, or try to help him be the person I know he is.

My mental health is also garbage and without my medication I've nearly lost jobs so I'm not blaming him for being ill, but I do think I could see more effort to remedy the situation.

Part of his stress is me getting fired and not making NEARLY as much, my interview today was for a position similar to my previous one that will pay just as well so I didn't expect him to be piss drunk when I got back. I'm very confident about the interview and have been doing everything I can to find a new job that helps sustain our way of living as well as take the load off him. I feel it a bit necessary to mention I was technically the ""bread winner"" before losing my job, but his pay is not far behind what I was making and we both provided 50/50 as far as bills were concerned with me normally taking care of fun expenses as well as splurging more often than I should have on both of us.

I just don't know if I should finally call it quits after 8 years of hoping things would get better and just let us both go our on ways and heal, or stick by the person I know I love at his core, but has A LOT of trauma, anger, and substance abuse to still deal with and handle the consequences of what that means by being here while he goes through those things.

Do I accept his offer for divorce, or stay and try to continue to help him through this?

Some back story on this: we talked over Snapchat for years and at one point finally went out on a date. The date was amazing and after some more hanging out with her and other dates I asked to become my girlfriend. I love this woman to death but the issue that I have ran into is the fact that all of my friends have said that I was a different person around her and she was controlling and manipulative. To provide some examples if I had a conversation for a couple hours on life stuff with my parents she would be furious that I wasn’t already at her house to spend time with her. She got rid of her bestfriend and then when I wanted to hang out with my bestfriend she looked at me and goes well I got rid of my bestfriend. Stuff like that in terms of manipulativeness. Then the clingeyness that she displayed was noticeable to all. I couldn’t be around a single female even with her right there without her getting visibly upset that I was even saying hi to another woman. This jealousy even led to me blocking my best friends little sister because she just didn’t like her and wasn’t invited to her graduation party. Then finally she said that the only way for her to sleep is if I was over at her house sleeping with her. I felt obligated to go over there even at the cost of getting stuff done at my own house. I was in a lot of strain with my family and friends over this stuff over the past year. Recently I broke up with her but we still text and check up on one another. She is going to therapy and seeing a relationship coach about all the things that were occurring. This post is most of the negative things that occurred during our relationship but there was much good during this time frame. I’m not sure if maybe she’s a narcissist or what but I really want things to be drama free and be with her. She’s trying to get better so my question is do I give it a couple months and see if things have changed and if it has get back together or drop it completely?

But we have no similar hobbies or interest. And i think that the only reason we are together is because of our child. We almost broke up 2 years ago but i persuaded her not to.

"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been dating long distance for just over a year now. I had to move states for my job when we first started getting to know each other and he thereafter enlisted in a military program so we didn't get to see each other for majority of our relationship. 
He had only joined the program because he wasn't able to get a job with the field he studied, otherwise he says he would have never put himself in this dangerous military-like job and sacrificed all the months of not seeing each other.
I make almost double what he does, which I would not have mentioned if it didn't pertain to one of the reasons why I'm questioning. He barely makes a living wage and hence isn't able to do much for me, and I want to clarify I can well take care of myself and afford to do things like my own nails, hair etc. However I always see my other girl friends getting spoiled and treated and I always end up feeling really envious. He has always offered to do all those things for me, however I'm aware of his financial position and I wouldn't feel right accepting that from him. He always says he's working hard so he can afford a lifestyle to my standard, since I am really high maintenence and he knows it's always been my dream to have a big family. He's really into taking care of me, often speaking of how he'd like me to be a full-time stay at home wife, because it's something I've always wanted. 
He recently graduated from the program and is now back at home with his parents. I have also moved back to my hometown for the holidays, we are around an hour drive away from each other currently. He now works the usual 8 hours, just the times differing. Eg, some days it'll be from 6 to 2, other days it'll be from 7 to 4.
The issue comes with what's going on now. All of these great things we talk about, or things that I like about the relationship is always future dated things. Like I can't wait to be spoiled in the future. I can't wait till he's used to working so we can see each other more often. I can't wait till he is able to buy his own car so we don't have to keep asking our parents to pick and drop us off like a high school couple.
I really love him, we are aligned on everything we want for the future and he always makes me smile and laugh when we are together, but I'm filled with so much of hurt and rage when we're apart because he's almost always busy and I barely get to see him. Whenever we see each other, it's only because I asked if he could make it to see me, it's never initiave he takes on his own, which he says is because he doesn't have his own car and because he earns so little, taking an uber would really strain him. 
I don't know I just sometimes find myself wondering if this is the hardships people talk about when reaching milestones in long term relationships, or is it not a hardship but a pattern in our relationship ? 
I sometimes feel that I give more into the relationship than him, because I often feel neglected though I never make him feel the same. I don't know if it's because I'm clingy, but when he's busy at work for hours and then after work he's busy with family, I get a little down. Because I can't speak to him when I want to like you would be able to with someone working in corporate like myself 
I don't know what to do I guess, because I don't want to lose the love of my life but on the other hand I don't want to stay in a relationship where I feel so sad over the lack of attention. I'm also really young, and this is one of the first real relationships I've had. I also am worried that I was just the girl there through his bad times, and now that things have gotten better hes just so used to treating me like a long distance girlfriend because he knows I've set that standard already that he's not gonna treat me like the way I see other girls get treated by their boyfriends (like the initiative they take and the way they are always the ones wanting to be physically with them) and always have excuses about his work.

"We  have been together almost 2 years, and got married this year. Recently she waited till the end of the day to get mad at me for not buying something for her. I was buying souvenirs for some of my family. I saw she was looking at some items and I was intending to buy them for her. I got distracted by my parents who were with me and she already bought the item. I did apologize and tell her that I regretted that she bought it before I could say anything, and would try and do better in the future. 

She then mentioned that she was instantly annoyed when it looked like I wasn’t ready to buy it for her. This is understandable. I told her next time she needs to say these things to me on the spot and I will try and remedy the situation there as opposed to later. In my opinion dealing with something like that then as opposed to later is healthier than waiting for later to be angry about it. Plus she has a history of holding grudges which is why I decided to discuss with her this time when something bothers her she needs to discuss it with me right then as to not lot it simmer in her mind.

She kind of agreed, but mentioned that she has issues saying anything nice during those moments. I said I understand but I still think it’s better to say something right then so the problem can be resolved and healing can begin.

Then she said something that threw me off. She said she needed some toxicity in our relationship since it’s too nice. 

I personally couldn’t wrap my mind around it and before we got married I told her I am not really the kind of man who looks for fights. I really hate it and try to avoid it. I made this adamant throughout our entire relationship. It’s not a surprise. She always said she likes that about me, but now this?
I realize this story sounds like some 4 year old shit but I swear it’s real.

I did talk about how I would always try and be productive in our arguments, but if she starts looking for fights all the time I’ll eventually give up and become apathetic to them. Which I don’t want. She again said she understood and would try and work on it but she isn’t sure how well she can keep that up. I know nobody is perfect and some fights are inevitable, but I don’t want this normalized.

Any good advice? I love this girl so much and I would say that it isn’t a big issue but I can see it building. I want help to deal with it before it gets worse.

A little about me and her
I grew up in an abusive home and my parents split and so did she. She has major anxiety issues as well.

"Hi, it’s a throwaway account. I’m 19F (tomorrow is my birthday, I’ll be 20) and my partner is 22M. We’ve been together since 2018.  
  
The thing is, I got a haircut yesterday. It was around my shoulders and it’s very messy and hard to control, and I wanted to feel fresh when I start my twenties. I let my partner know and we agreed on cutting around 2 inches and that’s it, but it ended up shorter than I expected. It’s not a pixie cut but it’s not around my shoulders like we agreed before. The back is around the end of my ear, the fronts are separately cut.  
  
Anyway.  
  
I was happy that I had a haircut because it felt fresh, finally got rid of the damage in my hair. Yeah it’s shorter than I expected. We are long-distance so I videocalled my partner and his mood immediately went down. He is especially stressed due to his studies so this was sort of a bad thing upon all that.  
  
He doesn’t like short hair. He is attracted to feminine things, he told me that. I knew that. He told me that my hair looks masculine. On top of it, he had sent some very big birthday present for me and he told me that I ruined it (it didn’t arrive yet but it will tomorrow).  
  
It was yesterday. His messages were cold. Today, they got a little softer and we called again. We had an hour of call, just talking about that.  
  
I tried to tell him why I got the haircut, and apologized that it’s shorter than he expected. The thing is, he is attracted to my hair, and he lost some attraction when I cut it. He says I look like a boy and he doesn’t feel attracted, valid, I understand. I don’t look like a boy, though. And it’s shorter than we agreed on, so I understand how he felt shock and sadness or anything.  
  
I tried to tell him that my preference is shorter, but yes I had agreed on not this short, so this is bad on my part. And he has a right to have a preference and an opinion. Yesterday, he was telling me in his initial shock “You don’t respect my opinions” but I really do. Just this thing messed up. And today, we were better on call, and we actually communicated.  
  
He tried to tell me that people sometimes lose physical attraction depending on things but I think I don’t understand some of it. I would love him even if he went and shaved his eyebrows. It would be shocking to me but if it makes him happy, why not? But that’s my weird thing I guess. He told me that he wants me to look “normal” in his words, like normal and feminine like he wants. And he told me that the only thing he doesn’t like is my hair, that we had both agreed on the length but yeah I messed that up. But it was an accident.  
  
I told him that he can’t change me, he can accept or we can compromise. And he told me “it’s not changing, I’m trying to make you normal” and I tried to explain that it’s still changing. In the end, we agreed to choose a different haircut when it gets longer, something we both agree upon. Compromising.  
  
At some point, I just started crying. I hadn’t cried for quite a while. I don’t know. Tomorrow is my birthday. I’ve always had relatively lonely birthdays since I was like 10 or something, so my birthdays always make me horribly sad, to the point of self-destructive thoughts. But I don’t act on them. I just don’t like it being celebrated anymore. Just a little congratulations from close friends and family is okay and more than that makes me sad.  
  
Anyway, I wanted to enter my twenties differently. I wanted to feel fresh. I wanted to get rid of the damaged hair ends and actually feel neat. Wind felt very nice on my face too, I was okay. Shorter than I expected, but I was feeling okay about it. It resembled those ancient statues in my favorite museum, and I work on those statues because that’s my major. It felt sweet actually. Symbolic, if you will. I don’t know if it makes sense but it felt like entire history was in my heart, my soul. I always feel spiritual about my major. It was a breaking moment, sort of. Stupid to feel that deep but anyway.  
  
Then I cried and I feel numb now. Doesn’t matter. We ended the call well though. We are okay. I feel like a leaf in the wind and it doesn’t matter. Hair doesn’t matter, nothing does (in a good way!!!) I’m good. I’ll always be me, no matter the hair. I can grow it out, I don’t know why I made a big deal out of it. It was a stupid move on both our parts to argue about it, but if he feels less attraction, I can grow it out I guess. I just hate the feeling of it, tickles my neck and makes me sweat but I can tie it if I grow it further.  
  
I wish there was a way to speedrun life. This is such a petty issue and it makes me feel so stupidly sad for no reason. When I graduate (two more years to go!!) I will have worse problems to think about, and these will feel like a joke. Perhaps I should sit down and enjoy year twenty.  
  
  
  
My question is: Have you ever experienced something like this? We agreed on choosing a haircut together, but I still feel weird and numb and all that. I didn’t want to cry, timing was bad too, and I felt confident but now I don’t feel like myself to feel anything at all (because I’m tired of classes tbh). How did you solve your situation? Is our solution good? I may send him the reddit post at some point too, I let him know I was writing one to ask for advice. He found it needless because we already reached a solution, yes we did, but I still wanted to hear people's advice.",My (19F) partner (22M) hates my short haircut.

"Okay, I’m sure everyone rolls their eyes at the title, but recently I’ve been conflicted. 


I (20F) met a guy (20M) at university. He started as a mutual friend but from the beginning of November we’ve been spending lots of time together and have become friends. He’s also approached me with some personal issues that I helped him through, and recently he’s done the same for me. 


Our personalities and core values are painfully similar, and I found it so easy to connect with him (I’m slow to trust people so it’s nice to be comfortable with someone). Our approach to resolving conflict is identical, and we prioritise similar things in relationships (we’ve had a conversation about it). We always seem to be on the same page. 


I’m actually hesitant to like him because we just got along so well, so quickly. I don’t think we will fall out, but it seems too good to be true.  Where’s the catch??


I’ve tried to devil’s advocate the situation and think why I SHOULD NOT date him… 
All I got was 1. our quick connection was too good to be true, time might reveal dealbreakers. 
2.  I value my friendship with him a lot and don’t want to risk losing that — I’ll rather stay friends to have that guaranteed friendship. 


I know people can be friends with ex’s, but I don’t want it to be awkward — we are in the same housing complex (different buildings) same friend group,  and eat meals with the group in the same dining hall. 



I’m slow to trust people and never liked someone like this. I never expected that I would develop these feelings after only a few months of knowing someone. I tend to take things too seriously and would only consider (any) relationship with serious + long term in mind. I’m a brutal realist and don’t take relationships (romantic or otherwise) lightly, so this is a big thing for me.  I have an anxiety disorder so I’ve really thought this through haha!
I’ve never been in a relationship, he had one previously but not serious. 


He liked another girl at the beginning of term but after seeing her twice he decided that they aren’t compatible at all, and he was disappointed. Yesterday we hung out and he says he thinks someone in our group maybe likes him. He’s closer with her than I am, but I didn’t expect it. He said he’s not sure how he feels about her yet, it’s a recent hunch.



In an ideal world he will ask me to consider a relationship with him. I really believe we are compatible, but I don’t want to ruin what we have. My anxiety tells me that he deserves someone better than me, but that’s just insecurity + catastrophising. I also don’t want to interfere with this new girl, if there’s potentially a relationship starting there (she is the nicest person and I don’t want to upset her because I like being her friend, too!). 



We’re on Christmas holiday at the moment but we text daily and probably will meet up in January before lectures start. 


What should I do? 

Tell him? Wait and see if he approaches me?

"TLDR: I made some big mistakes in this relationship, but my ex did too, and now he keeps calling me to vent because he wants closure. Am I wrong to block him, and try to clear my name to mutual friends? 

Tw// sui*cideMy ex and I dated on again off again for almost a year. In this time we broke up 4 times, and it was always me wanting us to get back together. The reason why we stayed friends every time we broke up, is because he would threaten suicide. Any time I tried to go no contact with him, he would have an extremely scary attempt, one of the times he was in the hospital for almost a month, all of these requiring me and my roommates to desperately try to save his life. 

The reason why we had broken up in the past is because I was worried he was relying on me too much for his mental health. He would constantly guilt trip me and say stuff like “I don’t know what I would do if you canceled plans on me” (implying hurting himself or od’ing etc) which made me uncomfortable. 

Other than this blatantly manipulative behavior, he’s a lovely guy and I adore him. The last time we broke up, we were actually no contact for about 4 months before I ran into him at a party and I felt like he had really gotten better this time. so we got back together. Things were great for awhile, and I felt like he really was better. After a bit though, I started to get this feeling that things weren’t right. I just didn’t see him Long term, little things he did got on my nerves more than he should… etc. 
I thought the same thing I had thought before- which is maybe I have relationship ocd and am pushing away healthy love now that I have it just because I’ve only been in toxic relationships. I eventually decided even if this was true, the relationship was weighing on me. I broke up with him again, and he was really angry with me. 

He’s upset that we broke up so many times in the past and that I was the main one to choose for us to get back together. I apologized profusely for the rollercoaster and apologized that I didn’t have what I wanted figured out and that hurt him. We’ve been no contact for about 4 weeks, but he finds excuses to call me at inconvenient hours (midnight, or once while I was in the library)  to yell at me and demand more apologies. He gets upset if I dont want to speak with him or tell him I’ve already apologized, or if I tell him why I made the decision I made. He says I am making excuses and not holding myself accountable which is so frustrating because I’ve beat myself up over this and felt like a horrible person for a month which is partly why I stayed for so long with him after having doubts, because I convinced myself there must be something deeply wrong with me, and I’ve taken full accountability and let him yell at me for hours uninterrupted because I’m just glad he’s not attempting suc*de. 


Now, he’s going around telling mutual friends that I “f*cked him over” and that I’m heartless. I’m so upset because I care about these people and it’s not fair what he’s saying. Especially when he knows all the shit I could tell about what he’s put me and my friends through with all his attempts at hurting himself for my attention. But he knows I wouldn’t tell anyone because he would use that as more ammo that I’m a horrible person. 
I should also mention that one of the times he called me, he did it to yell at me for moving on too quick because he found i out I had a drunk kiss with a girl at a party. HE KNOWS I HAD THIS DRUNK KISS BECAUSE HE JUSY GOT DONE SLEEPING with the SAME GIRL, and CALLED ME RIGHT AFTER because she told him. 

My friends have told me to just block him, but I feel horrible doing it. I know I messed up and hurt him and I want to be able to hear out his feelings and offer explanations if it gives him closure. But I’ve gotten to the point where I think he’s just abusing my empathy and thinks he can just yell at me for anything he wants because he knows I’ll apologize and listen. 
Deep down though, I have this fear that he’s right. That I am a horrible person. I feel endlessly horrible for hurting someone I care about through breaking up with him and getting back together, and he also thinks I didn’t show up for him in the relationship enough/ was a bare minimum girlfriend. 

Do I just block him, and then work to avoid him at all costs? Or do I keep being apologetic and cordial until he calms down and moves on and then maybe we can be distant friends? And do I tell our mutual friends the truth about him, or do I keep being a bigger person??",Am I(20f) an asshole for being done apologizing to my ex?

"So I've(24F) been in this relationship for 4 1/2 years at this point with my boyfriend(23M), right? We've been having some rough times recently since he has had to move out of my family home when my parents said they were over him being here.  

I've come to the realization recently that I'm pretty sure Ive been abused my whole relationship. It sucks to come to the realization, truly and it sucks that it took so long. I did some not great things in the beginning of our relationship that I'll tell you. 

I had just broken up with my ex (who was abusive, shocker) of 2 1/2 years...I got into a relationship with my partner a few months after we had started talking. He hit me up on tinder where I was trying to find friends from feeling isolated in my other relationship. We both connected really fast and it felt amazing. Anyways, besides the point, I had pictures of my ex on my phone still. He went through my phone multiple times without permission after the first like 3 times and saw that there were still more photos. I had thought I had removed ever single picture all of those times, but apparently 2 1/2 years holds a lot of memories. I admit, I could have been more thorough, it just really hurt at that moment to get rid of so many memories not even a month after breaking up. I was also still talking to some male friends I had previously hooked up with. Completely platonic feelings towards those guys when I was in a relationship. Again, I could have handled this better. He got mad that I was talking to them, understandably. So I blocked every one of them and stopped talking to them. Ever since, I have been trying to make up for those things that hurt him. 

He moved into my family home shortly after we started dating, for 4 years. In that time, COVID hit, we weren't allowed to get jobs because my parents are older and didn't want to risk it. We doorsashed as much as we could. We both got jobs last year. We would do chores in the house, pay rent when we got jobs and all that. We slacked a little bit at times, ngl so my parents weren't always happy and we had some fights. 

He always stayed out of it. My parents were mad that he wasn't picking up slack for things. For instance, I had foot surgery and my grandma died within the same week. I wasn't supposed to be walking on my foot at all and he said he was too tired or didn't want to interact with my parents, but wouldn't eat if I wasn't going to go out and cook something. So, I went out and cooked shit. He cooked for me for the first year, all the other 3 years, it was me. Even at the place he's staying at now. I felt bad that he would always say that he wouldn't eat because he doesn't want to ever leave the room. So I would feel guilty and make him food. 

I isolated myself for 4 years, saw my grandparents on my dad's side 3 or 4 times in the 4 years of him living here and they only live like 25mins away. We were both invited many, many times, but since he never wanted to see my family and would be pissy if I wanted to go...I didn't go. 

I never saw work friends outside of work, even though I've worked there for a year and 8 months, until literally last week because he would never want to go with me but would never want me to go to a bar without him, even if it's female friends. 

I think that shows enough of the point for now, there's definitely more though. If you have questions, please ask. 

TLDR; Like I(24F) said earlier, we've been having problems recently. He(23M) texted me the other night and gave me an out..but I didn't take it and said I wanted to work on us...I just don't get it.

"I've \[M28\] known my friend ""Markus"" \[M28\] for 10+ years. As I reflect back, Markus and I were close. In the last 5 or so years, Markus has been pulling away.

So last weekend was our Christmas party and Markus just said hello and asked how my engagement and such was going. I told him and he walked away and started laughing and joking with the other guys. I didn't know why he was treating me differently.

My brother \[M24\] is a close friend with Markus so I asked him what Markus's deal was. My brother hit me with a ton of bricks- ""Markus doesn't consider you as a friend anymore"".

Then my brother unloaded on me-

Him: ""Was Markus there when your previous engagement fell apart?""

Me: ""Yes""

Him: ""When was the last time you talked to him?""

I checked my messages. Last message was from Markus back in November asking if I wanted to go to the game. I remember reading it but I guess I forgot to respond.

Him: ""When's the last time you reached out to Markus?""

Him: ""Long story short, Markus told me that he had enough of your negligence. If you don't consider him a friend, he said it cuts both ways and you're just an acquaintance by association.""

I tried reaching out to Markus to apologize but he's pretty much blocked me on everything. What can I do at this point to salvage whatever is left of our friendship?

TL;DR- was unknowingly neglecting a friend. Now this friend wants nothing to do with me and it cutting me out of his life.

What can I do to salvage whatever is left of our friendship?

UPDATE:

At the advice of one commenter, I did email Markus as a Hail Mary. I apologized and asked what I could have done. Markus's answer was not good-

""Just note, I'm only answering this so you'll leave your brother alone. You were there for me when &lt;his ex&gt; was &lt;the a word&gt; me and helped me through my breakup. For that I will always appreciate that. I will remember the past adventures we had.

I'm not blaming this new friend group for where you fell short but I knew that you were phasing us out when we went on that trip and you were on the phone with them half the fucking time. But it was the sunk-cost fallacy for me and I thought it was the shine of a new friendship so I left it alone.

Then &lt;my ex&gt; came along and you vanished. You know we used to joke and make bets of whether or not you'd show up. You simply didn't.

When she left, I was there for you in a second. Did you know I was seeing &lt;his then&gt; girlfriend that day after not seeing her for 2 weeks? Not even for a second did abandoning you cross my mind.

Friendship cuts both ways. It looks like you chose your new friend group. It's not my place to say but &lt;our other close friend&gt; has already phased you out. He doesn't bother asking if you're coming any more. None of us do. The only reason you know about these things is your brother. I honestly don't think you'd give a fuck if we never asked.

I hope nothing bad happens between you and &lt;my fiancee&gt;. Unlike last time you had a devastating breakup, we were there. This time, we won't.

"My partner and I have been together for a few years, long distance. Things were going great so we decided to do a practice run of living together this summer, which led to him formally moving in about 3 months ago. 

Since then, he’s been struggling with severe anxiety and it’s beginning to impact our relationship. 

He’s began therapy and is trying new medication to get things under control and I really believe is trying to fix things. He also is on new meds for a thyroid condition that impact his hormone levels and throw off his mental health. 

The issues I’m having are that he is having bouts of paranoia/ panic attacks that revolve around me cheating on him. 

His therapist said when he’s in one of those moments to not tell me about his concerns for 24 hours so he can mentally process and validate the legitimacy of his feelings vs reality. 

The problem is he pouts the entire time and it’s CLEAR he’s upset. When I ask him to tell me what’s wrong and he actually does, 9 times out of 10 it’s about something irrational like me texting a friend or family member. 

He knows these thoughts are irrational and is apologetic for them. 

It’s hard because I was told not to address his paranoia until he has time to process it, but his moodiness is so obvious it feels like I’m being punished for something I don’t know I did.

I worry that his emotional state is going to lead to controlling behavior and that I won’t be able to set boundaries firm enough to keep his moodiness from impacting me. 

Last time I went out with coworkers I came home to him in a fight or flight state, crying. I haven’t gone out since. I know this is on me to work through and to try to force myself to continue to have social interactions despite his comfort level, but it just feels like more work than it’s worth. 

All of that being said, there’s a lot of situational stress on him right now and this moodiness is uncharacteristic of who I know him to be. 

Both our families are very involved in the relationship and are quick to jump in and tell him to cut it out, so we do have good support systems in place.

Should I leave him or continue to try and support him through it?

"I have been with my boyfriend, who we’ll call Sam, for 3 years now. I’ve known my best friend, who we’ll call Kendra, for 4 years. 
My relationship with Sam started out great and we caught feelings for each other quickly. But as time went on, problems started to develop between us. I always went to Kendra with our relationship problems and Sam knew that. Kendra was the only person who I felt actually understood me, and was about the only real friend I had throughout high school. She listened to all of my rants and still viewed Sam as a good guy at the end of the day. It made me so happy to have a best friend who supported me and also my relationship. Around the time we moved to college (both me and Sam decided to attend the same college), Sam and I were not getting along whatsoever.  Our arguments were getting bad, borderline physical. Our yelling would get us noise complaints. And Sam was showing really controlling behavior that was making me worried about what my future would look like with him. Of course, Kendra heard about all of this. Then one night a few weeks ago, Sam, his friends and I all decided to play a little drinking game. I got the drunkest I’ve ever been before. Sam got pissed at me for some reason and left the room. I start sobbing. Then next thing you know I’m cuddling up with his best friend telling him how badly I want to leave Sam. When I sobered up the next day I remembered how close me and Sam’s friend got and it gave me a little bit of butterflies, remembering what it felt like to be loved. I texted Kendra about it immediately and she was ecstatic. I gushed to her, told her how he played with my hair and was hugging on me. She told me that maybe it was a sign I should start to explore new things without Sam. Kendra and I texted about the whole situation for a few days. Couple of weeks later, I left my phone in Sam’s dorm unattended and he decided to go through it, even my messages with Kendra. So he saw everything about me and his friend, and everything about Kendra telling me I should leave him. Sam confronted me the cheating right away and that was a whole mess within itself. But for some reason, the thing that really bothered him was Kendra’s texts messages to me. He claimed she was telling me to homie hop and that she was crossing boundaries. I was a little taken aback, because Kendra was under the impression it was a private conversation between us that wouldn’t be seen by Sam. And, she was doing what any friend would do after seeing their friend unhappy for so long. Sam and I got into several arguments over Kendra, and he almost tried dictating my friendship with her. A few hours later I ended up getting a text from Kendra saying that Sam messaged her, calling her a “stupid bitch” and a “fan” for getting into his business. Later on he even decided to take it to the next level and made a social media post “exposing” her and calling her all different types of names. I was just appalled. My relationship with Sam has been one that I’ve tried to get out of in the past but it came very difficulty. We just keep getting into arguments over Kendra and not really resolving anything. Meanwhile, Kendra says she no longer wants to talk to me in case Sam ever decides to go through my phone again. I haven’t heard from Kendra in a week now, I feel absolutely awful. I have no clue what to do. I miss my best friend, how do I get her back and what do I do about Sam?

EDIT: Kendra never explicitly condoned me cheating on Sam, and she never told me to leave Sam for his friend. She only told me it was a sign that I should leave Sam and start taking on life by myself or explore new relationships.

I texted her about a week later and we spoke daily for around 10 days before my stupid ass decided to ghost her for an entire month. During this month i had exams to tackle and i used it as excuse to convince myself to wait till these exams were over to continue texting her. And that’s what i did even though i found her drop dead gorgeous and wanted to be with her.

After the one month ghost i texted her again and she replied relatively fast. From then on we spoke everyday went on dates and things just progressed and we learnt how much we have in common. But then we had a talk about our pasts. I am a complete virgin. I have had some sexually encounters but rejected any advancements because i just didn’t want to waste my first time having sex with someone i didn’t love. She on the other hand has had 4 different male partners before, 3 of which she linked up one or two months before she met me at the club. And one, the one the really fucks with me, she hooked up with one guy after she met me in the club during the month i choose to ghost her. I really don’t car about the other 3 but only just this one guy because it seems like it happened because of me. It’s like i fucking cucked myself. It feels sickening. 

I just can’t help but feel like I made a huge mistake here. If only i continued talking to her she maybe wouldn’t have hooked up with this guy. She also mentioned that this guy was being very pushy with her to do the deed and she can’t stand him BUT on another occasion she said the sex was good??? I know those two don’t go in hand but it just feels so odd to complement someone who you “can’t stand now”. They only had one encounter and never saw or spoke to each other again. It just feels so sickening that if i chose to not ghost her this whole situation could be avoided. I keep beating myself up for choosing to ghost her. Up till today, over 1 year of dating her and these thoughts still hit hard. 

I know this is a form of retroactive jealously and i know what she did before we were together shouldn’t be that big of an issue. But to think that she had sex with another guy after meeting me due to my stupid decision to ghost her just stings. No matter what i try the thoughts come out of nowhere and hit me like a pile of bricks and i feel like shit after. It hurts more knowing that could stop it. She herself said that if we continued talking she would only be talking to me and she only ventured off to online dating app (where she met the guy) because she thought i didn’t want to talk to her anymore. I’d appreciate if you guys and girls could share any advice on this. Thank you all very much.

Edit: I ghosted her for a month due to finals exams season and series of school projects. I still think it was a horrible idea. I always looked through her chat with during the month and always procrastinated responding to her. I actually liked her so much but i just kept feeling like it wasn’t the right time to break the silence. I don’t know what i was thinking, and it hurt and ruins my mood just thinking back to this and how i could have stopped this lol. But at that time i feared not being able to give her my full attention alongside fast replies and i felt like those would push her away from me and ruin my chances hence i procrastinated.

"Basically, it just started as a few hookups. I've never been able to orgasm from sex so faking it was just the norm for me, so I did this. Then we started seeing each other more and more until we decided we really liked each other and started dating.

"

I (25F) and my ex (26M) have an on and off relationship. I am aware that it is unhealthy, toxic to an extent, and probably not the best. 

As of right now, we aren’t officially together. Last time we were together, a couple weeks after he told me he wanted to spend his life with me, he  ended up hanging with a “mutual friend” of ours (they used to claim to be close friends from before I was in the picture). That’s fine. Problem is I asked him if they did and he told me no. Weeks later they confess they hung out (in a group setting but still why lie about it?). I forgave them both. He told me he wouldn’t lie again, except he walked right out of the door and continued to do so.

Then, I come to find out that he was venting to her about me. I’ve always known she’s liked him, but I never felt threatened bc (1) she’s incredibly unstable and (2) i told him that it’s his responsibility to essentially ensure boundaries.

One day when he was upset with me, he told me that our mutual friend had Facetimed him while she was very drunk and was begging him to call her beautiful as well as asked him if he would be able to pick her up during sex. He says he hung up after. 

This isn’t about our mutual “friend”. I have known she was emotionally unstable and gets attached to any remotely looking guy that shows her attention. Rather, this is obviously about my ex. We both have been through horrible childhood trauma, which is why I tend to intellectualize his shitty behaviors. I don’t think he’s physically attracted to her, I think he liked the attention she gave him. She has a new bf now. I read their messages between them because she showed me and not once did he flirt. I’m upset that he used our mutual friend to confide about me. I’m upset he wasn’t honest. I feel as if I can’t trust him because he’s lied several times now and created an environment with her that she obviously felt comfortable enough to flirt. I don’t know if it’s because she’s insane (she is) or because of him. Most likely both. 

He has apologized a billion times and says he understands his error. He claims to be so in love with me, and when we’re together he does make me his world and feel as so. Everyone used to say that he’s so in love with me based off how he would act around me in front of others.  Problem is I’m starting to question if he genuinely loves me or if he just loves how I make him feel (loved). I believe that if he really felt for me the thought of hurting me would seem awful :|

I know I sound dumb. I probably sound like I don’t respect myself. Please be honest with me on your opinion as to my situation. I love the man so much, but I also know love isn’t enough.  If that’s the case, how does one walk away from someone they love being around?  Please don’t be harsh, I am trying my best.

Thank you.","25F 26M - stuck, heartbroken, in need of logic",18n10n0,1703095665.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18n10n0/25f_26m_stuck_heartbroken_in_need_of_logic/,
"I've been dating this girl for a tad over 2 months, and honestly there are a LOT of great things, but now that we are hitting that 3 month mark where the infatuation dies down a little bit I'm really unsure how much of this is me finding real problems vs just making a big deal out of nothing and self sabotaging myself. 

Everything bothering me seems....inherently superficial or tiny if I consider imagining that I'm with the perfect person. To give context, she constantly tells me I'm handsome, compliments me, doesn't mind me playing video games with my friends, doesn't mind me occasionally smoking weed, wants to work out together, cook together, hypes me up when I felt bad about my work situation, the sex is good, shes very very into me basically. I remember at one point feeling like there is no way this is all true, she has to just be ""saying"" what she thinks I should hear, and recently, I found out I'm her first ever BF, and that took me from thinking maybes shes just perfect, to re considering maybe shes thinking these are the things she needs to do...but thats another post. 

Anyways, its little things. Like for one, she is at my place nearly every day. That felt like it went so quick, she has two cats, but she only now goes over to her place a couple times a week to check on them/feed them before wanting to come back over. I've been to her place, but she never wants to stay there because its very plain, she has no decorations or furniture (apart from a bean bag lol), boxes still from her move back in August, cat fur is all over the place, it is honestly messy, so I do prefer my place too. But to an extent it has gotten to be a bit much where I feel I can't play video games (despite her saying she doesn't care) but I think this is me switching from being so independent prior and still adjusting.

Another thing is basic manners type stuff. I'm typically a very clean/organized person. But she is the opposite apparently. Now her clothes are all over my apt, half empty cups/coffee all over, when we've done some baking/cooking she will kind of help, the other day she ""cleaned"" as I was cooking, only for me to turn around and find she stacked all the wet dishes/pans/etc and didn't dry them just all over the counter with water everywhere. I asked her why she didn't dry them and she said she was too lazy and I should have a drying rack (I asked her to use my drying towel, but she said I should get a drying rack and sat down). I asked her to come check what I was cooking to see if it was done and she said she couldn't get up. Overall, the typical 1 or 2 days I've had alone, I've needed to spend deep cleaning to get my place back to where it was. 

Another frustrating manners side, is burping...she will burp a lot and I will constantly say ""excuse you"", wasn't a big deal but as things continue it gets more annoying. I recently have been asking her to please say excuse me if she is burping. Mentioned that if she meets my parents that will be a kind of big ish deal as my mom really pushed that and general stuff on me as a kid, and she would just say ""well my dad wouldn't care""...which is I guess cultural since her family is chinese and I've never met an older chinese man who didn't burp/cough/etc as loudly as possible unapologetically lol. But the few more times recently I've tried to nicely say I'd prefer a little ""excuse me"" the more I'm realizing she does not think its a big deal at all, saying it doesn't matter its just a bodily function, and over time its kind of annoying me more and more that she refuses something simple. 

The last that I'll add is her breasts....this is a weird one. Before we met she apparently lost a lot of weight. To this day, despite that we've had sex a lot, I have never seen her fully naked. Shes fine with everything exposed but her boobs, those are to never be uncovered. I've slipped a hand under her bra, but she will often moan and groan that she hates them and it does nothing for her and doesn't want me to touch them. I've tried to be reassuring because she claims they are ""saggy and gross"" from weight loss, but it doesn't matter. So I just don't push it. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't bugging me. She wants a breast lift, which she has said she may get in 2025...but its frustrating thinking I could date her for potentially a year plus before ever seeing her boobs. I'm not even a real butt or boobs guy tbh, but I'm now finding that the lack of it is really turning me into one? Its getting me hyper focused on wanting to see boobs. I'm finding myself coming across social media profiles and just wondering what theirs look like, recently I met a girl through work that was into me and caught myself wondering if she'd take off her bra if we were intimate, its stupid fucking thoughts, and it feels real stupid to get hung up on, but its really bugging me that she will never take off her bra. The most her (never taken off) sports bra has ever come off is when she let me unhook it once to scratch her back, before she promptly demanded it be hooked back on. Very typical that when we hook up, she will keep on her bra and have on a sweatshirt, wanting neither to be removed. 

I know its more a her thing, I don't really even want to claim it as a problem, I've even tried to talk about how uncomfortable I am with my own body too, I'm very uncomfortable with my body too, but I'm willing to be exposed in order to get closer and have full contact with her during sex. Its ""not a big deal"" at all....and yet, all I can think is how I just keep thinking that I want to be with someone that will get completely naked and fully. That sounds so insanely cringe to type lmfao. 

Like I said, all of this feels....kind of childish to get hung up on. But idk, I was single for a long time, I am really not sure how ""easy"" or how ""simple"" it should feel when I'm truly looking for my long term person. At what point should you even come to the conclusion this is THE person? I don't want to waste years if they aren't right. But at the same time, like I said, these seem non major to an extent...I just don't know, I need someone to either tell me I'm being an idiot or whether I'm making any kind of sense and its worth talking to her about. She's got so much of everything I want, and I'm letting these tiny things bug me...or maybe they aren't tiny...I'm just pretty dang confused on how I'm feeling and wanted advice before I try to make it ""more"" of an issue and talk to her.

"TLDR at the end

I’ll try my best to keep it simple and concise

My [24F] brother [16M] keeps hitting me. This includes 

- Play fighting 

- Whenever he doesn’t want to listen to what I say 

- Whenever he wants to show his anger/frustration to a parent and he cannot hit them so he hits me instead 

To clarify with play fighting, I must admit it’s very one sided, I’m a relatively short and skinny girl and he is taller by a little bit but he is much stronger than me. 

I tell him to stop and don’t touch me but he doesn’t listen and I feel as though he doesn’t realise how strong he is. 


I’m someone who has to use to my arms, hands for my career and recently he has hit my shoulder very hard thrice in two weeks, and it hurts quite a bit. 

I told my parents about this (we all live together) and they told him off once and told me to apply a salve &amp; take anti inflammatory meds but this hitting behaviour has not stopped. 

What can I say or do to let my parents know that this type of behaviour needs serious discipline?

"So my GF(45) and I (F28) have been together for two years now. It's been a repeated talk about me feeling like I can't do anything on my own without being criticized, questioned or controlled. It usually ends with her feeling hurt because I don't just read between the lines and understand she's saying stuff because that's who she is, that's her opinion/question etc.. When I tell her I can understand what she's saying/asking but I don't like the way she communicates it, she says it shouldn't matter basically. I can't for the life of me figure out how to explain some things she says are just hurtful, many times selfish.

I'm torn between feeling like I'm letting my boundries be crossed and feeling like I'm being too harsh/manipulative when I tell her about her tone. Should I just accept that's who she is, how she functions? It's causing a massive drift between us, she says she feels like she can't say anything to me anymore.

EDIT: examples
So arguments usually stem from me making plans that involve other people.
For example, when I tell her I'm meeting a friend on friday she'll start questioning me about when I made the plan, how have I not considered another day bc she wanted to spend friday with me (she never mentioned the wish before), insisting she would be ok with the plan if she knew earlier, even if I told her the second I made the plan.

I went to a concert with my sister and I was gone for 3 days, she knew about it 6 months prior, we talked + videocalled all 3 days that I wasn't home and like a month after she brings it up during an argument saying I just don't care how things are at home, I just make plans for myself and thats it.

"My girlfriend had a very rough time growing up. She dealt with abuse and other terrible family situations. Her mom and dad are completely out of the picture. When she was in middle school her grandparents took her in, which is very sweet and I know she really appreciates them for that. She still lives with her grandparents- through college and now into her career.

I started dating my gf about 6 months ago, she has hinted that her grandparents (specifically grandma) don’t like me, and that they complain about how much time we spend together. (I see her one day a week) 

Last weekend there was an embarrassing moment where we had gotten back from a wedding late (around 12:30)  and where sitting in the car for a long time talking and kissing. I was about to walk her to the door, (1:15) when her grandma calls and flips out about how late it is and how sitting in a started car for too long can cause carbon monoxide poisoning - we weren’t in a garage. My girlfriend proceeded to go in and advocate for our relationship which I freaking love as she is a pretty passive and quiet person.

That said, my girlfriend still sees herself taking care of her grandparents long terms. I am fully under the impression that she would want to continue living with them, even if we were to get married. I’m comfortable with staying around the area but I don’t want to live WITH her grandparents and live in that toxicity. (I have yet to tell her this, but am looking to say it in a gentle way.)

That said I love my girlfriend, but cannot see a future living in her grandparents house.

"She told me all the time that he's the guy I ""shouldn't worry about"". He complemented her and wrote nice things about her on her Instagram page over a year. But she was like ""Calm down, I even don't know him"" and ""You're paranoid"". 

May be, if it were only digital comments on her Instagram, I really wouldn't worry. But there also were suspicion signals made me crazy. She smelled another man's Cologne when came home from friends (she newer told me about what friends they was). She started staying late at work unexpectedly. Every damn day. Our sex life  has ruined because she was ""tired"" all the time. Etc, etc. 

If I wanted to talk to her about us, she was started crying. Then she just used to unblock her phone and give it to me saying ""C'mon, check it all out. I bet you going to find nothing, but while you're checking I just going to puck my suitcase. I don't want to live with such clingy possessive ass"". Of course, I used to never mind to check her phone, and I usually was saying I am sorry and beg her not leave me. 

But these time I couldn't stand it and really open her Instagram page. I found out she was sexting with that ducking guy all year. There was walls and walls intimate messages. When she caught I really found out her chat with that POC, she became a fury. Firstly she yelled at me and tried to scratch my face, she also slapped me across the face twice. Then she put herself up, started crying and saying I never give her attention she's deserve. Then she said I'm paranoid and nothing happened, it's just texts and fantasies.

i have no idea what to do. should i go to the school, go to the police? im scared nobody will do anything because shes almost 18, but even at 18 this relationship is inappropriate because hes in a position of power

if i knew the exact teacher it was i would go to the school, but i dont. im scared of the school/police not taking me seriously

"I've just got out of a 6 month LDR and I'm reflecting on it as part of my healing journey. 

I've realised I was love bombed at the beginning; non stop compliments, pet names, constant texts/calls, constant need to be around me, planning future things, met his mum. etc this lasted about 2 months when over night he suddenly changed. He became the complete opposite, he would physically reject me unless it was him who wanted to be initmate, no phone contact unless I initiated it and this would only be weekends, he stopped with the compliments and pet names, he never planned anything with me, he stopped visiting me in my city,etc. He's not got a job and he lives at his mums so he was always asking to borrow money which was exhausting. 

It really made me question my self worth which for some reason made me want to please him and make me want to prove myself so I'd keep pushing through as I'd focus on the good traits.

Hes a guy with so many friends and early on he made me meet everyone, which was really overwhelming and I noticed early on, when we would go to events, he would often leave me to hang with them and leave me with a friend or on my own. I'd get upset as 1. I wanted to spend quality time with him since we're LDR all i was asking for was like 1 hr of his time 2. I'm not very good with keeping up energy in social situations with people who aren't my friends due to my mental health 3. I'm not used to spending hours and I mean hours and hours with massive groups of people I don't know.

He would say oh my ex was cool with it she never cared she'd just join in, and I'm like it's not so much you're just leaving me, it's the fact I don't necessarily like the people or have the energy enough to keep my mood up and then im worn out and I then can look a certain way (bored, moody etc). Anyways, he'd do this thing where he would people please and run around for his friends, literally do anything they ask of him. But if I asked for the simplest thing he'd say no. That's when things started to really damage me, and I reached a breaking point when we went to a music festival and he was a nightmare where i had to watch him for 5 days engage with others, be affectionate and support others and he singled me out to the point where I broke, can't even be bothered to detail it but it was so bad. I broke up with him, but he wouldn't let me go, he begged for me to stay with him and like an idiot I did, it's because he showed affection and was just being his old self. This lasted couple days then he went back to his old ways. He'd even say things like I should take pride that the relationship has even lasted this long with him like wtf!

I would ask for the bare minimum such as quality time, date nights (this man never took me on a single date night in 6 months!!!!!) communication etc and he'd make out as if I'm pushing him and not letting him be himself. Which now is crazy to me cos i was the one changing to fit his needs.

Like why was he like this? Has anyone else had a similar experience where their partner would just do everything and anything for others, like super supportive but for you they don't care unless they need something from you? 

Anyways couple months ago, he screamed in my face over nothing and told me he wanted time apart, haven't seen him since and he's barely spoken to me, i tried to tell him im hurt and left in limbo but hes just avoiding any conversation. He would just say its all down to his mental health and hes not doing good. Obviously he's broken up with me but doesn't have the balls to say anything. To make matters worse, ended up bumping into his friends and they said he'd told everyone we've been broken up and hes been seeing new people, we broke up cos of me being to comited and not letting him be him etc no mention of him screaming in my face bt whatever it was awful as they wouldnt accept that i hadnt heard from him and he hadnt said all this to me so this was all news. It also hurts that all his friends see him as this perfect guy, it's exhausting. 

Anyways ive finally accepted were over and now I'm ready to try and heal.

I know this wasnt healthy but I was just stuck cos I loved him.
I'm not perfect and I'm not looking for sympathy, I just wanted to see if anyone has had similar experiences and if there's any advice on healing moving forward, as I'm really struggling, I'm constantly thinking about him and getting upset that once he sorts himself out he's gonna be a good guy and I'm going to miss out on that version.

The conversation got mildly heated and I said something to the effect of, if you don't know if you want to be here after this long, you shouldn't be. To my surprise, he got up, starting packing and told me he had been unhappy for a year and a half. I think it's important to note that he never showed any signs of unhappiness, to me or anyone around us. He never spoke a word of this internal strife to his family, friends, no one. He also made it clear his unhappiness was within himself; feeling like hes never done anything on his own/been on his own, doesn't know who he is and doesn't trust himself. We proceeded to have a blow out fight for the next twelve hours, eventually agreeing to try and fix it. 

We started checking in on our feelings daily, including utilizing the ""paired"" app that sparks conversation (we were both scoring very high in relationship satisfaction). We started couples therapy and had our intake where the therapist said that she has never seen a couple who so clearly loves each other, respects one another and just needs to fix their communication (one side of the communication, I communicate my needs). 

I thought things were going well and he gave me every indication to believe that. A week ago, we sat down on our couch to plan our itinerary for our upcoming trip to Mexico (12/28). Friday after work we went shopping for swimwear for the trip, went to see the big Christmas tree, went on a see-saw, drank hot chocolate, discussed having his family over for Christmas and had a lovely day. When we got home, I could feel something was off but I couldn't place it and asked him to communicate to me. He said he was still struggling with his feeling of wanting to be alone, but had no intention of ending things. He repeatedly told me he had no intention of ending things, that he wanted to work through it. 

Saturday he got home from rehearsal and came into the office where I was reading, said hello, but didn't kiss me. I made a face. He asked what was wrong. I said I'm super sensitive and you not kissing me is making me feel insecure, you not doing the paired app is making me feel insecure. He sat down and told me he signed a lease for an apartment and is leaving. I was shocked - being lied to over and over and over again. It's as if I was living in a torture chamber for the last month. I begged, I pleaded, but he was immovable and eventually he packed some stuff and left. 

We did a virtual therapy session Sunday morning to get some closure. Our therapist, now my therapist, told me she has never seen someone so repressed, so detached. He is the type of person who can be in a room full of people who love him and feel completely alone. Now, talking to the people in our lives, they all have told me they always cared for him but always felt he had a wall up. I never felt that. 

Everyone who knows us is just as shocked as I am, thinks he is having a midlife crisis and is making a huge mistake. His family, our friends, everyone. Its taking everything in my everyday not to text him and say, I love you, I forgive you, we can fix this, come home, but I haven't. If he wants to be alone, I know I have to let him. He has to miss me, he has to miss our life, our pets, our home we built, our ability to communicate without speaking, our shared sense of humor. I know he needs to miss it. But I would be lying to myself if I said I hope that he doesn't see these things in time and come back to me.

That said, I am not sitting around and waiting. I can't. I know my worth and my value and I know that life must move forward - I can't wallow. 

I also understand that although I saw our life as our life, he felt like he was living in mine. I am a force; I have a big personality, I have a lot of drive and I was the bread winner (he does work, but I make significantly more). Our homes are in my name, because I made the down payments. However, I was planning to surprise him in Mexico with his name on the deed because his mortgage payments now equaled my down payment. 

I want him to see that I was never stopping him from doing any of the things he says he couldn't do - he was stopping himself. I was here cheering him on and trying to support him in whatever his wants and needs are.

I want to know peoples experiences who have gone through something similar: How did you handle it? What was your resolve? Did you and your partner ever reconcile? 

\*I should also mention we always had a very healthy sex life, that was never an issue.

"So I was sitting with my wife and we were looking at something on her phone when I noticed that when she clicked on the FB search bar, a lot of random guys names would show up. I questioned her on this, and I asked to see her history to see exactly how many guys from her past she had been looking up. She had searched out 8 different guys on facebook from her past in the past 4 weeks, so 2 a week, and that's as far back as I went. I was mad at her, and her response was to say I'm being ridiculous, looking up guys from her past is normal and every girl does it. I asked her why she was doing this, and ""I was just curious"" was the most substantive answer I could get out of her. She also claimed to never hook up with any of these guys and she would never look up guys she used to hook up with, but she did say she consistently looks up guys from her past at around that rate (2 a week). I for instance have looked up my two ex girlfriends on instagram exactly one time each over the course of our relationship, and definitely not since we've had a baby or gotten married.

For some further context to this we have been together for a little over 4 years and have been married for 4 months. We also have an amazing two year old girl together. I have never caught her cheating but there has been half a dozen or so events where she crossed boundaries with other men over the course of our relationship. I, and she admits this as well, have never crossed any boundaries with any other women. To give you an example of her crossing my boundaries, 8 months ago at dinner while on vacation with my family she turned to our daughter and said ""(daughter's name) loves smiling at the tall, dark... waiter"" after he came to drop something off at the table and in front of my mom, sister and brother. She was about to use the ""Tall, dark, handsome"" expression but caught herself from saying handsome at the last second. This was embarrassing and we had a big fight after. A week later when we were back home she asked me if she could go back to the same place without me (she would be staying in a room about 100 feet from the restaurant where said handsome waiter works), just with her and her girlfriend. As you can imagine that led to another fight. To add even further context, my wife has essentially refused to initiate any physical intimacy (sex, massages) in our relationship since our daughter was born. This has been something we've had a dozen or so major discussions about for over 2 years, and in that time period she has initiated sex two times and initiated massages around three or four times. And no, massages is not also code for sex or anything, I work a physical job and really appreciate them when I can get them.

So, my question is for the people of r/relationship_advice and mostly for women in good relationships, does my wife's explanation hold water? Are you still looking up guys from your past, and never any ones you've hooked up with, multiple times a week almost half a decade into a relationship?","My (27m) Wife (28f) has been searching out a lot of guys from her past on her facebook very frequently, claims this is normal and ""every girl does it"".

I know 2 weeks is not a long time but going from seeing him every day to not seeing him at all is so frustrating especially given that I’m spending these 2 weeks in my hometown where I have no friends anymore and am kinda going crazy with nothing to do.

I asked him the other day if we could start spending some more time together without his main focus being on his game to which his response was “what else do you want from me?? We see each other all day long.” And when I suggested we find something to do together he says “Like what?” when I propose something the answer is usually “no that’s boring” or “no I don’t want to do that” which is fine but he won’t give any input on what he would like to do together. I went to the store last night and ended up forgetting to get super glue for him (the other day I bought gorilla glue and it didn’t end up being regular gorilla glue) and he threw a fit saying “of course nobody listens to me, first you get the wrong kind of glue then you forget and you didn’t get the right kind of salsa either”.

"Some context here:

We've been dating for roughly 6 months now and things are going great apart from the occasional disagreements. We live about 1.5 hours drive away from each other. I don't drive and he owns a car so we usually spend time at my place every once in 2 weeks.

Christmas is huge for me and this year has been tough as I lost people close to me. My of and I decided to spend Christmas together after I'm done meeting with my family. This was decided 3 months ago roughly.

We're from traditional families so we haven't told our families about each other yet.

Fast forward to yesterday, he tells me that his group of friends have decided to meet during the time we were going to. Since this is our first Christmas, I just wanted to do something alone with him. The original plan was for him to come over to my house but now he wants me to go over to the party in his city instead with his friends. He says that the group of people are like his family and that this is probably going to be the last gathering they all have as everyone is moving out of the city. He says that he feels left out from the group ever since we started dating as he chooses to spend time with me every other weekend and declines plans with them. He says he wants to create memories with them one last time.

The problem is I wanted to spend Christmas just with him and so did he. I don't drive and it's going to be really difficult for me to get to his place. Not only that, he has other plans before the party and the group is working the next day so they're planning to wind up the party at 11 or 12 at night. So he's probably going to meet for an hour or so. They do meet every few months and their last meet was sometime in November.

Should I just give in and go over? At least that way I'll get to see him. But I keep feeling very hurt as it's making me feel that I'm an afterthought for him. This has happened once before. My love language is quality time and I built up my hopes around all of this. I don't know if I'm being unreasonable to expect him to follow through with our plan.

He feels that he makes the trip to see me all the time but the one time that he asks me to come over I'm being hesitant. I told him that I don't mind coming over if it's just us spending it alone. His friends all speak perfect English but they choose to speak in their first language since the majority r them belong to the same community. So I neve. included in the group conversations and I feel left out.

My boyfriend (M23) runs to social media to vent but will ignore my text for hours (F22)

I been with my boyfriend for almost two years and we aren’t a toxic couple but the only thing that bothers me is that he’s very emotionally unavailable , and he doesn’t know how to communicate. When there is a big issue or a a challenging moment I’ll want us to communicate about the issue (not argue but just express ourselves) and he will literally get stonewall cold , avoid the conversation and say he has to leave making me feel alone , or when he’s going though something he won’t text me back for hours or til the text morning but will vent about the issue on twitter , when there’s literally a text from me trying to see if you’re okay and it makes me feel like I’m in a relationship by myself 

recently his friend told him his ex was throwing shade at him on Twitter and I see him throw shade back in a tweet , and I was so embarrassed because why are you in a relationship with me giving an ex the attention she wants , embarrassing me . Idk how to feel , I love him and he has social anxiety and just overall a lot of things he needs to heal from that I been helping him with but I feel like I’m more a therapist than a girlfriend at times because he has a lot going on in he emotional department. He treats me well other than that with dates and gifts but that emotional unavailability is really draining , should I stay and work it out with him? Has anyone ever been with someone who is emotionally abandoning and does it ever get better ?

My partner and I have been together for almost 7 years, we broke up on our first year because I found out he had been sexting with another girl, we spent 4 months apart and then he asked for forgiveness and promised to change so I took him back and forgave him, we moved in together and our relationship grew stronger and healthier, in 2022 he was going through a burn out so we decided to break up again and stay “on a break”. I decided to start seeing other people and him too. We both agreed this was ok. We kept seeing each other and at the beginning of 2023 we decided to try it again but not make it “official” yet. He wanted me to be sure I really wanted to be back with him and also wanted me to go to therapy to solve some traumas before we made it official. I started going to therapy but due to my finances couldn’t keep going, but Ive assured him that im 100% sure I want to be back with him and get married and have a life together. We’ve had ups and downs because of this during the year but I felt that we were at a really good place and that soon hed ask me to officially be his gf
He has a friend that he regularly keeps in contact with, she used to be a work friend of mine but she stopped talking to me and grew closer with my partner, I had never thought anything bad of it until recently I started to get a weird gut feeling about her, and my gut feelings are never wrong. I decided to check his phone just to keep my peace but could not find much, only that she sometimes sent him kind of flirty messages, so I decided it was best to ask him directly and tell him about my worries, he confirmed he sexted with her one time LAST WEEK, that he is extremely disgusted with himself and that he regrets it happened. I feel destroyed, betrayed and in disbelief that he cheated again after so many years and knowing how much it hurt me when he did it the first time.

We’ve spoke and he says he promises it wont ever happen again, that he really loves me and want to spend his life with me, that he doesn’t like his friend and that he only did it bc he was horny and she sent him a nude first. I obviously think that is a lame excuse to cheating and he is aware of how bad he fucked up and is willing to make it better. The thing is im really hurt, I don’t understand how he could risk it all like that just for being “horny” what was he thinking and also why did he never put a stop to the flirtation of that friend. 
Right now im not sure if I should forgive him again and believe he will make up for it like he did last time. I obviously told him that if I gave him another chance he’d have to cut all ties with that friend and we may try couples therapy to work through this. But at the same time I feel id be too stupid if I forgave him knowing he knew better already.

Ive always felt that we are soulmates and couldn’t imagine sharing my life with anyone else

"For background information, this girl, Mia (fake name), and I had a months-long thing where we were close together in the beginning, but slowly she kinda differed from me and cited things like school and family for her distance. It made me upset because we relied on each other for a lot of emotional support. After all, she was the kindest person I've met, she's also the first lesbian I've met, and made me realize I was gay. She made me more comfortable with myself too, I used to have mental health issues but she greatly helped me with her support. She didn't offer emotional support to me but she was so close to me that she was the first person I was comfortable enough to tell her. On the other hand, she told me everything about her life and I always offered her emotional support and huge letters about how important she was to me to cheer her up. She didn't offer me the same back but at that time it was okay to me because she showed her affection by paying for anything, calling me, and stuff. The entirety of our friendship I had this huge crush on her and I tried to hide it as best I could because she always told me she wouldn't date or like anyone. After all, she was too insecure/busy for that. Earlier this year she would see me like 4 days out of the week and call me every night for hours, texting me as often as she could. We shared photos of our day and like made a bunch of inside jokes, and talked about a lot of personal stuff. But as time wore on she would go hours without texting me canceling on me an hour before we were supposed to meet and stopped apologizing for it (we only hung out once a month atp), and generally was super avoidant to me.

She was really kind to me, on top of paying for everything when we went out she would do kind gestures like when I fought with my mom and she came into my backyard and made a heart out of footprints for me to see. She would also hold my hand all the time and hugged me whenever we saw each other and often. She also planned a really sweet movie and game day when she was gonna shut herself in to study for the week. She supervised with my favourite movie and i fell alseep on her shoulder in the movie. So the romantic light i saw in her wasn't just entirely based off delusion. 

A week before her birthday she told me that I was mean to her and if I didn't fix myself, we couldn't be friends. This completely blindsided me because even as a joke I've never purposely said something or did something to hurt her. When I asked what I did specifically or anything she couldn't tell me because she said she didn't remember. This went on the whole day, I would ask her questions and she would avoid it and just say kinda of inflammatory comments. She also refused to meet with me or call me because she would avoid my texts and misinterpret them. I was really stressed our because I've never been spoken to like this or even had this come up with anyone, and once she exploded and said things like I do things that hurt her on purpose, I put my friends above her, when i talk too much it makes her feel dumb, thinks of that sort, i just told her to fuck off. It really hurt me to do and i regretted saying that. It even hurt more when i told her to come get her stuff like her record and sweater but she took the gifts she brought from abroad for me and my last year's birthday gifts and stuff. This situation made me really insecure for months because I felt like i was hurting the one person I loved I was possibly hurting everyone else and everything like that.

This December though, I had to tell Mia I loved her because it was weighing down on me because I had another girl I was talking to. I assumed she was just emailing me back saying I knew, that sucks though get over it but she emailed me back saying she missed me and loved me too. But she said she didn't want to like me and she was purposely pushing me away because she was too insecure about herself. She says the mean things I said to her weren't mean but because the friendly banter I would say to a friend was coming from a girl she liked, she got more insecure because of it. She was also jealous of my friends and the girl I went on a date with toward the end of our friendship which was the last straw for her.  She said she had a panic attack the day I went out with the girl, we were supposed to meet later but she had always been cool with being alone so it didn't seem odd to me to just spend time with the girl I was on a date with. She also said she doesn't have the time to sacrifice for me over her academic responsibilities.

This kinda shook me, because the first person I've loved could love me back but couldn't keep me. But slowly I realized it was kinda fucked how she treated me. She pushed me away on purpose knowing it made me insecure, self-conscious, and upset. She was gonna let me live life just pushing me away at the end making me believe everything was my fault because she would've never emailed me first.

My friends who aren't her friends never liked her and they have a biased opinion against her, but my friends who are also friends with her think I should talk to her one last time. I don't think we could be friends after this because Ill miss her too much knowing she can't be mine. But at the same time, I do want to talk to her and confront her because I didn't want her to treat her next girl like this. After all, while we were still friends she also pushed another girl away that I introduced to her. She told me in the email as well that she was pretending to like the girl to get over me but when she got too clingy she really crudely cut ties with her. She's only free after the new year and a part of me thinks starting the new year anew is good but currently, I'm really upset about how she treated me. But I've made a lot of progress, I don't burst into tears at the thought of her anymore and breakup and love songs sound less like her. I don't know if I should see her one last time.

"Here we go, just for my background... I have a huge passion for mountain biking and trail building which started 6-7 years ago. It became a dream to be able to ride my bike most days and build sick trails for everyone to enjoy. Fast forward to present day I've been dating my current girlfriend for about a year and few months. (we're both 25 &amp; live together) I absolutely love this girl and see and beautiful future with her traveling around the world and doing our thing. When we first met I was working a construction labor job which I absolutely dreaded and was miserable at everyday. But since it paid pretty well I stayed because of some impending debt from previous bad financial decisions.

After years of riding and networking at different mountains in various states I finally came across my dream job as being a full time trail builder, making more than my construction job! Of course I accepted the job immediately (to which she was 100% supportive and stoked for me). BUT, this being a traveling job is where the issue lies. My first season at this job was a sick one, she quit her job (pretty much ended up being a groupie haha) &amp; we traveled across the US pretty much all summer working all over the place. It was the sickest experience of my life so far. Its December now, and we have prob the biggest job we're ever gonna get. 1.9 million dollar project and we're getting per vailing wage. Its an 9 month job in Chicago meaning I'll be away for that time. This would finally be my chance to pay off my debt and be free to do whatever afterwards.

Here is my dilemma, she basically asked me for space a few weeks ago while I was away working which I found super strange because I'm only home on the weekends &amp; we only facetime twice a day with some texts in between. Ever since then, I did what she asked and backed off a bit and its been awkward to say the least and very frustrating because when I am home it feels like I'm a stranger in my own house. Last week I sat her down and tried to talk to her about what's been going on and she told me that she's been hating the long distance. Which I get 100%, it definitely sucks. Then she proceeded to ask me if i was committed to going to the Chicago job next year. At this point I kinda new where she was headed so I asked her to be blunt about it. So she was, she told me that she doesn't want to do the long distance for that long and that if I were to go then it would ultimately end up with us breaking up even if we tried. I told her that I could come home whenever I wanted and that I wouldn't just stay there and not come home. I could home every other week at least. I also keep trying to convince her that all our financial struggles could go away if I were to go and that we could do what we always talk about doing if we had the financial freedom. But no matter what I said, she didn't seem too amused. She went back to her old job and accepted to stay till September of next year; she is stuck here at home so she can't come with me again and doesn't want to anyway because she doesn't like Chicago. All very fair &amp; understandable reasons, which is why I'm finding it hard to decide on what to do. I have a couple more weeks to decide between staying here at home with the love of my life and finding some random job, most likely construction because thats all that pays well with my background. Or sticking to my dream that I've been working towards for years and finally being debt free but having to lose the women that I love and my best friend. I feel paralyzed by the decision I have to make, i feel like its the wrong decision either way.","I (25M) have to choose between the woman that I love (25F) and a dream job, what do I do?",18mzurk,1703092845.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mzurk/i_25m_have_to_choose_between_the_woman_that_i/,

advice on retroactive jealousy early in mine and my girlfriends relationship (18F) (18M)

I need some very serious advice related to retroactive jealousy. My last girlfriend was a virgin so this wasn’t a present concern. My new girlfriend recently told me that her BC is 3 and 2 of them were from 4 years ago and one from a year ago. To me this seems like a lot, and I hate the idea of this, because she’s most likely talked to a lot of guys in between those. One of the first things she said to me when we hung out was that she is happy she can actually have a conversation with me since guys usually just want to feel her up and do other things. It makes me sick to think she probably slept around quite a lot and starting from a young age. I need to overcome this for trust related issues and for my own mental sanity, i’m aware this is wrong of me. Also another thing is she said she doesn’t like using a condom.. meaning she definitely didn’t use a condom with other guys either.🙃🔫",how do I (18M) deal with retroactive jealousy early in mine and my girlfriends relationship (18F)?,18mzu1h,1703092797.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mzu1h/how_do_i_18m_deal_with_retroactive_jealousy_early/,

Hello everyone, I’m currently 23F and I talk to this older guy online. He does this thing where he acts super interested and texts me and then he pulls away and I don’t hear from him for days. And when he comes back around he tells me that he was sick, dealing with family or something. He tells me that I “cant be chill always needing like let me take care of myself. Get your priorities straight” and when I explain to him that when he pulls away from me it makes me feel rejected or worthless his only response was that “Thats thing idgit I literally talk once a week to others. Im not so needy. Just cause Im not responding dont mean im playing games, im literally doing me but I cant change or offer that to you” or other excuses like “Regardless I said I get away from everything meaning trust everythings good yet still like damn sorry im not thinking of replying to you through out the day” all I asked was for consistent communication but I’m just met with responses like “can you please chill out and enjoy solitude” I feel like absolute crap. All I’ve ever asked for was consistent communication why does he treat me like I’m a burden or I’m not important?? I don’t understand. One day he’s nice and the next day he’s cold and distant. And let’s not forget how he blocked me for standing up for myself after he disrespected me and blamed me for “pushing pedal”…. He then unblocked me Friday and sent a messages saying “hey are you good” i explained to him how I was in the hospital for a stupid mistake (i still am) at first he was kind and empathic acting like he wanted me to get better but now i haven’t heard from him since then. I don’t understand am I not worthy of his attention or is he really stringing me along and acting like he’s not?? What do I do? Everytime I bring this to his attention he just leaves me on read or tells me to move on but then if I act positive or mention intercourse with him he perks back up and becomes super talkative. He asks me on dates and then something always comes up so he either has to cancel or he just flat out ignores me when the time comes. I always give him a chance because I truly want him in my life and I think he’s a great person but after sitting here being ignored after I told him I wanted to give him a gift for Christmas I’m thinking maybe he’s never cared for me. He might just have found me pathetic or some placeholder. Idk if it’s another woman in his life or what’s going on. It’s almost like whenever I think things are going well and maybe he’ll treat me fairly he just ghosts me.",What do I (23F) do about someone I like (30M) who constantly ghosts me?,18mzq1y,1703092527.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mzq1y/what_do_i_23f_do_about_someone_i_like_30m_who/,
"We’re both freshmen in college at a town that’s far from the two different cities where we’re from. The entire campus shut down like 3 weeks after classes started and everyone got a week off, so I (19F) hitched a ride with him (20M) to the nearest airport as we both had to fly home. During that 3-hour journey, we found things in common (we mostly had the same classes and neither of us had made a lot of friends yet), so that’s how the friendship began. Also, he was one of the 2-3 male friends I’ve made like ever because my parents made sure their only daughter always attended all-girls schools (very orthodox, I know) and I’m kind of an introvert, so I didn’t really socialize a lot beyond that.

That day, when I reached home, he called to check if I’d landed safely and called again 2 days later to “catch up”. I didn’t think much of it, just that he was a nice guy who’s trying to be my friend. Even my mom had said he was a nice guy and I should stick to him. However, after we returned to college, he was the one who became too clingy.

He used to call me in the mornings to ask if he could jog with me when I preferred jogging alone. During the classes we had together, he used to insist on sitting next to me every time, even when other guys used to make fun of him for “sitting next to a girl”. I told him he could sit with them but he always said “it’s fine, just ignore them”. He called after every class we didn’t have to ask where I was and again after dinner to ask whether I’d eaten or what I’ll be doing after that. Add to that at least 2-3 random calls asking what I was doing at that moment and if I said anything other than studying, he used to say “I know you’re studying, no need to hide it, haha!” 

Now, everyone says he was just joking around at the time, but I was really creeped out. It became worse when I ignored his calls and notifications for an entire weekend and he told me the following Monday, “You ignored me for two days, huh?” I made excuses and said I was sleeping or watching Netflix on my laptop but he replied again “Sure, I know you were studying, haha!”

I still believed all of this was his unique way of showing that our friendship was important to him and like I said, he was one of my only friends at the time. I thought the least I could do was be nice to him, so I didn’t tell him I found him creepy.

As I slowly settled in, I became friends with a girl (20F) who is a childhood friend of one of the new friends (21M) he had made in college. He suggested that the four of us should make a plan to go to the mall for lunch one day followed by games at an arcade Since two other people were going to be there, I agreed. The evening before, I confided in my female friend about him for the first time and she encouraged me to tell him off at lunch the next afternoon and that she’s be there for support.

Then, she and her childhood friend went to a party and got blackout drunk, so both were hungover the next morning and I couldn’t reach them. I called him and asked if the lunch plan was still on if they weren’t coming and finally found the guts to mention that I didn’t want to go alone with him. He said he’ll call me back in a while and when he did, he said they weren’t coming but other people from college would be going to the mall. The catch was, they were taking the bus (it’s kind of far from the campus) while he had already booked a cab for the four of us who were supposed to go. I did see the people he mentioned waiting at the bus stand and it was just 20 minutes, so I thought “what’s the worst that could happen” and decided to go with him.

I was planning to tell him after we reached, so we could our separate ways from there. It was just the two of us with the cab driver and halfway through the journey, I asked something about the food court at the mall to which he replied, “oh, we’ll be going to the restaurant where I’d already made a reservation for the four of us and since the other two aren’t coming, it’s going to be just you and me”. That’s when I finally realized what was happening.

I told him to his face that I only agreed to go out because other people were gonna be there and I didn’t want to be alone with him because he creeps me out. He started crying (yes, he did) and said he was sorry. We were already close to the restaurant and once we got there, he kept saying he was sorry as we got out of the cab. Once he was out, I jumped back in and asked the cab driver to drive off immediately and he took me back to the campus. Once there, my female friend dropped a bomb on me. He had told his friend (her childhood friend) that the plan was canceled that morning and he conveyed that to her, so she thought I had finally told him but didn’t call because she was hungover.

She said she was really sorry she couldn’t be there and told her childhood friend who told his friends what happened and it spread around campus like wildfire. The thing is, he had told his other (male) friends that he was going on a date with me, so they think I “used him” because I “strung him along” and left him hanging at the restaurant. I blocked him on everything so I didn’t get anything, but I’ve been told he has tried to apologize many times. He’s telling everyone he gets anxiety attacks because of me and as someone who’s been diagnosed with anxiety, I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.

It’s been 5-6 weeks and we’ve been avoiding each other like the plague, but everyone says I shouldn’t have “overreacted”. I have a reputation among the boys for being pretentious and “undateable” and even my mom told me he just “liked” me. When I said I felt I was being harassed, I was told it’s just a “misunderstanding” and not that big a deal.

I’m trying to focus on myself and my classes waiting for this to blow over but at the same time, I don’t want to be pretentious and “undateable” for the rest of my college years. I want to fix this but I don’t know where to start. Any advice/suggestions would be welcome.

"Hi everyone! 

I often notice that at the start of a friendship I get along really well with people, to a point where I almost feel fused with them. But when times goes by, poeple just don't seem to be interested in me (in a friendship way) anymore. That's the last exemple i have :

I'm friend with a girl since the beggining of my uni, we shared every little gossip (not mean one I swear) and had private jokes. But this last month she was really distant, even when we where sat next to each  other in class.

We don't spend as much time with me as we've done before, and when we are in groups she kinda avoid me. If i talk to them they answer me, but they hardly ever speak directly to me. And if we have to split our group she will be the first one to voluntarily leave our group for an other one. I already try to ask her if I have done something wrong but she said everything was fine.

And today she told me ""you know you have a really special sens of humour"" (not in a good way) but usually she laughed at my jokes and outbid them.

That's just some exemples, but there are not the only thing that make me thing that, and she's not the only person who act like that with me.

That hurts because i still like her a lot, and it feel a little unfair because i want her to like me as well but i can't force them to love me back.

I don't think she is bad people or whatever, just that she don't find me ""interesting"" anymore. And so I wanted to know what can I do to improve that ?

I mean I think my qualities are that I'm smart, kind and really comprehensive, but I'm maybe not the funniest person ever. I am not the person who is going to start the convo, but if someone is talking to me i like to chat with them a lot and i don't thing i'm weird or anything. Again, i don't think they are ""bad people"" or anything, just that maybe i'm doing something wrong.

TLDR : my friendship never last and i can't understand why.

So yeah i don't really understand what i am doing wrong. Can you please help me on that ?

Ps : english is not my main language so sorry for the mistakes

"I just finished my studies at a somewhat unconventional film academy (students alternately cover every single role in a film crew). The final month of the course involves co-presence with students of the following year. As I am leaving my classroom, I see this new wonderful girl sitting in her seat earlier than everyone else, and we smile at each other. I am immediately struck by an impression of a familiarity between us. On top of that, she does not take her curious gaze off me and she is not embarrassed to hold it even when I reciprocate. I do not think much of it.

Since that day on, I see her again and again but just for a couple seconds at a time. When I pass by her classroom, I feel her staring at me. Meanwhile, I am busy with the final steps of post-production for my first short film (eith an average of 16 hours a day on a isolated computer) and I do not have the clarity of mind to approach her.

One day, during a shared lunch break, she actually manages to strike up a conversation that immediately seems instrumental to know something more about me. Everyone introduces themselves to her but she almost doesn't seems to listen, until it's my turn to do so. We chat and finally get to know each other.

Two weeks later, my class year finally arrives at the final screening of all the works produced during the course. A few hours before the event she passes by my workstation and says ""Are you ready?"" to which I reply ""Of course not"". She laughs, so I ask her ""Will you be there?"" She smiles at me and replies ""Of course"".

The screening goes surprisingly well, the movie theather is filled with a noisy crowd of a few hundred people. I am surrounded by friends and then, out of the blue, there she is: ""Congratulations! You have raised the bar for next year. It will be difficult to live up the expectations"". We chat about her impressions and my feelings about the event. We go on and on, while the room empties, everyone else momentarily ceases to exist. Our eyes are glued to each other except for some trips to each other's lips. I feel incredibly serene. However I snap out of it a few minutes later, when I realize I have classmates, professors, actors and lots of other people to say goodbye to: I quickly take my leave. She goes ""Will we manage to see each other again?"" ""I'll come by tomorrow to pick up my footage"". She looks a little disappointed. When I leave half an hour later, I feel her gaze caressing me as usual.

The following day, I tell her ''See you next year'' (not mentioning to her that I am leaving two days later to spend the Christmas period in my hometown. Hey, I never said I was good at these things!) and she says ''Worst case scenario there's always my year's screening next December"". Before I can say anything else, she says ""Come here, give me a hug"". We hug each other for a bit. I don't remember what happened afterwards, I was overwhelmed.

The day after, I thankfully finally manage come to my senses and I ask about her to a professor I am very close with, the professor in question straight up gives me her number. I am initially hesistant to send her a message for obvious reasons but I convince myself to go for it.

*""Hi ###, it's @@@. I thought about it and editing an interlude full of boring downtime and a year long is probably excessive. What's your take on it?""*

Seven hours later she replies:

*""Hello @@@ :) What a pleasure to hear from you! Of course I agree with you :) I am glad we are in touch!""*

To which I say:

*""I am glad as well :) Tomorrow, I'm traveling home for the holidays but when I get back here we'll share a glass of wine/beer/sparkling water if you like the idea""*

Since then, radio silence. Two days later she hasn't replied yet and I am here second-guessing the whole story and her supposed interest with too much time in my hands. Her reaction doesn't add up anymore to my narration of the events. If she is so interested as I imagined her to be, why would she not reply to that kind of a proposal? How do I proceed? I am 800km away from her until the second week of January. Should I try to contact her again? I need a strategy. Please help me, I feel like I'm going mad.

**TLDR:** Fell in love at first sight with a girl but I was too busy/dumb to make a move in time. I just left for the holidays and now I am even questioning her signals.",I (M28) fell in love with a girl (26F) at my film school. I have to find a way to approach her while I am (momentarily) 800km far from her,18mz8x1,1703091362.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mz8x1/i_m28_fell_in_love_with_a_girl_26f_at_my_film/,
"I (26F) have been with my bf (29 M) for about two years now, and at the beginning everything was great.   I was the one who reached out to him, and we clicked and started dating long distance, and at about the 1 year mark we started living together.

It's been increasingly difficult, though. He is so sweet to me and and is never unkind, but lately there have been things that have been cropping up that are starting to eat away and me and I don't know what to do. Basically my question is, how do I address this situation? 

For starters, there are little things like making crude jokes/making jokes out of everything, and it's becoming an issue to me because I feel like I can't make a connection to him when everything he says is either a double entendre or a line from a show or movie. Sometimes I just want a meaningful conversation, but it just doesn't happen. I've started just giving up and not talking as much because of it. Also, the crude jokes make me uncomfortable. I did not grow up with Monty Python or Mel Brooks so it's just not my style of humor, and it just makes me feel weird. I have told him this before so he knows it, but I have to say it over and over. 

Also, though he is very kind to me and accommodating, he tends to not know how to handle emotions well and can be impatient/have a temper. Not towards me, but just in general. He can be a bit of  an irresponsible driver, especially when he's late for something, and sometimes it scares me and once I cried because of it. He got a little better afterwards, but it's still there. He also seems to be distant if I am upset, and if there's something that happens and it's obvious I could be comforted, he often will leave me alone. I get this, because he may not know how to respond, but sometimes I just crave for connection and want to feel loved and heard.

There are also times where I very much disagree with his points of view, and sometimes the people he listens to on podcasts/shows make my stomach turn. He listens to people like Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan who are clearly more right leaning, and it makes me wonder if their mindsets are affecting him.  He's made jokes about women before, but like in a ""Haha, I'm just making FUN of them because of how ridiculous their misogyny sounds"" kind of way, but none of it is funny to me, and sometimes I wonder if it's just a joke or if he actually is believing it. I say this because a lot of stuff he listens to talks about allegations against popular actors and the like, and a lot of these talk show hosts end up favoring the person with the allegations rather than the woman. I have been sexually assaulted before, and he has experienced similar things to what happened to me, so I don't know why he would be listening to that garbage and it makes me extremely upset. Just as well, he likes to make ""edgy"" jokes and the like, stuff that should probably be grown out of after college. Like, jokes poking fun at people's ethnic accents, etc. and it's just really immature and whenever I'm out and he does something like that it makes me so embarrassed that he finds that kind of stuff funny. I've tried talking to him about it in a kind way, saying that he may not believe in those things, but people who may not know him and hear him say stuff like that may think badly of him because of it.

That, and.....I just don't feel romanced anymore. He does a good job of doing his share of housework, he cooks breakfast and some meals and is responsible, but I just don't feel the romance. I've lost the desire to be intimate with him because of his bad habits, and I just feel.....unhappy. The only time he got me flowers was when he apologized to me after a  recent situation that got me upset, and it made me sad thinking back on it that the only flowers I ever got werr apology flowers. I recently had a big conversation with him about this, yet I just feel so unhappy and want to cry. And yet, part of me doesn't want to let him go and give him a chance, yet I know if he keeps this stuff up, I won't ever be happy. He's not a bad person, but he is definitely immature and needs to grow up a bit. I just feel stuck and I want to curl up in a ball and disappear. But, I don't want to break his heart and that's what's killing me. I've always been such a tender hearted person and I know it'll kill me inside if I end up having to do it. 

TLDR: Been with my bf two years and his crude/offensive jokes, emotional immaturity, and lack of sensitivity are giving me second thoughts. I feel so unhappy, but I want to give him a chance to change, yet I know if he can't soon I'll never be happy, yet I don't want to break his heart.

"23f I've never had a relationship. I really want one, but at the same time I don't. I don't even know if it's a sexuality problem. I am diagnosed with autism so I believe that has a lot to do with my relationship issues. Sorry for the ranting and if it's really confusing.

Men have been interested in me a few times before, and one very recently, but I always come up with an excuse to say no to them, or avoid them. It's nothing to do with them, I genuinely don't know why I do this. I feel awful about ghosting them, because its not their fault but I can't bring myself to pursue it. Anytime chatting with a man I always ignore the messages for a few hours, a day, a few days... I don't do it out of malice, or disliking them. 

I was on a date with a guy a while back (I didn't know it was a date when I was asked to go, we were friendly coworkers before) and once it started getting more romantic I was silently freaking out, when I was alone later that night I was so agitated! But I don't really know why. I've never used a dating app, I'm not out here toying with men on purpose! But I'm afraid I've been accidentally leading men on, thinking it was just friendship, or thinking dating would be just like a friendship. When we were just friends, this guy and I chatted all the time at work. I myself brought up the idea of a second date that night, he's a good fella and I do like him but I just can't find it im me to go through with another one.

(I don't really feel strongly about women either. I was chatting with a girl a while back and it was easier with her, I never ignored her but I can't really tell how I felt about her, romantic or was I just seeking her out platonically? I feel more comfortable around women but again, i can't tell if it's because I'm attracted to them, or if it's more friendly.)
I do think I may be asexual but as I've never tried, I might not know whether I am or not? But I don't really like the idea of physical intimacy, so I think that's also scaring me when thinking of relationships. I don't think I'm aromantic, either. I'm not very well intuned with my feelings as you might tell haha! Everyone i know, family/friends are all in relationships and I just feel like an outcast.

Has anybody else ever gone through something similar? Or was anyone ever unsure about their sexuality? How did you figure it out?? Or if anybody here also has autism and struggled with relationships I'd love to hear how you're dealing with it:( 
The guy I was out with before is still interested, I don't feel so comfortable going out again but is it worth it just to try, for experience or getting more comfortable with romance etc? Or could that just harm him?

TLDR// unsure of sexuality and how to even tell, also having trouble with romance and feel like there is something wrong with me where I can't even respond to a potential bf, fear I may be accidentally leading him on.","I (23f) can't tell my what my sexuality is and having relationship issues, have I been leading him (26M) on?",18mz8a7,1703091318.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mz8a7/i_23f_cant_tell_my_what_my_sexuality_is_and/,

At least not as much as she does around him, so one time she sent a reel about 2 couple kissing and he knows our relationship boundaries this was a no so obv i made a fuss about it and he told her to not send such a thing again, but i really hated seeing them close tpgether after this so i asked him to keep some distance) so i wasn't okay with their friendship, but i was okay with the fact my ex was able to hug his female friends (because this was our relationship boundaries and it was okay for both sides) he mentioned that i was okay with my ex doing that yet upset about my current bf friend and they dont even hug, he also mentioned how i used to send songs and stuff to my ex ( but i also used to send alot to my bf he just didnt listen to them, let go our different taste in music!)
He mentioned the fact that i kissed another guy (my ex) and got drunk with guys (my friends) before me and my bf dating
And he did neither (i'm his first gf and he doesnt drink it's forbidden here) yet nagging about his female friend and he said that he feels our relationship and my requests are not equal or fair
I honestly can't see that because all the things he mentioned was about my past not about who i am as a person rn, and not to mention he LOVES to keep bringing up my past every other day
I really don't know what to do I'm frustrated, i keep asking him how can i help with this because everything is in the past and i've literally changed!

We’ve been together for almost a year and a half.
Last year he didn’t get me anything, but we only been dating for a few months. I had just gotten back from a trip on Christmas and gave him some local coffee wrapped up with a bow. 

This year I guess I had higher expectations. 
I went over to his place last night with a big snake plant that I put Christmas ornaments on, a basket of his favorite foods, a book, a personalized ornament that says “of all the weird things I’ve found  online  you are by far my favorite” and tickets to see a comedy show. 
And I delivered it wearing nothing but heels, a Santa hat and a trench coat. 

I put a lot of thought and effort into it. he makes me so happy and I enjoyed picking things out for him and planning a night out for us with the comedy show. 

Well, before he had even opened his gift, he told me that the next weekend we would have together his best friend has now planned a last minute all expense paid trip and he’s going. 
That happened to be the weekend that I bought tickets to the comedy show for so I was a little bummed, but he didn’t know what I had planned. 

He seemed appreciative and said that was so sweet but I can’t help feeling a little bit sad. 

About a year ago, we did one of those love language quizzes and I did know that giving and receiving gifts is not in his love language and he’s not into it. But it’s Christmas…  He gets gifts for his kids. I guess I felt like a long-term girlfriend would fall into that category too. 

And I guess he could still technically give me a gift, but I feel like if he had planned to get one or had one in the mail or something there would’ve been a time last night to say yours has arrived yet  or something. I’m not gonna see him again until New Year’s due to holiday travel/kids so the last two days would’ve been the time to exchange.","Boyfriend M45 didn’t get me, F41, a Christmas present.

i (18f) have been with my boyfriend (18m) for a year and a half now. i can't express enough how important he is to me and how our relationship has improved my life for the better. we have never had a rough path, big arguments or anything of that sort, our main and only problem is my dad. he's the kind of parent who is extremely invasive (to the point of yanking my phone out of my hands in order to see who am i speaking to and see whatever i'm doing) and he's always made my life a living hell. he constantly tries to paint himself as a ""caring dad"" when behind closed doors he always makes me feel like a failure. he never tells me he cares about me or loves me, or does anything a loving parent is supposed to do. i was raised not to trust him, but fear him and try to always be the perfect daughter. i won't be saying everyhting he does because that would be a whole other post. but just know he's never cared about me unless it comes to assert his power over me and have extreme power trips.

now, as i said before, the main problem in my relationship is him. he does not want me to have a relationship and refuses to explain why (he only says he'll allow one when i start uni, which is next month but i know nothing will change when i do start). the only reason he knows i have one is he forced me through manipulation to tell him about the one i have now. when he found out to told me to call it quits and i told him i did (when i obviously didn't), but since then i've had to keep it hidden from him. my mom knows and she supports me (in case you guys wanted to know) but she doesn't have a backbone because of how much she's had to endure with my dad and don't think he'll even pay attention to her if she tries to defend me.

the issue started when my boyfriend told me he wants me to speak up for myself and make the relationship public, but i'm scared my dad will blow up on me and even prohibit the relationship. i've been meaning to speak to him for a while but i'm just so scared, but i also don't wanna risk my relationship ending because i wasn't able to speak up. because of how strict my dad is, it's so difficult to see my boyfriend regularly which has taken a huge toll on us and making us drift apart. i truly understand why my bf is feeling frustrated, but it doesn't make it any easier for me and is making me very scared of our relationship coming to an end.

how should i approach the topic with my dad? i appreciate all advice, thank you for reading. any questions i'll try and reply in the comments.

"I’m having trouble figuring him out, we’ve had so many conversations with our couples counselor and without. I really want marriage. My family structure is so bad, multiple suicides/imprisonments/drug and child abuse that I want to create my own. I’m really excited for my own home, my own life, my own family. I’ve been in love with my partner for 4 years, but he has only recently told me he’s falling in love with me.

I told my partner and the couples counselor that after I graduate from college I would like to get married, either symbolically or legally. (We will have been dating 6 years at that point and a private, spiritual blessing from a local shaman is good enough to make me happy) My partner is not having it at all. He says he doesn’t like to have major decisions put on a timeline.

The couples counselor said I should just drop the conversation because he’s not ready but now I’m confused wondering if he really wants a life with me. Would it be harmful in letting it go?

"We’ve been together for two years. We’ve had quite a few problems - big fights, trust issues, etc. I can take 95% of the blame here for lies I’ve told, things I’ve done to hurt her, etc. She’s done some things that hurt me like lying about her past, called me names, given me silent treatment often, etc. I’ve never cheated on her, but I have done some things I’m not proud of. But our relationship is at a point where the future is uncertain and I’m feeling a lot of confusion about how we heal, where to go from here, etc. My mind is a mess and I’m overwhelmed with all of my feelings. I feel like I just need to take a step back and reflect. Not just about the relationship, but how I can be the best partner to her that I can be.

She told me that I am more than welcome to take a small amount of space/time, but if I did, she told me she’d go to Vegas for a few days while we’re apart and be “fully single”. Implying that she’d sleep with random men. I pressed her on what she meant and she just keeps saying “I guess you’ll find out. I’ll be single and I can do whatever I want to do. You have no say. If I go sleep with random men while I’m there, that’s my right”.

I want her. I really do. But I’m also feeling overwhelmed and wanted to spend some time alone to reflect on everything and re-center myself. But I really don’t want her to go sleep with other men while I’m doing so.

I don’t know what to do. I need to prioritize my mental health and resolve some trauma I’m dealing with, but I also am afraid of her going away and sleeping with other men next week. Should I take space and accept that she’ll go sleep with random men, or should I stick it out and keep her from doing so?

Tl;dr - I (28F) am seeing a guy (29M) who is rushing into things too quickly for my comfort. I feel super freaked out. It's been just over a month and he wants to be in a committed, official, super public relationship. How do I slow things down without hurting him? 

Like the title says I am trying to slow down the pace of a potential relationship because I'm not ready for more yet. 
Background- I (28F) started seeing a guy (29M) a little over a month ago. We met at a bar he works at and although he's not my usual type, a mutual friend set us up. He's a very nice guy, total sweetheart, who goes above and beyond for me. I enjoy spending time with him but I'm still a little hesitant getting into this. I had only recently started dating again when I met him after a particularly rough breakup with the guy I thought I was going to marry. 
This new guy is such a great guy but we don't have much in common. Different political beliefs, different hobbies, etc. He's very eager to be around and spend time with me, and even learn all my hobbies. But basically it's becoming quickly overwhelming for me. He wants to spend time together super frequently, he bought me a Christmas gift, he's inviting me to family events. And then here's where I definitely effed up. He asked if he could introduce me to his family as his girlfriend and I was super flustered but ended up saying yes after a bit of stammering because I'm a people pleaser. I'm completely not ready to be exclusive yet. I'm still navigating my own feelings on whether this person is right for me. What prompted this post is he tried putting us in a relationship on Facebook. I didn't even realize people still did that! It has completely freaked me out. I'm like ready to run due to being overwhelmed. 

How do I pump the brakes on this? I don't necessarily want to stop seeing him, as he's a great guy, but I am still working out if I can see a future with him.

I dated my now gf for 2 years , it'll be 2 years in feb . It was a serious relationship, we were compatible and she is the most wonderful person I know. But today we talked about marriage and stuff and I wasn't ready. It was not about getting married soon or anything like that , she just asked me i was sure about her , and I wasn't. I said I'm 99% sure . The answer was terrible, I'm clearly a bad guy , I'm not ready for a commitment and don't want to keep her hanging till the very end where i find someone better or something like that . I'm 100% at fault here, she's been nothing but nice and sweet and supportive. She would make a great wife too I'm sure . Its just my ego that I'll find someone better , I'm also egoistic about my profession, I'm a bit better than her , but she can easily get people who are more qualified than me very easily. She was very hurt today and sad , I don't want to waste more of time than i already did , I know what i did was terribly wrong and I'll have to face karma for it too . But how do i break up with her ? Also she's asking a question of why did i waste 2 years of her life if i wasn't sure and the answer is coz i was selfish. It was more of a rant than a question. I'm already feeling very bad about myself I don't want to hear it from you guys what a pathetic selfish jerk I'm.

"I’m the youngest of my family. (22F)  I met a guy(26M) &amp; we became close. I lost my virginity. We never dated. We had a lot of fun times and memories together. He lost his job. Which slowly led to him losing his mind. (Psychosis.) So when he started going through psychosis he began acting really strange and put me in a lot of messed up situations. One where the police had to get involved. So, my family of course does not like him which I completely understand that. They care about my safety. They want me to cut all communication with him but I feel like I don’t wanna do that. 

My thing is, I lost my virginity to this guy. I knew him when he was him. Before all the craziness. So I wanted to try to help him get help. Because if you know anything about psychosis, it’s debilitating and it’s a lot to deal with. My family keeps telling me that it’s not my job to do that for him. I just don’t like seeing him go through that. And I’m black, he’s black. Mental illness in the black community isn’t taken as serious as it should be. So his family isn’t really doing much to help him get help. Also, he doesn’t feel like he needs to get help. I tried to convince him to get help before but he feels like he’s being targeted by the CIA so me telling him to get medicated makes me his enemy too. He starts feeling like I’m part of it. I also feel like he only thinks he doesn’t need help because his family is telling him he’s fine, not his mom but his brother. The brother makes it seems like it’s a spiritual thing. No one is telling him hey you need to get help, except me. Right now I don’t see him. He’s back home with his mom but he obviously wants to see me again. I don’t wanna see him until he gets medicated. My family wants me to block all communication and cut him off completely. Idk what to do, I feel like me and him could still be friends but do you feel like my family is right?

"Basically, if we argue before a day we’re scheduled to hangout, he just goes ghost until he feels like talking to me again. It hurts a lot when he does this because I’m being vulnerable and trying to talk to him. Also, I understand having alone time and that he doesn’t always need to talk to me but specifically when we argue and we’re supposed to hangout, it drives me crazy. Plus, I take those days off specifically from work and it’s like he didn’t care enough to work things out to not waste the day(he would insist we works things out before). We were doing good relationship wise the past 2 weeks but idk I guess the lack of communication got to me. He’s super crazy about me and we love each other dearly, but we’ve only been together 4 months(he’s not the cheating type fyi). For reference, we live about an hour away and he works a lot so we would see each other like once a week. After he ignored me the day we were supposed to hangout, he texts be back like 5 hours later saying he was just driving around and he was free to talk now. I was so furious that I said “thanks but today was the last straw” and now I haven’t heard from him in 3-4 days. The only response I expected was a confirmation of the breakup but he never sent anything. I’m wondering how hes feeling because the last time we broke up, he immediately brought up getting his stuff back but he hasn’t this time.

"Her and I met over Xbox while playing a video game with a mutual friend over a year ago. We had gotten along incredibly well and understood each others humor from the very start. We crept into becoming a ""gaming duo"" and we began playing everyday together because of how much we enjoyed each others company.

I was married but also filing for divorce earlier in the year. To make that story short, my ex had committed every level of infidelity you can think of and our relationship couldn't have been the same if I stayed with him. Because this girl online had become such a close friend, she was quick to offer me a listening ear.

A few months after my marriage ended, this girl and I had taken our friendship off just the game and into other games, our own personal discord movie server, social media, and text message. I started to develop romantic feelings for her. Out of all the things I had been able to tell her about, telling her my feelings was a tough one. But I did tell her.

She told me she reciprocated those feelings and from then we had only grown a closer bond. Played everyday. Texted everyday. Fell asleep on discord. It was great, as I had never had an online relationship like this.

In August, I sent her a package of items I found at a local halloween store that she favored along with one of my sweaters doused in my perfume. I even included a card that said I had something to ask her when we finally met offline. She was on a Facetime call with me while I watched her read it. Just smiles and excitement from her. Since then, things have felt weird.

She plays with me less and other guys more. In fact, she told me one of her other online friend also likes her. I asked if she liked him back and she said no and that he's emotionally immature. I can read inflection very well and could tell something was off with her response but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. There have been guys in the past we've played with that have given me the same ""vibe"" with her, but who am I to get in the way of anything? I'm not her girlfriend. But, she says she's made it clear to nearly every person in her life that she likes me—and me only.

I bought a nice hotel for us in the city near me. One bed. Bought tickets for a beautiful touristy spot to ask her to be my girlfriend. Planned flowers and dinners. Everything was great, she was excited and there were no sign of any issues.

Until two days ago in an Xbox party.

""Are you going to ask me to be your girlfriend when we meet?"" she sounded like she was scared to upset me.

And I just sat there without knowing what to say. I had already hinted at it in my card.

""I was, why?""

""I really like you, but I am not ready. I want to finish college first, my love language is physical touch, and I can't bear to be in a long distance relationship."" 

""Give me a minute to respond."" 

I muted myself and bawled my eyes out. My upset didn't come from her feelings, but from the way I trusted in her intentions being the same as mine for so long without her telling me otherwise. It was so inconsiderate that she waited this long to tell me.

""Well it's going to be awkward if we meet. We have one bed and tickets to the place I was going to ask you.""

""I'm comfortable with it though!""

And blah blah blah blah blah.

I can't refund the hotel nor these tickets. She still wants to meet me. I feel like she's only leading me on but my liking to her has blinded any rational thought. Maybe she just doesn't like me enough? But I'm super indecisive right now and I need help. 

Do I meet her without making it overly romantic, and have fun? Or do I take another friend with me and tell her to stay home?

What would you do in my shoes?

For context, my father divorced my brother’s mom before he met my mom. He then divorced my mom when I was 12. He met a woman 13 years younger than he, married her and they now have a 2 year old child together.

It has been pretty clear from the beginning that my step mom is not a big fan of either my brother or me, I’m not sure why but she’s always been a little passive/awkward around us. Might be the fact that we were fully grown when we met her and our personalities are vastly different from hers, so she felt like she couldn’t really have a relationship with us as a step-mom.

So here’s the weird part - My brother and I received a christmas card from my step-mom with pictures of my little brother, father and her and it says “Merry Christmas from the [our last name]s”.

"I [19M] like a girl [18F] I know and I don't know what I should do considering the situation

Hey everyone, so basically, I [19M] started staying at my [24M] friends house for the past 2 months, he has a girlfriend, and she has a [18F] sister, let's call her Amy.

Until about a month ago, Amy and I didn't really speak much, until one night, we both just started breaking the ice with eachother, we spoke in the lounge until about 2 in the morning even though she had finals at 8 the next morning.
From there, we'd been starting to speak more gradually, we'd basically speak in the lounge while watching movies or whatever until 12-2 in the morning, we realised we both have quite a lot in common, we have the same personality type, have a fair amount of interest in common, I've started teaching her how to cook, she even started watching football with me and seems really into it. 

At the time, I had been a month out of my 3 year relationship, so I wasn't really looking to getting into anything as I was still quite hurt from everything. 

While speaking in the lounge until late, I've noticed her body language is really towards me if that makes sense, she faces my way and brushes her hair a lot, not sure if that means anything though. She asked me why I stayed up so late, I told her it's nice speaking to her, she said it's mutual.

Shortly after, I found her Instagram account and saw she has a boyfriend, so I was a bit confused to be honest. She did bring him up not too long after that, so it's not like she was planning on hiding him from me. She saw him for that weekend, and before, she mentioned she didn't really feel like seeing him, since they hadn't seen eachother for 3 months, and their texts were one worded. 

Fast forward to last week, I went out to a club with my friend, his gf and Amy. When we got just above tipsy I noticed she started having more physical contact, such as playfully hitting me and things like that, which she doesn't normally do. This is where things started becoming really confusing to me, so my friend and his sister decided to go home, with the car, so we stayed there a bit longer. When we did decide to leave I asked Amy if she wanted to Uber, she said she would prefer walking (which was a 30 minute walk at 2). We started walking and we randomly started holding hands, she asked if it's weird, I just said no it's all good. Maybe it was because she was drunkish or scared I'm not sure, but the fact that she has a long distance relationship boyfriend and did that started making me ask questions. 

And what makes me question it more, she has a male friend who likes her, and especially recently he has been seeing her more and visiting, he admitted to liking her 2 weeks ago, she told him she doesn't like him and has a boyfriend, they agreed to continuing being friends, and shortly he came over and we were watching a movie with the family, and he was sitting next to her, and was holding her leg, I saw she was uncomfortable. She told me the next day that she didn't know what to do in that situation, and she was very uncomfortable with everything, which makes me wonder why she wasn't uncomfortable with holding my hands for 30 minutes, maybe just the alcohol?

We've still been speaking for the past week, and didn't bring up anything about holding hands, so I'm not sure what to do with that, because I feel like I want to know from her why she did that, but I don't want to ask her directly because it might make things awkward between us, so I'm trying asking her if how her boyfriend would feel about the situation by starting the conversation.

"Me(M28) and my GF(F31) were friends for a year and recently became a official (the week after thanksgiving). Im from a big close knit family and she is not. I do want her to meet my family but since we just started to date, im not sure when a good time is. We both live far from family so it has been easy to keep it on the low from them. I told my family about her over thanksgiving and then told my sister we made it official the week after. My family can be alot especially for someone that is not from a big family. My family is the type that you cant just meet the parents and siblings, you have to meet cousins, grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc. When I go home, I have to dedicate a day to go around the city to visit each person. All of my cousins are still with the first person they introduced to the family, some have kids with them. I've never introduced anyone to my family so this is the first GF they know about. Already people are expecting me to introduce them to her. When I talk to my sister she asks, when she can meet her. I love my family but I know they dont realize that not everyone has a family like ours and they can come off as too inviting. I've warned my GF a little about this, she thinks it's nice but she also has some nerves about it.

My sister is one of my biggest concerns. She is great but at times can be combative, a little controlling, hard-headed and likes sticking her nose where it doesnt belong. Her and I have butt heads over these things over the past few years. Where she feels she needs to make up for her bad behavior with me growing up and now wants to now play the ""protective big sister"". Like I do worry that if they meet she'll be looking for reasons to not like my GF. My GF and I bicker sometimes but it's never bad, I can see my sister trying to get in the middle of it and making it bigger than it has to be. I like that she is taking an interest in my dating life, but with other things in my life I sometimes feel she tries to butt-in to thing that shouldnt concern her and wants to do things her way without consideration. I can see a scenario where my sister tries to use my GF to try and control or manipulate situations. I've seen her do this with some of my cousins GFs.   


My sister texted me asking if my GF would feel weird if she sent her a xmas gift. I felt weird about it because her and I just started to date, I could be blowing it out of proportion or worried what type of gift my sister would send. My sister is that type of person that would send the gift and leave a note inside calling my GF her sister. I worry how my GF might feel or react to it since she has some nerves about my big family.

I know my supervisor is religious and I’m more than positive we’ve had a conversation at some point and I told her that I wasn’t religious. That was probably 5 years ago when I was going through the death of a close family member.  

She has brought up religion/having faith a few times in reference to her own life, which is fine. I do start to get uncomfortable with anyone if God, Jesus, or religious wording comes up in conversations too much. 

I’m not religious, and I think religion is a personal journey someone needs to make and can not and should not be pushed onto people. Maybe some day I’ll find religion, or at least some spiritual pathway that isn’t religion, but today is not that day.

Today I found a gift at my desk that’s a book about the wonders of prayer and finding a powerful connection to God. I know her heart is in the right place and she does deeply care about me, but I don’t know how to accept this gift. I feel uncomfortable even receiving it because I feel as though it’s getting pushed onto me. Yes, I know I can just choose not to read it, but I doubt she would appreciate a book along the lines of “How to enjoy your life religious free!” Or “You don’t need religion to have a good life!”

I don’t know if I’ll ever read it, and I want to make it known that I don’t want gifts like this. However, I don’t want to come off as rude either. I could fake an appreciation for it but that feels really insincere to do and I don’t know if I want to do that either. How should I approach/address this situation?

TLDR:  I’m not religious, but my supervisor bought me a non fiction religious book for Christmas. I don’t know if I should fake an appreciation (which feels insincere) or tell her this isn’t something I’m comfortable with accepting.

I (23f) got pregnant almost 3 months ago by my bf (30m). I am going to be completely candid and honest with everything since I never have been out of shame. 
I moved to his small town and it’s been almost 2 years now. We love each other very much but we are so so different. He is Mormon and I like metaphysical stuff it’s never been a problem in our relationship but his family does not care for me at all. I’ve never really tried to forge the relationship either just feels like there’s no interest on both sides and they are Uber religious. We are raised very differently so during our 2 years together we’ve had problems. I started dating him m immediately after meeting him and within the first few weeks(3) I went back home and slept with my ex, I admitted this and asked him for forgiveness and he did forgive me. He had an inappropriate relationship with his ex gf as friends and they would call and text all the time and he would complain about me throughout the relationship. I asked him to stop he did but started back up again. I broke up with him bc of it and went on a date with a guy to a wedding then never talked to wedding guy ever again. I also told him about this. Now it’s been maybe 3 months since he’s had any relationship with her. Half a ago He went out of town for work and tried to go on a date with a girl. It never happened He never admitted it to me I had to find it out by going through his phone. He said he couldn’t and that solidified he couldn’t live without me but I saw in his text to his friend that he was excited about it. He is also addicted to porn. Since he’s found out about the baby 3 months ago he has made a big effort to stop lusting after everything, I check his fyp on Instagram and tiktok and it isn’t related to half naked girls anymore. He is a calm and patient guy that never gives up I think he would be a good dad. I have a sharp tongue and get med often and hurtful that is my fault I try to leave a lot and say things below the belt. I just hold so much pain and resentment from everything and do not know if he can ever be faithful, tell me the truth, or stop being addicted to looking at sw online. We have already argued about custody and about the baby bc we’ve broken up few times in the last 3 months. He’s kicked me out and I went back to my apartment. I threw ranch all over his kitchen when I found out he was going on a ski trip w his friends. The good is good the bad is bad. I want to have my baby in my home state so the custody battle goes in my favor if anything and I have no support in his home state only from him when we are doing good. I hate that he will not be there for appointments or birth or post partum. I told him I would give my best effort to forgive and make us a happy family and that if in the next 6 months he wanted to move to be with us there I would like that. I am not asking anything more of him than he has of me I moved out here and payed for everything, found a home, and a job on my own. I don’t know if he would do it. We love each other very much and we’re both trying our best but the problems of reality are still there. I have thought about aborting several times and is against it bc of his religion but has expressed that adoption could be an option. If I am having the baby I am going to keep it, we are both very financially stable. What should I do? Have an abortion and suffer guilt and losing the person that I love forever or have the baby and deal with his family maybe never liking me and us not ending up together and always fighting over custody, being a single mom and ruining my body?

"Hello everybody I've been with my gf for 2 years, we already moved together, we see each other everyday, we've bought our own things for our house and we get along really well.
What I've found out is that before she met me she was dating a guy and she kept seeing him for 1 month and a half after we started dating. 
She has never told me about him but I was suspicious about this because one day almost 1 year and a half ago some random guy went to her house crying and asking what happened with her and why she haven't texted him in a while.
At that time she told me it was some random guy she used to date before me but never told me that she was dating both of us simultaneously.
I was suspicious about this so I started looking up on her phone and found out she kept dating him for 1 month and a half after we started dating. She met him 1 month before meeting me
I confronted her about and she started crying and explained me that at that moment she thought I didn't want anything serious with her so she kept dating around and when I asked her to be exclusive she was really surprised and then she decided to stop seeing the other guy. I also found out that she slept with this other guy while she was dating me and also sleeping with me so I called her a slut and thrash and she started crying even more. 
She told me she haven't told me because at that time I used to tell her that people who dates multiple people are worthless and trash so she kept that in her head after all this time and she was scared to tell me.
I feel hurt but I love her and I don't know what to do. Technically It's not cheating because at that time we wasn't exclusive or in a relationship but I feel cheated on but at the same time I also was dating and sleeping but other girl but only for 2 weeks after meeting my gf. She kept dating this guy for 1 month and a half so I don't know how to feel 
What's your opinion on this? Should I keep her or break up with her?

UPDATE: I told her I'm sorry for calling her a slut and trash and told her that her past self was that not now.
She told me she is going to do everything to deserve me and show me that she is not worthless. She says is going to ask for forgive to my family for disrespecting me and that she deserves to feel bad for what she did.
I asked her to delete all her photos and ig stories of that time.

"i (F20) ruined my boyfriend's (M18) sex drive. our sex life has always been a bit different to me. it felt very awkward at first of course but then i eventually took a dominant role and it stayed like that for a while. i always initiate, i am always the one to say when i'm in the mood, i prompt just about every single thing in our sex life. i started asking and talking with him about why he doesn't initiate these things if he wants me and feels the same way. this lead to a blowout over the course of about a week which was very stressful. i was not understanding why, if he felt and wanted the same exact ways i did, why he simply wouldn't make a move. ever. i probably put pressure on him to do this so the whole thing was very stressful. we talked a lottt and things seemed to be much better and our sex life resumed, but i stopped initiating for about 2 weeks and we didn't have a sex life for a bit. When asked about it he revealed to me that the whole event stressed him out so bad he didn't feel horny anymore. i am still completely crushed. he said this about 2 months ago and only yesterday did we engage in anything sexual. but i felt so guilty despite him saying he wanted it too. i can't believe i made him feel THAT stressed out. i just don't know what to do. or how to feel. is it all my fault? i feel like you should never make your partner feel sexually debilitated. i feel like a terrible person and our sex life/relationship is forever ruined.",I (F20) ruined my boyfriend's (M18) sex drive,18myflw,1703089232.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18myflw/i_f20_ruined_my_boyfriends_m18_sex_drive/,
"Flash back to 2017, I met the sweetest girl online. She’s thoughtful, optimistic, and was always very straight forward in a gentle way. I liked her enough to go out with her for a few dates, and I could tell she liked me a lot. But when she asked to dtr, I ended up breaking things off with her because she wasn’t as financially stable as me. I didn’t tell her, but it was also because (complete transparency) she wasn’t as conventionally pretty as I’d like. She’s not unfortunate looking, in fact she’s quite pretty, but I just have a preference for girls who are slimmer. Like I said, she is the sweetest girl I’ve ever met, and we remained friends even after I rejected her.

In 2020, I met someone else online, and she was older (then 33F) and our parents pushed us to get married, especially because she was here on a work visa, and with the pandemic, jobs were not as stable. She’s smart, had two PhD and a very well paying job. She also fit my type very well. We got married late 2020.

After marriage, I found out a LOT of lies that ultimately led to divorce. It is still a messy situation, and throughout it, I have been talking to the girl I met in 2017. She and her now-husband have been very supportive and are continually reaching out to check in on me. He knows that we went out on a few dates and that things didn’t work out, so there is no sneaky business there. 

I am now bitter that I rejected her and didn’t stay with her. I know I would’ve been happy with her and I completely fucked it up.  I think in the past few years, I’ve completely fallen for her since she is the first person I WANT to share everything with and talk to, and I’m now actively restraining myself. I am not going to try and mess up their marriage and I’ve stopped reaching out, but THEY reach out because they’re worried about me when I don’t talk to them for a while.

"I have been dating my boyfriend since 4 months and he passes random comments about my body and classifies it as 'fun'. I would give two instances: One day while I was cooking, he comes from the back and grabs hold of my love handles/oblique fat (I am 5'9 and I wouldn't call myself fat at all) and says 'you look like you are from a wealthy family who gets good food' and he laughed that off. Someone who struggled her whole life with food disorder, this comment threw me off. I explained it to him and he promised he would not do it again. Second instance: while we were scrolling through Tiktok on my phone together while on the bed, he passed the comment 'your nose is like two big tunnel'. We laughed it off but such comments always stay in my head. I never even thought about my nose like that but when someone I love passes such comment, it sticks. I have never knowingly commented on any part of his body ever because I know what it feels like when someone comments things on your body. He thinks all of this as joke and when I don't, he says 'you are such a mood kill', which actually kills my mood.  
I love him but I want him to stop commenting on my body or any parts of it. I have never seen my dad comment on any part of my mom's body and they have been happily married for 30 years.

"Hello

Known this person for some years now and we broke up earlier this year got unrelated things and have since lived separately, I got a new job and we started peaking again now I'm doing therapy and stuff and all is well.

However this weekend just gone my mother went to hospital for a hip replacement and my dad has taken this week off work until she can get around by herself. She's only had 1 hip done and still waiting for the other. She's also in her 70s.

She needed help getting to the toilet and the other day it took my dad 1 hour for them to hobble there and back. 2 days ago down to 20 minutes so progress is made lol

Well my GF hates my mother and has the opinion that my mum is manipulative and doesn't need any help with that at all. She even went as far to Google the whole thing and told me that people can manage completely by themselves and that she's just making things up to be worse than they are. As I'm writing this I can hear her shuffling to her room on her crutches.

I feel like blowing up at my GF but at the moment I haven't said anything about it and have just been keen to pursue different subjects. This is due to the fact that going through therapy right now and the fact that my mother has been a little manipulative/ hasn't made great choices regarding other people before (it's hard to say because I honestly think she's getting a tad senile now) I don't feel I have confidence in my own decisions whenever something emotional happens.

"So I distanced myself because of the toxic/abusive relationship she is in and how majorly it’s affecting our friendship. It’s been going on since January/February and they break-up/make up on a weekly basis. Their private business is posted on Snapchat stories/insta etc. 

I felt like she only made time to speak to me or to see me whenever she needed support or things were not going well between them to rant then couple hours later she would go back like nothing happened. 

It started making me uncomfortable so I left her private stories and blocked her on tik tok not to see the content she posts. 

I got a message today from her and tried calmly explain that I do care about her and wish her well but it’s just draining and makes me uncomfortable. In return she called me a hypocrite and told me she has been an amazing friend so it’s my loss and I just calmly said “I’m sorry if this is how you feel”. 

Then she went and blocked me on Snapchat and Instagram.

"First, I have been feeling off about a few things and one day her phone was unlocked and I looked at a lot of things. 

Second, girlfriend is in quotes bc we have not verbally committed. We have been sleeping with each other exclusively, saying I love you, with each other every night, and been clear that talking to other people is inappropriate. 

We talked about her and her ex. She said she could still be cool with him. And in her phone she did message him setting a boundary about not bringing up reconciliation because that has sailed. However I saw she had called him and talked for an hour and he invited her to a holiday party and she said she may show up. 

I feel like this is something she should’ve shared with me and I haven’t been told anything. 

She also lied about the timeline of dealing with someone. Weeks before she met me she was actually intimate with someone. And apparently they had history, but this time was just fwb. He was actually married and she found out and it ended a few weeks before we met. However when I asked who she dealt with before me she claims for months she was alone dealing with no one. And when I asked her specifically about that person, she lied as well. 

Finally, she told me there’s someone she works with who they messed around years ago. She says they are friends and he does get her a lot of gigs for her business and sends money her way. So she wants to keep the friendship. She asked me how I felt and I said, as long as it is platonic it’s fine. Well, although on her end it is he does text “I love you”, I miss you, and call her babe. She doesn’t reciprocate at all and will stop texting when he says stuff like that to her credit. She also talks to him when I’m not around AND she will go out to dinner with him after work if she and I are beefing typically. 

We’ve been dating going on 6 months. She’s not sleeping with anyone from what I see.

I just wonder why she doesn’t want to tell me these things or having these inappropriate dealings. I am not her typical type by age or look, and I think that may be stirring something up in me and maybe I’m a placeholder/experiment for her.

 Idk if she has feelings for her ex, and hoping she can get over him, our situation did move fast (although everything I get in moves fast) — is there something here? Do I let this go? Are these not relationship breaking?

"Okay, so I’ve been dating this person who after many long but ultimately unfit relationships finally seemed to be “the one” the connection was so instant it was electric. 

Both of us could tell that we made each other immediately really happy. I truly don’t think it’s one of those maybe she felt differently type of situations. 

One day after about a month she randomly loses all momentum. Messages me once a day and no convo starting messages and basically doesn’t want to meet anymore. This was like over night level change. 

I’m really confused and hurt so much at this point because I REALLY liked this person and although I’ve had much longer relationship breakups this one had such a special nature that I’ve never felt before. I was so hurt it was physically painful. I kept texting are we good? And because we hadn’t dated for long I didn’t want to rock up at her place like a psycho.

I ended up deciding if she didn’t want to communicate I would get one over by blocking her. This gave a small amount of catharsis the idea of her going to message me and my name not being there. Unfortunately it’s not made the pain go away for me and I’m just so depressed and constantly wondering what I did to suddenly go from so appealing to completely thrown away.

"So, firstly, I just got out of a narcissistically abusive relationship a few weeks ago, and I'm realizing how it's affecting my ability to trust people and interact with people.

I moved about 45 minutes away from my family's house a couple years ago, and was transferred to the local restaraunt up that way. I was living with my bf at that time, ended up leaving him because he would ignore me for 12+hrs a day at times and his kid was absolute hell. I felt like I was basically a live in maid. Ended up getting with my mechanic, who I found out the hard way was a very abusive covert narcissist. I finally escaped him a few weeks ago, and moved back with my family, but I didn't transfer back down to the other store.

And I started to realize something... I realized how absolutely ecstatic I've always been to go to work - because of one person. Everytime I see my one manager, I excitedly tell him hi, and I actually smile. I love talking with him, and we have this dynamic that is so uplifting and enjoyable. For the past couple years, he's been listening to me cry and complain about dealing with these assholes that break my heart. And he always tells me that I'm a bright, beautiful woman and I deserve to be happy. When I was with my narc ex, he told me that I have too good of a heart and I was wasting it on someone who only cared about himself. He was right for sure, and that really stuck with me.

It's driving me crazy. He's like 20ish years older than me, but we get along as well as I do with my brother. I've always been able to just be myself around him, and he still says I'm unique and it's a good thing lol. I won't transfer stores to one that's 5 minutes away, because I'd miss him. So I keep driving my shitty car 45 minutes to work everyday. I think he's been asking me to hang out without directly asking me, and because of the narcissistic abuse I just endured, I feel to distrustful and awkward around people to hang out. Last night, I drove him home from work before I went to therapy, because his car wasn't starting, and I became hyper self aware and it made me even more awkward, like I forgot how to form sentences and use words.

Everytime I feel like we're getting closer, I unintentionally fight it, because I'm afraid of being close with somebody again so soon. Even though it's someone I've known and been open and honest with for roughly 2 years now.

I think everyone at work can tell. Last night, my one coworker called me out on it. He said, ""You dont work today. Youre just here to see him."" I said, ""Yep, you caught me,"" lol. They probably knew before I knew, because it was just like a couple days ago that i realized how I've felt for the past couple years. When there's no customers, I wonder off to go talk to him and I'll just follow him around like I'm in a trance or something. Yesterday I noticed how I smile everytime he does, and I think his missing tooth is the cutest thing ever. I feel this energetic rush when I see him, like my whole world just lights up.

I really just want to tell him how I feel, because I can't bear keeping anything to myself. But I'm afraid of that. Because once I say it, then what's next? I just went through a pretty traumatic experience and am not ready for a relationship. But everytime I talk to him, it's like much wow, I'm so excited and elated and happy. I can't take it. I get so happy that I become afraid of losing it, so I just take two steps back. And then I reprimand myself for taking steps back.

Should I tell him how I feel? I feel like it's pretty obvious, but maybe its not. He seems to be about as awkward as I am, so it might be really awkward for both of us. I almost wish he'd just stumble upon this post, and then I wouldn't have to say it lol.

"So... the title pretty much sums it up. Looking for some advice here. 

Basically, my boyfriend has a history of being a workaholic of sorts, and our last major fight (one of our only fights, I might add we get along very well) was about how I don't feel like a priority for him. In the heat of the moment, he said that he ""doesn't want balance until he has millions in the bank"" etc. Keep in mind I am not high maintenance at all, and for months all I'd asked for was a simple date that he would plan. Little gestures mean much more to me than anything. But it seems like they're an inconvenience for him at best. 

We ended up talking it out, and we both came to understanding that after being together for almost 2 years, we had gotten comfortable, and need to continue to strive to be better for ourselves and our relationship. It all was resolved and we've gotten along well since then...  

Until yesterday (LOL).  Essentially, my family has invited him to our annual ski trip out West at a very nice ski resort. I have 2 sisters who have never invited a guy on the trip, and I'm the youngest so it was a big deal when he got invited last year. We all had a great time as we all are avid skiers. I feel like it's a great gesture on behalf of my family to welcome him and everything. However, I do feel as though he doesn't put in effort with my family a lot.. (for example, his bday was on the trip last year, my dad got him an extremely nice dinner, bottle of wine, etc. and everyone was in a good mood, but he just sat there looking miserable.) 

So that brings me to yesterday. We've had to get our ski passes and flight tickets 6 months ago because they sell out, in addition to dinner reservations, lodging, etc. My family is covering everything except his ski pass.  Yesterday, he randomly goes ""Would it be a big deal if I didn't come this year?"" And I was confused and said ""WDYM?"" He then said he has a lot of work to do and wants to get ahead for the New Year. Keep in mind, the trip is over Christmas, so that would mean we wouldn't spend Christmas together. Some other information: he tends to say he ""needs to do work"" a lot, in my opinion, to avoid other plans. Whenever the weekend is around the corner and I ask him about what we should do, he always says ""I need to get some work done,"" and then I'm the one who has to plan anything at all. He might get some stuff done, but usually he's just chilling watching Youtube or on his phone. So it's not like he's actually getting work done 24/7. 

I've always been completely supportive and understanding of his drive and journey as an entrepeneur, but I also struggle with the lack of balance because I grew up with 2 extremely successful parents who 1) came from nothing so worked more than he ever will and 2) never talked about work at home EVER -- and they're still together so I've understood that separating work and home is important for healthy long-term relationships.

This whole ordeal has made me feel the way I did when we had our huge fight, which was the accumulation of months and months of asking for the bare minimum and feeling like there was no effort. I feel guilty for my family and also want some advice on how to navigate conversations about balancing life with a successful career. Thank you in advance for all of your input!

"I (21F) have been dating a guy (22M) for close to a year now, I want to preface by saying we are not officially boyfriend and girlfriend yet. We are exclusive however and are “dating” if you will, it’s a weird concept to me as well. The reason for this is that we were prepared to do LDR, and he made it clear he wasn’t keen on that, so we just didn’t get together. That kind of changed, he didn’t end up going overseas to start his business and is trying to start smth new. 

I know this sounds pretty pathetic but in the moment I didn’t really care if he asked me to be his GF, because we were practically alr BF/GF. But now it kinda started to bother me. A month ago I asked him why he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet, and he responded with a smirk. It really put me off him, and I asked jokingly is it because I’m not wifey material and he said yes. I was taken aback and furthered my question with “you mean because I don’t cook and clean?” He said yeah and I laughed it off and dropped it. I was really offended by these comments. Why should I have to cook and clean in this day and age? Yeah I’m a shit cook but wtf. I come to see him every week even though he has a car, I take care of him, I buy him things for his health and daily life, and I do clean. But most importantly, I show I love and care for him and support him even though his business is practically failing and it hasn’t even started. Meanwhile, he constantly reminds me about how he is going to be successful and won’t tolerate a useless partner, so I better work for a good career. I don’t want to sound arrogant here, but I come from a very well to do family, my parents own their own business. I didn’t want to use their connections because I just want to prove to myself I can make it on my own first. I will take over the business eventually. I just want to start from the bottom. He thinks I’m being stupid, I might be, but it’s my life and my choice. 

Point is, how is someone who has not accomplished anything yet, telling me that I’m useless? Sorry if that sounded cocky. But does anyone else see the irony here? Furthermore, I never used this against him, just told him I want to make it on my own and supported him in his dreams, even though in my opinion they are far fetched and have already failed and he doesn’t even have a job. As if that’s not enough, he makes fun of my religion. I come from a controversial religion that I don’t practice but keep by name because I have been raised this way. He uses every chance he gets to tell his friends “Oh by the way, she’s xxx” they are all obviously shocked. He told his parents as well and they were shocked. I acknowledged it’s controversial but he knows I don’t practice so why do that? And he’s doing it in a way to make fun of me which I’ve told him to stop but he just laughs at me. He’s spared no efforts in informing everyone every chance he gets. It’s so upsetting to me. 

My family and friends hate his guts. They think he’s controlling and emotionally manipulative because he doesn’t want me to hang out with anyone he doesn’t like (which is practically all my friends), doesn’t want me to club and drink. Even if it’s my best friends birthday and I ask him along. He just says no and when I ask if it’s ok that I go, he says “u do u”. It’s so fucking toxic. 

I feel like I’ve finally fallen out of love for him, I just don’t feel emotionally fulfilled at all. I fell in love because I love ambitious men, which he was until he gave up on his failing businesses and had no back up plan. How do I end this relationship that hasn’t even begun? I’m a very non confrontational person and always give in to others so I feel like I am too scared to end it. Has anyone been in this situation before? What was the final straw, or what made u finally end things?

"I need advice. My (23f) boyfriend (24m) has a lot of female friends, in my opinion. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. He used to follow over 250 women on instagram. I know, it is super weird of me to count but he claimed that they were all “really good friends.” I asked him if he could clean it out because I wasn’t comfortable with him being “really close” with over 250 females and he cleaned it out twice, but still follows over 200 women. He swears that they are super close friends and that he had a life before me, so I shouldn’t ask him to remove more women. 

Along with this, he is constantly liking all of their pictures on instagram. Some of the pictures are normal pictures, but a lot of them are bikini pictures. After discussing this, he likes fewer bikini pictures. But he is still liking a ton of women’s pictures. He says that they are all super good friends and I shouldn’t be upset. 

Another thing is that he texts women a LOT. He often calls them “mi amor” or “mi vida” and adds a lot of heart eye emojis, kissy face emojis, and hearts. He says that he is just being friendly and that this is his culture (he’s Hispanic). I’ve had multiple conversations with him about this due to me being uncomfortable. However, sometimes I catch him still sending messages like these to other women. He also often deletes chat threads with women and claims that there was nothing bad he just “didn’t want me to get upset.” Which I understand, however, I feel like deleting the messages is even more suspicious. 

I know I might sound super controlling and anxious, however, he has a past history of cheating on me multiple times. I recently found out he used to be on dating apps and even texted women to meet up, saying we had broken up when they asked about me. This past issue makes me skeptical that these “friends” are just friends, especially with the way he texts them and interacts with them. 

What do you guys think? Is this normal behavior? Can a man really have over 200 “really close” female friends? Is this flirtatious texting just a Hispanic culture thing? Should I try and trust that he’s being honest? What are reasonable boundaries to have in this situation?

"I´m so sad right now. 1.5 months ago I met a cute guy at my university´s club &amp; after several group hangouts he finally asked me out. He told me I´m the first girl he likes, he never dated/kissed anyone. To avoid rumours, he wanted to keep it secret in uni which was fine.

**So we went on 8 wonderful dates,** held hands and discussed our life goals &amp; values (e.g. no casual dating). Also shared some trauma (him: emotionally unavailable parents, me: being used for sex). Incredibly refreshing for both of us. After our first kiss, we couldn’t get enough of each other. I was head over heels when he told me he *„really likes me“*! But during exam phase he got so stressed, we only met once in 2 weeks and texted every few days. So when winter break started &amp; he wanted to see me, I got so excited!!

**Yeah…then he dumped me.** He doesn’t feel ready to *„be someone´s someone“*. That’s why he never dated. It’s not about me; he pressures himself. He has lots of upcoming projects and not enough time. We would fight and break up. And the reason why he tells me now is, he doesn’t want to wait until sex and make me feel played.  


In shock I told him I don’t expect him to be my boyfriend *right now*. I also have things to do, no problem. But ofc I´ll respect his decision. I still enjoyed our time. When I asked if he did too, he said: *„Maybe…I´m confused“* which hurt a lot. He thanked me for *„caring about him and his story“*. He’ll never forget that.

While walking me home, he asked me if we can meet in my country some day. (I´m a foreigner moving here in 2024). Also if we can stay friends. And if I´d still show up to the club on Saturday. I couldn´t decide on anything.So he just hugged me tight twice. We both didn´t want to let go. *""Thank you""-""Thank you""*. That was it.

But there was this girl i was friends with and i felt like she had a thing for my partner and I told him to stay away from her but he kept going out with her even when i wasn’t there. 
I traveled one day with a friend and we knew a high school friend in the same area thats high school friend has a girlfriend for 11 years whom i’ve never met. We went out clubbing and i felt like he was being flirty but nothing happened, a few days later i randomly video called my partner and he was hanging out with that girl in her house and i was so sure i want to break up with him we went clubbing again and i was being super flirty and then i got drunk and kinda greened out, he seemed like he wanted to kiss me but i avoided the situation but when we got back to the hotel we fell asleep spooning and the next day we also sexted but then i told him i regret the whole thing and when i came back we solved the whole issue with that girl and my bf told me nothing happened, its been 1.5 years and I feel super super guilty more so for the sexting than anything. We are going to get married soon and whenever things are really good i feel guilty.

"I’m feeling very conflicted right now and just wanted some unbiased opinions regarding if I did something wrong here. So last night my husband (M48) and I (F39) were lying in bed when he asked me to set his alarm clock for him on his phone. I did, however when I unlocked his phone the first thing that popped up was a NSFW Reddit sub. To be more specific, red head porn. Obviously I was taken aback by it but more so because he has always told me he wasn’t into watching porn. I have tried to get him to watch it with me since I thought it would be fun and he has always refused and said he didn’t need to watch it in order to get off and he has made comments that discussing sex with me makes him uncomfortable. Honestly, it made me feel bad for asking. Against my better judgement but wholeheartedly due to curiosity and excitement, I began to look through his search history to see what sort of things he was into because I saw it as an opportunity to learn about the things he might enjoy but may be too embarrassed to share with me, so I could surprise him by incorporating them into the bedroom the next time we were intimate. Instead,  I started to figure out that he had been searching for one account in particular. He had typed out different names in an attempt to find this one account until he was successful. I learned she was an actual person from the city he was recently working in and the sub was advertisements of her OF account. Now that bothered me. When we did have talks regarding sex early on in our relationship I made sure to discuss my boundaries as did he and OF was something I felt I would only be comfortable with if I knew about it and I agreed to him subscribing because in most cases it’s always someone the subscriber knows therefore to me it’s more personal than porn.  I won’t lie, this hurt on a level I have never experienced before because we have been having a dead bedroom lately and no matter what I do I just feel rejected. I attempted to talk to him about it making sure I was not accusatory because I honestly didn’t and still don’t know what his intentions were other than him looking her up on Reddit. Instead, it turned into an argument where he accused me of betraying his trust by going through his search history even after I explained why I did it. And yes, I definitely regret it now. He refused to talk to me and even went as far as to delete all his social media accounts and his Reddit, which I feel is a bit extensive especially since I didn’t accuse him of anything. What makes this even harder is that I am autistic and I have a hard time processing disagreements because I end up hyper fixated on the how, the way, the who, etc. This then causes my anxiety to be at its all time high and it certainly is right now. He won’t talk to me and he keeps reading my texts and not responding so I feel absolutely horrible now. Did I honestly do something wrong? If I did, I don’t know how to fix it. I’m confused and my self esteem has taken a huge hit.

"So I f24 have been seeing m22 for like 8 months now. I do social media and that’s how he found me. Originally it started off as just friends cause we hit it off really well and it gradually progressed to more. I’m extremely open that I do OF on the side cause just social media by itself is hard. He knew very quickly into finding me that I do it and when we were just friends they knew all about it cause I would confide in them. I told them that once I was making enough money from other endeavors that I’d stop cause it’s not my favorite thing to do and that I wanted a partner who wouldn’t be upset by what I did and they understood so when we started to see eachother I thought they understood but a few times now their mother has brought it up in passing how much it upsets him and this upsets me. I know they can see my online interactions and now I get worried about saying or doing certain things out of fear or upsetting them. It’s making it harder to do my work normally online. It also upsets me that their mother is getting into it cause I already feel a little weird that they know I do OF and have openly told me they think me working with other people is trashy and I’ve since stopped doing collabs because his mother gave me a sizeable amount to focus on my other endeavors but it just makes me feel bad. I’ve been doing OF long before I met them and he knew what I did in detail before getting involved and he hasn’t said anything to me directly about it but his mother on a few occasions has off hand brought it up.

"F/24 M/22 So I’ve been stewing on this for awhile. The first time it happened was because I made a joke for a reaction over text but he never told me he opened it so I wasn’t able to complete the joke, instead he opened it and told his mom about it because it upset him as he didn’t know it was a joke which is valid but instead of talking to me about it directly the next time I was at his house his mom confronted me about it and told him that it sounded like he was seeing a child. I didn’t say much but explained that I was just trying to make a joke and that our sense of humor was different. Now the second time was when I was staying at his house and I left a hickey on his neck. I told him before leaving it that I was worried his mom would see but he assured me he’d cover it. Well she saw it and just kinda went off a little but not too badly just exclaiming that she was upset and that I should know better because I’m 24. I like his mom a lot but at the same time I feel on edge because I’m now constantly worried about his mother not liking me and at times it feels like I’m dating someone that still has to have supervision. The fact his mom feels so comfortable openly scolding me for something that should be just between me and the person I’m seeing just makes me not want to be involved. I feel like our issues between us aren’t private and it makes me feel less inclined to communicate on them as I worry his mom will get involved.

"I am 30M turning 31 in June. Decent IT job, apartment, car, and motorcycle. 

My situationship partner is 36F. Successful stylist, bougie life style in Iran before starting from nothing in the US, completed citizenship, now owns nice house, new car, and successful hair stylist business. She is all about self improvement, life coaching, good health and I absolutely love it because I’m the same. Recently officially divorced from a marriage that she had since she was 22.

We have been “together” for 2 years. Yes, her and her ex were separated before we met and started the situationship. I knew from the moment I saw her I wanted nothing more than to be with her. She is the total package from being incredibly sweet to everyone around her, smart, deep to talk with, experience life, beautiful mindset, beautiful body, connection on a deep level both physically and mentally..

Over the years there has been some flags that would clearly tell me not to talk on a deeper level on how we felt about each other. When we are together and even on the phone, it feels very emotionally deep and things are said that confuse me on what she wants whether to be friends or more than that.

We are incredibly loving to each other, listen, and talk openly. When we have disagreements, we are calm and collected, and we can talk through it like adults. We make dinner together, I take her out, she even takes me out, she cuts my hair, and we just do life together, and it’s been beautiful.

However recently, we had a deep discussion about our future and that she is getting older. She said she feels how much love I have for her and how when we are together she feels at peace, loved, and nothing else matters… and… Although she feels these things, she said it’s not enough for her. She wants someone that can spoil her, let her be a stay at home mom for 5 years to raise kids, but expensive stuff for her, take multiple trips a year, and she wants that bougie life style she once had. She said I am in no position to give her that and she is thinking about moving on. She said I’m on the right track, but there isn’t time for her to wait. She also said she doesn’t know who she really is by herself. She hasn’t been with anyone except her ex and me.

Granted- she’s right. I make $80k a year. She makes more than me. I don’t have a house and I can’t spoil her with items or have a really nice house while paying for everything like she wants..
I lowered my self-worth by pleading with her that I can be wealthy and I will focus my energy to get better and skilled to get a higher paying job… I’d do anything..

So after time passes… Texts have gone down, calls have gone down, time together has gone down…

I’m thinking to myself.. Before I even met her, she was exactly who I wanted.. I’m not financially good enough… But I know that I can be financially good enough with focus on acquiring additional skills and applying to higher level work…

I’m torn between: 
1. Is this the moment I fight for her and try to become financially capable of what she is looking for? How to deal with this drifting away feeling I’m getting.. 
2. Leave because I am enough and if she doesn’t see that and would rather have a bougie life style, than be with me then that’s her decision.",30M 36F - Fight or Flight?,18mx8zn,1703086193.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mx8zn/30m_36f_fight_or_flight/,

Hey guys! Just a quick disclaimer I please take note we do have a baby involved (7 months) 
I’ll try to make everything quick! We’ve been together for 2 years! Before and during meeting him I was the life of the party, constantly making money, traveling, doing great in the content creator area &amp; basically just really tapping into my element! He’s my first ever boyfriend!

 Everything was great the first year and a half! I was myself, still gleaming and we were doing great as a couple until I got pregnant. My whole mindset changed, I was very focused on building stability and a family. We both wanted this. But as time creeped closer to me being due, I was still working and he was either working very short term or not working at all! His aunt invited us to live in their house so we wouldn’t have to splurge on things and just focus on us getting straight! 

By the time I hit 7 months I was the only one bringing income completely. He would say he’s finding work only to be lollygagging and not getting on his P’s and Q’s! I stopped working because I got way too close to my due date and we only had my savings but of course only emergencies. 

Fast forward to us finally moving everything was cool up until bills and certain responsibilities were still on me. He claimed he was still finding work and I understood (to an extent because of his background check) but I still got an ass about it! 
Now moving forward again, we found a 2 bedroom and moved again but his mom offered us a room so he could work while I got help with the baby (we’re African and everybody is very family oriented and so so soo lovely🥹) 

Now we’re in a whole different predicament and now our kiddo is 7 months and he’s just NOW trying to get things together and I don’t know if it’s because he’s seen me completely dissociated or if he’s actually taking initiative..
Guys I’m at my wits end!!! I prayed and prayed for an answer and I love what we’ve created and how things WERE going but I’m too grown to keep being strung along and being the “breadwinner”. But I also strongly believe in having a stable 2 parent household. I’m done talking &amp; I can tell he’s noticed that.

"we met each other in the middle of the year at college and, to me, it was kinda ""love"" at first sight, i mean, he's handsome so naturally i felt attracted by him. anyways, we ended up being in the same friend group and, honestly, since the beginning we got along pretty well in real life. when we are together we're always laughing and talking about the most random things, whether it's serious (like the day i freaked out due to my grades and he calmed me down) or VERY unserious (we sometimes talk about some sexually related themes even), we're always joking with each other and he's always, not like being rude but, for example, he calls me a weirdo but i know its kinda in an ironic way (i don't know how to call that in english). like i said, in real life. when it comes to online, it's awful. honestly, we just send messages to each other about specific things, but when i try to do a little joke like i do irl he doesnt answer (he answered a few times in the beginning of our friendship when i'd do that on instagram), but i know he's not the best person at answering messages, he never talks in our friends' group message for example.  
  
i don't know if i explained it well, but now we get to the problem, the thing that's been living in my head rent free since friday: we went to the park with our friends for a little goodbye because we're on vacation now and everyone is going home in the next few weeks (he included). i thought that maybe something would happen between us, if you know what i mean, but we barely talked (alone), but i think i caught him looking at me a few times (if that even means anything), he did some jokes to me as usual, but nothing far from that. we hugged each other and that was it. we still have a few days before we go home, but i dont think he's inviting me out, neither am i doing that, i might be reading a little too much into it also, but at the same time i dont think so. maybe i also should shoot my shot, i dont think he would refuse an invitation, but i'm afraid he's accepting it just for the sake of our friend group, if you know what i mean. also, like one of our friends told me, he's an introvert while i'm more of an extrovert (i dont know if thats a problem btw?). i dont know if he sees me as ""more than just a friend"", but, as a friend, i do think he enjoys my company, we're always laughing, he laughs at the worst jokes i make (once, one of our friends asked for help as to what should he be during halloween and i said 'taylor swift!' and he laughed????), i mean, if he doesnt he wouldnt even talk to me, right?! i do enjoy his friendship too and im afraid to ruin it too (and our friend group). i'm also thinking about talking about this to a mutual girlfriend of us to see if she can help me ""better"" with this situation.

She has job offers already fresh out of uni and seems to be in a much better pathway than I am.I do well in school, and I dress mediocre, but I feel that I'm just not as good as her. I am not as rich and thus can't afford the same brands that they like nor am I extremely gifted and hardworking like she is. So I don't understand why he would pick me to be with.I've brought it up once or twice, and even though he reassures me that they are purely platonic and that he sees her as his 'mum' (because she helped shape his fashion and her family helped him through highschool). It actually feels worse, because even if I dress better and become smarter (?), I can never beat the amount of memories and time they've spent together. It's not like I can make him know me 6 years sooner. This is also really bad because I feel like my family is kinda messed up, and I am an only child whereas she has two sisters that he is also close with. He has even met her grandmother apparently, and slept over at her house. My family isn't as warm and I'm not as good, and I'm scared the more he gets to know me the sooner he will realise this and realise how much better she is.Part of me thinks I just secretly crave his validation more straightforwardly (like proudly announcing I'm his girlfriend on all social media platforms) but we are both very private people so I'm not sure how I am going to get that type of validation. He hasn't shown any signs of introducing me to her either...

"So my boyfriend and I have known each other for a while and decided last year to become a couple. He told me that he was ready for a serious relationship and that is what I am also interested in because I want to be a wife and a mother one day. So everything was going great (So I thought), we met up last year, hung out and I left hopeful that we were in this together and building a solid relationship. I had asked him a favour because my car at the garage and I needed a ride to go get it mind you it was an hour drive away from my town and he said yes. Did that happen? No... he ghosted me. I was hurt and confused because I didn't know why he ghosted me especially at a time that I needed him. This was around Christmas time last year. I texted him of course, called him there was literally no communication from his end. I gathered myself together and was doing my best to move on and get on with life. We managed to reconnect a few months later and he was very apologetic about ghosting me and I asked him what was the reason. He told me it was because we were not in agreement over having sex. So his attitude towards it is we should be doing it and I am more of I need to know this is is serious for you and you are not just giving me lip service, I haven't done the deed because its a big deal to me and I want to experience that with someone who understands that plus we are both Christians so y'all know how the Christian community is. So I asked him why he didn't just have the conversation with me before ghosting me and he said he was just way in his head and he wanted to figure it out himself. He expressed how sorry he was and that he would like to try again because he really likes me and can see a future with us. I decided to try again even though I didn't really trust the relationship anymore... ghosting really messes you up. He has assured me that he will not ghost again, he has learnt his lesson and he doesn't want to lose me and he will wait. Mind you this is my 2nd relationship. We reconnected earlier this year. Everything was going good as far as I could tell, of course we had difference of opinions but nothing crazy ever happened. We resolved most issues to do with us. Fast forward to now, we spoke on the 4th of December but I was out of town getting me car MOT at the car dealership and by Wednesday I couldn't get through his phone. I sent him a WhatsApp it only had 1 tick, I tried calling the line is not going through, I tried his social networking sites... nothing. There is absolutely nothing even today. I feel like a fool and I just need some advice because I am dealing with this on my own. I did everything that I know as a woman you have to do so I'm confused. I must say he has health issues so part of me is like is he in a hospital somewhere is that why he hasn't reached out. But I know that is me giving excuses. I just need advice.... Thank you!

"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 7 years and have been living together for the last 1.5 years. 

This summer we sorta hit a rough patch. We weren’t communicating well, the affection wasn’t there, but we discussed it and talked about what we wanted to see more from each other to get back to that happy place.

My girlfriend is also part of a group of friends all around the same age who all met at work. They also hangout outside of work which I’ve also been invited to as her bf. The first time I met them was at a party at one of the guy’s (let’s call him Tim) houses. My girlfriend seemed to be way too interested in only talking to him, to the point where I was totally alone at one point (which she said she noticed but didn’t do anything). I told her this made me super uncomfortable and she needs to have better boundaries with these new friends. She apologized and said it was just because she was excited to have this new friend group and maybe that’s why she was more focused on that.

Fast forward to the last month, she has finally been putting in so much more effort towards our relationship and we both feel that we’re in the best place we’ve ever been. That is until I saw texts on her laptop between her and Tim with clear flirting but not overtly sexual. He would compliment her but she would entertain it. I called her out on this and she said that’s all that happened.

However, after questioning and questioning, she finally admits that Tim told her he has feelings toward her a few months ago after they had been texting almost daily for a month and even asked if she would leave me for him (since she also told him we were going through a rough patch). She claims she was more focused on talking to him because we were going through a rough patch at home. I think it’s the opposite looking back, things probably weren’t going well or improving at home because she was invested in someone else. She said no to him but didn’t say it was because she wasn’t interested or they’re just friends; she said she “can’t”. Implying she wants to but can’t because she’s in a relationship (she says she was never interested in him in that way). She’s telling me she said this because she wanted to spare his feelings because they really were friends (which I don’t doubt) but I’m upset that she even wanted him to think he had a chance. She was thinking more about his feelings than mine.

Given all of this, she still felt that they could continue being friends. So they decided they should take some space for him to deal with his feelings and this bombshell is what triggered her really realizing this was wrong and needs to stop. But still, she missed having him as a friend so she initiated contact with him again a month later because she thought they could continue as friends but this turned into flirting again. She said after that she realized it couldn’t just be friendship either and cut him off for good and hasn’t talked to him since (about 2 months ago). Although they still see each other in the same friend group outings, she says they don’t speak.

She hid all of this from me. She hid a month long of flirting over text (conversations that she would delete so that I wouldn’t see). The only saving grace to me is that she cut off contact herself before I found out. But she admits she let it get too far and just liked the attention and should’ve shut it down way earlier. I told her that I don’t understand how she could still want to be friends with someone she doesn’t respect our relationship at all. 

Now she’s adamant that she’s only focused on us (which I’ve noticed she has been for the last couple months) but if I never found out, she would’ve just continued on as if nothing happened. And only now is she focused on setting clearer boundaries with her friends (keep in mind I already asked her for this when I first met them). She had to make this huge mistake to realize that I actually meant what I was saying and that I was right all along

I know I would be a huge idiot to stay. She thinks that things can be great since they have been for the last couple months but I tell her that’s only because she got scared of losing everything and decided to actually get her shit together now. She promises it will never happen again but to me, this is just the classic cheating response but I’m supposed to just trust her on this because she “really means it”. I’m not sure what I want from this post.

"We have been together for just under 6 years.  For the past 1-2 years, things haven’t been great between us. There is a lack of connection and neither of us feel like we are truly happy. But at the same time, we still love each other dearly and still have some really great times together. Additionally, we have spoken several times about wanting to improve our relationship, but it has never seemed to come to fruition.

Anyways, we both work really demanding/tough jobs, which I think has contributed to our problems. She was recently assigned a new project that has been even more demanding. A few days ago, I brought up the subject of our relationship and how I wanted to improve it. She was nice enough to hear me out, but essentially said she has too much on her plate with work to truly give me what I need. She said she understands that it’s not fair to me, but that it’s the truth. This is a 12-16 month project.

"Hello there, I’m new to making posts to Reddit, so bare with me as I attempt to write this. I need to ask for advice, because I don’t know what to do.

Well I’m 19M, and while having been graduated for round bout 6 months now I can say my senior year was no easy feat, considering I had to transfer due to some unfortunate circumstances, but I can confidently say I am still struggling to some degree but definitely better than I was.

At about the same time I graduated, roughly a week or so later, I meet him. Whether some people find dating apps stupid is completely valid, because sometimes I felt that way too. Although I never truly used it for dating, I was very clear that I only sought to make friends. This was more than a dating app, it was simply to meet people with common interests, but majority used it for love or well the other kind of love.

I had meet many people in the time I used that app, but never up until that point had I met him, we will refer to him as M, 24M, now M and I started off a bit further than first base than I’d like to admit, but we did step back and slowly started getting more knowledgeable about one another. He’s learned my past, as well as me learning his. Neither of our lives has been easy, but it didn’t stop us from becoming the best of friends.

Now what even caused this in the first place, well I was up at his house, we tended to watch videos, or play games while up there, you know what friends typically do, but that’s normal for us. On this particular visit I had told him I’d been having a rough work week, holidays aren’t particularly nice to retail workers, especially when it’s the end of the year, but reguardless I had gotten up there feeling a lot of physical pain and mental stress, as I soon as I got in the door I was greeted warmly with a hug, but it continues.

I felt lightheaded, dizzy, like I’m going to pass out and then I do, I tend to overwork myself so this issue can be common with me. As I wake up I see him, I’m laying in his lap, he’s holding me and rather close, he smiles and cracks a joke to cheer me up, he then continues to pull me up onto his chest and says I should get some more rest, pats my head and then we both fall asleep.

Now, this isn’t the first time I’ve passed out, but this is the first time I’ve awoke in his arms, and that’s the moment when something inside of me changed about him. This is the first time I felt this way in a while, and well I can confidently say those have remained. For the past three months, I feel closer and more attached to him, but I’m scared.

This isn’t the only instance of him seemingly being affectionate or caring, he always makes sure that I feel safe and loved in his home, we keep in close contact because the holidays have been more restrictive on when we get to see each other due to family, sickness, or scheduling. We’ve been out to dinner together, I’ve spoiled him, and cooked for him as well. He has a house mate who I’ll call E, he’s been helping me to navigate certain things because he can understand to some degree what I’m going through with M.

So that brings me to this, I’ve never really had good relationships growing up, of the few I had (like twice lmao), I tried my hardest to make them work out, but in this day and age dating has become a toxic environment most of the time, so it scares me to know that I have feelings. I wanna ask him out, but I fear that it’ll end up going wrong, what should I do, as well as any advice?","I [19M] have fallen for my friend [24M], but I’m not sure what to do, any advice?",18mwrxs,1703084965.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mwrxs/i_19m_have_fallen_for_my_friend_24m_but_im_not/,

We both work full time and get paid biweekly, except I rely on my nightly tips and all of her tips go on to her paycheck. I was bringing home enough to cover gas for both of us, food, eating out/going out on our days off, cell phone payments and whatever else she wanted/needed. But when rent comes along, I’m always short because my paychecks are smaller than hers, since all of her tips go on to her paycheck and all of my tips get used for our everyday expenses. She cannot get this through her head and thinks I’m not “pulling my weight”. I tried to explain it to her but she says she’s tired of being broke and covering me. Even though, I cover her everyday and never throw it in her face. I told her we need to manage money better instead of eating out and/or spending too much on our days off. 

We decided both of us need to pay for our own stuff and split everything 50/50. I started a new job 3 days ago and she is already telling me I made the wrong move and won’t make money at this place. I’ve been there for 3 days and they’ve been training days so I only brought home total of $180. She is already saying that she will have to cover “all the bills” this month again. I’m trying to tell her to be patient and wait until I get out of training to get a good idea of what tips coming in will be. 
I feel so put down by her and almost insecure.

"My partner a I have been together almost 3 years, and we've been living together for nearly 2. We both came to the relationship with trauma and are both going to therapy.

I love this woman, she's fun, smart, ambitious, responsible, but also a bit chaotic because of her adhd. She's done very well for herself in her career and has a lot of friends and is on mostly good terms with her family, albeit they are responsible for some of her trauma. She loves to travel and has been all over the world, and is even a polyglot. She's taken me with her and I'm so happy to finally travel, and with someone I adore, I'm happy to be with her. Unfortunately, she's also had past abusive relationships that contribute to her trauma as well, so I try to be considerate of that.

Myself, on the other hand, have crippling adhd and/or might have a touch of the 'tism. I do well enough, I've just always struggled in a lot of aspects of life that most dont. I have no problem making friends, I just struggle at maintaining friendships, I really only have the bandwidth for my relationship and the little friend group we hang out with every once in a while. Careerwise, I do great at my job, but I'm not happy with it and I desperately need a raise, but its enough I don't have to work two jobs, yet. I'm a pretty average guy all around, and I do my best to be a good person and partner, but I have my faults.

Our relationship started after when matched online and went out for a few dates, things were going alright for the most part. We obviously have common interests and get along very well. Well, months later she has to go away for a month for work in a different state. (I should mention that because of a past relationship that my partner cheated on me with my best friend, I carry that trauma and have a difficult time with trust) So she's gone and I'm paranoid. She's never given me direct evidence that she's ever cheated in our relationship, and I'm aware that my paranoia will try to get me to find evidence and I mitigate it the best I can , but there have been, things. She has a lot of guy friends for one, and only recently has had actual girl friends. That work trip, she sent pics from her friend's bed that she was staying with, told me she got in it after he left for work because it was comfier. She does this work trip yearly with the exception of this year, and essentially she works all day till late at night, then goes out drinking with friends, and gets completely shitfaced the last night of the this seasonal job. Once, she came home from a night out drinking with friends and said she made out with a guy she made friends with, I wasn't sure so I asked her to repeat, and she acted like she didn't say anything, then said she was tired and went to bed. When I asked again the next morning after she sobered up she denied it. I love her and she's always been honest, even when she doesn't need to be. She's maintained that she's never cheated on me, and I do my best to believe her. I've made mistakes that would arouse suspicion as well, she's explicitly told me. Once I was scolling through my phone, she saw a sexy, but not nude, pic of a friend from years before we started dating, my fault for not deleting it. Another that happened recently, she found shapewear in the laundry that wasn't hers, that I put there because I thought it was, that I found in my dresser when I was pulling out old clothes. I have no idea where it came from. My guess, is that back when I was using my apartment's laundry center, I picked it up with my clothes, and because I don't go through my clothes often, they just sat in my dresser, a ticking timebomb. I was stupid, one of the stupidest things I've done, but that's all it was, I am not a cheater. She was furious and this has caused a rift that I've been trying to mend.

This year has been rough on the both of us, we've been having a lot of troubles. I had my truck stolen and put my 14yr old dog down, and right now this is currently the 2nd, maybe 3rd time she's tried to break it off with me, and I don't understand this time.

We have a pretty standard relationship dynamic, we get along most of the time. I try to make her laugh, take care of things around the apartment, make sure theres always flowers, give her attention and affection, and make sure she's ""taken care of"" at least once a week. I think I do okay. Sometimes we get on the others nerves, and we argue from time to time, maybe once every other week. It's usually my fault and I usually end up apologizing. Sometimes she doesn't like my driving, sometimes I forget something or wasn't listening to her at the time. It's the same with me, sometimes I'm just an asshole, but I never to intend to be mean or cruel or hurt her, I just have the wrong ""tone"". My love never wavered, I can forgive and forget most things, but she doesn't do that, and things seem to compound. Arguments may get loud, but I never yell, I've never touched her or called her names, however she will yell, has gestured at wanting to hit me, and has even thrown my phone across the room. Usually we make up within a day, but there are situations like now that I'm so lost a hurt that I have no words.

Currently, she is on a month long international vacation with a friend, we have only been able to communicate through email, and I hadn't heard from her the last couple days until this morning. I thought things were good when I dropped her off at the airport, I thought things were good when she was telling me to lock down our next apartment, and I thought things were good when she was emailing me daily.

But this morning, after a brief convo, I get;

""I had a lot of time to think, and I realized I hate how you make me feel a lot of the time. I can't even enjoy these once in a lifetime adventures when you aren't there, and every time we go somewhere, I end up crying. This is what I love to do. This is the ONLY thing that truly brings me joy, I'm really tired of you taking that away from me.""

I wasn't even there to say or do anything wrong.  And admittedly, in the past during vacations, we've fought to the point of bringing her to tears, and obviously I never wanted that, but that's always a mark against me. And never for an entire trip, just once during the trip, we both get frustrated and butt heads. I always apologize, I never want to make her cry, and definitely don't want to ruin our vacation.

I just don't know anymore. She wont be home for another week and a half. I try my best, I love this woman, and I love out little home and family we've made, but I don't know what to do, I thought I was doing okay.

tl;dr Partner says she doesn't trust me and doesn't want to be with me whenever she goes on a trip, I don't know what I've done wrong and don't know why she does this.

"I am 31, will be 32 in March. I have had girlfriends in the past and am currently in a relationship that’s been going on for about 9 months.

My problem is I always rush into relationships because I tend to stay single for long stretches between relationships. Then once I get into the new one I see other women I would like to be with but I don’t because I would never cheat on anyone cuz I think that’s so cowardly.

My last relationship before this one was particularly toxic so I had stayed single for about 5 years before this with the only companionship being tinder hookups or platonic friends.

In this particular instance I have an amazing girlfriend (28F) who shares my interests, cooks, cleans, has a good job and is pretty.

She’s not my usual type physically but I really fell for her personality, she’s a very compassionate person who always puts others first and never complains.

Then there’s this girl at work, we work together all day everyday and I have developed feelings for this girl (21F) and she is exactly my type, physically, personality, some shared interest but not all. I’ve known her for a couple months longer than my GF and I want her, despite her showing signs that she’s immature and a little toxic because she’s so young and honestly hasn’t been hit by the world in the way you do as you get towards your 30s. She also has some feelings for me but I know she is in her going out and having fun and drinking and partying stage of her life and I’m not really in that stage anymore.

I know you might be thinking “hey asshole, appreciate what you have” because I’ve thought that to myself.

I know this is probably a “grass is greener on the other side” situation but the thing that makes me worried is that this isn’t the first time I’ve done this. 
I get what I want then once I have it I don’t want it anymore and find something else to want.
To be fair I was talking to both these women when I was still single, my current gf just seemed more into me at the time so I went with her.

Do any of yall have this experience ever? If so what did you do? Any advice or even constructive criticism is welcome and appreciated. I know I need therapy lol

TLDR: I have an amazing girlfriend but can’t help wanting another woman still. But do I really want her or do I just think I want her because I can’t have her?

Edit: 

I feel like I need to make an edit to this because people keep misunderstanding.

First of all, In the part where I complimented my gf I said my girlfriend shares my interests and is compassionate, I figured that would imply our emotional connection in less words than “she’s great to talk to about everything” but I should’ve elaborated that’s my bad.

Secondly, the “went with her” is just the way I talk. I could’ve said “decided to pursue her romantically” doesn’t sound organic to me but I apologize if the wording seemed rude that’s not how I meant it.

Third, I am not actively flirting with the other woman or considering being unfaithful to my girlfriend. Me and the work woman are just co workers and friends. The discussion of us having feelings for each other was had before I officially got together with my girlfriend and we haven’t talked romantically since then. The “wanting to be with her” is a thought I keep having, whether she likes me or not still is anyone’s guess.

Last, I NEVER said that I don’t find my girlfriend attractive, I only said she is not my usual type.

This post was more to ask advice about how to get over this “grass is greener” thing so I can be appreciative of my current relationship but perhaps this wasn’t the right place to post it.

"so i'm currently debating whether i (f, monogamous, bi) should date my crush (m, polyamorous, queer, trans ftm) who's in an online long distance relationship with two other people who are dating, but he's never met them irl. i really REALLY need advice, so please read &lt;33

backstory: 

so me and my crush  have had feelings for each other since may. we're in the same class and we're sitting together. we hung out everywhere all summer, and i've spent some of the best memories with him this year. we've always been so touchy, cuddly, we always held hands and teased each other a lot etc. etc. - we never confessed until a week ago, tho. at the end of july he told me he was polyamorous - i accepted that, saying i wasn't but i respect and i'm glad for people who are, and he also mentioned he would like an open relationship if the chance occurs. 
a week ago, we confessed our feelings and then i kissed him. after the kiss i hugged him and said i loved him, but he said he wasn't ready to say it back? he seemed kinda regretful and weird, which i was confused about? but the rest of the evening was fine, we talked about our moments with each other etc.

THEN, when i came home he texted me saying i maybe wouldn't want to date him after him saying this. so he said the whole time he's been in an online long distance relationship with his friend O (who i knew about, he talked about him often, i just thought they were friends) and O's boyfriend E, who both date each other irl. and apparently with E it's a bit more casual cause they don't talk much?? he has been dating them for 1.5 year, wayy before him and i met. he said that he was sorry and he knew he should've told me earlier and that was what he was regretful about after the kiss..

i was literally devastated, like, it just hurts knowing i've been LIED to the whole time. he said he didn't know how to tell me, and that he was scared i'd think of him differently in a bad way. he wants to date me, and idk what to do in this situation. it's very complicated, we've been discussing it a lot. i kinda feel like anyone with an ounce of self respect wouldn't want to agree to that situation, but idk, i can'ttt. i would date him, but i feel guilty cause he's already dating people, and even though he said they're absolutely okay with us being together and O offered to talk to me abt it, i still feel like an intruder. and the only thing that's ""calming me down"" is that they're in an online relationship, but if they were dating irl i would Not be able to handle it. i really need advice on this, i hope you can understand and give me advice. for more questions or advice you can send me a message.

"Context: My mom has always had narcissistic and emotionally abusive qualities. But for the past couple years, she has also been dealing with health issues and my father and I are doing our best to help her manage day to day activities. She has enough agency to walk around and clean the house, but she struggles with becoming lightheaded at times along with her elevated blood pressure. We are all currently living together. I moved in last year to help her when my dad works during the day as well as to save money. We both know that she has unresolved mental issues as well (high anxiety, possibly bipolar) and know that she will never willingly receive treatment for anything mental health related due to her narcissism...

Which brings me to the incident.

Walls are thin and though my dad is quiet about his sexual frustrations, my mom is a very loud and vocal woman. She will say things like, ""I'm too old for sex!"" or ""I'm too sick for sex""  loud enough for me to hear. She has always thought it was funny when I would get grossed out by this talk. She often brings up sex issues randomly with my father to me, because she has no friends, and thinks because I'm an adult that it's ok to talk about these things with me. I instantly leave the room and never entertain this talk, and but she laughs at my disgust. My dad and I both hate that she is so loud about sex talk with my dad, given that I live in the house. She does not care. Again, our disgust amuses her.

Recently, something that she said stunned my dad and me and we are having trouble forgiving her. She did apologize two days later, but does not think she said anything extreme.

My father and mother were in the kitchen, and I was in my bedroom with the door shut. I did not hear anything from the conversation on my dad's side (he is considerately quiet), but I heardly my mom loudly scream:

""Why don't you ask your daughter for a blowjob instead of me?""

I got sickened. My dad screamed ""What is wrong with you?"" and instantly left the house.

It took me a bit to actually process that she said that. I collected myself, and a few minutes later asked my mom if she could never say anything disgusting involving my dad and I again. She screamed at me: ""It's just words! blowjob, blowjob, blowjob who cares!""

I no longer want to help take care of her, and want to move out as soon as possible. I don't know, I am used to her saying terrible, awful things, but I am deeply hurt by this commen in particular, like the fact that she would even utter something so gross and disturbing and not truly apologize or see anything wrong with it.

My dad is old as well, and I feel so guilty about leaving him to deal with her emotional abuse. He is too selfless to leave her, but it gets worse every day and he is severely depressed. I don't know how to get through to my mother. I wish there was a way to mute her screaming and vile commentary. To go to therapy. To change. I feel so much guilt.

TLDR: My mom is emotionally abuse to her caretakers (my father and I). She said something sexually gross and graphic, and my dad and I think she has gone way too far this time. Am I overreacting about wanting to leave because this comment was the final straw? My father and I have been handling her abuse for forever now but this comment was vile.

"So, my girlfriend, who I've known since highschool, but been dating for 4 months, has a birthday coming up in February, I'm planning it out early, and have a few ideas already but before I get into that, I gotta give y'all a little backstory 

I live in Michigan and my girlfriend stays in Ohio with a friend, and she's a single parent of two children. My girlfriend rarely gets to have any fun of her own, since she stays in the house all day, and by her birthday falling on the 13th and Valentine's Day being a day after, I wanted to take my best shot at creating two of the best days of her life.

I already know that I wanna buy her some gifts, take her shopping, get matching tattoos, spend one or two nights in a hotel or resort, and take her on a date for her birthday, and take her on another date for Valentine's Day, but the problem is that I can't think of anything, my main go to's for dates are Amusement Parks and Arcades and those never failed me, but the problem is that my girlfriend suffered a severe concussion 3 years ago before we started dating, and it still affects her to this day, from time to time she gets migraines, and becomes sensitive to light, so Amusement Park rides, especially rollercoasters aren't ideal, nor arcades, which are usually bright and colorful, I feel like for Valentine's Day, a dinner date would be a great idea, but for her birthday, I think it'd be more fun to do something active.

"Background: I have been with my girlfriend, who became my wife in an almost 7-year-long relationship. She came from a wealthier background, and I came from a broken middle/lower class family. We hastily married during COVID when I was living in her house so that I could continue my relationship with her (She was a new grad international student back then). I never had a formal wedding (proposal + celebrations etc,) with my wife so I still innately felt like we weren't really married, however, to her, it's different. As time went on, our small differences started to become topics of argument and we have been increasingly arguing since COVID began, and that's when I started to become loathsome to our relationship. Our dynamic somewhat changed two years ago when I went back to school and got accepted to a top 5 Uni. At the peak of our arguments, I talked her into living separately from me while I focused on the heavy workload in school. Life became simpler as all I needed to do was grind. Along the way, I found new friendships and also planted seeds for new... potential relationships. my original plan with my wife was simple: graduate, find a job in the area, and buy a house with the help (think of like shaving 20-25 years off of a 30-year mortgage) of her parents. However, I think after I had tasted (again) the freedom of living like a bachelor (the only difference is that I am now financially capable of living unlike broke college students) and making new passionate relationships, I felt happy.

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing I loathe the most about my wife is that she loves to ""lay flat"". She has no ambition for any career initiations even though her parents probably invested 300k+ for her to get an education from a pretty good, top 30-50 Uni degree program nor the motivation to even exercise (to become more fit and beautiful). I know that should be none of my concern, and to love her as she is, but on the career front, I could already see that as I become more successful (I have always been ambitious and self-motivated about doing better in the best way that I could) in my career path, I would drift further away from her in terms of mentality, topics of discourses, and interests. So I will in the end have a stay-at-home mom who I would barely talk to every day coming back home from work. On the fitness front, She's not fat fat, but she has very good potential if she even becomes half as fit as she would be if she worked towards it (I even made it a main focus to get her on exercise plans 1-2 years into the start of our relationship, but nothing comes avail as she's always going ""too easy"" on herself and as we start to argue more, it becomes even more hopeless). I admit that I too am out of shape due to the grinds, but as I'm coming back into the workforce again, I am determined to get back in shape (I have experienced losing weight before) as now that I will actually have a work-life balance. So for all these complaints of mine, I feel I'd be very easily attracted to someone new, who's already fit, younger, better looking, and most importantly, also works hard due to not coming from a well-off background. And yeah, I have prospects like that now. So now, the appeal of her parents frontloading the success of our family-building becomes less and less as I have just graduated from a very good Uni, and am on track to start working at my darn good six-fig offered company. So maybe I saved 7 years off of mortgaging grinding if I just stay put with my wife? But the feeling is that since the 2 years apart (with some weeks of meets in between or during semester breaks) I have grown to love her less-er than her love for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my dilemma, whether to stick it through like older generation Asian parents who just put up with their significant others, or go with some other girl (already have been talking to) who's taller, sexier, way younger, skinnier, equally mature, and hardworking?

"He emotionally cheated on me after 4 years together. Do I give him the benefit of the doubt? M 22 F 22

I had dated my ex for almost 4 years, M22 F22 , we met at university and were together up until about 3 weeks ago when I decided to break up with him.

Rewind 3 weeks ago I found out he had been messaging a girl he knew from university, on Snapchat, iMessage TikTok, IG etc.. it started off last year exchanging TikTok’s with no intent or flirting, but in the last month or so when we had been going through a rough patch and on a break, their chat seemed to get really flirty and exchanged vulgar messages.
I called the girl and she was happy to send screenshots of the conversations where he had said questionable things and sent me about 20 screenshots in total. She answered any questions I had and just explained she felt out of respect for me to tell me what had been going on as she “respected me” - mind you she only decided to have this conversation weeks after it got extremely flirty and sexual.
I discovered they had been exchanging flirty texts, compliments, reminiscing the times they saw each other at uni, and the chat then got rather sexual/vulgar. Comments from him like “stay fertile for me!”  Opening up to her about some trauma then responding “perfect, now can I put the tip in?” 
I was honestly shocked and disgusted to read these screenshots while on the phone to the GIRL HERSELF.. we wrapped up the call after 2 hours and several screenshots later. I drove to his house the day after to confront him with all the receipts and he eventually crumbled. Apologised and explained it was where we had a rough patch recently and he didn’t know where his head was at so while we were on a break, decided to speak to her as his female friend, but the chat then just got out of hand and she then ended it and removed/ blocked him.

Fast forward 3 weeks later and I just don’t know what to do. I love him so much and miss him terribly after breaking up with him, I feel like sometimes things are worth fighting for and forgiving but I just don’t know if I’m a mug for doing so.
He explained he was in a bad place and just enjoyed her massaging his ego (LOL) . And begged and pleaded for me to give him another chance. They both confirmed nothing physical happened, it was just an exchange of messages. He promised he had no intention of meeting up with her also, however I’m struggling to believe this as when she ended the chat with him and said she felt bad for me, he said, “ I think we should still grab a drink over Xmas just so we can still be friends at least” and also “I’ll just message you in like 6 months time” after trying to reassure her she wouldn’t be a rebound. 

Things have been on and off for months but we had the best few weeks before I found out this news. Can’t help but feel was that because he felt guilty or shame, or we just actually started to get along better etc. timing just sucks as things started to get back on track and we were in a good place; I then found out this news and broke up with him.

It’s been 3 weeks pretty much no contact and I’m still unsure if I’ve made the right decision. My heart aches and I’m trying to move forwards but it’s so hard :(

"He (41M) left his phone on the bed while taking a shower (he rarely does, but he was exhausted after work), and I noticed that a girl (23F) from work was messaging him about non-work related matters. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it, but I’ve met this girl when I accompanied him to a work event - she’s young and bubbly, I liked her very much. But was slightly confused what they’d have in common due to the age difference and the fact that they don’t work in the same department. 

The messages were things like her saying “If you say please then maybe I’ll consider it” and he replied with “Please”. It was over something about dinner recommendations, nothing scandalous, but it felt flirtatious to me. He also complimented her saying she was very intuitive, and he teases her often as well. He’ll say things like “Might have to block you now” or “I’ll stay away from there” in reference to where she lives. Is this just normal banter or flirting? 

They don’t message each other often, but I know they talk at work, and they tease each other a lot, like playful bickering. Considering the age difference and the fact that they don’t even work together, him being fond of her strikes me as strange. 

She’s a beautiful girl as well, even he admits it when I asked him, but he didn’t say anything more than that she was just a colleague.

"I used to be engaged to a guy that I had been with for 5 an a half years. The last 2 years I was living with him and his family. I was already uneasy about his family because they seemed to react negatively about me behind my back and made a bunch of assumptions. They never really once tried to get to know me and refused to believe anything good about me. They are all truly terrible. Racist, sexist, agesist, manipulative, liars...etc. They didn't like how big my eyes are even though they are a normal size, they accused me of cheating on their son with me cousin, and they accused me of giving him an STD because he had mentioned a bump around his crotch but the doctor just said it was a little cyst. Those are just some examples. They wouldn't be happy if my family put their son through what they put me through but my ex said to just deal with it because that's just how they are. But it made for such an uncomfortable environment. I cried every single day for the first year that I was living with them. All I had was my fiancé at the time since I left my city to be with him but he seemed to only be interested in me if I gave him sex. If there wasn't any sex, he'd ignore me for his games. He said sex is the only way he knows he's loved. But having been a victim of child molestation and sexual assault as an adult too, I felt extremely disgusted and hurt. But I did sometimes use sex as a way to get him to ""spend time"" with me. He always went back to the video games right afterwards though. I eventually found out he had been cheating. He was on several hookup sites, and he would disappear in the middle of the night while I was sleeping and not come back until around 5am-6am. Fast forward to this day and I am in a happy relationship and so is he but I have difficulty not thinking about the bad times while being with him. I don't love him anymore. In fact, I actually feel like I hate him. Hate is not a word I use to describe anybody but I am now. I feel like I hate him and his family. I know they hated me first since his father actually said it. I want to just forget about them because I find my self still suffering because of them. I'm still very depressed.

"Hi, I’ve recently posted on the AITA subreddit asking about my situation, that kind of went like this; my friend is currently studying abroad in another country, she’s has a lot of dietary restrictions, so she’s been struggling with eating in that specific country. She’s been venting nearly everyday about how little she eats, and I’ve been kinda asking if she’s been eating, because I know she struggles with disordered thoughts. She’s been telling me that she hardly eats lately and probably eats snacks for the most part, and the types of snacks she can eat are usually limited because of her dietary restrictions, and she needs to go to specific store to pick up these snacks. So around her birthday, I put together a detailed list of grocery stores that carry food that adhere to her dietary restrictions, are able to deliver to her dorm, simple quick recipes, etc. Despite the list, she still told me about how she was hardly eating and there wasn’t much else I could do. I worry about her and I know my concern is overstepping and naggy, but I genuinely do not know what else to do? I thought her telling me about how she hardly ate was an invitation to help out where I could, but I guess that was not the case. 

In my post, I said I was starting to feel exhausted hearing about her eating habits and disordered eating, as it’s starting to trigger me, and the consensus came that I was the AH, and I was told to stop bothering my friend with my helicopter behavior and unsolicited advice. It was a wake up call, because I’m definitely projecting onto my friend, and I’m making up scenarios without ever clearly communicating my thoughts and feelings, or creating firm boundaries for myself. But I’m not sure what I would say to her? How would I word this? She’s coming back soon and I really don’t want to mess up our dynamic. I feel like we’ve been open with each other abt a lot of things and I’m scared this will affect other parts of friendship.

My boyfriend (30m) and I (29f) have been together since 2019 it wad a whirlwind romance to say the least I've known him high school and always had a major crush on him in high school. We got together and everything was great he had a kid from a previous relationship and so did I. About 8mo after starting our relationship we moved in together everything was good then he lost his job and then covid hit and everything went to he'll. He did get a new job right around the time covid officially became a thing like I think maybe 2 or 3 weeks before the shut down and he was essential worker with the job he was in. I was however laid off because I was not in that shut down we found I was pregnant with our son. So I stayed off of work and collected unemployment because I have a high chance of miscarrying very easily and my job was very hard on my body I didn't want to risk a miscarriage and my work let me stay off of work. Well during that time I didn't know it but my boyfriend started to gamble I paid most of the bills with my unemployment and didn't pay attention to what he was spending his money on I see now that was obviously a mistake. Well around August of 2020 I developed a blood clot in my leg due to the pregnancy so I had to technically quit my job so I could no longer collect unemployment and my boyfriend wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I should've seen the red flags there I should've realized he just wanted to make it so I couldn't leave him. Over this time he because very abusive he punched me in the face and locked my tooth out. He would choke me until I almost passed out I found out later he was also smoking meth which is probably why he was so violent all the time because when he didn't have money to get anymore he would go through withdrawals. Well Dec came and I had our son. Things were alright there but he was still gambling and I didn't know because he was still paying the bills for the most part. He was still pretty violent but I learned to avoid what triggers him for the most part. Fast forward to 2021-2022 he started stealing from stores and I'm not talking like food I'm talking like HUGE lego sets so he could sell them for money so he could gamble more because his gambling got so out of control he was no longer able to work and gamble while still paying the bills. Then he lost his job then he found a job and 3 months later got fired then found job got fired from there after 3 months then found another job and you guessed it got fired. He went through at least 6 jobs in less than a year. He was also caught stealing many times he now had a felony record. In sep of 2022 I found my mom dead on her floor then a week later it came out my daughters father was molesting his 2nd cousin then a week later my cat died. Now I know the cat dying seems insignificant compared to everything else but it was just added to the pile of shit that my life was. My boyfriend was gambling constantly I couldn't pay bills we almost got evicted many times our power had been shut off our phones had been shut off we couldn't pay for groceries now I'm sure you're asking why I didn't leave well its not that simple unfortunately I had and still have no income I'm a stay at home mom I have no family who will help me the only person who would help me died. I did get some money after my mom passed away but my boyfriend gambled it away. Every last penny he gambled it away. I was left with nothing and I fell further into a depression and I'm still in a depression. Now his stealing did catch up to him and he was sentenced to 60 days in jail in May of this year and wad released early he spent 45 days in jail I believe. He got a good paying job and he actually stopped gambling he was doing really good for a while then he started to gamble again and he's still doing it. I haven't been able to pay any bills and he just doesn't care he blames me saying that my anger is why he gambles but he never stops to ask me why I'm angry. He doesn't care that I'm drowning because I always have to help him and hold him for his actions and his feelings but I'm never allowed to have feelings I'm drowning and I don't know what I can do to make things better. I can't just leave its hard to leave when you have no income and 2 kids. None of my family will help me and his family just enables him which makes it worse.

"My in-laws are very culturally different from me and my family. We’re all from the US, but my mom’s family is from Spain (my mom came here as a child) and I think that may have impacted things. I also think my MIL is just extremely strange and has raised her family that way. We’re having a big issue about Christmas Day right now and I feel like I’m losing my mind.

Firstly…the food. To put it bluntly, they are terrible cooks. On the rare occasion they actually cook, the food is almost inedible. I have suffered my way through eating it, smiling and thanking them, because that’s what my mom taught me to do. Most of the time, when we visit one of their homes, there is no food at all. They won’t even have drinks or offer us water. We usually have to bring food, or order out (and pay for it!) and they see absolutely nothing wrong with that. I’ve stopped visiting their house as much as possible. Again, on the rare chance they do cook or order, they make it into a huge deal about how hard it was.

Once, we visited MIL’s house overnight. The first night she cooked, a veggie loaf thing (yikes) that we ate and said thank you for. The next morning, we had to go shopping because she had nothing in her fridge (despite begging us to come for months) and spend quite a bit of money. She told us to get whatever we would like for dinner, saying she thought it would be nice if we cooked for them. I simply can’t imagine inviting guests to my home then treating them like that.

Another time, we went to his brother’s award ceremony, and then BIL and SIL invited us all back to their house after. They asked us to stop at a grocery store and pick up a few things since they had to go straight back for their dogs. They ended up texting a list of about $150 of items, everything needed for a full dinner, and we ended up paying for it and they never offered to pay us back. Again, I can’t imagine doing that in my home - I would always feed my guests, I see that as the bare minimum.

When we host, I always cook, we set out appetizers, my husband stocks the house with lots of drinks, etc. Last Christmas, we invited my MIL, SIL and BIL, and their two kids over on Christmas Eve (we all do Christmas Day separately). I planned to make a sauce with meatballs (it is from my culture but is super good and is generally food most people like - a red sauce with cheese and optional meat). MIL texted me to ask what I was making. When I told her, she informed me that SIL had recently gone vegan. She said if the meatballs are cooked in the sauce she won’t be able to eat it. She also said the kids won’t like that - they started (I guess) only eating mac and cheese, chicken fingers, or hot dogs and she asked me to make one of those. She also asked me to make a separate sauce and pasta that’s vegan, and another that’s low-spice for her (she doesn’t like any pepper or salt). I had to make a ton of different dishes. I found this SO rude. And they’re not even really grateful - they don’t appreciate home cooked food. I’m not trying to be braggy, but my food is pretty good - I spend a ton of time cooking and working to improve (it obviously wasn’t good when I started out haha). But if we don’t host them, we have to go to their home and awkwardly sit around for a bit, without any sort of Christmas meal, and often get asked to help clean the house or cook. I don’t want to do either of those.

They ALSO invited three guests from the other side of their family - MIL’s boyfriend’s mom, aunt, and the boyfriend himself. I would have been fine with the bf (despite them only dating a few months) but then she was like, oh can his mom and aunt come too? They wont want to be alone. I should have said no. I felt guilty and said yes, but I have plenty of family members I could have invited instead. She said “it’s only two more people.” This isn’t the first time they’ve tried to throw people I don’t know into my home. It just feels very ungrateful for all the work I do. These are all unspoken rules in my family - we just don’t do that, so we never have to say no. No one would ever ask that kind of a question. If I did say no, they would hold it against me and talk about how uptight I am.

To them this is all just normal - it’s how they all treat each other. They don’t see it as rude. It isn’t really behavior that my husband can “have a talk with them” about because it’s just literally who they are. But I don’t know how to stop being horrified by it. It’s such a culture clash from what I was raised with that it’s making me not want to be around them at all, and then I feel terribly guilty because I know my husband loves his family and wants to see them, even though he agrees with me on a lot of these things. Everyone keeps telling me to just stop cooking and doing these nice things, but that’s literally my culture - that also feels wrong to me. But then they’re so not appreciative that I feel shitty either way. Any advice is very appreciated - I would just like to stop feeling so angry all the time around them.

"Almost six years into our relationship, my partner and I are hitting a rough patch. Living together for five years with our two-and-a-half-year-old child, we're feeling the strain of daily life and parenting. The joy we used to find in each other's company is now overshadowed by a sense of routine and the overwhelming responsibilities of raising our son.  
  
The past three months have been particularly tense. My partner feels overwhelmed by the monotony and the burden of motherhood, believing that my contributions are insufficient. Despite my efforts at home, she often feels the need to remind me of my responsibilities. As a response, we've considered couple's therapy, seeking a space where we can both express and hear each other's feelings.  
  
Throughout this time, I have tried to support my partner by suggesting she seek professional mental health support and return to her sporting passions. However, she faces hurdles like lack of motivation and fatigue, often spending most of her time in bed, not seeking the necessary help.  
  
To find my own respite from the routine, I left behind long hours on the computer to immerse myself in mountaineering. This sport has not only given me a much-needed break but also led me to form a close friendship with a work colleague. I have been completely transparent about this friendship, even inviting my partner to join our mountaineering trips. Though she has joined me a couple of times, her knee injuries from years of high-level sports have limited her involvement. There was even an occasion when the three of us - my partner, my friend, and I - climbed together, but my partner's physical limitations have made it difficult for her to engage more in this activity.  
  
This new dynamic has brought unexpected emotions to the surface. The discomfort it has caused in my relationship has led me to genuinely question my feelings and whether I should continue in this relationship. I feel torn between my love and commitment to my partner and the need for personal fulfillment and happiness.  
  
During the first signs of a potential breakup, when this tension started, what kept me willing to continue was the thought of being with my son, waking up with him, and growing as a family. This connection and desire to be present in his life remain strong factors in my decision-making process.  
  
The last time I went to the mountains, I assumed that going with my colleague and another person would ease my partner's discomfort. However, this was not the case. She was upset for several days, barely speaking to me. When we finally talked, she expressed her hurt feelings, which I understood and apologized for. But the damage was done. Since then, for the past two weeks, there's been no sign of affection or love from her, just a lingering fondness based on our shared history and cohabitation, but the romantic aspect seems to have faded, which saddens me.  
  
Now, I'm pondering my next steps. Should I wait and continue with therapy, openly share my doubts about our relationship with my partner, or give it more time? These past months have felt like a long journey, yet at the same time, it seems too brief to make a definitive decision.

"Hey there Reddit,  
Using a throwaway account here because my gf occasionally checks this sub.  
I've been in a solid 4y relationship with my gf (25F) and everything has generally been very good. Around 3 years ago, I became friends with a classmate (24F), we share almost all our classes together and we sit often next to eachother, we also play the same games. Our friendship has remained very platonic, I never experienced any hints from her, but since she has problems at home we have had dinner together and she's been coming over more regularly. Lately though, my gf's behavior has been very bit strange. She's dropping many passive-aggressive comments and kinda indicating that she's uneasy with my classmate being at my place this often. I'm not entirely sure if it's just insecurity due to our long-distance relationship or if she's insecure about me and my friend.  
I want to be honest to both my gf and the classmate, since I personally think honestly is the best policy. Any advice on how to handle this situation without causing unnecessary drama? I dislike drama alot, would be highly appreciated.

"I am 26 years old, and my boyfriend is 36 years old. This is my first relationship and his fourth. We have been together for almost a year and a half. We are from different countries and different religions. It doesn't bother us. He doesn't know English well (we met at a university in the US), and I don't know Spanish.  
  
Here are some things about our relationship to better understand the situation.  
  
1. Communication in the beginning was mainly based on google translate. I think because this was my first relationship, I was too eager. I did not stop to consider a lot of things.  
  
2. At the beginning of the relationship, I had a very tough time because I thought he would be more attentive for some reason (he had experience being in a relationship before). It wasn't like that, and we had to have a lot of difficult conversations right from the very first month (all initiated by me).  
  
3. He always listens, and I think we both grew to learn our differences and respect each other.  
  
4. But he never makes any plans by himself. For every date, I had to initiate an idea. I think he only planned one entire day by himself for us in over a year.  
  
5. He cooks and cleans, and he is a very organized person. Everybody respects him a lot. But I think sometimes his helping nature makes him suffer (and sometimes our relationship).

6. He buys me flowers and writes me little notes (after telling him that I would appreciate such gestures). But I have never been able to have a very deep verbal conversation with him about my likes because he has trouble understanding English. I always write it down though.  
  
**The problem:**  
  
Even though I am a student (who gets paid), I am more financially stable than him. I save my money a lot. I thought he would've had savings because he was ten years my senior. But he doesn't. He worked for seven years and then got his master's this year. He told me he used up his savings during the Covid period as he didn't have a job then. I understand this. I do. But he said he would pass his English exam and start his Ph.D. (because that is his dream). I am currently doing my Ph.D. He was supposed to start last year but hasn't been able to clear his exam because he struggles with English. I have paid for his Exams and other stuff because I know he doesn't get that much money and has to send money to his mother and sister as well.   
  
**My question:**  
  
**Am I being too superficial? Should I not care about the financial aspect of our relationship? I know that after graduation, I will be the one to take care of us financially (if he will be doing his PhD). And I was totally fine with that. I can take care of us. But he knows that I wanted to start a family soon. He says that he doesn't have money to think about a family. I don't know if I should give up a caring, loving, and respectful man for these other things that are bothering me. Am I being too heartless or cynical to think about money and not love?**   
**I talked to him about this, and he always says that ""I am not a good boyfriend for you"", ""you deserve better"", ""I love you and I don't want you to leave me,"" and things like this. What am I supposed to do?**

I’ve voiced to my boyfriend that I’d like if he could spend Christmas with my family but he says missing Christmas is a non negotiable for his family (and it’s also a non negotiable for my family.) the frustration comes in because due to his culture and religion, they technically honor Christmas on January 6th. But since moving to the US, they’ll celebrate on the 25th and the 6th.

I feel like it’s not fair that I celebrate literally every holiday with his family (including NYE, 4th of July, Memorial Day, etc.) and he won’t celebrate this one with mine even though his family celebrates it twice.

"Hey Reddit, I think my new coworkers are hazing me. I just started this job roughly 2 weeks ago.

My boyfriend recently got a job with (bank) and I got a very lucky opportunity to work at a different branch under the same company. (YAY!) My boyfriend has been learning alot of gossip about my branch and its' employees from the ladies at his branch. These ladies previously worked at this one and either transferred out or were moved for unknown reasons.

These stories and opinions of the employees here match up exactly with what I've seen and heard here so far. I met them at a (bank) paid Christmas dinner for my boyfriend's branch, which I was invited to tag along to. I learned each branch has these around the same time, and I asked my manager about our branch's...

- All 10 employees plus management conveniently forgot to inform me of the prepaid dinner event every employee was invited to.
- The employees, on multiple occasions, have conveniently forgotten to answer the locked door while it's 30°F outside until a different employee is also waiting outside with me, then which the door is opened immediately. 
- Nobody answers my good morning but are very friendly with eachother. 
- I've been spoken over by 2 specific employees whenever I greet customers, making small talk with them, or even say ""Somebody will be with you in just a moment!""
- Leave me out of morning meetings/don't announce that they're happening to me specifically (the meetings aren't scheduled or at the same time every morning) 
- They talk trash about a ""newer"" employee who's been there a little under a year, saying things like ""We need to stop coddling her!"" or ""She needs to deal with her speed!"" 

My biggest grievance right now though, this company has very restrictive policies surrounding abcenses so I informed them of an out-of-state trip, in which I was assured the needed days would be accomodated for. My days off (personal holiday) were already approved, plane tickets already purchased, when I was then informed my live training classes overlap this trip because of a miscommunication. I was told the days off will just be counted as occurrences, even if an accommodation could be made with my live trainer. 

Sure. I'll take it, I already bought the plane tickets with no refunds. My manager then said ""This isn't a good look on you, you've already had to leave early (context: threw up) and now you're leaving for a trip.""

I don't want this trend of perceived unreliability to continue by this manager. I don't want to have to find another job, but I can't comfortably be unemployed. But I HATE this position, everyone who works here, and the energy this branch has. I have no clue about transferring locations but is it too soon to request? Do I start the job search again? Do I try to speak to the branch manager or something?

I find myself in a bit of a dilemma and would love to hear your thoughts. I'm a 24-year-old guy, and my girlfriend is 30. While we get along great and have a strong connection, the age gap sometimes makes me wonder if it's too much.

"**am I right in getting fed up of my bfs behaviour or am I overreacting 

We have been together for about a year and a half and in that time he has had an issue with drinking that doesn’t seem to have resolved. He had this issue when we first got together and I said I would support him to get better, he has tried and I do believe he has gotten a bit better with his drinking. However, apart from numerous occasions he has spoiled with his drinking, the main two are:

My graduation dinner (where he met my parents for the second time)

My birthday evening

Both 6 months apart. There has been other examples of when I’ve had to babysit him or he has just been so bladdered that it’s not been enjoyable to be around him. His drinking is is main priority and it’s making me resent him. 

I love him so much and sometimes I feel as though he doesn’t hold me in quite the same affection and his love for drinking outweighs our relationship. I don’t want to break up with him or lose him but at the same time I can just see this issue not being resolved and it being the reason we break up in the future.

Aside from that he has some insecurities which I feel make him jealous, some immaturity and is selfish at times. But I do love him and love spending time with him as we have so much fun together.

"In our relationship we had a lot of issues, in the beginning it was that he was too immature (made jokes about the worst things, kind of an ass) and just generally didn't understand other people's emotions or his own. Over those 2 years he grew so much, but then a couple months ago I found out how bad his porn addiction really was and it put a big set back on our relationship and my feelings for him after we had been doing well for so long, to the point where I could feel myself becoming numb to him and falling out of love because I was just so hurt. 

So he came to visit for Christmas yesterday and I went to pick him up and the whole time my body was telling me to break up with him, it didnt feel right to stay with him when i was aching to leave. I ended up doing it at the end of our hangout after I found out he was lying to me about having a drink at the airport (recovering from alcoholic tendencies) but it was the most loving breakup I've ever had and he was so strong for me and understood why I was doing what I needed to do and it reminded me of all the good times and all of his amazing qualities and I left feeling the biggest hole in my heart. 

I woke up today and just immediately started crying once I remembered, I can't tell if I just made the biggest mistake of my life.

"I (29M) can’t tell if I should be worried if my GF (25F) is cheating on me or not. 
My GF and I have been together for just over 2 years, lived together for 1 year. I should also note that this year has been great and I just a couple months ago had asked for her father’s blessing to ask her to marry me. Now that being said I will start from the beginning. 
When my we decide to move in together my GF had to quit her job and find a new one because I lived about 2 hours away from where she was living at the time. It took her a little over a month to find a job in my town which I was fine with I am payed fairly well and have no problem affording all our monthly bills. She started her job and hated it at first there were a few ladies there that she said were just awful to her and made her life miserable at work. I kept telling her she didn’t need to stay there and if she wanted to she could quit and just look for a better job, she said no and that she would look for another job but she wasn’t going to quit till she found one first. Well this continued for several months she would come home very upset and wanting to quit, I would tell her how sorry I was and that she didn’t need to put herself through that. Then one day she asked me if it was okay that texted with a guy coworker of hers because he was good on computers and could help with something we were trying to do (I’m not going to say what cause it’s irrelevant and my GF is active in Reddit and it would give this all away.) I told her yes I wouldn’t mind at all it’s not my place to say who she can and can’t talk to. She said that she wanted to be sure I was okay with it because if the rolls were reversed she would in no way be okay with it. At the time I kind of laughed because I knew it was true but I really wasn’t thinking anything of it and reassured her that it was fine and that I trust her. 

Well now months later I have inadvertently caught her texting him fairly regularly, like her phone connected to CarPlay her showing me something on her phone and his name pops up, she doesn’t try to hide it necessarily but it does come off as though she doesn’t want me to bring it up or talk about it cause anytime I do she is almost jumpy about it and kinda acts as though his texting her is an annoyance. Last night we were sitting on the couch and I turned to say something and saw she was texting him I couldn’t not see what about but the texts were lengthy I didn’t say anything and pretty much right after that she started acting real tired wanting to go to bed and like she was in a bad mood (it was around 10 o’clock).  

It should also be noted he has a girlfriend as well and I have met both of them. But when I did meet him for the first time he did pretty much run in the other direction, this was at her work and he made it seem like it was cause he was busy and had to go do something but before I walked in he was standing there with his hand in his pockets talking to my GF.

He’s kind, caring, thoughtful, very affectionate, smart… just a great person all around and I’m really attracted to him.  
  
However, since our first date he has been very pushy when we’re in private and I’ve often felt very coerced into doing sexual acts with him as he wouldn’t accept it when I said no. He would very much beg me until I gave in and it would make me uncomfortable.  
  
We have only been on two dates so far and I ended up staying at his place, an error on my part as I drank a little more than I anticipated and couldn’t drive home, and he begged and begged me to get into the shower with him or have sex and became quiet when I refused and then even tried multiple times to engage in sex when I continued to say no. He even woke me up in my sleep by performing a sexual act on me which I hadn’t consented to.

"43 year old female here. Been married 22 years. Married at 21, never lived alone, moved from my parents house to his house. I totally accept there are always two sides to every story but will strive to be completely transparent. I was a very sheltered, naive child, teen and young adult so when I married I was easily controlled and manipulated. My marriage has always been pretty much about what my husband wanted or where his interests lay at the time. I didn't work, I stayed home playing the good quiet wife, because that's what he expected. I never voiced my opinion or feelings about anything. I have always kept house, did the cooking and all the things. We know have 1 teen and 1 preteen. A few years ago we went through some pretty shitty stuff. I know I suffered some mental and emotional abuse through this time. I finally got the guts up to leave and he did not leave me alone for a solid two weeks, promised the sun and stars and I ended up going back home. I set boundaries which he promised to keep. Meanwhile, couple years later, I have a full time job now and am just tired. I'm emotionally tired, I'm physically tired and torn about my life. I do all the house work, the laundry,  the cooking, the food shopping, the actual paying of the bills. I get up everyday before work, pack his and the kids lunches,  make his coffee. Most ppl say if their spouse doesn't clean he is happy to live in a pigsty. My husband get angry when the house isn't clean. I do have diagnosed depression and anxiety. I feel like a mess most if the time, just like I'm hanging on trying to make it through the day without the house burning down, lol. A bit of a hot mess mama I guess you could say. He says he makes 80% of the income so why should he have to clean...what would I do? He also likes to tell me the ""I do just enough to get by in life"". I'm super confused,  I know I am a good mom and a good wife. I feel like this just touches the surface, there is so much more that this affects as you can imagine but can't make a post that long.

"Last night I went to put my fiancés phone on the charger and discovered that he has a 94 day streak with a girl he’s never mentioned. We’ve been together for 2.5 years, and when I asked him about it he said he’d met her briefly a few months back through a coworker and that she’d asked for his Snapchat info and there was nothing inappropriate happening. 

I’ve never looked through his phone before but when I saw the notification I was curious because he’s been getting a lot of Snapchat notifications lately. The notification was from a selfie of her that said “just watching tv.” From what I can tell, they send photos back and forth several times a day. 

I can’t tell if this is odd or if I’m just overreacting. I’ve always thought I trusted him but this has me questioning that. Something just feels off to me. I guess I don’t understand why you would meet someone for 10 mins, get their contact info, and then talk to them everyday for over three months if nothing else was going on. Is this suspicious?

Update: I asked to have a conversation about boundaries and how we should move forward. He packed a bag and said he’d be back Friday to get his stuff (we live together) because I “obviously don’t trust him.” I told him this isn’t anything we can’t work past and that I want to figure this out. He said we couldn’t. I said obviously this makes me feel like there was something more to his relationship with this person, and he said I was being irrational. I’m in complete shock, as are our best friends (a married couple that consists of both my best friend and his). There were zero indicators up until this point that he would be cheating or that he was unhappy or that he was doubting our relationship. We almost never argue or disagree, we’re very good at anticipating the other person’s needs, he literally told me right before he went to sleep last night and this all happened how happy I make him. We check in regularly with each other to make sure no adjustments in our relationship need to made, and I still am not 100% sure what happened here. This really freaking sucks.

Hey,
I feel like I am getting totally crazy.  I was never a jelous type. We have been for 2 years, and we know eachother almost 20 years.  He had a 4 years long relationship with a girl ,after 2 years they broke up we got together. We were in zero contact  while he had the 4 years long relationship.
I feel like he is not honest with me,maybe neither withhimself. I had this strange feelings to get it touch with his ex,if they  have feelings for eachother,I would step from their way out. I am so curious  what is the opinion his ex, just to talk like a human with a human, about objective things. 
All over I think I am out of my mind because of this idea.
On the other hand I dont want to loose him,but I want to make him happy, no matter if he would be happy with me or with her, ofc it depends on her feelings, thoughts  too.
 This is such an ambivalent feeling.","I (F39) want to connect to my partner's (M42) ex (F36), to get know the truth about his feelings...what is going on with me?",18mubao,1703078045.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mubao/i_f39_want_to_connect_to_my_partners_m42_ex_f36/,

"So for some context we’ll have been dating for 2 months soonish. I’m on the spectrum (autism) but most of my issues fall under sensory issues, social settings and memory. 

She’s my first everything, girlfriend, sexual partner, kiss, cuddle everything in a relationship. 

Now here’s the thing. I think she’s attractive, I definitely can feel turned on towards her and enjoy looking at her albeit she’s not what I’d say my type is, she’s cool and funny and does have a personality I enjoy as well. 

She very rarely makes me actually mad or upset or other negative emotion. But something that does bother me is the lack of actual excitement or happiness that I feel should come from being or about to be seeing her, for me it’s like she’s just a friend I kiss and that I’m committed to. 

We’ve talked about this before me and her and she explained to me she thought it was because I was her first everything and that my feelings mattered but that she thought I was still sorting everything out. (We moved kinda quickly)

Is she right? Do I just need to spend more time with her and everything and eventually it will even itself out and I’ll become closer to her? Will the excitement come or should I break us up and save her the heartbreak? She already seems a little Delusional about me (which is kinda hot but y’know 🤷‍♂️)

"I've been told I should fix my shortcomings, fight depression, work on myself. But I've found again someone I like. Not that much like the ones before but I like him for who he presented as he is. I think he's pretty, has style I like, has creativity and is into fantasy. He's passionate about things he does. Is kind but true to his feelings. And I just can't but find him cute. 

Since I have a lot of issues and I am not experienced much in what to do I am scared to say anything to him. I am scared of rejection and even him accepting it wanting to know more about me. He has same identity as nearly I do. Hes bisexual and asexual and demiboy. Which I do not label myself as that but many people pointed out I might be asexual. I feel attractiveness as into women and into men. But more men. I am not confident about my gender but demigender is relateble to me.
It's one big issue (apart of I listed already), he might have a partner. But it could even be his best friend. I don't know. 

I've wanted to date one person a while ago and he too had linked best friend and shared a profile picture as well as this bookseller. Although he has the person as ""partner in crime"" which is unfamiliar to me what that means.

I don't know what to do since I want him but am scared of my failure and rejection because either he has someone or he doesn't want me.

This could possibly be my first real relationship, ever. And has possibility to be real.

Though he's not like my past crushes. Those were more manly and into military, maybe my type is somewhat more strict like my father is. Which feels awful really to think about.

And when I anonymously said I like him in Tellonym on ig page of our school he responded in comments with this ""👀👀🕷️"". I have no explanation for that either..

Any advice??

"We’ve been together for 2,5 years. He lovely when he is in a good mood and not stressed, but can have trouble seeing things from my perspective, leading me to compromise most of the time.

We’re a long distance relationship and we met through a common interest. He has been a challenge from the start, which is probably not how it is supposed to be, I don’t blame him I would blame myself also for choosing to be with him. 

He worries about money, but the career he’s pursuing is hard and takes time. He doesn’t want to work a “normal” job…

Some examples of why I want to break it off with him:

Last Christmas we spent together he showed very little interest in my family and were so moody on Christmas Eve. I brought it up to him before we went to my home this Christmas, and still now he has been very moody and doesn’t want to do anything because he’s just thinking about what to do with his career…

Sometimes when he is mad/stressed he ignores me for half a day, and doesn’t say anything about it or apologize. I’ve engaged in his family and tried my very best to support him.

He said he didn’t buy any Christmas gift for me this year, he said he would buy something at my place but I doubt it.

On my birthday this year,the clock hit 00:00 and I waited for a bday message because we were talking right before and ik he were up and on his phone. I know he wasn’t in the best mood but still hoped for a bday message or call! He just sent a snap “I’m the worst boyfriend ever” no happy bday. And he said it was because he was in a bad mood… its not hard to just say happy birthday.

He isn’t so nice to his own family either…

I want to end it, as I’ve tried to support him and have done so much but I don’t get enough in return but I would feel bad as he is in a difficult place but I would still want to support him as a friend

I understand if he is depressed but people around him want to help but he doesn’t treat them great… I told him to maybe talk to a. Therapist but he didn’t like that idea plus he doesn’t have enough money for that.

I want him to go home now as this brings me stress in a family environment because my family see he isn’t ideal. The tofu so plan is for him to go home in two weeks but it feels so hard right now.

"TLDR at bottom

  
A bit of background: My wife (32F) and I (37M) have been together for 8 years and married for just over a year. Our relationship is strong, we have been through some tough times but we have grown so much as individuals and as a couple.

  
She was in India for the last three months getting teaching qualifications in yoga, Reiki etc and taking some much deserved time for herself. I was fully supportive of her trip and never once told her to come home - she was so happy and fulfilled and I love seeing her like that.

  
A few weeks ago she called me to say that she had met someone and that she wanted to explore the connection she had with him. Everyone there (including her teachers) had told her just to do it and not tell me, but we have built something on trust and communication and I appreciate her calling me, even though it was very painful to hear.

  
I told her I needed to think about it and she was very supportive but also said that he was leaving in a couple of days. Without meaning to pressure me, I did feel from a couple of comments over the next day or so that she was desperate for an answer before he left.

  
Eventually I told her that I would support her, in spite of how much the idea hurt me, but that for now it should only be the one time and that we should speak properly when she is back. People will probably say I'm crazy, but I want her to be happy and from the way she explained it beforehand (which very few people will understand), I genuinely felt that she was more connected to me and in love with me through the open, genuine conversations we had leading to me giving her permission.

  
A bit more background: over the last couple of years I have seen something like this coming. We have vaguely spoken about the possibility of discussing an open relationship or having experiences with other people in the past, but the idea was always that we would talk it through, make some ground rules and ensure we were both comfortable with it every step of the way. I always knew that I was not interested personally in being with anyone else, but that her feeling free and open might actually bring us closer together.

  
But I'm a little angry at how it happened, how I had to make a rushed decision and how I maybe went against my instinct. I can't be angry at her really, I gave her permission after all, but I'm really hurting right now.

  
I'm trying not to think so much about the physical act, and I have my good moments, but since she's been back (just a few days) it's very hard to be around her or to be ok. She's being really caring and supportive and wants to help however she can. And she honestly seems closer to me than she has been in a while. 

I don't want to mess up the relationship just because I can't deal with this. How can I learn to accept what happened and move forward? How can I stop this from consuming me totally (I'm struggling to work, socialise or just do much really)? She's happy to talk to me about whatever I need to know, but how much should I know? I also have a horrible urge to check her conversation history with him to try to understand better but I know that is stupid and will cause me unnecessary pain. Any advice would be much appreciated. How can I deal with this?

"Dear redditors, 
Christmas is coming up, and to me it’s already a difficult time for me due to reasons not related to this post (growing up with toxic parents). 

This year, my boyfriend and I made a deal that our gifts for each other should be crafted by ourselves. It was my idea and the intention was to save us some money. 

I have got a very strong feeling of what he’s making. And I simply don’t approve. Also, please tell me if I’m being unappreciative and am in the wrong here. 

The reason I do believe I know what he’s making is a few things, one being the crazy amount of time he’s been working on it. The second thing is a relative accidentally slipped their tongue and mentioned resin. I know my boyfriend has worked with resin on smaller scale items / furniture before. 

In November I saw on social media someone who’d made a resin table with a Star Wars theme, I showed it to my boyfriend because he absolutely loves both. While I did appreciate the masterpiece someone had made, my boyfriend and I talked about wanting a resin table in the future, I told him that we should NOT get one for several years. I told him I loved the table we have now, which is from his childhood home. 
To me, we already have a very nice and functional table, we don’t have room for anything else. 
Please call me out now, if I’m being unreasonable, but I feel like for a piece of furniture I should also have a say in which type of wood, color of resin and general design. 

I’m terrified I won’t like this gift. I’m terrified my facial expression will break his heart. I know I will have a hard time not showing my genuine emotions, so I’m asking you guys how you would respond to something you really don’t like? And also asking you if you could somehow change my point of view? 

To add, there’s a tiny chance that it will be a smaller piece of furniture. I’m 100% certain he’s using resin. If it is the smaller furniture, I will be relieved, but I would still be a bit scared if it’s a wood type that I really don’t like.

"So me (18 f) and my  boyfriend (18 m)  both struggle with  mental health issues.  He has really  bad anxiety and depression, and i have ADHD anxiety/depression.  And we have been together for 4 months now.

One of the ways he kinda copes is playing video games a lot, which is fine i don't mind gaming but hes always playing games.  Even when I'm over, I could be sitting there with no shirt on and he would be glued to the screen. And if hes not gaming hes sleeping. There been 3 occasions where I've been over to his house and hes been asleep and I've just had to go home, even if hes said he wants to hang out that day

Now part of my ADHD is that i have very bad Rejection sensitive dysphoria but i also overthink every thing. And its never him making plans to hang out, its always me asking him, and if he says he wants to hang out and then changes his mind it hurts way more than it should and i feel like I'm falling into thoughts of ""oh he thinks I'm annoying, he doesn't actually want to hang out, hes sick of you""

we also haven't slept together either and Ive subtly brought it up and hes kinda brushed it off, i would never want to make him do something he doesn't want to do but it makes me feel like I'm not attractive enough for him. I have also ruled out cheating being the issue because its against his morals  and hes very introverted and doesn't go out that often.

I want to let him know this is how i feel  but  i don't want to talk to him about it  and then have him freak out or think I'm personally  attacking him. He always says he loves me and all that but I just have a hard time believing him. Part of me feels like hes only with me out of pity.

And this is like the best relationship I've been in, the times where he does hang out with me is amazings, i like him alot but when he ignores me its really fucking hurts. I just always worry I'm not good enough for him.

They are not sharing bedrooms and we talk on the phone every night until we fall asleep so I’m pretty confident nothing is going on. They had been in a relationship for ten years.

At first it didn’t bother me, he even told her he was dating. However, now it’s gotten pretty serious between us. A couple of weeks ago he admitted that he found it hard to stay with me for too much of the time because he wouldn’t admit to his ex that he had gotten that serious with someone. He told me to please wait until january when he moved out and that I then would get all of his attention. I told him that I expected him to be transparent and tell her that he was serious with me. He says he is not willing to do that, because apperently she is battling depression because of the breakup and is in a bad mental state. He says she could know about it later on, however he does not think they will stay in touch. I find it rather difficoult that he is prioritizing her emotions over mine.

I asked him if he wanted space and I also offered to talk. He didn't respond. So I'm assuming that means he just wants space. The day before I told him I was feeling insecure . He told me that I have nothing to worry about,, he misses me and loves me. I'm just honestly at a loss on what to do. Just give him the space? Move on because it's so new? It's causing me anxiety because I just want to know where his head is at regarding the relationship but I also don't want to make his family problems about us.

"So I've recently gotten into a relationship with a wonderful girl who is everything I'm looking for, she's the best in every way and I would not like to hurt her or make her feel on edge etc. 

Now I share quite a nice flat with some people I met at flatshare group, the place is really great, cheap and good location. I had a little fling with one of my roommates, it was a lot of back and forth between us. We never went further than making out and sleeping in eachothers beds (no sex). She broke it off for a silly reason, ruined my trust towards her. Now she's been away since summer due to an internship, but will be moving back in here by the start of February. I'm totally over her, and feel no romantic feelings towards her whatsoever, and have realized in retrospect that I'm glad it didn't work out. 

I would like to continue living in my flat as I quite enjoy my time her, I would still be friendly with the flatmate I had a fling for, but nothing more than being cordial. How should I go about telling my girlfriend about this, and should I suggest to her that I can continue living here cause it's her that I love, not my flatmate. Or should I rather just tell her and say I will be finding a new place to live?

"Been married 10 years.  I knew she had a few relationships before me, but the extent of which only became clear after we married through her actions.  For example, she wouldn’t stop messaging her ex or his family for years after we married even when I called her out on it.  She finally ended up at his house one day “by accident” after we had been married 5 years.  She swears nothing happened but it still bothers me.  They were together 6 years and had all their firsts together which over time has made me feel like a second husband. I also discovered she had a one night stand with a married man and father before we were married.  When I found out her response is she’s glad she did it because it made her realize how important a good relationship is which is why she married me.  The lack of remorse stung. She also cheated on me once when we first started dating.  

As for my past, it’s very vanilla and I was always 100% faithful to her.  So I have no understanding of her actions.  To make it worse, she was uninterested in sex and complained about me wanting it all the time. This culminated one night on an anniversary vacation after a romantic evening. I thought we would make love and she was so mad she told me to go out and find another woman and have sex with her instead. She apologized after.

After that day she ended up at ex’s house, something clicked for her and she really changed for the better.  She’s been an incredible wife and has turned into the woman of my dreams in all things but one: I can’t get over what she did and how she treated me those first five years.

So after therapy and counseling I still don’t have direction.  All I know is I’m tired of the pain. It feels unfair that she did whatever she wanted for years without remorse and I suffer the emotional consequences. I want to “get back” at her for making me feel this way for so long.  At the same time I don’t want to leave or cheat but I also don’t want to live like this anymore.

"So me and my girlfriend have been together for some time now. We've had our ups and downs and such as anyone does.

Our strongest suit is our honesty and communication. We tell each other everything and discuss how to move forward. Down to the smallest things craziest things. 

Lately she's opened up a whole new level of herself to me, mainly about her lack of self value etc. Which I responded in kind and she said I really helped   her get through those feelings with the praise and words I said. And commented that we've never felt closer. 

Fast forward to yesterday when out of the blue she says she's just gonna bottle up her feelings and not tell me anything anymore cuz she's hypersensitive (her words not mine). She's not understanding I fell in love with all of her and good and bad, and we can't hide any part of ourselves in a relationship otherwise said relationship is doomed to fail. She's convinced she's doing me a favor (again her words not mine)

"My partner and I met in Iceland in August while I was there for work, and we dated until October, at which point I returned to the UK. We decided to text daily and call about twice a week, and if we still felt like we had feelings for each other in November, would book flights for her to come to the UK for a week in December. This all went ahead, and I am delighted to say that we had a fantastic week together.

So fantastic, that I am now sat here after her departure, terrified at the prospect of what is to come. I am working, she has just started at university. This means we have about 3yrs ahead of us where we’re calling and flying back-and-forth. She would like to spend a year of her study in the UK, but this is unconfirmed and could be tricky (and possibly extremely expensive) to make happen. She’d have a year of study in Iceland after that, and possibly another if she’d like to do a masters. So 3yrs is an optimistic estimate, we could be looking at 4yrs apart from each other.

I really want to make this work. I am not questioning my relationship with her, nor my ability to stay faithful. What I’m struggling with is the concept of only getting to see her for a fraction of the year, for such a long time.

If you’ve entered a long-distance relationship and have felt similar feelings, how did you cope with them? Does it get any easier as you get into the rhythm of visiting each other, or is it a constant uphill struggle?

"Hello everyone!  
  
I don't want to drag on too much, but about a year and a half ago, I started dating a girl who comes from a quite wealthy family, especially on her father's side, who is a millionaire. He keeps a low profile, but considering the house he lives in, the cars, and the fact that he only travels, it's evident that he has a significant fortune.  
  
I, on the other hand, am quite modest. I have a regular job in the Marketing field and come from a lower-middle-class family with working-class parents.  
  
Regardless of that, apparently, we always got along well, and I believe I was well-accepted into the family (with her brothers and such). However, from the beginning, I noticed there was always an interest in knowing about my background. When her father first met me, the first thing he asked was what my parents did (what?).  
  
Anyway, time passed, and I always maintained a good relationship with her father, but sometimes I heard unnecessary comments that made me very sad. Once, for example, my girlfriend was showing her new clothes to her father, and he complimented her, saying, ""You look very beautiful. In fact, you're very beautiful. I don't know why you didn't find a boyfriend who's also a millionaire."" He said it half-jokingly, but I sensed some truth in it, and it hurt me a lot.  
  
More recently, I was at his house for dinner, and we were talking about companies in our country. He turns to me and says, ""You know, (my girlfriend) used to date a man from (big company)."" Another sister even interrupted, ""Dad, (OP) doesn't need to know that!"" and the father replied, ""Yes, he does. It's good to know.""  
  
Now, this, combined with what happened before, has left me upset. I take great pride in who I am and where I come from, but I feel that there is some resentment there because I'm not a millionaire like them. My girlfriend has never made any comments, and I know she's not to blame for her father's attitude, but I'm starting to feel insecure and tired of being in this relationship because of it. She is very close to her father, and he is very present in our lives, so I can't escape from this.  


I ask for tips how to deal with this, please! 

Thanks

Hi, I got no idea if anyone has anything to say about this, but there’s a guy I have dated for quite a long time (though we’re not seeing each other anymore) and we have this weird problem where we can’t relax around each other. We can be very physically intimate and also have been able to open up to each about really personal problems and inner thoughts. But when we’re just supposed to be hanging out and be casual, there’s an uncomfortable tension and anxiety in the air, making us both anxious and unable to be ourselves. We are really different in many ways, especially when it comes to hobbies and interests, but we also do have common points and share a lot of the same sense of humour. He suffers a lot for anxiety, which he started developing around the same time as when we started seeing each other. It’s not only connected to me, although I think being with me is now associated with anxiety and therefore makes him really anxious in my presence. And that makes me really uncomfortable around him, in return. 

I just find this really really weird. I’ve thought through every sort of reason for why this is happening, and I just can’t find a reason that seems logical. The only conclusion I can come to, is that it’s a mix of something in him, that’s just not open for me or for being around me, and the fact that we’re too different? Even though I’m hesitant about that statement, because though I think we might not understand each other all that well sometimes, doesn’t it feel like it should create this anxiety between us…..","Uncomfortable tension when we’re hanging out (F/21, M/21)",18msoqa,1703072519.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18msoqa/uncomfortable_tension_when_were_hanging_out_f21/,
"Last week my girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue and this has turned my world upside down in many ways. She has been battling intermittent mental health issues for quite some time and it seems like, from what I can gather, is that it's come to the point where she feels breaking up with me to 'find herself' is her only solution at this point.

I really don't know what to make of it. Her rationale according to her is that she feels inadequate compared to me in different ways. She has dropped out of university twice now (but has started again this year, doing a different subject each time), and as such, feels like she is lagging behind me in life. I graduated last year and now have a full time job, and I believe she can't help but fixate on comparisons between her point in life and mine. She has called herself 'pathetic' despite me repeately tried to convey to her how special to me she is, that she's on a good path, and that I nor my family (who she seems to also compare herself to) care that she's had some issues holding her back.

She has told me that she still loves me and that I'm the best person in her life, and the feeling is of course mutual, which makes this break up hurt even more. I don't know what to do going forwards. Ideally I'd like to see her be happy in herself while remaining with me, but since the breakup we haven't spoke and I feel incredibly powerless at this point to reason with her or try to find a way to fix it. Probably the most important thing in my life, and I feel like there's nothing I can do.

We had been semi-long distance for a while (about an hour away) but she moved to my city for university in September, which meant we could spend much more time with eachother. We hadn't made official arrangements yet but it was becoming increasingly likely that we'd be moving in together shortly. I'd been planning the basis of my future life around her, and now to see it squandered for a reason I can't fully understand is heartbreaking. I don't want to see other people. I don't want her to go through her struggles alone. I want to be there to help her through it and I don't believe isolating herself is necessarily the correct decision.

During the breakup I tried to offer different solutions, just to *try* to fix things. Couples therapy, regular therapy, spending more time together, making an effort to treat her more maturely, but it was evident that she felt like she *had* to do it - all in spite of her reminding me that she loves me and will miss me and can't believe she's doing it ""to you of all people"". She was very distraught as she was telling me all this.

There is also the question of what I do now - do I try to wait until she comes back to me, if ever? We both love eachother and it feels like it would be an enormous tragedy if we feel we're right for eachother but our relationship is never salvaged because of momentary circumstance. In my eyes, she was a true one-in-a-million person.

One of the biggest things I'm truly frightened of is that she finds herself ready to be in a relationship with me, but doesn't feel brave enough to ask me. Do I check up on her, to know if she's okay? What amount of contact would be considered overbearing? How and when do I let her know that I want to take her back? I haven't spoken to her since the break up and this new 'status' I have is all so alien to me.

I've spoken to her sister, and she doesn't seem to understand it either. She mentioned my girlfriend resorting to self destructive behaviours in the past, which is something I have also seen, though this does feel like a culmination of sorts. I'm sure there's a lot psychologically going on which I can't fully explain. With or without me, I think she does need some sort of therapy to process these unhealthy thoughts she's having, and perhaps with time she'll come to realise her own self-worth.

An easy answer to all this would be to just ""move on"", and I can see why people would think that. But to me this is a core part of our *life* at stake. 3.5 years of building a relationship and memories with this person who still claims she loves me. There's no ill will, no insurmountable personality differences, just this insecurity and self identity crisis she feels. I just don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------TLDR------------------------------

My girlfriend broke up with me unexpectedly due to feeling inadequate compared to my status in life. She's been battling mental health issues and thinks finding herself requires being single. Despite loving each other, she feels compelled to do this. I'm devastated and unsure of what to do. I've suggested therapy and solutions, but she's adamant. I fear her previous self-destructive tendencies and worry about her well-being. I'm torn between waiting for her or moving on. Her sister acknowledges past self destructive behaviours but doesn't understand the breakup either. I'm lost and deeply hurt as I don't want to lose what we've built over 3.5 years due to her insecurities.

"Hi Reddit,

I'm Indian, 27, male, grew up in a progressive Chinese city. My mom was very domineering and fairly controlling, she had a bit of a temper, and ultimately it led me to being a bit introverted/quiet/in my own thoughts. I ended up getting really into computers. Today, I run a huge multinational company, am a lot more confident, etc. but am still an introvert.

My mom was in an unhappy marriage and got divorced \~12 years ago. She lived with my grandma, me, and a helper. 2 years ago, my grandma died, and it was horrible. My mom is still depressed about it today, and cries every other day about it. Before my grandma got sick, I'd met a girl, she's awesome. She's Chinese and from the same progressive Chinese city, so, somewhat different family values. We were dating for a few months when my grandma passed. On Christmas that year, about a month after my grandma's death, my girlfriend assumed I'd spend Christmas with her (I never said so, though), my mom was depressed and crying, so I had to tell my girlfriend no, and that my mom was crying and depressed and I couldn't come. She spent it with her family instead, and was incredibly mad at me.

Because of my job, I am both flexible about my location, but also traveling a lot. I was with my mom for about 4 continuous months after my grandma died, my mom fired our helper, and now she was completely alone, my mom was very sad/unhappy about being alone. She doesn't have that many friends, either; I am lightly pushing her to find a new man, too, but that's easier said than done. My mom also works for an airline as a flight manager. Anyways, when my mom seemed a bit more stable, I had to travel for work, and soon my girlfriend joined me to travel/remote work across Europe, Dubai, California.

She got a new job in London, so we eventually rented an apartment and settled there for a while. We still traveled a lot, things are good, I treat her like a princess and the Christmas we spent in the UK was her best ever. However, I never really got around to telling my mom that I'm living with my girlfriend, I just kept telling my mom I had to travel for work. Why did I do this? I think it's because my mom was depressed and alone. I didn't want her to feel like I'm abandoning her to go be with my girlfriend, especially now that she's all alone. Whenever I was back in my hometown, my mom would, at least once, cry and say stuff like ""I don't know what I'm living for anymore. I had to look after you, I had to look after \[grandma\], but now you're sorted and she's gone""

I feel incredibly guilty about my actions, i.e. leaving my mom to be alone. So I call her everyday. Given I never told my mom about my girlfriend being there, I usually go inside the bedroom to talk to my mom. My mom knows about my girlfriend, though they haven't met as yet, and it's become a bit weird because it's been like 2.5 years with my girlfriend now. My girlfriend is incredibly annoyed by this, and I don't fully understand why: she feels like she has to mouse around and feels like ""a side chick"" (??). It's not like she's quiet either, I just mention it so she doesn't barge in loudly.

My mom has come to London twice to visit as she had work flights to London twice, both times she'd be there for like a day and a half. I'd go to her hotel and stay 1.5 days. My girlfriend also gets incredibly mad about this, like my mom is interfering in our lives.

**So, fast forward to this Sunday:** I am back home in China to sort out a longstay visa for the UK. My girlfriend is in the UK right now. She's feeling lonely and wants to spend Christmas with me, so I offered to fly her back for Christmas, I booked her flight, she's coming on the 22nd.

**Then, Monday:** my mom fell down at 3AM, I had to take her to the hospital. Turns out she needed knee surgery, we had it done the same day. Now my mom and I are alone at home, my dad is here too staying for a few days, but he will leave soon. I tell my girlfriend, she is instantly annoyed because her family is traveling somewhere else on the 23rd too, and she was about to ask me if I could stay with her 22nd-25th at a hotel. Of course, given my mom is alone and can't walk, I probably can't do that, and I tell her that. She gets mad, treats me coldly for a few hours. I tell her that I promised to spend Christmas with her and will still come spend Christmas with her, pick her up from their airport, spend the next day evening with her.

**Then, Tuesday:** She brings up that first Christmas, she's tells me that I am ruining her Christmas again, she demands I tell my mom that we are living together, and to set boundaries such that my mom doesn't interfere in our lives, and that if I didn't do that by January, that we should break up.

I feel fine with mentioning to my mom that I am going to be in London and staying with my girlfriend, so she can make noise if she wants while I am on call with my mom, sure. However, what's more troubling to me is the attitude that she's displaying in general? It doesn't feel like this is going to work out longer term. She has a very normal and healthy family: mom &amp; dad in love, have 2 kids, her and her brother. Her family is successful and pretty normal. They seem fine with whatever she does, aren't really strict at all. Nuclear families I think are more the norm in Chinese culture. However, most importantly, her family doesn't need her, they have each other, they have extended family, they have lots of friends. My mom doesn't have any of that, just me. However, I think I would like my mom to be part of my life in some fashion. Not glued together, but more than seeing her once a year for dinner. 

My mom is alone in China. She retires next year, then what? She'll probably want to move to where ever I am, and not necessarily be glued to me, but yeah, she will want to be a part of my life, I imagine. If she still had a husband, or she still had friends, or she still had someone else in her life, I feel like I would be okay with keeping my mom at arm's length. However, she's alone. It's her choices that pushed her to be in that position, yes, but I feel it is my duty to make sure my mom is okay in life - after all, my mom did that for me.

To be clear, I think my girlfriend is right, and I am displaying sort of abnormal behaviour, I am just too ""in it"" to really recognize it day to day. I recognize I should have probably told my mom we were living together earlier and now I have to correct that issue. 

How do I navigate this situation? I don't want to abandon my mom, I love my girlfriend, but I feel as though we are too opposed on this issue that is very core to my life.","My girlfriend (23F) doesn't like how I (27M) sometimes prioritize my mom (56F), how do I deal with this situation?",18msmiy,1703072296.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18msmiy/my_girlfriend_23f_doesnt_like_how_i_27m_sometimes/,
"Too young to commit ?


Hello everyone, just needing some perspective on the current situation that I’m in, I’m not expecting any solutions but like i said maybe a different perspective would help

For some backstory me(25M) and my girlfriend(25F) met about 5 years ago when we were both in uni, we were doing different courses at the time but met through a mutual friend and kinda kicked right off, it was amazing when it started, we had so much to talk about, so much fun doing things together and was just an all round healthy relationship. Then after about 10 months i had to move campuses to a different part of the country which also happened to be my home state, it was about a 3 hour drive from the city where we were originally. Even then i guess we tried to make it work and it somewhat did work, but i also felt my mind slowly getting more and more disconnected/dependant from/on her, i guess i just started reverting back to my emotionally independent day, but i just went with the flow and didn’t really acknowledge it as an issue at all. I still tried to be there for her as much i could and make her feel the best that she could albeit the distance, but i was never really considering by gradual detachment at this stage at all. Her gratitude was enough for me to believe that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my state of mind. Anyways that went on for a couple of years and then last year I had a unexpected career opportunity overseas that popped up,and given that it was somewhat of an offer you couldn’t pass, i took it (for some context i work in healthcare) and everything happened really quick then, within a matter of months i was on flight to a country that was very far from home. I didn’t think much of this at the time but that would have been really hard on her, but i just went with the flow and reassured her that everything will work out. Throughout the year the relationship was definitely strained, it was my first job and all the responsibilities had taken was really getting to me, and i expected her to understand this but it didn’t really seem like she did. She didn’t really get the high stakes of my job and anxiety and stress that comes with it, but again i just went with the flow because i never really thought id be capable of breaking up with her although there were multiples times i felt like i probably had to. 
She does have a lot on her plate as well including a parent who’s diagnosed with a sinister disease

So fast forward to the last couple of weeks, I’m nearing about a year since I’ve moved here and she is beginning to raise some questions in terms of our plan for the future. This is complicated because now I’m in a different country and there’s lots of logistical barriers, the easiest way would be if she gets a spouse visa, which obv means we’d have to get married, and this is where I’m just in a really really tricky position. Do i love her ? Yes i do, i care for her immensely but i also feel like I’m too young to make a commitment like that. On top of that having someone move across the world for you is very very heavy burden, what if she doesn’t like it here?This is my first relationship, I’ve never been with anyone else ever before. She has and maybe thats why this decision is easier for her. I don’t want to be backed into a corner. This relationship does have many flaws that i never expected my dream relationship to have. When i tell her this she always assumes that i just want to bail out and sleep around/have fun. Its so frustrating.

"Dear reddit,

  
I (M23) am in a happy 4 year relationship with my girlfriend (F21). We are not living together. However, the last few months it costs me a lot of energy to see each other. When we do, the time is usually fine and never horrendous. We both enjoy the activities and eachother company. However, since the last few months I am always looking forward to being by myself. I don't like planning things anymore and just want to be alone. I still thinks she is absolutely gorgeous and care deeply for her. I don't think it is fair that I have this feeling and I hoped it would go away, but it seems to grow stronger. Now, I am spending more days with my friends so that I dont have to spend too many days a week with her. Since spending too much time with her results in a deep pit afterwards which make the feeling grow even stronger.

  
So my question is, should I communicate with her or should I continue doing my best effort to get the feeling back? I think that if I say to her how I feel, the relationship will end. Since if I say that I do not want to see her for a few weeks, it feels like I am restricting her life too much. Furthermore, for me to be in a relationship, I feel like I should first have to work on myself to want such a connection again. Any other insights is also welcome.

"My boyfriend and I have a great relationship filled with laughter, but lately, I've been feeling a bit disconnected. He's really into a card game that involves events and gambling for expensive cards, like in Pokemon.

The problem is, these events often fall on the days we'd usually spend time together. I  support his hobby (now less ngl..), but when it consistently affects our plans, it hurts. We've missed out on special moments, and it's been ages since we've had a proper date night

For instance, he canceled some of the summer plans for the game events. These plans are events that only happen in the summer so for me they were special. We could not to big date nights in September and October due to money concerns (i would ofcourse pay as well), but he's spending money on these card events. In November, he had plans for two weeks, and the other 2 weeks I was sick with COVID. Now, in December, he scheduled the weeks for other card events.

I confessed that it hurts that he planned December without me, and he tried to make it up. We had a date night, but he said multiple times he couldn't wait for the day to be over. Now he had a long day at work, but I heard him being excited about other hangouts before and after ours, so it that was a bit painful.

So then i noticed in a group he wrote this to someone.

""I wanna give an huge shout-out to u/aperson for being a wonderful writer and an amazing person ❤️

Sadly I can't send you anything in DM otherwise I would have overflown that with love as well 😄""

I can see that it is supportive. And can see he means to be kind. But as his girlfriend i have not heard in a long time 'you are amazing i want to overflow you with love' and also i have not been overflown with love lately. Also some months ago i was uncomfortable about a hobby of his and instead of talking normally about it and explaining the hobby, he said then maybe i should break up since it does not make me comfortable. It scared me how fast he goes for breaking up instead of having a normal conversation about what exactly the hobby is. The hobby was writing stories with a writing partner where romance and sex can happen. I said it made me uncomfortable that sex has to happen in the stories.

I plan to talk to him after work, express my feelings about the lack of quality time, and share that I'm upset. I'm also curious about what he meant by 'overflow of love.'

What do you think? Would you be okay if your partner shared something like this? Would you ask the same questions? How should I approach this conversation? Do you think you need to share who you are close with of opposite sex before being surprised with these kinds of texts? IDK!

I do have to say is that he does bring me to work when I am his place. He gave me chocolates when I was sick. He is really kind.

Thanks for your thoughts! ❤️",I (24F) feel like a sidequest instead of a companion to my bf (26M). Is it normal to say that you want to overflow someone with love?

"I (30, soon to be 31f), used to be with my toxic ex (32m) for 10 years, until this past April. At the end of the relationship he told me that I am ""expired"", that ""men go for women aged 18-29"" and that I should have thought of settling down earlier, because now no one will love me because I am older and I am a bit plus sized.

This month I started dating a wonderful man (31 soon to be 32). He told me he hasn't had a relationship for years because he couldn't find what he was looking for, that he wants to settle down eventually and that he thinks we would make a great couple. I feel he treats me like a queen every time we go out, and is very vocal about how much he likes me.

Problem is, this man is objectively really hot (think male model looks), really intellectual, a gentleman....a real catch. So, I am always with the fear that someone more attractive in the ""not expired"" age group will catch his eye, and he will eventually leave me. He has already assured me that while many women do hit on him, he was looking for someone worth the effort, and these women weren't it.

I know it is my own insecurity speaking, and I definitely don't act jealous or have told anything to him, it is just my inner thoughts.

"So I've been friend with this girl for 5 years since we met in high school. 
We used to live in the same city so we were close we used to go out almost every day for walks or errands...she felt overwhelmed going grocery shopping or similar by herself so I used to go with her. Sometimes I offered to go somewhere different to have fun like visit new places... but she always refused because of her social anxiety (I have it too but Idk why I learnt to manage it somewhat) so I didn't insist. 


I was the only friend to hung out with that she had, I got acquaintances but rarely went out with them. We got mutual friends but they rarely hung out with us. 


About 2 years ago she moved with her family in a distant city. 
I don't have a car neither does she. So occasionally our parents gave us rides to see each other. But we did texts everyday. I would have loved to call her but she hates calls so I didn't. 


Then she met a guy and texted me less and less.
I still texted her sometimes to see if everything was ok. 
Then I ended up in a toxic relationship and got a job. 
She got mad at me for my relationship and I haven't heard from her for like 2 months then she came to visit me and out mutual friends, we said we missed each other and everything went back to normal. 


She didn't share much about her life or his bf as she did before. I think she was kind of jealous of her relationship with him (???)..
I don't know if she made new friends in her town, she is still looking for a job. ..
But when I texted her (not everyday, sometimes because I was working and didn't want to stress her ) she answered me like the day after... it didn't bother me at first as I thought she was with her bf and preferred to pass her time with him.....


Then few days ago I texted her and asked her how she was doing, as we didn't hear in 1/2 weeks and she never answered me I know for a fact that she is mad as she Isn't even reading the texts in our mutual friend group and she hided her profile pic from me (I could eee it before). 
I deleted the text.

"This thing is really affecting me.

I have no friends in medical school, and I'm not intending to make any friends. I just want to have good and fun colleagues that I enjoy my journey with.
I always try to help. I have a ""Telegram"" channel that I share explanatory videos on. I share my notes with all the girls. I try to be as nice as possible all the time. I'm also a straight As student. I'm mentioning all of these things just because I really don't know why my colleagues are so rude to me, either online or in reality.
I left all the group-chats so they don't argue with me, they just want to find any little mistake I make to argue.
I only joined the group chats that are with our professors. Even by doing so, yesterday some [20F] asked in the group (of the professor) about something that I did know the answer to and the professor had answered it before in the group chat, she immediately replied with anger that I should not be talking with her. I found out later that she is in the same class with me.

"My best friend and I met when we were 12 years old in 7th grade, I had just moved from another state and she was my first friend in the new area. We have always had a little bit of a leader/follower dynamic, with me being the leader, not saying anything negative about her. It was just that anything I liked to do, she started doing, any music I played became her favorite band, I decided to go to a specialized high school, she followed me there even though it wasn't in her school district, etc. After we graduated high school, I moved away and she stayed in her home town, but I would come back and visit often and we remained best friends from a far. In my early 20's, I had moved back to the state we met in for a little bit and we got super into partying together, and that was sort of the beginning of both of our addictions. I left the state again and started traveling seasonally for work all over the country, and during that time my addiction got worse and worse, and she and I drifted apart for a few years. Then in 2020, I had a major wake up call and was going through a very hard time with my addiction, and I started reaching back out for the people I loved, and she was one of them. In 2021 I finally got clean and sober, and am now almost 3 years sober this coming February. 

Unfortunately, my best friend is headed in the opposite direction and it's getting pretty bad, very fast. She has been through hell in the past 2 years, her mother died after battling cancer for 5 years, she left her DV boyfriend of 5 years just a few months ago, had to move out of her apartment and doesn't get to see her dogs as much. She's been dating someone (34M) and I feel he is a really dangerous influence on her... She's now told me about at least 3 instances of them being together where things got extremely dangerous, including her having a seizure after partying all night with him doing hard drugs and drinking... As of 4 days ago, she told me that he brought her to a drug dealers house and that the men there were trying to get her to have s\*x for money and she thought they were going to SA her.... I have tried to tell her that none of these situations are in anyway normal, nor should she be spending time with the guy she has been because he does not have her best interest anywhere in his mind. I have also told her many times I think she is starting to go in a scary downhill spiral. Anytime she texts me it is always something negative, or bad news, or boy drama, or general life drama. I'm running out of ""I'm sorrys"" and ""that sucks, but maybe you could try --"". Just tonight she texted me about this guy she met a week ago, they only spent 1 night talking and she was already getting invested... She invited him out tonight and he responded saying that he wasn't interested and she was really seriously upset, to which I replied ""I'm sorry, but it was only 1 night, and I think you have some other stuff to focus on right now outside of men"" and I said some other things that she probably didn't want to hear.  


I don't have much advice for her anymore because she's living in a victim mentality of ""why is this happening to me?"" instead of realizing it is her own choices that are winding her up in bad situations... After she told me about her most recent experience I had to get kind of tough with her because she was making light of it and using ""lol"" after each text she sent me like it was just some funny experience instead of a seriously dangerous and traumatic one... I'm visiting her home state right now for the holiday, and have been with my family, who love her as if she was their own. I've been here for 4 days now, and have asked her a few times about when we can hang out, and she keeps making up excuses like ""I have to work, and I have family stuff"" but then is posting on her Instagram story that she's out at bars with random people I've never even heard of her mentioning. I feel like she's falling into a bad crowd and going down a dark path, and I don't know if I can be there for her while she does... I have worked so hard to stay sober, and I'm really trying not to play victim even though things in my life aren't peachy either, I'm actively trying to work on them and better myself. I just feel like things at this point are very one sided, and I get this draining feeling whenever I see her name pop up on a text message. I also feel pretty upset that she isn't making time to see me considering I live in a different state and we don't see each other often. 

I need some guidance on what to do here, is a break a good idea? Am I going to be abandoning her if I take some time away so I can focus more on myself? What do I say to her about it outside of blind support? How do I structure a productive conversation with her about all of this? I need some perspective, I love her very much, but I don't know if it's a healthy friendship anymore....

TL;DR My best friend of 15 years is spiraling down with her addiction, and poor decisions, and she will not accept any responsibility for it, she is constantly negative and living in victim mentality. I am 3 years sober and have worked hard to maintain that. She never really asks about me, when I tell her good news there's never that much of a congratulations. It's starting to feel very one sided and unhealthy. What and how do I say something to her about this?

I had a crush on him then but he eventually pushed people away because he was going through some stuff. So obviously I moved on and gave him the space he wanted. Recently we reconnected and we started talking alot more and became close friends. He's really the sweetest guy ever and would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. Also to me it seems that he his low key flirting with me. The issue is that he's been in a relationship for a year and half. I don't know his partner well but is a nice guy. I started falling for David and I find myself getting excited for his texts and when I see him. My heart skips a beat everytime. Logically I know I can't act upon my feelings, he's in a relationship.

"We are long distance and have been dating for almost 4 years. Emotionally, sexually, physically, mentally we are extremely compatible. I love him dearly and he means a lot to me. 

As of now, we are living separately with our guardians, I moved to another nearby state for school and he stayed in our hometown, I have a ""healthier"" family that supports me through school and financially, while his parent left him to be independent besides paying for his tuition and occasionally once a month support him. 

We are both from Asian families, and success is important to our families. I am studying to become a pharmacist, and so far it is going well. It's been two years in college and I'm doing okay. However he has failed almost every class, and is close to being kicked out of his school. He is trying really hard though, but he didn't do good in high school either. 

As much as I want to say I believe in him and that this won't matter in 20 years, that he will make it and become something, my family will not. I have been lying about his grades and academics to them, because I am slightly embarrassed. It feels like if he doesn't fix it or figure something out other than college, I need to find someone else in their eyes, but I don't want to leave him. Like I said, we are so compatible and I can imagine living with him, but with the fact we want to live in our hometown, we need a pretty high dual income, and personally, I do agree with my family that I want someone to keep up with me.

I feel genuinely bad because he's already beating himself up over his grades, it would be different if this was on purpose, where he's skipping class, not studying, not doing assignments, partying and doing drugs etc. I don't know what he wants to do in the future if college fails because he doesn't really fit into any trades. I don't know what I can do. I can't tell if what I'm feeling is just influenced by my family's values because I know we are young and still have a lot of time left. But I want to settle down fast at least when I finish pharmacy school which might be in 7 years. And I'm just stressed that if he's still in college or doing nothing, it might be a bit late to end things. Do you guys think this is possible to fix and will it work out for him without college?

"Okay so, obviously this is a throwaway account, but the need for help / advice is real.

Apologies in advance, I honestly don’t know if this is the best subreddit to post this to, so if there’s a more relevant place for this, I would greatly appreciate you directing me to it. Nonetheless any sort of insight is appreciated.

I’m in my 20’s (male) and have been single for a few years. Being single doesn’t bother me, but I do like getting attention from women, which honestly who doesn’t?

Recently, as in as of a week ago, I started texting someone and things have been moving very quick. It was pretty obvious from day one that we were both just looking for attention fueled by lust, and I knew going into it that I shouldn’t indulge in this but I did. 

I know for a fact that a relationship with her is not possible, but I still say stuff like “I can’t wait to see you” (we’re located far apart). I feel guilty for leading her on because I’m really just thinking with my dick, and I doubt I’ll fulfill anything I say to her. 

I mean, we’re already saying we love each other when the most personal meeting we’ve had is facetime. I don’t love her, I barely know her. I’m using her attention as a way to get off and feel special and I feel like a shithead about it.

Honestly there’s more to it that makes this all even more complicated, but that doesn’t matter so much. I need to end this before it goes any further. 

Well it actually does matter: she’s married, and I knew from the start, yet I didn’t shut it down. That makes me feel even more awful, but in the moment I didn’t care, I just wanted to get attention and get off. I want and need to end this, I just don’t know how to best handle this.

So what are your thoughts? Judgement is welcome, but I would really appreciate any advice or insight for how to navigate this situation. 

No matter what ends up happening, I’ll treat this as a learning experience and hopefully it helps me grow up a bit.

"My fiance has a friend at work who she says she has no feelings for. But when ever I've seen her around him she loves his attention. Trys to play scare him or ignores me and wants to talk with him keeping me out of the conversation entirely. She came home this evening and was very needy for attention. She was frisky, wanted cuddles kisses and love, way.more than normal.

After dinner we are sitting talking and she tells me how this guy is moving away. She says she doesn't care but thinks hes making a mistake. She tells me all about his plans and how it will be good for her. She talked about it for 5 minutes and almost seemed mad at him for leaving.This is someone she says she never speaks to.

She then starts talking about our plans and how good that will be when we achieve our goals.

I've intentionally stayed away from her work to show trust and give her professional space but...

I have an uneasy feeling about her in this situation. The few times I've talked to him he seemed very nervous. he's known some personal information like the specific YouTubers I follow. When he brought up my YouTube channels he tried catching the words as they came out of his mouth. This is from someone she never talks to and doesn't care about.

I might add we had a rough spot for a few years where she would work really late on the weekends. She always wanted to be at the job she hated

Me and my fiance have a history, we met at work and we both had partners at the time.

I guess I am asking if her sudden swing in wanting attention the same day this guy's says he's leaving is a similar pattern to what others have seen in cheating spouses. What do you think I should do?

"My boyfriend is just used to just asking for a blowjob and going straight into the act . In the starting he didn’t even care about foreplay or anything at all towards me . I tried to tell him multiple times that I need foreplay else I don’t even feel like having sex. Just giving him a blowjob and not being able to insert because it hurts is a big turnoff.  Initially he was very reluctant to understand this saying none of the other girls he’s slept with 9 girls apparently wanted foreplay. I don’t even like giving blowjobs but I try for him . After telling him multiple times he has started to Atleast do some foreplay . He didn’t even kiss properly back then . He feels like he is doing a lot but how do I explain it to him this is how it is supposed to be in love ? 

At this point I think I am losing attraction towards him. I don’t even feel like having sex at all. He’s constantly making me insecure about my own body saying he doesn’t like hairy legs . I wax every month and I was waiting 1 week because I need to get waxed then . He says stuff like my boobs add 2 points to my rating making it an 8 . Idk this is so different from the relationship I’ve been in past . He makes sarcastic jokes if I am on my periods and if I am suffering from pain I once asked him to help me crush the preps because I wanted something sweet . He just said I won’t. He later got up and helped when I started crying , but I don’t want to deal with it . Having to tell him everything to do and just listening to him speak like a 5 y/o . 

I am with him because he is very caring and loyal and I know he is a good person. He is also very emotionally available. But I somehow lose respect for him when he does things like this . I just fundamentally can not look up to him as a person and I am always in my survival mode with him . 

Some facts that are adding to the issue - I had to move to his city because he said he will not be able to handle long distance and women cheat in long distance . So I moved 1800 kms just for him , I had gone back home after I switched my job to remote work .
But he still lives with his mother I live 500 m away from him . But that is okay and normal in my country . I was initially struggling a lot living alone because I had to clean , cook and also work more hours than him because I make twice in my software job than he does . I feel like I do everything, what does really add to my life . I have lost my friends because of him and once I went out with his school friend a girl so she invited some old friends for a birthday party and he acted very paranoid knowing I drank and we went out and asked me to leave asap . They were his friends and I was so embarrassed I stopped talking to them . His justification was that he was drunk

"Hello. My (39 m) partner (49 f) has been going through the perimenopause for the last year or so. We’ve been together 2 years and lived together for 1. She’s been on HRT for 7 months, and that did wonders for her physical symptoms, but less so the emotional ones, where she feels detached, and sometimes has no idea who she is anymore. I’ve tried to be supportive throughout, reassuring her, doing a lot around the house, helping with her 19 year old son and his various issues. I’ve read books (especially Davina McColls Menopausing) which have helped me to understand things a lot more. I know she feels guilty about being less intimate or affectionate (not talking solely about sex, which is not something we’ve ever argued about to be clear), and ive tried to never push anything. I’ll admit to having insecure feelings, and I’ll try and talk to her about them for some brief reassurance (which I see now is perceived as unintentional pressure).

We are amazing together 99% of the time, have never argued without alcohol - which we’ve both developed a bad habit of arguing after a few too many in recent months. Last week, she decided to end things with me and asked me to leave. We met a few days later to talk it through. Although she loves me very much, and has said we are amazing together and that I’ve been great through all of it, that she needs to deal with what’s going on with her ‘on her own’ and ‘without the pressure of a relationship’. I don’t understand how we can throw everything away for something that might be transient, and can get better with time. By saying ‘transient’ im really not trying to minimise how hard it is for her as is a huge life changing event.

I’ve never wanted to cause any undue pressure, and she did say maybe that’s on her and thus nothing I can do. I have to pick my stuff up after Boxing Day, and have given her space since we talked on Sunday. I don’t know whether to suggest couples therapy to help us both or suggest therapy, or just grab my stuff, leave, work on myself for a month, and then try and reach out to her. I do know that this can be a phase in life where people work out what matters, what they want and don’t want. And maybe the hard truth is she just wants to be alone and has decided she doesn’t want me anymore.

I do understand that sometimes soul searching needs to be done alone, but hate the feeling I’m losing the best thing for something that can be worked through. I also really don’t want her to feel pressure or that she ‘has’ to do anything. And I also know I can’t just wait around indefinitely and that time heals.

"I have 3 other siblings, one passed away in 2012, the other 2 are still here. 4 years ago our father unexpectedly passed away. For quite a few years even before Dad passed I lived with and helped care for my Mom who has MS and is now in a wheelchair. About a week ago, our mother who is in her late 60's was admitted to ICU for COVID, bilateral pulmonary embolisms, struggling to breathe. Her MS makes her a high risk patient and it proved to be true when it all hit her as hard as it did. 

I'm looking for advice on how to handle something with one of my siblings. Since my Mom has been admitted, I have been at the hospital daily which has put a strain on my own life as I also have a family of my own. But, it's my Mom, and when roles were reversed she would've done the same for me. 

Out of my 2 older siblings, only my sister and her family have come to visit my Mom. Mind you, they live furthest away from the hospital she's at and my brother-in-law is high risk due to his heart condition. My brother, on the other hand, hasn't visited at all despite telling me last Friday he would ""try"" to make it up Saturday. 

For years my brother has essentially cut our family off. I had hoped with the passing of my Dad he would see the importance of family; apparently not. When my Dad passed, the first thing he said to our Mom when he walked into the hospital room where our fathers dead body was; ""Did Dad have a will?"" 

For context; like everyone we didn't have a perfect family *BUT* our parents weren't abusive or neglectful in the least. If they were, his choice to stay away would be justified in my opinion. However, that's not the case at all. In fact, the only reason he has chosen to stay away, is he dislikes the fact that we all maintain a relationship with his ex-wife (and mother of his oldest son) who he was with for over 10 years. Mind you, their marriage disintegrated because of infidelity on my brother's part, with his current wife. 

Tonight at the hospital, my Mom said; ""I don't know what to say when people ask me if I've seen or heard from your brother. Have you heard from him?"" I told her I hadn't heard from him in the past couple days and asked her if she would like me to say something to him. Her reply; ""No. Why? You shouldn't have to."" Which, I agree with...but I am also torn. 

Do I reach out to him and try to convince him he should visit? Do I send an assholish text like; ""So, are you ever going to make it up to visit Mom or no?"" I really want to give him a piece of my mind. I feel what he doesn't like is the guilt he feels knowing or possibly seeing his ex wife and she being someone he f*cked over. He's said that we are ""disloyal"" by maintaining a relationship with someone who treated him like shit. The thing is; during the duration of their marriage he never complained or told us anything she had done that bothered him or was causing a rift in their relationship. I am just torn and looking for advice on the situation. It has consumed my thoughts for so many reasons; I am an empath, I also could never imagine NOT seeing my parents OR siblings or ANYONE I love who is in such a dyer, unpredictable state.",My Mom (68F) has been in ICU for a week.

"My husband (36M) - myself (32F) / My parents (F+M) / My BIL (45M) and my sister (36F)

Christmas is coming up and we're celebrating with my family as every year. The normal amount of money everyone in the family spends is about 70-100USD per gift (1 gift per person). This is the same amount for any type of celebration (be it birthday, Christmas, other holidays..)
  

  
My BIL's birthday is on December 17th. My sister asked the family (my parents, my husband and I) to pitch in, as she wanted to give him a new expensive phone (+1000USD). It's normal for our family to join 'gift funds' together to buy a more expensive gift for a member of the family.
  
My parents and we both each gifted 200 USD as a combination for his bday and Christmas.
  

  
On the 17th we had a party for BIL's birthday, where my sister announced the gift and mentioned that unfortunately he'd have to wait another 4 weeks for the phone to arrive but it's on its way.
  

  
Now for Christmas, I'm not sure what to do. In theory we've already gifted him (part of) the phone, but to leave him without a gift when everyone opens theirs seems not very nice. If he had already gotten the phone it would be different, because then it would be obvious what we've gifted him.
  

  
My husband feels we've already gifted him something so it's not necessary to provide an additional gift and go above the budget. I agree on the one hand, but not fully because of the abovementioned reason so I'm inclined to buy a smaller present. It's been mulling in my head for the past week and we're getting close to the deadline.

"My boyfriend (26) and me (23F) have been in a relationship for over a year. I really love him and want to make this work so I’m looking for genuine advice because this topic is making me worried about our future.

First of all I expressed in the beginning of our relationship that I have an issue with being told what to do and I can not be in a controlling relationship. He agreed and never brought his thoughts on this topic up till recently. He’s American and I’m Finnish so I know there might be some cultural differences in what’s seen as normal and controlling, but I’ve been raised to be independent and that no man can dictate my self expression.

Basically he thinks that I should not wear revealing clothes out of respect for him (mind you I never wear revealing clothes or maybe once in a while if I’m going to a get together with my friends). He claims it has no root in insecurity or jealousy (he does however have a jealousy issue and doesn’t have the greatest self-esteem so I don’t really believe this) but is normal ”give and take” of a relationship and that ”we have to come to a compromise” (he says I’m disrespecting him if I wear revealing clothes, I said I feel like he’s disrespecting me if he tells me what I can or can not wear). However, I have a feeling that that compromise is me just bending to his will and that’s the only way he’ll be happy. Especially because he gave me an example saying if we were going out and I was wearing something revealing and I wouldn’t change he would just stay home. I hope this was said out of the heat of the discussion but also fear this is his perception of a compromise.

When it comes to me, I don’t see how me having to change how I dress is a compromise in the first place. I love fashion and clothes and never wear clothes to get ”male attention” or anything like that. I don’t have the greatest body image as of late and I use clothes to make myself feel beautiful. Men will find a way to be gross and stare even if I’m wearing a sweater so I don’t see how what I wear makes a difference. Fashion and clothes are a part of what I am and I feel like he’s asking me to give up a part of me I’m not willing to give up. Thinking I have to spend the rest of my life defending how I dress or letting men oversexualizing me dictate my life is making me feel anxious and claustrophobic.

I really love this man but he doesn’t see my point of view at all, even though I’m trying to be empathetic to his. I understand he doesn’t care about style or fashion so he doesn’t see it as a form of self expression and I also know that the American culture is different towards men being controlling in the relationship and it’s more normalized. But I don’t see how what I wear has anything to do with him or has to be something I can compromise on. It was a boundary I set early on and I feel like he should’ve expressed his opinion much earlier in the relationship.

How can I make him see my point of view? Other than this our relationship is great and I can see a future with him. How can we understand each other so we can come to an understanding? It’s really hard for me to discuss this without getting heated. How can I remain calm in the conversation?",My (23F) boyfriend (26M) believes he should have a say in what I wear,18mrizu,1703067989.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mrizu/my_23f_boyfriend_26m_believes_he_should_have_a/,

"English isn't my first language so I apologize for any mistakes.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now. We met in my home town and spent almost every day together for the first 5 months of our relationship. Then I had to move away into a different city for university and now we only get to see each other on weekends or during holidays. The thing is, my boyfriend doesn't like communicating via his phone and it makes me go actually insane. To me, i feel like if he cared about me he'd make an effort to text and call me even though he might not be used to that in order to make me feel safe. I have talked to him about this many times and he has actually made some changes but some days it still feels like he just doesn't care as much. 

This has started to strain our relationship a little because I don't feel as loved when I'm away and it makes me very anxious (due to my anxious attachment style that i got from a previous relationship) and he feels like he can't do anything right to accommodate my needs. When he doesn't text me for a long time I also just start assuming that he doesn't want to talk to me and that makes me spiral a lot, making me feel like he doesn't love me as much as I love him. 

I know feeling like this is really unwarranted but how can I make him understand that I simply need  him to make an effort even when I'm not with him in order to not get anxious? He's great in person but once I leave for uni it just feels like he goes cold.

"So as the title states he’s always been a bit of a liar. Some smaller than others but he has always known where I stand with lying and how deeply it affects me but he will cry and apologise and come up with some reason why he lied and promise it will never ever happen again and I’ll forgive him..and ofc it happens again. 

Unfortunately it seems each time he lies he gets a bit better at it and it also seems harder to get the truth, I used to just go on for a bit and that would be enough to crack him but now it seems if I want the truth I need evidence..which brings us to the recent events of this post. 

He went out with his friends, he can get a bit nasty sometimes if he drinks too much or does drugs so I just reminded him of this and said please don’t show up here in that state and also please don’t do cocaine (he knows my views on this) and was also a bit offended tbsg I’d even had to remind him not to do it, he said thsy I need to start trusting him and this was a perfect time to start doing that..and I agreed. 

He came back and I just knew instantly he’d done coke, the slight gurning and inability to stfu was evident 😂 I ofc asked him if he’d done it and he ofc looked shell shocked and said that I need to stop accusing him and take his word for it. I pushed for a bit but I actually believed maybe it was in my head and left it. We then went up to bed and we were kissing and I kid you not I tasted the coke and my bottom lip went fully numb (I’ve done coke before I know the effects it has, I also had no clue it could get to me through kissing) I instantly pulled back and just said in a hushed tone “you lied to me didn’t you” he seemed so offended and hurt by what I had said to the point where he acc left my house that night and threatened to leave me because he “can’t be with someone who doesn’t trust him” go figure..he told me he had no idea what I was tasting and pretty much said it was in my head and I need to just take his word for it. I said before he left my house that this was his last chance to be honest and we’ll be able to talk it out but i have a right to know if I’ve consumed a drug without my knowledge.. he left sticking by his word.

He kept it up and for days I just kept thinking about it and couldn’t let it go in my head so I decided I needed to get the truth for myself..I told him I’d purchased drug tests and before I knew it the anxiety clearly became too much for him and he cracked. 

He put protecting his ego before protecting my sanity. 

Ofc he’s sorry and says it will never happen again and THIS time is the real wake up call (what’s different about this time to all the others?😂)

I really think I’ll end it now but I’m very scared to, I love this man a lot. Could this acc be a wake up call for him? Or will he just continue to keep trying to get away with things bc I keep forgiving him and allowing the opportunity to do so?

"We have been together 2 years, good friends before that for nearly 7. 
We have always had the same sense of humour, I’m not easily offended whatsoever and tend to be considered “one of the boys” when around his friends - a term I don’t so much enjoy because it makes them talk about subjects I don’t particularly want to hear, but I would never make a fuss so they’re none the wiser. 

Recently I’ve had some health concerns, in and out of hospital and had to have some surgeries which is not something I have ever dealt with. 
Because of this, I haven’t been able to exercise, get my lashes done, fake tan or really even have the energy to put makeup on or be concerned about my choice of clothing . 

My boyfriend was nothing but supportive throughout it all and I’m coming out the other side of it but he has made comments such as “You haven’t exactly been your most attractive self recently” after I mentioned the fact that we haven’t been able to have sex. I obviously was offended and very hurt that at my most vulnerable, he obviously noticed I don’t look as good - this isn’t why we couldn’t have sex to clarify, I was saying it as a joke because it sucks and he kind of went along with the joke but it hit a little hard for me. 

He also has mentioned things about my Christmas gift for him VS what I asked for when he asked for ideas, making comments about how much money I spent compared to what I’m asking for. I have always taken pride in giving gifts and is something I truly love, but he vehemently was against me getting him anything, instead wanted me to put money towards our renovations. I decided to get him something small and thoughtful (around $60), and was going to put money in Christmas Day as well - he brought up the price difference because I asked for a pair of new runners, and as I tried explaining the above and that I’m happy to get him something he told me I’m being sensitive and offended for no reason, the more I tried to explain the more it drilled in the sensitive accusations so eventually I just stopped trying. 

There have been a couple of other things recently that I have been a bit offended by and tried to bring it up, especially while sick after he has said things that are sort of out of the ordinary and I don’t know whether I should talk to him about it, or whether I truly am reading into the little things too much and overreacting to him calling me sensitive?

Now, I don’t mind his quirky harmless banters, it’s totally fine by me, but recently he has been doing it more often and I noticed that its starting to get disrespectful, when I started to catch myself shutting down or filtering my sense of hearing when I noticed that he is doing it again. 

So, I talked to him about my feelings about the insults and condescending remarks  as “jokes and for laughs” , and even told him how I felt when hurtful words are said to me by my mom and how it affects me mentally and emotionally. 

All has been said and done. He told me he’s gonna lessen it down. Days has passed and yes, everything is going well. Until we started our review for our board exams. Now, this is the part where his “jokes”  happens every time, specially when we are together with my friends. He would joke about me saying “naay gamay” (a Cebuano derogatory term for crazy person ) when i get a little expressive with my thoughts about the review or would tell me “nag tukar napud oh” ( a Cebuano slang that means she’s changing again or she’s not normal again) infront of my friends when I get a little excited about something. My friends would laugh, of course, because i’d laugh with them. But deep inside, it kinda hurts a little, specially when its coming from him.

Those were just the surface level of insults i receive everyday (masked as a joke, according to him ). I’ve been patient with him long enough it’s just hurtful man. Specially when he can’t fully grasp how his words are affecting me at all. Idk what to do anymore.

Upon discovering my mistake, my partner's reaction was extreme—he locked me in his room, confiscated my phone, and resorted to multiple instances of physical aggression. In the aftermath, I forgave him, believing it was an expression of love, but our relationship has since been strained, marked by constant arguments.

Recently, he demanded I travel to his house, located 45 minutes away, without offering assistance, sparking another heated altercation. Notably, he ended up driving to get me but was upset that he had to, adding another layer to our complex situation. We get into an argument the next morning after I asked him to meet my sister to drop me off 11 minutes away. The dialogue during this argument included him expressing frustration about my supposed lack of appreciation and explaining how I don’t do enough for him. He resorted to physical violence once again, hitting me in my face while he was driving. I began to cry and screamed that I hated him, we both go silent and moments later he asked why was I crying… Upset at such a question I ignore him. He insisted that I gave him an answer and said “ Is it because you feel guilty or is it because of something else”. 

He continues you on his rant after I let it be known that he knows why I was crying, you just hit me again. I dont know if he was genuinely apologetic, because he continued his rant about me. We get to his house he breaks up with me because I had nothing to say to him after he put his hands on me. When I got home later tonight he sent me voice messages. He said he was sorry and he reacted out of anger, he has issues on his own to deal with, and he doesn’t know why he said I dont do anything for him he’s just taking his life frustrations out on me. He finishes with clarifying he is not asking for us to work it out he just wants it to be known that there is no bad blood, he doesn’t hate me, and I will always be the one he loves even if we’re not compatible.

I have read many posts on reddit saying : if you don’t want to have sex with your partner it doesn’t matter if you love him just dump him. And as in some cases I agree its a resolution I don’t think its my case. First of all I lost my virginity with him so I don’t know how it is with other guys but basically I NEVER had a high libido and as a teenager sex topic seemed to be just neutral and as stupid as it may sound I never imagined myself having sex. I would literally cringe off while thinking about it while watching other people do it was completely normal and sometimes making me horny. When i started having sex with my boyfriend everything was amazing at the beginning, it was something new we both had our honeymoon phase but after a couple of months I couldn’t have sex anymore because of the burning pain in the entrance. Even while putting a tampon in it hurts. I have been to specialists they all said I’m fine even though i suffer from infections pretty often (once a week or two) What came down to losing sexual attraction was the fact that it hurt, that every time we did it I know it has been forced by my bf which makes me already NOT horny, but I don’t blame him because he needs sex at least one time in a month. Also I often wonder if I lost sexual attraction to him (I remember he used to be more physically attractive for me at the beginning or is it the issue of pain or maybe both. To be fair while I have sex I also don’t feel like a goddess even tho he treats me like one and I just sometimes feel cringed off by the idea of me doing it. I tend to overthink a lot, maybe that also contributes to the issue?

When I[26M] kissed my fiancee[23F] for the first time, she told me that I was her first kiss. She said the same thing when we had sex for the first time. While it doesn't really matter to me, it still made me feel special and good. I was elated, tbh. She also said that she never had a boyfriend.

I told her that I really don't care if she had a bf, but she should be upfront in telling me about any past relationships and heartbreaks so that I would avoid any similar mistakes. I also told her that my only concern is that none of her past relationships should affect our present or future. If it is done and over, it better stay in the past. I just wanted to be sure she has moved on before committing to me. 

She didn't share anything, and although I had a gut feeling she was lying, I let it go as I didn't want to force her. I thought if I gave her enough time and support, she would eventually tell me the truth.

3 month down the line, we had a little fight in which I said I really don't understand where her insecurities are coming from and instead of fighting she should tell me why she feels insecure about me leaving and I will help her resolve that conflict. I can't be available 24/7, and she should understand that sometimes I get busy. But I still take out time to stay in touch with her. This fight happened while I was on a trip with my friends. I will accept that I didn't get much time for calls, but I made sure to call her before going to bed to talk to her and know about her day.

 She comes to me with confession that her first kiss was a guy she met at her friends place. It was casual, and they just touched 2nd base. She found out the guy was cheating on his gf with her, and she broke it off.

After that, she did have a boyfriend, albeit for just 6-7 months, in which she grew really close and attached to him, and that guy was her second kiss. She also shared some intimate moments with him, going down till 2nd base, but never had any penetrative sex. It was just foreplay, in which the guy used to do his thing (dry humping while naked) that too just once or twice. But she never had sex with him. But soon the guy turned toxic and she saw a complete shift in his personality. He stopped caring, started giving single replies, and stopped putting effort. This mentally messed with her as she ""loved"" the guy, and she saw him change.

Now, I feel a bit betrayed that she didn't tell me these things earlier while I asked her to be honest. I still don't care about the past relationships, but I am afraid of the lie she told me - I being the first kiss; no prior bf. Are my feelings justified, or am I just being an asshole?

Tl;dr: My fiancee didn't reveal about her past relationships earlier while I asked her. I don't care about past relationships but feel a bit betrayed it took her so long to tell me.

"my bff ghosts me in december. At the end of December he swears he's not ghosting me, he's just busy.

But the truth is, he was waiting until January 1 to dump me as a New Year's resolution. 

One of the reasons he gave me was ""the things people say about me"".

As a socially paranoid person, I immediately panicked and spammed him with a thousand questions to find out what he was talking about. 

he replied to none of my questions, he just left me on read.

All he answered was that spamming him was harassment, and that I'd just ruined his good memory of me. he blocked me.

I offer him a ""farewell gift"" at a party, and apologize for the spamming.

In February I like one of his posts on his secondary account, he tells me not to even like his posts, that he doesn't want to hear from me anymore. 

Suddenly, our mutual friends are masking their stories, blocking me, refusing to meet me, etc. Including a guy he hates.

I reveal to the latter that he hates him.

He discusses it with my ex bff, who sends me a letter telling me to ""leave him alone"".

So he forbids me to talk behind his back while he convinces our mutual friends (including one he hates) not to talk to me anymore. 

I find him hypocritical and manipulative so when he launches a crowdfunding, I give it 5 bucks and add a sarcastic message where I wish him a happy new year and say he’s so genuine, adding this emoji 🖕.

While being blocked on instagram, I create multiple secondary accounts on instagram to keep lurking on his storys, to see how happy and surrounded by friends he is while i’m put aside. 

But he notices my secondary accounts everytime and keep blocking them.

I had a long talk with her about why she is skipping classes and tried to find out ways to make her attend classes, but nothing worked. She just doesn't attend the classes due to procrastination or her busy schedule (which only includes going out with friends and family functions). I have tried to explain to her that this is not how things work, she has to make some sacrifices on her schedule, but that backfires.  
  
I tried to talk her into doing something which she loves, like pursuing her hobby, but she doesn't want to. I asked her if we could start our own side venture in which I will work, she could do some easy tasks, but she doesn't want that too.  
  
It's been more than 9 months now, that she isn't doing anything. I can't see her wasting her life away.

"Well the title pretty much sums up my situation. I met an amazing girl on an online dating app. We met up went on a nice date and hit it off. She’s beautiful, independent, smart and funny. After the first date, we continued to hangout and stay the night with each other at both of our places. In the beginning she said how happy she was being alone and single and just going on trips with friends all over the world which I was completely fine with. We both had gotten out of toxic relationships within the last 8 months so I was completely okay with the situation we had. We then begin catching more feelings for each other.  After things started to become more serious in our conversations, she admitted something to me. 

She told me she had been engaged to her high school sweetheart and had a child. 

I was very taken back. Her apartment had no pictures, no toys, no baby shampoo in the shower, absolutely no signs of her being a mom. Her Instagram has absolutely no pictures of her and her child. This absolutely blind sided me. By no means am I upset by her withholding this information because I know letting that wall down isn’t easy but on the other hand, I wish it was given because it would have saved all this difficulty. 

After she told me, I didn’t really ask any questions because I didn’t know what to ask over text and it not be taken the wrong way. I just kind of pushed the conversation off to the side and wanted to wait till in person. 

I have always told myself I don’t want kids of mine own and couldn’t imagine being a stepfather. I’ve always been a very selfish person with my time. I like being able to do what I want when I want. I like to work when I need to and be able to book a trip within a moments notice just because I can. 

I feel it’s only right I tell her how I feel but I would love to know how to go about it. I truly have feelings for this girl and don’t want to let her go but I also don’t think it would be right of me to have a “trial run” with her then realize later on that my original thoughts were true.

We are currently talking right now and have been for almost 3 months now, but we’re just friends. I told her I would love to get back together with her, she said she doesn’t know, she has to work past what happened and then we’ll have to see.

"I asked my bf to get a massage while he’s waiting for me for my facial treatment. Afterwards, when I asked how it went he said it was not good as the masseuse is not good at massaging. And then I was shookt when he said they had extra service so I asked him to elaborate. 
It was kind of funny/okay at first, because I thought he did not accept it and just went away. But then he confessed he got a hand job. My thought was is this real so I asked what happened and he said it was so fast, the woman suddenly started stroking his inner thigh and slipped his hand in his brief and started stroking and he didnt know what to do and asked her to stop but it was too late because he already cummed. And I’m getting mixed emotions at this point so I asked why did you not stop it or said no (because obviously it’s not fast enough if he reached climax) and he said he didn’t know as he was just caught in the moment and probably went on for experience and He thought he’ll tell me the story and we’ll just laugh about it (we’re talking openly about fantasies, like threesome, etc, but w consent). But in my head it’s getting clear that he cheated on me even if it’s no strings attached. At this point he’s now sorry and saying he’ll not do it again and says he didnt know why he went with it anyway. He didnt know what to do at the moment so he just went with it. He said he didnt enjoy it but just cant get out of the situation. He didnt think it was wrong at the moment. He said he didnt mean for it to happen

Im just disappointed that he didnt say no, because, from my thoughts there’s lots of moment where he can get away from it. It’s a long moment to pause and think that its wrong. He fucking reached climax, so it was a long moment!!! But he says he didnt think it wrong at the time. It was just fast bla bla he wasnt thinking
And of course, I also asked him if he felt violated or assaulted in any way. And he says he’s not sure and maybe. Maybe That’s why he froze and let it happen. he’s not sure what happened, why he didnt refuse. I said it’s contradicting that it’s assault if you let it happen and you’re not even sad the first time you told me (but then again assault victims really freeze in situations like this so Im not dismissing it)
Now im not sure what to think :((((
We love each other so much. It’s our 10th yr now and I just can’t believe he will do this.
What if it’s really assault? What if not? I dont know what to do

(Context: in our 10 years, this is only the 2nd time he lost my trust. The first was 5 years ago when I caught him masturbating to photos of his high school friend. He said he didnt actually think it to be wrong at the time, he thought it just like porn. And he just realized when I told him its kind of cheating and it hurt me. He stopped it after and acknowledged that its bad)

We are very close, best friends even. Our situation is amazing, planned future, good sex life, good communication and everything. And he’s perfect apart from these two sexual encounters that I got hurt. I dont know what to do because he broke my trust again and it’s almost same sexual reason.
But I acknowledge that he didnt planned it and did not lie to me. I just dont understand how he can not refuse it, it hurts me. Looks to me that if he’s given a sexual pass, he’ll just accept it??? it’s so fucked up (but what if its really assault???)

"Somebody please help my boyfriend and I. I am literally sobbing as I type this. I'm not sure what has happened

Some back story. My boyfriend is manic bipolar and sometime before I met him he experienced a manic episode that resulted in him believing he was the 2nd coming of Christ and running in the streets of the city naked before being held by police and taken to a mental institution.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. He has been sober from everything for around 3 years and suddenly started experimenting with weed out of no where. I, being powerless to stop him, offered my advice that he probably should not be smoking weed while taking his lithium bipolar meds. This of course did not work since he is a grown man and I cannot control his decisions but only offer my input or thoughts.

As it ended up turning out, the weed and his bipolarness and lithium meds did not interact well and caused him to go nearly manic. His heart and brain were constantly racing and he could not sleep no matter how hard or how much he wanted. I woke up to him having cleaned the entire house in his manic state and him expressing that he felt he would not come back home and no one would likely hear from him again if he left right then and there. 

After this episode he stopped smoking weed and continued his bipolar medication and began attending AA meetings again. Everything seemed to be going great until today.

Today I left work early to be with my boyfriend as he was sent home from our job today because management and others felt he was ""being weird"" and not stable enough to be working on the floor for the rest of the day. Despite this he seemed to be in good spirits. The red flag for me was his insistence to LEAVE WITH ME and how he wanted NO ONE ELSE but me when they asked for him to go home early. I love my boyfriend with all my heart but his recent behavior HAS been alarming me.

Anyway, I drove him home, he seemed to be happy with me, I tried to get him to relax so we watched some animal documentaries and he seemed talkative and lovable as always with me. He was having a hard time sleeping. I remember the last thing was me telling him to go to bed at 10pm and he said he would be in bed soon.

Fast forward to 1am and I wake up to my boyfriend still wired and wide awake. I ask him what's wrong? Why are you still awake bubby? And he turns on me and gives me an irritated ""what?"" He then leaves the bedroom and goes into the backyard. I let him go for a few minutes before calling him. Our conversation went something like this:

""Bubby, please come back to bed. It's late. Do you want to take an ambient? (He has a very hard time sleeping especially lately)""

""NO. I don't WANT an ambient. I'm done. I'm done with it all. Nobody understands and YOU don't understand"" 

He hangs up the call.

This obviously is a COMPLETE 180⁰ in his behavior from just a few hours ago. I'm shocked by his words and sit stunned in bed for a few minutes.

He comes back inside from pacing in the backyard and into our bedroom and he gives me the coldest stare I have ever seen from him before asking me who I am and what I'm doing here.

This fucking broke me.

He now claims he doesn't know me. He now says his name is Richard and not ______. He's telling me he doesn't remember who I am and as I was sleeping shirtless he was disgusted by the sight of me topless since he claimed he did not know me and told me to put a shirt on which I did for him.

All of this has happened within 4 hours from him being all over and lovey with me to forgetting who he is, who I am, and what the fuck is going on.

I'm so fucking scared I don't know what to do in this situation or how to help him. I finally got him to take an ambient after he first rejected it because ""it was blue and not red, why is it blue?? I'm not taking this if it's not red"". I think he is finally resting now. 

This is what absolutely terrifies me the most. After I finally got him to calm down a little bit, he still claims to not know me or who he is but as I was laying with him just before he went to bed he whispered to me:

""I finally get to die""

I'm so fucking scared I'm worried about my boyfriend and his mental health and I just want to help him but I don't know how to help him or what to do at all. Now that he's sleeping I'm going to get his psychiatrists phone number and call her first thing in the morning about what I experienced. Until then I don't know what to do. I can't imagine going to work and leaving him home alone like this at this time.

I need advice. Asking this on behalf of a friend, because they’re much too proud to ask for help! Throwaway because both of the people I’m talking about are huge reddit users and follow my main acc.

My friend, let’s call her Alice (33 F) has been seeing a man, let’s call him Dave (37 M) who is currently in the process of leaving his current relationship. I apologise, I don’t know all of the juicy details but I’ll try and answer all questions.
They have been friends for a long time but started dating about 18 months ago. The partner of Dave, as far as I know, works a lot and isn’t home much. She doesn’t seem to be happy but I don’t think she thinks that Dave is planning to leave or that he is seeing Alice. Dave and Alice do seem to have such a lovely connection and are so happy but it’s hard to look past the fact that he’s cheating on his current partner. 

Alice is head over heels in love with him. Said she fell in love with him when they were just friends, and well before the relationship turned physical. Apparently he felt similar. But it’s been so long, and Dave is yet to leave that I’m concerned for Alice that he never will. Dave and his partner are in the process of selling their house and their investment property, which is giving Alice hope that he is about to leave to be with her.

Have you ever cheated on a spouse to end up faithful with your new partner? Any advice for Alice? Any advice for how I can support her or wake her up?

"my girlfriend and i used to be just friends for years before we started dating. around a year and a half ago, her ex-girlfriend of five years broke up with her and we found out it was because the ex had cheated. 

after a series of events we started dating. 

fast forward to a year later and we were at her hometown visiting her family. she asked me to help her with heavy items stored on her sister’s closet. once we got to a box that was filled with stuff she made for her ex, there was a gift she made on top of it that i had to touch to securely grab everything and put it down. she quickly came down the ladder and took it off my hands, claiming she would deal with that later, and stored the whole box up there again.

those were her memories with her ex and it’s her business what to do with it, but i noticed there were a lot of gifts that showed she used to put effort into gifting her ex and was ‘romantic’, as she said so herself before we started dating. she used to write letters and verbally express her feelings for her ex too, planned trips for them and basically cared for her in many ways i have never seen, all things she herself told me.

later that week, we were talking about christmas gifts we planned for our families and friends and it gave me a chance to try to touch the subject with her. i said something about how dedicated she is and pointed out how nice some of the gifts she gave her ex seemed (like a personalized coloring book, which i find cute). i don’t know if that was out of line, but she replied she’s not like that anymore and changed the subject. 

i have tried to talk about it once in the past and back then she said she’s sorry she’s not a good girlfriend and that i deserve better, which i refuted because she’s great to me in other meaningful ways. 

like i said, she was cheated on and that changed her vision on love as far as i can tell. but i try my best to give her everything she needs, everything she asks and to surprise her with something whenever i can. 

every time i go out i get her sweets, i craft gifts i think she will like, i compliment her all the time, no matter if she’s dressed up or if we just woke up because she’s gorgeous to me anyway. i prioritize her sexual needs above mine always (i used to bottom and she was always proud to say she’s a top and gets satisfaction from that. now i haven’t been the bottom in months and she never ‘returns the favor’. i told her i have needs and that i’d like to compromise on switching things up at least once in a month, but she said that’s not doable). i plan birthday and celebrative dates surprises, both irl and in the games we play in common. i try my best to make her happy and make her feel loved. 

i like doing all of those things (minus the sex part, which isn’t much fun to me) and i’m not doing anything expecting the very same in return, but at the same time it hurts knowing she used to demonstrate love in other ways too and won’t do it for me. am i too needy? 

anyway that’s not to say she doesn’t treat me right! she’s always there for me when i have a mental crisis, taught me a lot about being more self-conscious and we have a pretty good time doing things together because we share a lot of interests. 

i think i’m not being fair here, but i’d like help on how to navigate this, because i’m autistic and this is my first real relationship. i want to make it work but i don’t want to feel like i’m undeserving of that sort of care. i do not want to break up, because i know she loves me and i love her very much. i don’t know how to deal with being jealous of her previous relationship, so any advice would be appreciated. 

sorry for any mistakes, english isn’t my first language. also sorry if there’s a better place to post this, i’m not much of a redditor. i feel like this is too long but i wanted to give context how i’m feeling, sorry again.

"I don't want this to be too long, but we'll see how that goes.

At the beginning of 2023 I started to have passing, ""am I going to break up with him?"" thoughts. It'd never happened before and I was surprised at my mind for considering it. I pushed it down, but it only moved further and further to the forefront of my mind until it completely consumed me in October of this year. 

My partner is 13 years older than me, which I've never minded, and he's wonderful. Incredibly smart, so funny my jaw is sore from laughing when we spend a day at home together, the most resourceful man I've ever met - a mechanic who can take ANYTHING apart and fix it whether he's ever worked on something like it or not, and build anything from scratch to solve any problem. He's thoughtful, an animal lover, considerate, generous, and loves me desperately. I know he loves me,  I feel he loves me, he shows me he loves me, and I love him too. We're affectionate, we have consistently passionate (albeit vanilla) sex, we have a perfectly serviceable life and relationship. I COULD do this forever, I think. I thought.

Something has always been missing. So many things have always been missing. We're both deep introverts, but I have my streaks of extroversion. In the beginning of our relationship, I noticed but never minded that he preferred to sit out any events, shows, parties, or general gatherings I attended. I enjoy my independence and I loved the space he gave me to go anywhere, have a great time, then come home at 3am to crawl into bed to a loving partner who trusted me. But, over the years I've been so independent, it's like I'm alone. Most of my friends have either never met him or only know what he looks like. I spent the year trying specifically to include him, encourage him sweetly to join me to places I'd usually go alone or with friends. Each time I was disappointed. I would have enjoyed myself more without him, either on my own or with others. I've spent thousands of dollars this year, and so much time and energy, trying to treat us to wonderful events, spa days, trips, etc. All of it was lackluster.

I've talked to him many times, for the last 7 years straight about his lack of general passion/desire in the bedroom (I'll get to that), and for the last year or so about these feelings I've been having in an effort to encourage intimacy and open communication between us. He's been open to receiving the information, knows about the changes in his life and our life together that need to be made...then absolutely nothing will happen afterwards.

At the beginning of November, I sat him down to talk and told him I think we might need to separate. He was calm and collected as usual, just asked why. I told him everything. We only have fun together in our home (where we've lived happily for 5 years), and when we leave it's like he's a fraction of himself. I focus so much on him having a nice time that I don't have one, and even when he says he has fun it doesn't seem like it to me. I want to travel, he isn't very interested, is extremely picky and reluctant to admit he's a bit high maintenance. I enjoy sharing meals and going to eat together, which we don't do because he's a picky eater who DOES NOT like to share food almost as a rule. I'm a casual drinker, especially when visiting European countries and sampling wine, and he's sober simply because he prefers not to drink - which is great, except he can't stand to be around anyone who's been drinking - including me - so we can't really share those environments together. We don't enjoy the same music and don't go to live events together. I'm an artist and inherently love things like enjoying a day at the museum, an evening picnic under the moon. But to him the museum is boring and too much walking around, and the park at night has too many bugs and we aren't supposed to be there after dark anyways. We are NOT sexually compatible and never have been. We have lovely, intimate sex that satisfies me physically, but I'm just not having fun. I'm stimulated, but I'm not STIMULATED. I've asked to have sex in the car, on the counter, blindfolded, hands tied, against the wall, anything interesting or spicy. Just light play that wouldn't intimidate him too much, but it's always a gentle no. He'll find a clever way to joke around and we'll both laugh about it until he walks away. I've bought lingerie, sexy outfits and costumes, toys, all unused. He'll say I look cute and act goofy to make me smile before going about his business. 7 years of conversations, some angry at his lack of effort, others begging and crying to be wanted and needed. I feel like I've gone through the all stages of sexual grief and I've reached a cold acceptance. My inner nymphette is near-lifeless, lying on the hard ground in an empty room in my heart. 

I'm a young bartender who finally gained confidence and beauty in my adulthood, and I see the change in other's responses to me. I AM wanted and needed by people, hot people damnit. It makes me incredibly upset when all I've ever wanted is for my partner to look at me that way. I do see love in his eyes, but I've never seen desire. I'm a highly sexual woman and I just want the chance to be wanted again, to have the bedroom be a playground, to go all night and go again when the sun comes up. That connection is so important to me. I understand he's older than me, but he's in his early 40s, he isn't dead. He has a woman in her 20s who is open to doing pretty much anything, but my sweet dumb dumb is just deeply, deeply vanilla, and possibly the calmest person I've ever met.

After telling him all of this, he spent a few hours rationally telling me he understood, but he didn't think it was a good idea to separate. He wants the time to figure himself out, and figure us out. He said he knows he has no ""zest for life"" and also admitted to having ""no hopes, dreams, or ambitions"". I suggested therapy, which he isn't really on board for. He says he doesn't need it since he isn't ""falling apart"". I tried to explain that therapy can help give him the tools to make sense of things, and it would benefit not only himself but us as unit. All in all, we spent some hours talking about how we could change and grow. I asked him to put in more effort, since I'd been spending the last year trying so hard and I was tired. He said he saw my effort, and he would try, said he was capable. We had sex on the couch, it was intimate and wonderful. I described to him that our sex life was like having the most perfect pancakes you've ever had, and then having only those pancakes and nothing else everyday for years. I asked just that he sprinkle a few strawberries and chocolate chips on them.

It's nearing the end of December, and all is the same. After our conversation, no changes. Everything is normal, same as it's ever been. I still go out to do things alone; Christmas parties, museum walks, new restaurants, etc. I've been looking at apartments without actually having the full intention of contacting any of them for an application. I've texted a few for viewings but they've all fallen through for one reason or another, and I've wondered if that's a sign. I keep asking myself if I'm crazy. I have a wonderful man, a perfect handsome dream. One thing I haven't mentioned in this NOVEL is the fact that we share the same birthday, though 13 years apart, and have celebrated together for 7 years. The idea of having my birthday, our birthday, apart from him breaks my heart. My beautiful, soft hearted pisces man. 

I spoke to my sister, and she told me that when he and I first got together, I was in a cloudy place where I needed to be healed. He helped me do that, and I loved and love him deeply, but over time the colors of my rainbow grew brighter and brighter. ""My sweet, dear sister, your rainbow is just so much brighter than his,"" she told me,

I still don't know what to do. I love him. I don't know if I'm in love anymore. But don't long term relationships require work, patience, compromise, change? I feel dampened. Parts of me are falling away like dead leaves. I'm not supposed to feel this way. 

My bad. This was long. ",Not sure if I (28F) should break up with my bf (41M) of 7 years. Am I crazy?,18mpug4,1703061153.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mpug4/not_sure_if_i_28f_should_break_up_with_my_bf_41m/,
"I (35F) have been with my partner (46M) for 18mths. We have a wonderful relationship and have been living together for about 9mths. Like every relationship there have been ups and downs - little arguments over house chores etc. but for the most part we do our best to be present, supportive and patient partners to one another.

He has been struggling with motivation for about 6mths now which has lead to me financially supporting us. This isn't an issue (my salary covers us both easily) but it does place a degree of pressure on me (i.e. I don't feel like I can just up and quit my job if I needed to). But, he is finally taking some steps to address this and getting the right support.

He also has a child (toddler) who lives interstate. He visits every month for 4-5days. When he is away he becomes fairly disconnected, although does try to call at night (often exhausted after running around all day). But I can hear in his voice just how happy being there makes him. The challenge on this front is that he is struggling on how to bring his two worlds (me and his child) together. We have had the discussion multiple times, but it often ends with his fear that his ex would cut ties if he made any real attempt to do this.

I didn't think I wanted children, but seeing him talk about his child and his efforts to be a great Dad have me thinking that maybe I do...

But...

Last time I mentioned this he made a remark about how he is too old to become a dad again. Previously he had said that it was ""up to me"" which doesn't really suggest a partnership approach in hindsight.

So now I feel like I'm grieving the life I won't have on so many levels:
- if I was going to be childless, then I would have the ability to be selfish and flexible - drop everything and live overseas etc. But that's not a possibility any more
- if, instead, I pursued having a family, I would have all the joys (and heartaches) of that life but that also isn't really an option
- lastly, the half way point - I don't have children on my own, instead I become part of a blended family - but that also doesn't feel like that will become a reality.

So, I guess I'm just looking for some thoughts on all of this. I feel sad and stuck at the same time.

"I aplogise in advanced if any of this seems inconsistent or jumbled, I'm just trying to process everything still.

Last night my girlfriend of 1 and a half years just told me she's been losing feelings for me, even though she's not trying to. She said I've done nothing wrong, and she doesn't know why it's happening either.

I talked to a close friend of mine and they suggested that it might be a sign to break up, obviously I won't do that for now, especially close to Christmas. I'm going to try and do everything I can for this relationship, I've never felt this truly loved and appreciated and comfortable with someone before, we're both very open about communication and respecting each other. We've both had our history of traumas and mental issues but we worked past them together.

It was also pointed out to me that it I'm trying for the relationship more than she is. I put in far more effort and time into making things work. That she barely gives energy towards trying to fix things. That's she's ""losing feelings despite me doing so much for her"", however I don't feel like I've been doing enough for her.

I'm just failing to understand how she can go from ""You're perfect for me"" one day, to losing feelings the very next.

Tried a relationship while in the same house, didn’t work, so back to trying and be just friends with her…which Is proven difficult but am getting better with it.

Made the silly decision to go through her phone while she was drunk the other night… roast me all you want I regret it, it was stupid.

Came across a message she sent to some dude, last week after we had an argument, so she was very drunk and angry at that time, talking about me saying “he couldn’t fuck to save his life”.

Now, she isn’t the type of person to talk behind someone’s back and I believe the anger/drunkenness have a lot to do with it. She always claimed to find me extremely attractive and was always all over me kinda thing, always had amazing sexual chemistry etc… but this has thrown me off and really got me thinking, was it all fake?

Why would she say something like that, at a very difficult time, not just for me but for her as well? Was it out of anger and frustration? Was it to “impress” the dude she was talking to?

Okay. Fine. Problem is they constantly have to share this. I feel like everything I do is under scrutiny. The other day I made waffles and we didn't have any plates, so I put them in a Tupperware with a towel. By the time my partner came to have one they were soggy, no surprise. They came in and immediately said ""these should be on a plate in the oven."" 

And if it's not cooking it's filling the dishwasher, or being too loud, or using the imperfect paintbrush, or not waiting long enough for the adhesive on the command strips to activate.

For context, we've been together for nearly 8 years, never married (mutual agreement we don't want to get married). Live together, have a dog, split household finances in half.
Over the last week or so I've made the decision to leave the relationship, a lot of thought has gone into the decision and it's what I definitely want. I feel like we don't want the same things, he wants to settle down, buy a 'forever home' and basically work to put money away for our eventual retirement. I on the other hand want to travel and work abroad. He wants to spend his free time and weekends sat on the sofa, I want to do things and build memories together. I also take on the majority of the burden of household chores, with no offer of help unless I explicitly ask. We've butted heads several times about the absence of an equal 50/50 division of household chores and I'm met with what I feel is borderline gaslighting and made to feel like the bad guy for asking, or made to feel like I'm crazy for thinking he doesn't do his fair share.

"As a heads up, I fully recognise that I've been a massive asshole here, and I really don't want that to continue, so I'm here to ask what you guys think the sensible thing to do is. This is also super long.

As a bit of context, I grew up in a strongly religious household, I also had some pretty strong struggles with drug addiction, social anxiety and all-in-all just not having my shit together. By the time I was 18, I had never been with anyone, and had nothing going for me except University.

When I met the girl in question (let's call her M), it was on my 20th birthday, and I had really transformed myself in the last two years. I became involved with sports, got good in that, working a good job, with a lot more confidence, but had a lot of conflict with my family over that. I wanted to pursue sports, and to see girls, get in a relationship etc but they didn't, they wanted me to stick to academics, and marry someone from our country and religion.  I was very close with them, and really wanted to make them happy. My genius way of resolving this was to just go for casual relationships (I was a fuckboy, having one night stands). I'm also extremely busy at this point in my life, attempting to balance full-time study, work and a budding athletic career, recipe for a disaster.

The night I met M, at a club on my birthday, we fell hard for each other straight away, spent the night and then the next three together. M was a 22 year old University graduate who had recently moved from another country, she had been through a lot, was unsure of her future, and was at a time in her life where she was just partying her days away. She was very honest about all of this, including telling me about her past sexual experience upfront and some of the issues she had faced. I thought she was wonderful, she made it clear she felt the same and she wanted this to turn into a relationship. I had never been in a relationship or experienced emotional intimacy like that really, I had just had a couple of casual sexual encounters in my life by that point. M had been in two serious relationships before, the last one ended quite badly and following from that she had been struggling.

Me and M were often having sex without protection, M had an IUD, and within two weeks we found out that M had unknowingly had an STD without symptoms which she passed on to me. M was very apologetic and again honest, she felt terrible and I re-assured her that it wasn't an issue at all. In all honesty though, my thinking became kind of toxic, my father found out about the situation and basically shamed me for it (she is not from our religion or nationality, and there is a lot of taboo around sex in our culture especially around women), and some of my distant 'friends' talked shit about it too, it weirded me out especially so since M wasn't able to find out who gave it to her.

I didn't know what to do about this, I judged her despite the hypocrisy in me living the same lifestyle, yet I felt for her strongly and recognised she's a good person. I didn't talk to her about any of this, and (I am NOT proud of this) just started being very withdrawn and hesitant instead, coming over only when I felt like it. M was obviously quit hurt and emotional about this, tried to talk to me, to get me to come over more, got really angry at me, all that. Eventually, we both kind of said we'd just be casual, fuckbuddies, but that didn't really work either. because I'd start to miss her or her me and we'd end up spending days together in ways that fuckbuddies wouldn't.

I knew putting her on a string like this was wrong. Was just being weak about it. So I kept trying to end it but for months we kept seeing each other anyway. I had convinced myself I didn't want a relationship with this person and she had convinced herself she didn't want me. I didn't see anyone else in this time, not in the least because I had no time at all, but near the end of this whole 5 month period she had another one night stand which again she was totally honest about (and she was fair about what she said, that I had made it clear we weren't committed or exclusive and that I didn't want a relationship). I still judged her for it, tried to stop seeing her after that point, regretted it and contacted her again, and she made it clear that if I didn't want to put in the effort for a relationship she wasn't going to see me. Not gonna lie I was proud of her for finally standing up for herself.

Again at the time I convinced myself I didn't want relationships, and that it was a mistake to have gotten involved at all. So for a few months we weren't together, I didn't think about her and pushed forward in other areas of my life. After four months, having had other experiences and seen different people, one night out in the Mountains on a hike I kind of burst down crying about her, realising the value in meeting someone like her and how I had totally wronged her with my behaviour.

I contacted again, apologised, sent roses and food and poems, and we saw each other again. In person, I told her I should have been honest and upfront about not wanting a relationship and what my intentions were. She accepted my apology, said that she doesn't want to rush this like she tried to (which I mean she didn't), she started to say, 'you know I thought I was falling in love with you' to kind of test my reaction, it was obvious I had more feelings for her then I let off so she wanted to see how deep that went. I didn't really say anything in response, I was scared. Still really close with my dad. I told her I don't have a relationship to give, she told me that's fine, but that she wants clear communication and respect.

From that point on, fairytale basically. We weren't in a relationship, but we basically were. I helped her move into her new place, we talked all the time, I'd spend weekends with her, we discussed all the things we wanted to do. Ever since we had met, I had big dreams and she had been incredibly supportive of them (even when I was being a toxic asshole, at one point I told her I couldn't see her because I needed to focus on getting a particular achievement, and she had just told me she knows I will succeed and to call her when I'm there). She kind of gave me the wings to action it all. At the same time, she changed her plans to move back home and instead stay in the same country. 

So things with her are great and I'm finally starting to make stuff happen on the athletic side. My departure from University is becoming kind of imminent, and things between me and my dad are very tense. Then, all in one week, a bunch of strange shit happens, and I kind of fucked it all up. It's been about four months since we started seeing each other again

My dad tells me on a Monday that if I marry someone outside our religion, that he wouldn't come to the wedding and would most likely distance himself off from me no matter what. I tell a friend of mine that things are becoming serious with this girl, but when he asks about her past and the stuff that happened early on, he warns me that I'm an idiot for going for a girl that has had STDs, been sexually active etc. M has a good guy friend from her country fly into Australia for the weekend, she goes out with him (she told me, I was there when he called her, I assumed it would just be her and him, which I was cool with). She calls me late at night from his hotel, telling me she's drunk, then tells me she loves me, and really hopes I'll be her boyfriend for real one day. At the time I didn't know there were about a dozen people over at the hotel room with her, I assumed it was just her and him. I also didn't know he was gay. At the time I didn't think anything had happened though, I felt elated to hear her confess those feelings. I told her, 'oh if your feeling sick you should probably head home' and she said, 'yea, you're right, I'll probably call an Uber back'.

I went to sleep straight after that. When I woke up at 5 am for work, I saw a text from her saying she had spent the night at the guy's friend, and immediately I assumed the worst. I sent her a dumb text, along the lines of 'wtf  that's cool but you said you were going back', and then called her a few minutes later. When she picked up, I could hear guys in the background, and she, having seen the text, sounded pissed and definitely exhausted (she had been up all night). I just kind of said, I'll talk to you later, but throughout the day at work I just assumed that she had told me she loved me then fucked someone else, and just blew up internally, sending a bunch of stupid texts accusing her of playing me on and whatnot, whilst also telling her I love her. 

Later that day, I called her best-friend and roommate, who hated me (M hid me from her for the first few weeks we got back together), told her what happened. She told me M was at a party with a bunch of people, that the friend is gay, nothing would've happened, but that M was probably just telling me she loved me to see my reaction. 

I talked to M later, and ironically enough, this time she stated she wanted to slow it way down, she isn't ready for a relationship or for this kind of intimacy. All fair. I apologised for the way I acted, it was after the fact that I looked back on it and realised that I had no right to accuse her like that and that even if she had done what I thought, my response was disproportionately and unjustifiably angry. She wasn't angry, but the vibe between us was weird. 

We had a bunch of arguments over nothing. I brought up if we were in a relationship and said that we weren't, she seemed good with that (which was really weird given how I had acted over her potentially sleeping with someone else). M told me some her about her past relationships, how she had been in one relationship which was miserable, she had gone and cuddled with another guy, she didn't feel like that was cheating, and went on a break with him soon after, that kind of messed with me. Me and M inexplicably even talked about having a threesome. In hindsight, she was distraught over how I had acted, I was distraught about still judging her and not being able to trust her. 

So over phone call I brought up some small stuff, she got angry, it was about to turn into an argument when she finally said that she didn't have a relationship to give and that I was making it too serious. We didn't talk for the next week or two. In that week or two, I did some heavy reflection, and that's when I realised the totality of an asshole I had been. How I should have been in a relationship from her since the beginning, treated her right since the beginning, should have trusted her, not judged her, all of that. 

I tried to make amends, showed up to her place with flowers and a handwritten note. She called me back to say she doesn't love me and doesn't see anything here and doesn't feel anything like that for me. I pleaded with her and told her I'll change etc, and she started contradicting herself but was firm on telling me that it was nothing to do with me, she isn't angry at me and appreciates everything I've done for her but that she doesn't see a future her. It also became apparent her best friend was really trying to stop her from seeing me because she reached out and said a bunch of stuff about M's feelings that contradicted how M was acting and what she was saying to me. 

Later that week, M calls me late at night and asks me to come over. I go running. M's roommate refuses to even look at me, M tells me it's because she's angry at M for having me over. Me and M have sex, but M seems different, asks when I'm leaving, I ask her why she called me over, she tells me she intended this as a last hook up. I felt so hurt, I had done the same to her in the past, but it felt horrible. 

Was a mess for the next few days, it hit me all at once how significant this all was for me, cried lots. All the big plans I had made when I was with M, I actioned them immediately. Left University, made some big career steps, cut off the toxic relationship I had with my dad. 

With M, I felt very conflicted. The last hook up and the being led on for the last few weeks, it felt bad so I texted her about it and was angry. She tried to tell me she just doesn't want to see me, I told her that's fine I don't want to see you, I just want you to know that what you did isn't cool, even though I did the same thing at one point. I also told her what her roommate said about her saying 'I love you' for shits and giggles, and how that's messed up if it's true (I kind of knew it wasn't).

A month goes by, I miss her every day. M drunk calls me one night, she's with her roommate. I can hear her roommate trying to convince M that I am toxic and that she shouldn't see me (which is fair), She takes the phone from M and tells me that M doesn't love me, is just playing me. M asks me to come over, I say no. 

I think about it, and go, wtf am I thinking, of course I want to be this person I messed up. I call M, tell her how much I love her, I come over and spend a few hours, telling her in clear terms that I've been in the wrong in not giving her more, but that it will be different. I go over the next night after work, she's testing me in a way, letting me know she's got work and bills and commitments and that if I'm staying I'll have to work around all that. We have a great weekend, her body language and demeanour showed that she was able to fully relax and feel comfortable and safe. She also got her period, and by the end of the weekend, she was feeling pretty down and I guess she looked like she was rethinking everything. I sat down, told her that it's a lot for her for me to come here and tell her all this so I'll give her space, I tried to tell her I love her (hadn't said it in person yet) but she cut me off, so I said goodbye and left. 

For the next few weeks, everything with M was hot and cold. I'd send sweet little texts, she wouldn't really respond, but then she'd call me and talk for an hour. She'd ask me to come over then change her mind half an hour later. It didn't really make sense to me, I suspected that M had strongly ambivalent feelings and that her roommate was cautioning her against seeing me. So on an impulse I called her roommate, told her I don't blame her for being against me, explained a little backstory and assured that if M does keep seeing me again I wouldn't hurt her again. The roommate goes 'yea yea, just be careful, M is planning on moving back home in two months'. And then it all kind of made sense. 

Before she met me, she planned to go back overseas. While we were together, she started to plan to stay, but after I got angry at her in that manner, I probably gave her the ick, she wrote me off like I did her in the beginning, and decided to move back. The whole time I've been trying to fight for a relationship, she's just been seeing me because she can't help it. 

M's friend obviously told M, and M called later that day to end it. I ended up talking to the roommate once more. The roommate told me that M is a mess, she might have felt love for me but never saw a future with me after everything I did in the beginning, and that these last few months she's kind of been playing me on, not because of anything I did but because she didn't want a relationship but wanted to keep seeing me. Roommate was pretty persistent in making it clear M never loved me. 

That was like two months ago. Since then I've just been heads down in my work, got blasted drunk once and tried calling her a few times but she blocked my number. A few days ago she tried calling late at night, I tried to call back the next day, she's unblocked my number but didn't pick up or return call. I've been so toxic here, and so much of what has happened has made me paranoid or untrusting of M even though my gut and heart trusts it, I am unsure of what to do next.

"So I (25M) had this friend (20M) online (let's call him B) for a couple years now. B and I met while we were playing CS:GO and eventually became friends who would play CS together and other times hang out on Discord and watch movies or youtube with a group of other friends.

For more context, I have struggled with loneliness and depression for a very long time, and have had a history of self harm. Just last year, I spent a month in a psych ward where I'd eventually get diagnosed with BPD. B knows all of this. We had a falling out last year, because I had told one of his other friends during a heated argument that he was B's dog. I have since apologised profusely for it both to B and his friend, and the latter and I are on good terms. Since I didn't really have many friends back then, I would desparately try to contact them by whatever means necessary to apologise, but after a few months of trying I eventually gave up until around a couple months ago where we all reconnected and everything was forgiven.

B is a very domineering person in general. He thinks (and is) fairly good at games, especially tactical shooters. I have spent an unhealthy amount of time playing tac shooters but I'm not very good at them. I often make bad decisions and my fundamentals are bad. When we do play a game, B gets very angry at me when I mess up. And B gets even more angry when I ask why he did something. He calls me a bitch, fucking dumbass, stupid, dumb fuck etc and I'm too intimidated to talk back or argue. When I do say something like ""no I don't think I'm that bad"" or tell him he's wrong he would talk over me and start calling me a faggot (since I've been with men in the past), and all the other stuff mentioned before until I wouldn't know what to say.

This carries on in normal conversations as well. I went out with an old female friend of mine from college and I was repeatedly called a pick me even though I have never harbored any romantic intention for said friend and said as much to him. To his credit, he eventually did tell me that I should let him know when it gets too much, but even then he maintains his opinion on me being a pick me and a ""feminist SJW"" for my opinions on gender politics. He thinks I'm not on ""our side"" in the gender divide and that I selectively highlight women's issues over men's issues although I never said that men don't have social problems. He thinks that I think too much about politics and how he doesn't give a shit. I am fairly sure however that I NEVER bring it up by myself. I only respond when I'm defending myself against being called a pick me or an SJW or whatever.

In the last few days everything had gotten worse. Anything I would say that he didn't like would result in me being called a bitch or ""are you fucking stupid"" and stuff like that which to me is very hurtful. I've been spending too much time playing games, and he thinks that since I spend so much time playing games I should work on improving myself or it's a waste of time. I mean, it is a waste of time since I never had any ambitions of being a professional esports player. I know I should improve but he repeatedly points out how over the years I have the same hours as a professional player but I don't have the fundamentals down and am bad at the game. I now feel very shameful about playing games and I always think that I'm wasting my time. 

I've recently been applying for jobs and waiting for responses but the process is slow and I don't really have anything to do in the meanwhile. I suppose I should diversify my activities and I have been spending too much time playing games (around 4-5 hours a day) but I just feel like trash. I feel like I'm being judged constantly. I don't know what to say to him or share my problems because they're usually brushed aside. He always thinks he's giving me reality checks, which he is, but I just feel so devastated afterwards. I have been really getting messed up in the head and I can't tell what's happening because it's such a jumble. Despite all of this, I've never told him any profanity or said anything disrespectful. 

I made a routine a couple days ago where I limited my playing time to a couple hours a day at the maximum and yesterday in the evening I asked him if he wanted to play and he said no. I then said ""come on man"" and he went off on how I'm dragging him into my problems and how I'm a fucking dumbass who just wants to play games etc. I told him I don't speak disrespectfully to him or call him any profanity, and that I don't want to hear such stuff said to me because it's hurtful and he said he's ""just like that"" and that he's not gonna change himself because of me. I told him if he's so annoyed why he doesn't just block me and that he should stop talking to me and I left. He then texts me that I'm being too sensitive and impulsive and throwing away everything to which I said that it's disappointing that he cannot change a little bit about how he talks to me even though I do not disrespect him or his opinions. Then he says I'm a sensitive bitch and my therapist is ""fucking useless"" and blocks me.

My head has been a mess and I can't discern my own emotions. I feel very lonely, I feel like I'm not good at anything and that maybe I am overreacting and being sensitive. Many of his criticisms have been valid, so I don't know if I'm wrong. I've always been good at studies and I have made it to good schools but I've been struggling with getting a job for the past 4 months. Maybe I'm not really good for anything and I just feel defeated and broken.","How do I (25M) deal with self resentment, doubt and low self esteem over my friend's (20M) actions?",18mpdmf,1703059212.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mpdmf/how_do_i_25m_deal_with_self_resentment_doubt_and/,
"My (27f) boyfriend (35m) of 7 years always borrows my car for long trips (anything over 30 minutes away). His cars are always falling apart, but the only time he goes on long trips is when his mom wants to go shopping at the mall or she needs to get somewhere further away.

His mom has a license and her cars in better shape than all of ours, she just refuses to drive because she's scared. 

His mom was gifted a nice car from her husband's mother. It's not a luxury car, but it's less than 10 years old with minimal miles on it, whereas mine is 20 years old and has 250k miles on it. Way nicer than either of our cars. 

It never occurred to me why they always take my car because in the past, his mom's truck was terrible and couldn't take long trips either.

 I finally asked the other day why they can't take her car, and my boyfriend said ""because we don't want anything to happen to her car if we get into an accident"". 

I was absolutely mind blown and that thought never even crossed my mind. 

Im honestly feeling pretty upset about that, because we live in the middle of nowhere in a rural area and I have a job. So if he were to total my car, I would definitely have to quit my job because there's no way he could drop me off and pick me up.

 And their reasoning feels wildly entitled especially because his mom doesn't need her car except to go grocery shopping, she doesn't even have friends she visits or anything. 

My boyfriend lives 10 minutes away from her so he could help her out with groceries. Whereas I already know he would refuse to drive me to work if anything did happen to my car, and obviously borrowing his mother's car is out of the picture.

"I have never pictured myself with kids. I’m the oldest of three children, and my parents used to pawn my younger siblings off on me a lot when I was younger. This, paired with a lot of other nuances like costs of living and sustainability have led me to not even so much as consider having any children of my own. My own mom, when she gets frustrated with my younger siblings, often tells me to “never have kids”. For as long as I can remember, whenever someone asked me where I saw myself in five years, ten years, twenty years - kids were never in the equation. I’d only see myself, a partner, and animals.

My girlfriend on the other hand, loves kids very much. She has younger siblings as well, and works with young children along with having a degree in childhood education. She displays very motherly behavior almost daily, subconsciously healing my own inner child with her gentle nature.

She has fertility issues, and it’s a well known assumption between us that if we were to ever have kids, I would be the one to carry. I have a higher chance of getting pregnant naturally, and if she were to decide that she wanted to carry, she would have to get already fertilized eggs implanted in her uterus, but it still wouldn’t be without risk.

My worry lies within the issue that her one true wish in this life is to be a mother. She wants to give a child the love and care that she didn’t receive as a child herself. We both had traumatizing childhoods and still suffer from the aftershocks to this day, but while she wants to be different from her parents and elder family, I don’t see myself ever being any different.

I never want to end up like my parents, and lately I’ve been seeing myself acting more and more like them as I grow older. I’m terrified that I would give my child/ren the same trauma that my parents gave me. I truly see myself continuing the cycle instead of breaking it.

My girlfriend is patient, and will take all the time in the world to assist young children. I have very little patience, and I never know what to do around children. We’ve had a deep discussion about this before, wherein she told me to tell her now that I don’t want kids so she can “get over the idea and move on”. My response was that I didn’t know, as we’re still way too young in my eyes. Both unemployed and recent college graduates - it just isn’t feasible. We don’t even have our own place.

Another component that worries me is how back and forth she is on this. One day she’ll have the worlds worst case of baby fever, but then the next she’ll be saying how maybe she doesnt want kids after all; she just wants her own inner child to be healed. However, after her saying this, I’ll get videos on my Tiktok FYP about only ever wanting to be a mother, reposted by her. Then minutes later it’s “ew, children. F*ck them kids.”

I don’t really know what I’m asking for advice wise here. It honestly just feels good to get all of this out, but I’m pretty worried that this difference is going to be the elephant in the room for the foreseeable future of our relationship. We both want to get married and live the rest of our natural lives together, but I just have this nagging feeling that this is going to blossom into a bigger problem.

"I (22F) have a friend (22M) and I just feel he’s gotten a bit cold with me all of a sudden and it just kinda makes me feel sad. I think he has or had a crush on me as I look back over the past couple years we’ve been friends and think about some of the songs he showed me, posts he’s sent me, how he wanted to hang out and do things together but maybe I’m just looking too much into it as I know he has other girl friends and seems to do the same with them. 

I enjoy hanging out with him and he’s a nice and supportive friend and I feel like we’ve even been becoming closer but all of a sudden lately it just feels like he’s pulling back and just acting kinda cold toward me even though I haven’t done anything. I do have a tendency to overthink things but for example we would both send each other posts almost every day and then he just randomly stopped responding and has ignored me on social media since. The posts are not a big deal but its the fact that I see him active so I feel like he’s just specifically ignoring me. And when I asked him he kinda just dismissed it. And it felt kinda cold when we hung out recently and felt like what I said didn’t matter to him which causes me to not really want to talk or when I said something meant to be kinda funny its like I’m unamusing or something to him. He’s a pretty chill person and isn’t that expressive or animated but it feels like he’s even less now. I’ve given the idea of being together a thought but behavior like this is a huge turn off and I don’t think I’d want to be with someone that I feel like isn’t completely sure of what they want and if I’m no different than their other girl friends. 

I don’t play guessing games because it’s a waste of my time and energy and if he does/did like me I would rather have someone communicate this to me and show me that they know what they want. 
I know he doesn’t hate me even though it feels like it and its not a huge deal but it just kinda irks me and triggers things like my anxious abandonment when it comes to people I care about in my life which I’m working on.

"Family trip

My(29F) dad and his wife plan yearly family trips now that they have all adult kids (and no grandchildren yet) they enjoy going out together sipping alcoholic drinks and what not. Last trip I went on was to Puerto Rico in 2021 and I had a great time with my family. Shortly after said trip I began a new relationship. I skipped the 2022 trip and then I missed out this year’s Las Vegas trip due to financial hardships I was having at the time plus a recent car accident I was dealing with. My family would like to take a cruise for 2024 and I am very excited as my first and last cruise was nearly 10 years ago.

My current bf(33M) has already expressed he would never step foot on a cruise ship. He doesn’t trust them nor Mother Nature, hates the ocean and would probably be seasick anyways. I had already expressed that my family enjoy cruise trips and that I would be joining the next one whether he would like to join or not. He didn’t like my answer and said I shouldn’t get on a cruise. 

I have my mind set on going anyways but I am not sure if this is the right decision. I feel like I need to prepare myself for an argument. He didn’t like the Las Vegas idea either but I wasn’t going to be able to go anyways so I didn’t entertain it, I did  say how I wished I would’ve gone though.

"Hi everyone. I've been dating this girl for the past 9 months and a couple days ago, I broke my toe (rolled it during a martial arts session). She was off to her niece's bday earlier in the day. I texted her and let her know that I possibly sprained my toe. It didn't feel too bad at the time, and a classmate made a splint for it. I got back home later that evening (we don't live together), and asked about her event and how her day went. We had a 30 minute call and she was in a good mood. 

Later that night, after I removed the splint to ice my toe, noticed it was black and blue, and was even more painful to the touch. Gave her a call, and was rambling about my injury for 40 minutes or so. The entire time, she was saying not to worry about it, there's nothing I can do about it now. I was pretty hysterical because I felt that I should go to the hospital. Then got upset and said that this whole time I was talking about my toe, I only asked about what she is doing twice. I was pretty surprised, so I apologized for being seemingly inconsiderate and that I would call her the next day because I was in pain. I ended uptaking two Advils and going to sleep.

The next day, I went to the hospital, and after a 7 hour wait, she barely spoke to me through texts. I found out that x-rays showed my toe was broken, and then she says she's not happy with me so she'll just talk to me another day. That she needs some time. Soon after, she cancels Xmas dinner.

Now, this was a pretty important event because I was going to meet her parents and sister's family. I canceled my own family's dinner to attend this, and my sister was nice enough to shift plans to xmas eve. She's met a large number of my friends and family, but after all this time, I've only met one of her relatives and one friend. 

The next morning, she says that she's upset because she thinks I'm selfish for putting myself in danger for practicing martial arts (I somewhat agree to this), that I only spoke about my injury for 40 minutes straight a couple nights before, and that she doesn't want me to meet her parents if I have a broken toe. I apologized for those things, and let her know that I will have to work on solutions for those matters. She said she can come by later in the day and help me do some tasks because I'm immobile at the moment. She brought food, said that she can take me to a hospital appointment the next morning, then left a couple hours later. When she got home, she said she is canceling taking me to my appointment, and that I am selfish because I am putting her in danger of catching a flu/covid for going to the hospital.

I feel so down now that everything has rapidly changed in terms of her attitude. It's like I'm getting kicked when I am already down on the ground. Perhaps she is bubbling up all the negative things about our relationship? Does she not want me to meet any of her people because I am possibly disposable? 

What am I to do? How can I resolve this with her? Asking her about what is the root cause of her upset is making her even more upset.

EDIT #1: I have a temporary plaster cast on and was told by the doctor to keep off my foot. They also gave me crutches. The report says ""Avulsion fracture with a 2 mm displacement and intra-articular extension"". I was hysterical while talking to her because I felt what I thought was either a piece of bone, or some hard type of inflammation floating around. I wasn't sure what it was.

EDIT#2: I just got back from the hospital appointment, spoke with the specialist and he said I have to return in two days for surgery. Saw the x-ray and there is a clean break (loose bone fragment) at the joint (middle of the toe, on the tip bone with the toenail). The surgery will fuse this piece of bone with pins. 

I texted my gf immediately afterwards and she said she can pick me up on Friday, spend time at her house, and she will take me to my family's x-mas eve dinner on Sunday. I cannot drive with cast on right foot. She mentioned she doesn't want to introduce me to her parents until we sit down to discuss future plans, finances, goals etc. She then said if all goes well, she says I can meet her parents at her nephew's bday on Jan 6th.

"Background: This is going to be a rough introduction, but my best friend dated my girlfriend over a year before I did. Yes, ""horrible mistake"" you might be saying, but it was complicated. In senior year of highschool, she became my best friend before we started dating and my best friend warned me and did not approve of us being together. For months I was completely depressed and anxious because I had never met another girl that fit me so well and who cared so much for me, yet I couldn't tell her I loved her. Eventually, after talking things through with my best friend, I chose what was best for me and decided to date her. I kept our relationship a secret for 2 months so people wouldn't have any ammo to fire at my best friend. He expressed that this was a bad idea to me and so we made it public. Eventually, he and I stopped being friends after it was just too much for him, but he expressed that he completely understood my feelings and always defended me when other people told him I was a shitty friend. On that note, I lost all of my friends because of dating this girl. I have no regrets except I wish I dated her sooner instead of going through all of that pain. She is the most incredible thing to ever be apart of my life, all of my problems faded, we dated for 7 months and they were pure bliss...

Until college came and we became long distance. Not seeing her in person did something to me where I started to steadily lose sight of her in a way. Conversely, long distance was so hard on her because she became so attached to me and her happiness depended on me. She had no hobbies, few friends, low self esteem, and all she cared about was me. I very much appreciated this love, but it wasn't healthy. She had anxiety that I would break up with her, she would cry because I would be busy or go to bed early. Then the really bad part came. This created some absurd ego inside my childish mind that fueled it to tyranny and a want to abuse the power I had.

Despite my love for this girl, I started seeking some horrible things like getting with other girls with her permission (which I quickly realized was horrible and never went through with) and I started becoming misogynistic and cold, expressing that I should have more power in the relationship as a man and a more logical thinking human. I deserve all the criticism I will get for this. I was shitty, I was immature, and I desired was I thought made a man powerful. I now realize this is not the goal, this is not what it means to be a man, and I deeply regret ever treating her like this and ever falling for these ideologies. (I will note though that I only said this once to her, the majority of the time I was loving and caring, but I would be irritable sometimes and cold. It came in bursts where I would have random delusional rants that were hurtful)

She came to visit me in college for Halloween and suddenly everything changed. Despite her extreme excitement, counting down the days for a month till we see each other, she acted rather distant in person. She went on her phone a lot, stayed in the other room, and we didn't do much together like I expected. It was strange and I wasn't feeling very loved. The last day I brought up my concerns and we ended up breaking up. She wanted to take a break with no contact because, as she clearly expressed, she cares too much about me that it hurts her. When shes dating me, all she wants is to talk to me and put all her energy into me. And she cant help herself and focus on school. Which I completely agree, and so after consideration, I thought taking a break would be best and really good for both of us. She added that she would not touch another guy as to show she had no other motives and to calm my worries, I too did not touch another girl over the break nor did I want to. She said we would talk on thanksgiving.

In this time, I changed considerably. I not only became spiritual and started believing in a god/higher power (my whole life being a vehement athiest and borderline nihilist) but I also began reading philosophy and constructing a new world view, especially with regards to how I treat others. Crime &amp; punishment and meditations were 2 books that particularly changed my beliefs. I was doing okay during our break, and I didn't even think about her too much.

Thanksgiving comes around and we see each other in person and she says she wants to see how things go. I was feeling fine and understood this and wanted to give her time to process. But here is where the pain started rolling in. Seeing her everyday and just being her friend, wanting absolutely nothing to do with anyone but her, and seeing her not so eager to hang out with me and instead having a lot going on with other people. Everything changed. We used to be each others one and only, but then it looked like I cared about her way more than she did. Thanksgiving break came and went and we did not get back together.

We went back to college and now it was barely any contact except goodnight and goodmorning I love u, with the occasional small conversation. She wanted to not speak much because she didn't want to have to think about me. I became extremely depressed and anxious now, my lifestyle and discipline went out the window, life became miserable. I was missing a piece of my soul. But she told me that we will get back together Christmas break.

Tonight is Christmas break and we saw each other for the first time since. She doesn't want to get back together. She told me that seeing me in person changes everything, that she remembers what I did and its hard. I fucked up in the past considerably but I have changed so much and done everything I can to show her that, but she doesn't believe me. But she says that she knows as soon as we go back together, shes going to end up prioritizing me and not herself and its all going to be the same. I tried desperately to explain that I will do everything I can to help her through this problem. I sincerely believe that couples become stronger by working through their problems together and being open about them. Many times in the past she was not happy with things but kept them to herself instead of telling me how she felt. Now it even feels like shes running from our problems. She expressed that she truly wants to marry me and wants a future with me, but cant do it right now. And by right now, she means until she ""transfers colleges and figures life out"" which is many months down the road.

Its just heartbreaking for me. I sacrificed so much for this girl because she is so perfect. And our relationship was so perfect for a while. I made several mistakes yes. But one day everything changed. She seems so disinterested in me now. And now I am supposed to wait months for her just being her friend. The way she talks about me, it seems like I am a plague to her life. Dating me is taking away from her ability to be happy and succeed when all I want to do is help her. When she sees me in person she becomes afraid of me almost, but I just want to be loving and gentle. When she dates me all her anxiety comes back, but I just want my presence to calm her and put her at ease.

I don't want to give up. I want to marry her and if I really have to, I will wait months. But she said we will get back together and now shes pushing it back and I don't know if I should keep doing this. Im very frustrated and sad. Its so heartbreaking to have everything one moment and for it all to be washed away the next, and the explanation confusing and unsatisfying.

"I love my wife. And I’m realizing that I’m much further along in my career, finances, ability to regulate my emotions, social life, maturity, and most other things important to a relationship than she is. She’s pretty, book smart, and creative. She sometimes cooks and cleans while I do a good portion of the chores and cooking too.

She’s comfortable taking my support (including money-wise) which I provide beyond 50/50 even though we both have good jobs and earn enough to share half each. When I need her support, she either falls apart quickly in the conversation, calls me names, needs solo time, or otherwise can’t really help. I don’t feel like I have a real partner, more like I have someone I need to take care of. In fact she often makes things worse given her immature and emotional approach to problems. Sometimes this includes disrespect.  

In the years we’ve been together, I feel I’ve grown a lot more than she has even though I do see improvements in her. Her approach to life just seems very slowly improving while my expectations are high. I’m a successful, fit, extremely reliable guy. I expect a lot of myself too, and I’m not willing to accept her type of behavior long term. 

I love her and want her to be happy. I also don’t want to settle. Terrified of having kids with someone who isn’t strong or resourceful enough to even handle an overall cushy life and relationship. I’ve given this relationship the better part of a decade now. Do I stay in this or make a big change?

"Thanks guys for reading this! 

We’re in a relationship for about a year and I am at a stage where I want to settle (not marry or have kids right now) but building a life with someone, which means planing to move together in the next few months and having similar long term goals to start to work on. In terms of my career and living situation I am stable and I would like to make the next step.

My boyfriend on the other is now doing his apprenticeship and it will take him another year to finish. He is not working at the time and he would like to look for a job when he finishes his apprenticeship. As he is still living with his parents he first would like to live on his own and maybe also get a seasonal job in Greece where he would work during summer season there.

We had an open talk about this and if I calculate his plans it will take him another 2 years or more to live those phases. I know there is never a guarantee, goals can change and I am absolutely up for it that he needs to live these phases and I don’t want to put him under pressure. But I am worried that if I keep going on it will cause compromises that will hurt and frustrate both of us. He says that he is aware of that but that he just wants to enjoy the time with me.

I feel like this is a love story but I am not sure if it has  the potential to be a life story although I would wish.

Emotionally we are very connected and we love each other deeply. I never experienced this kind of emotional connection and intimacy with a man. And thinking about leaving him is hurting me and I am worried it will be the wrong decision.

I am really struggling if I should I leave my boyfriend because we’re in different phases in life although I deeply love him and care about him?

"Well, a couple of weeks ago, like the title said, my fiancé and I were hit by a car. We were walking home like we normally do. I recognize a car is already driving on the wrong side of the road. Thinking, ""What an idiot."" 
But that car kept getting closer and CLOSER. I tried to push her out of the way but instead missed and threw myself between her and the front of this car. BAM! The car hit me, and I went hurling into her, fracturing her left arm. She passed out, and sooner than later, I did, too. 

I'm not bothered by my injuries, but I do feel a little guilt because my body crushed her during the accident. 
She was in the hospital way longer than me, and I feel responsible. When she woke up, I felt overjoyed and relieved that she was ok. 
We had a new doctor so we had to hear a lot of old news we should already know about ourselves. So I thought. 

Doc brought up my intermittent explosive disorder (IED) because I have a rare case of IED. If I get too angry, I will pass out for 3 to 5 days. In other words, I go into an anger coma.
My last episode was 3 years ago. My fiancé and I have been together for 8 years. When listening to this, she was shocked like she was hearing this for the first time. I was confused and asked her, ""What's wrong? Are you feeling ok?"" 

She told Doc to give us some alone time. Then we argued. She said that I hid my IED from her. Confused as heck. I didn't know what to say. So, I brought up my last episode from 3 years ago. 
She talked about that episode like it was a whole different story. What happened 3 years ago was between me and my brothers. One thing led to another. I got angry, passed out, and went to the hospital. 
Her story was like this. ""You and your brothers got into a huge fight. You and one of your brothers went to the hospital. Back then, I wasn't allowed to see you because I wasn't an immediate family. So I assumed that you got beaten up, not because of your IED."" 

I feel like an ass at this point. It never occurred to me to bring my IED up mostly because it is not something I like talking about. Also, acting like I don't have it feels nice. It makes me feel like I actually have a handle on it. 

Now, she thinks I have been avoiding certain situations because I didn't want to fight with her. I'm also never upset with everything she does to me. She is turning everything positive I do into my way of avoiding being angry. I mean, of course, that my goal is to not be angry. My ultimate goal is to be her husband, but ""she slammed on the brakes.""

"So, my partner and I have been together for about 8 years, and for the past 3 years, we haven't really had sexual experiences. 
I'm bisexual, and to me sex in a romantic relationship is quite important.

About 2 years ago, I brought the subject and, after a quick talk, decided to back off because they expressed to me they were feeling unattractive.

This week, my sexual desire has been high, so I've been trying to engage with them. After they showed no interest, I decided to have an honest chat about the subject again.

This time, they recognized that they didn't really  find sex interesting and said they didn't really feel like they're asexual. I've recognized that this feeling has nothing to do with me in particular, but I still felt sad about the fact that we're not going to have the ""usual"" romantic relationship.

I love them very deeply and feel fulfilled in every other way with our relationship, but I feel like I'm missing the sexual part of it. While I enjoy masturbating and recognize that there's other ways for intimacy, I still feel that I want to have sex.

"I’m not really sure where else, or who, to go to with this but me and my gf have been dating for 7 months. For the most part it’s been very good however at the beginning I could tell something was always on her mind and I felt like I was being compared to her ex, while she never outright said it, there would be things she would say about me that always seemed like I was being compared. On our first date I remember her asking me about my past and when we got to her she just said she has an ex but she’s over him. I remember specifically asking if she really is and that I’m not some sort of rebound and she told me I wasn’t. However there would be times early on where we went somewhere or if her ex got brought up she would get really quiet and borderline sad. I never said anything because that was early on.

      Today, however, I was waiting with her at the airport and we needed to kill time so I decided to go on her phone and scroll through some apps. I got to the notes app and she began getting defensive saying “some people would think what you’re doing is toxic”. I got to one note and she immediately snatched the phone away. After some convincing she let me read it but warned that, “you’re playing with fire”. It ended up being a diary she wrote around the time we met about how there’s this boy in her life that is doing things right but that at night she feels nothing for me and doesn’t want to hurt me, stating she’s been hurt in the past. She went on some rants about how she doesn’t believe anyone cares about her and the only one who did was “that boy from 2 years ago, but did he really care?” Her words about her ex.  Then she stated she doesn’t know whether or not she likes me or is just lonely that she’ll attach to anything. After I read it she got really upset and started crying and telling me she does love me. But at the beginning of the relationship I always expressed to her that it felt like she’s in love with the idea of me, and not for who I really am. She always said that’s dumb and not the case, I’m afraid I’ve been proven right. It just feels like I was just someone who’s been used to forget about a past bf and used as a 1-up on them.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKSTORY: I (31M) recently got out of a toxic relationship of 5 years where my ex ""Val"" (31F) stopped me from seeing one (well, there were more people that she stopped me from seeing, but this story is about one of them) of my best friends ""Nat"" about 6 mos. into the relationship (33F) (yes, we did date, but had been broken up for a year before and were casually dating other people for several months; our friendship had existed both before and after dating). To make a long story short, Nat kept warning me that Val was no good for me and that my relationship was abusive, and I ended up falling for it with Val. I had tried contacting Nat a couple times a few months after the ultimatum, but Val found out and threw a fit. Fast forward to 2021 - I get a message on my reddit main account from Nat, cleverly disguised, asking about me and if it was a safe way to contact me. I had freaked out and then hesitated to respond. In that time, Nat deleted her account.

Now my relationship is over and I'm emerging from my forced isolation, and here's where I need some advice or guidance - I have tried contacting Nat in all the ways I could think of; text and call to last known cell # (from 2019), email, venmo, snapchat, linkedin, letter (which could have likely gotten lost because another letter I mailed in the same batch was lost), and finally, knocking and leaving a note at her door of her last known address about 8 hours ago (which I can confirm she lived there as of 2021, and has lived there for quite a while, and seems like a place that she would still live at based on decorations). I have made it clear in all of my communications that if she has no interest in talking to me that she should tell me otherwise I'll assume she never received it. I'm definitely trying to make it clear as possible that if she wants nothing to do with me I will respect that, and I'm not trying to act or look like a stalker. Am I pushing it or being unintentionally creepy? Have I not given her enough time to process and respond? Anything else that might be important that is going over my head?

EDIT: I should mention that Val had been emotionally and physically abusive, something Nat was well aware of, and tried to help to the best of her ability at the time.

Turns out, school is too demanding and she is not able to work, or barely. She does receive study grants and money from the government for the kids, but it does not cover much. She basically can pay me about 300$ a month, and I pay for everything.

"So tldr; we've been together almost 12 years, known each other for almost 14 years and I don't think there's a future together where we are happy. 


The extended back-story, to where things are now:

We met at work, and became friends. It was a difficult time for me as that year, my then-longest relationship ended, a long-term close friend of mine tried to ""guilt"" me into sleeping with him (I didn't), and was very close to being SA-ed while on a solo camping trip. So basically my life felt like a giant unsafe upheaval.

I ended up dating someone else, and became pregnant. Had the baby and still this person (current ""partner"") and I were close friends, and has been in my older child's life since they were born. The man I was dating at the time and I were splitting up (my decision) and I had discovered I had romantic feelings for my then-friend (I'd tried casually perusing him/seeing if he was interested before I started dating older child's father, but he didn't seem interested at the time/didn't reciprocate anything except friendship). He did reciprocate at this time, and we started seeing each other.

Due to carelessness on both our parts, I became pregnant again shortly after we started seeing each other. This was honestly not something either of us had planned for, or was ready to handle. Options were discussed, and we ended up moving forward with what we were handed.

Cut to now. We have been together the entire time, no indefinitely on either side (at least not to my knowledge; I really don't see him as that type of person, and he's never given me a reason to question that). Kids are now both in the lower double-digits.

We were close to separating in early 2020, but did manage to reconcile (all before lockdown thankfully). The next while after that did start to feel like things took a turn back to the positive, but since then have taken a 180 back to how they were moving towards and worse in my opinion. 

He's never been overly or very publicly affectionate, which while it took some time to adjust to, I did eventually (somewhat). But he's also never been overly supportive, and I feel like he's just essentially ""staying for the kids"" (Blink-182 reference; yes I'm obviously a millennial, come at me bro). I used to love to sing and dance, never trying to make myself out to be someone amazing at either, but I've done both since I was a baby and they make me feel good. But the comments of, ""why do people dance, it's so weird and awkward"", and the fantastic ""joke"" 🙄 of ""hey who sings this song? Maybe you should just let them sing it"" were frequent. I had decent self-confidence my whole life up until within the last 3-5 years (never cocky, but also never overly concerned with what others thought), but his frequent comments, and being from the one person I trusted the most, did of course slowly wear me down.

Any compliments he's given me have always been made in a sexual way, and for a while I didn't entirely mind. But when he would act upset, angry, or disappointed that I didn't want to sleep with him or do things only for his gratification, it really started to wear at me. Anything nice he's done or said to/for me, there's also a caveat where he expects something for it. There's never any comments about, wow I love how you look today. Or, I'm so glad I'm with you. Never the silly, happy looks you can catch guys having when they just look at the woman/person they love and you can easily see on their face how their heart swells because they Actually Feel It.

I would absolutely melt over having actual affection given, and not only in the context of expecting some sort of sexual gratification. I have always wanted to get married, and he has known that since the time we were friends, and was reaffirmed after we got together. He did give me a ring around 4 years in, but it was definitely a placeholder/""shut up ring"" in the end. Yes of course I have brought that up since, many times, and he's just countered with he doesn't really believe in marriage. That was one of the reasons I wanted to split up in 2020, but ultimately decided that I would rather be with him over the ""need"" to get married, and I would stand by that except for the issues of how he treats me overshadowing that.

Any life goals I had or wanted for myself/my future, he's never had any interest in and will constantly be the grey cloud in the sky to bring me down. I understand not everything is realistic all the time, but having positivity and trying to encourage someone you care about I think is very important. 

I started working nights (overnights/graveyards) to be able to stay at home with the kids, and not have to pay for childcare. I at one point was working 4 simultaneous part-time/gig jobs, while he's only ever had a single full time M-F job (it does pay well, but even to this day hadn't cracked the 6-figure point). I've paid for either the majority of child/household expenses, or at very minimum half, the entire relationship. So I've never once expected him to just ""take care of me and the kids"" financially. I've also done the majority of kid related and household tasks too.

He's never been outwardly mean to me, and had thankfully never laid hands on me. He's not a bad person at all, but I honestly think that he just never had the same feelings towards me as I did for him, and he's now only still with me out of duty and obligation.

A couple of things did happen around July - September, which really made me start questioning things again, and helped to mostly solidify the fact that I think things have run their course, and it's time to tell him that we need to move on from each other. I feel defeated with this, and that I've ""wasted"" almost 12 years of some of the potentially best years of my life, trying to convince someone to love me.

"Hey everyone, sorry about the long read. I am seeing a girl now for two months and it has always been really tricky situation since the beginning. We met while she was in a bad relationship but she broke up after 3 dates and we have been seeing each other really often since then. She was pretty clear she didnt want any commitment early on but later changed to that she does want me as a boyfriend in a month or so after she has processed her breakup a little more. Lately tho, we had been having some troubles as she had some issues setting up boundaries with her ex and also some things she did that crossed my boundaries as well (nothing major but still borderline). So I decide its better to take a break and heal rather than being in this situation and lets start it again in some time but I couldn’t really help myself and texted her to meet in two days. When we met, she had the wallpaper of her and her ex bf (I consider this strike 2) although she explained it didnt mean anything and she was upset about everything. She said she was going through her gallery and just thought of having a good memory as the background but I do think coming into my house like that is a bit weird. Also something to note here is that I saw the glimpse of it before she changed it and I spoke about it. I wanna know if its worth continuing with this woman or not since i like her but also need rational advice

But lately, she keeps repeating that phrase ""it seems like you're not serious"". She's insecure, but this is getting past annoying - and I'm starting to feel really disrespected. After all my commitments it seems I'm not serious? I don't get it.

Today she said it again because I wasn't paying full attention (i have ADD; she knows) to a time we're supposed to meet tomorrow, so I asked her to clarify and she said that phrase.

I can't help but wonder if she's projecting, and that she's losing feelings. Or if she's trying to sabotage things. But that could be my insecurity talking.

I'm frustrated. So frustrated by it. I moved to her freaking country to be with her, and I'm spending Christmas with her instead of with my family. Yet it seems I'm not serious? What the hell.

And she snoops through my electronics when I'm asleep. And keeps thinking I'm talking to another girl when I'm not. Again, she's very insecure.

"Hi, so I (25M) asked a friend of a friend (26F) on a date over text and am thinking of walking it back. So a bit of context, I met her in March of this year at a festival, we made out and had a good time on the first night of the festival. I did not have very good mental health at that time and acted a bit strange later on, pushed her away a little the next day but then tried to rectify it. She however went off with her ex ath the festival. Afterwards she said she didn't mean to hurt anyone but wanted to take some time to figure things out. I let it go and moved on. Fast forward a few months I see her at a different festival and she comes to talk to me. We chat for ages and she invites me for coffee. I agree and message her afterwards saying I'm free. She says let's meet up next week. Next week rolls around and I don't hear anything back from her. I assume she's not interested and move on. I see her at another festival a couple weeks ago and we chat a little but not much about anything specific. She does mention to a mutual friend that she doesn't want kids. I have been on the fence about kids for a while but for a long time was definitely wanting kids. I chatted with my cousin (36M) and he suggested I had misread her previous behaviour around the coffee date and that I should ask her on a date. I sent her a message saying that we should get together and 'clear things up' sometime because I was confused after the previous festival. I also say that we could just text about it if she doesn't want to meet. At this stage I'm not sure exactly where I want to go with this ie: friends or romantic. She says she's going to be busy for the next while as she has a lot of work commitments and stuff going on but we can text about it. My cousin suggests I instead directly ask her on a date as my previous message was wishy-washy and seemed a bit like I wanted to have a difficult conversation. So I send her a message asking to go on a date and see. But I've been thinking now that I actually really want kids one day and that I would like to be friends with this girl because she's quite a cool person and we have a lot in common. I'm not that concerned if we date or not. She also knows a lot of people and that's also kinda useful. Anyway I'm not sure I really want to pursue anything romantic anymore and I don't want to jeapordize a potential friendship. I kinda worry though that I've already jeapordized a potential friendship here and am not sure how I can best smooth that over.  


Should I walk back the date invitation or just leave it and wait for her to respond? If she says no to the date invitation, should I propose us being friends or just wait to see her at another event and then feel it out? If she says yes to the date I think I would simply go on the date and then ask some more about her goals for the future and then carefully say that our goals are misaligned and perhaps we'd be better as friends so I'm not concerned about that.",I (25M) asked a friend of a friend (26F) on a date and want to walk it back,18mo6k8,1703054391.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mo6k8/i_25m_asked_a_friend_of_a_friend_26f_on_a_date/,
"So for starters, we’ve been together for almost 4 years and currently live together. We met just before the pandemic so things moved pretty quickly from the start. He’s a sweet, loving, loyal/ committed partner who easily goes with the flow, although he can be quite adamant when it comes to something he firmly believes is right. Within the first year I noticed that he doesn’t handle conflict well and views talking things out as more of a confrontation than a productive talk. I tend to be rather direct. Throughout our time together I started to lose my patience because it seemed like he would either get defensive when I brought up something that bothered me or he would shut down and basically stonewall me. I would push to be understood and it would lead to this long drawn out thing that we’d both get fed up with, and it never seemed to reach a point that felt productive, leaving him frustrated with me, and me more upset than if I hadn’t brought it up in the first place. He never really wanted to talk about anything so I started putting the ball in his court to let me know when a good time to talk is. This worked about 50% of the time. I always felt like he viewed talking as a chore when it wasn’t a lighthearted convo. Fast forward to now, and he’s gotten a lot better at not getting defensive, is accepting of my feelings, and understands the importance of not letting things go, but the dialogue in the conversation I want to have still isn’t really there. I’ll tell him how I feel, and he accepts it and listens and will apologize if necessary, but due to how long it’s taken us to get there, I don’t really trust that he genuinely cares about how I feel and end up thinking that he’s only listening and apologizing to end the conversation faster. He reassures me that he cares, but can’t say much else in response to whatever I bring up. He’s a pretty simple guy, I don’t expect long responses, just normal back and forth dialogue. But it’s always the same kind of response, almost as though he has a script that’s he’s sticking to. Its as though he puts emotional walls up anytime a conversation goes beneath surface level when talking about anything “serious”. Difficult conversations seem to be a chore to him. I’ve been more understanding of this in the past year, as this doesn’t come naturally to him, but I’m also fed up with each conversation and I can’t seem to let go of the feeling that my feelings aren’t important to him, it can be triggering for me to tell him how I feel bc I end up feeling like it’s my fault for off setting our dynamic while simultaneously feeling hopeless/ unseen by him. At this point I don’t even know what he could say to make things better bc I can’t shake the feeling that he doesn’t actually consider my feelings as important even though he insists he does and is trying his best. He doesn’t share his own feelings too often but can be passive aggressive/ short tempered about little things. I’m looking for more dialogue/ problem solving but he doesn’t have much to say and more or less just wants me tell him how I feel. Which, great that he listens but it feels like whatever I say just rolls off of him.
 I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but I can’t shake the feeling of frustration and disappointment when we talk about anything serious in regards to our relationship. I want to feel like he’s meeting me half way/ have more balance.

"I am an artist, a career my dad has largely been fine with growing up. In the past 2 years my dad has become OBSESSED with AI art. I personally am extremely uncomfortable with AI art, especially once my dad started making art of ME using AI that depicted me as extremely skinny and blonde (I have never been skinny and haven’t been blonde in years). I also as an artist have never like AI art because so many people use it in ways where they steal the works of artists without their consent. This is the ONE strong boundary I have ever set for my dad, and he finally seemed to be listening (for about 5 days), even though he wasn’t happy about it.

Also before I get comments on this, I know I can’t control what he does, and I know I couldn’t stop him if I tried. I’ve just told him I don’t want any part in AI art and I’m not comfortable with it or any conversations he has about it. 

The main problem is currently occurring. For Christmas my dad told me he’s making my mom a personalized coloring book and he wanted me to make binding for it. He told me he had 50 artists make artwork that told this story across the coloring book, and he seemed so excited to give it to my mom. He said he’d been working on this gift for a YEAR. I was genuinely excited to help make the cover because I recently got into leatherwork and was going to do so many little details to make it look nice for my mom. However, when I asked my dad which artists he commissioned so I could see their other works and follow them on social media, he looked confused and said “Oh you’ve got it wrong, I used 50 artist’s STYLES.” It’s freaking AI art. The same man that constantly belittles me for not selling my art as much as he thinks I should won’t pay for art (and believe me he can absolutely afford it). To make it even worse he said he’s considering PUBLISHING the coloring book afterwards without giving any credit to the artists whose styles he copied. I want to drop the project because it’s breaking the ONE BOUNDARY that I’ve set, but I know the whole family would see it as childish and disrespectful that I stop helping with my mom’s present. My mom is actually great about this boundary and usually the person I ask for advice in relation to arguments with my dad, but obviously I can’t ask her about this.

"Me and my cousin gradually lost touch 8-5 years ago. It was mostly my fault, I went through deep mental health issues, cancelled plans we had, left him hanging, got taken inpatient and just didn't speak to him anymore.

"I made a previous post about my partner and I not getting on well because sometimes my autism (level 1, quite “high function” until it comes to deviation from routine) and ADHD feed into generalized anxiety. Sunday night, she said that I “had one more fuckup” before she cut me off forever, so if I went to therapy I’d get to keep loving her. That she was “concerned” for me and “therapy would make us better together.” “I’ll always love you but certain things have to change.” So me hearing her genuinely and literally, I went and immediately scheduled a consult because I wanted to both be calmer and love her better. Then she invited me inside and we went to bed together. Woke up for work, we kissed and I headed out.

Mondays are also her therapy days as well so I didn’t want to dump anything on her despite being excited that I finally took a baby step. It was kind of exhausting to do, but I did it. (Therapist said she may refer me out to someone who’s better with autism but I don’t feel like I’m being given up on, which is nice.) I texted her at night that I’d done the thing she said.

This morning she said she was glad I was doing what was best for me but we needed to talk. And of course, I start panicking trying to figure out how I’d fucked up in the course of 24 hours after starting therapy. She said her own therapist has been pushing her to do “what’s best for her” and that we could “only be friends because no matter how much we work on each other we’re not compatible” and I’m at such a loss. I reminded her she said “if I did X (went to therapy) then I could keep Y (our dynamic)” and she launched into how I was gaslighting her over and over. Any time I used her very words she told me, it was gaslighting. 

Overall I’m really sad and I don’t know if she’s ever gonna come back. I don’t understand what it is I did wrong. I followed her exact instructions. I struggle with deviations from plans and she’s more spontaneous than me, but she didn’t name that as the third strike that “got me out” so to speak. When I asked could she at least let me get the help first, and then decide if we’d work or not, she said no. But this whole time she’s been in therapy she’s wanted me to be there to hold her, wipe her tears, all of it. One night she verbally freaked out at me in a bar parking lot, left with my keys (had to get them back from her), then slammed my door shut and left in an Uber before apologizing and telling me to come back. I got yelled at more and told she needed space so I left again (I now realize I should have let her sleep it off but I was concerned and again I follow directions to a T.) Her apology was how she’s still a work in progress in therapy and is learning to convey her emotions better. 

So I made it to a session, but I feel like I got led into it and then left behind. Maybe I’m wrong, I’m not for sure. I can’t stop hearing “one more fuckup” in my head. I didn’t cross that line. She even said I didn’t cross it, but that she “had to” take away the chance she extended me “for her.” If anyone could shed light I’d be so grateful; how do I even react to this? How would a reasonable person?

TL;DR: My partner told me to go to therapy so I could continue to love her and to “be better for the both of us.” I wasted no time going and was so excited to show her what’s already slowly taking place, but she said she “had to do what was best for her” not a day later and went back on everything she said, claiming “she respected her words to me but respected herself more.” I don’t understand what I did other than what was asked.",My (32F) partner (38F) duped me into therapy.,18mnwj9,1703053355.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mnwj9/my_32f_partner_38f_duped_me_into_therapy/,

"basically my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months and it's been really great this whole time but recently (past few weeks) we've just been arguing all the time. It's getting to the point that we can barely go a single day without arguing and it's very draining. At first I thought that I was just doing everything wrong then I realized that maybe we just need to communicate better then I thought maybe we're just leaving the honeymoon phase and this will all blow over but I really don't know. He always says we want different things or maybe we're getting bored or we aren't compatible but I think that's wrong. I want everything he wants and I'm willing to compromise and make sacrifices but I'm just not good at expressing my emotions like that. And I don't think we're bored.

"My (27f) boyfriend (35m) of 7 years told me he would join me to visit my family. They live about 4 hours away one way, so 8 hours away in total.

 My family and I haven't had the best relationship for the previous couple of years, I almost went no contact with them due to it. But our relationship has improved this past year so I agreed to visit them sometime around Christmas. 

My boyfriend has never had a bad experience with my family, he just complains that they talk a lot but it's never about heavy topics, it's usually just surface level stuff and he actually does enjoy my dad's conversations. 

A few days went by, I brought it up for some reason, and he said ""oh yea, my mom has to come with us or I cant go"". 

His mom is so overwhelming to be around and pretty triggering for me because she talks about heavy topics and drama constantly. 

She talks a mile a minute, she cannot go a second with silence. My boyfriend knows his mom can be overwhelming and understands me not wanting to spend that much time with her. Even he complains anytime he has to take her out that she didn't shut up at all the entire time. 

And I know I just mentioned my parents talk a lot, but she talks super quick and comes across as borderline neurotic. Think high energy, lots of words, and it's usually something negative. 

Her other son rarely speaks to her, and against my boyfriends wishes she always ends up talking crap about him and guilting him into trying to ""talk some sense into him"".

 She feels like nobody is ""on her side"", but the truth is she was an incredibly neglectful and alcoholic mother. She would spend days at the bar fighting with her new husband.

Her kids were very young, my boyfriend was around 6/8, his brother was around 8/10ish and she left them to fend for themselves while she drank and verbally fought with her husband for days in the bar. She would also frequently drink and drive with them in the car. 

They would roam the neighborhood or find solace in the neighboring houses. His brother actually met his wife because she lived in the house next door to the bar. 

I'm saying all of this to explain why his mom is really triggering to me when she relentlessly talks crap about him not answering his phone, and tries to make herself seem like the victim when her son has every right to not talk to her. She has every right to be upset and sad too, but it's so stressful to listen to her complain about it. 

And she shows no self awareness about why he might not want to have a relationship with her anymore. I'm pretty sure she knows I went no contact for a bit with my family too, so it just makes me feel extra weird. 

I'm not trying to make the situation about me, but I'm not going to lie and say it's not a bit triggering to hear her spew hate at her son who she clearly traumatized as a child and is trying to force a relationship onto him.

Now my boyfriend is saying he cannot visit my family unless his mom comes because his aunt lives 5 minutes away from my parents and they have a new nephew. The car ride is 8 hours in total and then we also have to stop by his aunt's house for a few hours, and knowing how his family is it could possibly turn into more than just a few hours. 

I didn't appreciate that he didn't even ask me, he basically gave me an ultimatum and said either I come with my mom or I cant go. 

His mom claims she has no way to see her sister, but she has a valid license and her cars in better shape than all of ours. She just refuses to drive anywhere and hasn't for the past 10 years.

 Anytime in the past when she found out we visited my family which was not often at all, she would make passive aggressive remarks to him about how she ""would've loved to come"" sarcastically and how she has no way to visit her sister. She's not disabled, or limited at all and is only 60 years old. 

I did bring up to my boyfriend how I'm not comfortable with her coming and she will drive me mad in the car. I told him I don't think it's fair that he's demanding his mom join us when we rarely visit my family and now we'll have to schedule his aunt's house into our time too. 

He kept saying I was being ridiculous and I'm not normal for just sucking it up and dealing with it and I'll make everyone miserable if I don't let her come.

 He said visiting my family for 3 hours is stressful to him too, so I should return the favor and allow his mom to join us. But the big difference is I'll be stuck with his mom for 12+ hours. I don't agree with this and I'm feeling very invalidated and like he's putting his mom's feelings above mine. He isn't understanding how he's doing that though. Also, without a doubt she will become more demanding about wanting to join us on any trips in the future and I absolutely don't want her tagging along.

 His mom stresses me out so much I spent every holiday alone last year and didn't feel too bad about keeping my peace either. 

After I spent an hour trying to explain why my feelings were hurt and having him deny that and calling me weird and ridiculous for it, he suddenly gets a jolly and very sarcastic attitude and says ""ya know what? Don't worry about it. I'll deal with it, I don't know why I ever thought you would be okay with this"".

 But I'm feeling like he's not okay with it by his sarcastic and sudden jolly attitude after agreeing, and I don't know how to proceed. He's clearly not okay with it and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since.","My (27f) bf (35m) of 7 years is demanding that his mom catch a ride with us on a trip to visit my family and I'm upset about it.

My boyfriend and I are both young and have been together 3 years. There seem to be a few underlying issues in our relationship that we’ve tried working out because we want to be together. I had concerns that my boyfriend was upset with how I grew up. I grew up comfortably and with parents that prioritized experiences over things- so they took me traveling. 

But when I first started dating my boyfriend, a few years ago, my parents got a nasty divorce- and took me on many trips. I think it was a competition between my parents of who could treat me better. So my boyfriend saw me be “spoiled,” for lack of a better word. My boyfriend grew up stressed about money. He grew up with a single mom who worked really hard, but still there were financial issues. He is very ambitious because he wants a good life for himself and me. He wants to be a provider but is also supportive of whatever I want as well. We are both a bit traditional (with gender roles), which I thought was good because we were a good match with most things. 

It seems like there has been low level resentment about how I grew up, especially after I went on a long trip by myself and some friends. We recently went to visit some of my family, in a different state, and took him with us. We got in a fight, or rather a serious talk, and it came up that’s he’s jealous of my background. Honestly, it was crushing to hear it. We have both sacrificed so much time and energy. But I don’t want a partner jealous of how I grew up- something I cannot control. We have gone through some other big fights but mostly worked through them. My dad works beyond hard for everything so he can give me the world. Although I was finically taken care of, I underwent a lot of not great things growing up. My boyfriend has seen some of very bad things first hand, so I am hurt that he would pick that aspect of my life to be upset/jealous about. Although we are young, we both have many life experiences and are both quite mature. Ideally I want this to work out. Is this a relationship that can work out long term?

"Last year November I walked in on my boyfriend cheating on me. He explained he was coked out and didn’t mean it. He also said it was my fault he cheated due to us not being intimate enough… (Now I feel it was probably a mistake staying in the relationship)


Anyways switch to now, I think he’s cheating on me again but I cannot seem to get any definite proof. He works in tech and is very techy and knows to delete everything and use special apps. I suspect he is because there was an earring left in his room that was not mine. He explained it away as saying it was another girl in our group and it fell in the living room and wanted to hold onto it for her. I never found out whose earring it was. Now this week, while on a mushroom trip he gave me his phone to charge. Desperate to find prove of cheating or not I looked in his phone ( I know I shouldn’t I feel bad) and found a message he sent to a girl on a night I was out of town at 5am asking “wanna hang a bit more?”.

"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year in a half and things have been fantastic to say the least. We travel well, love the same stupid restaurants, cooking each other meals, spoiling each other with occasion-less gifts, and so much more. We both have talked about conquering the world together and how easy it would be. However, I haven't been the best partner when it comes to big steps in our relationship, namely the communication aspect. My gf has mentioned about how important having children is to her several times since we began dating. I decided in my early 20's that I would almost certainly remain childless for a multitude of reasons. Namely, some mental heath concerns that run in my family that I struggle with from time to time. I would want to be the absolute best father at all times and I'm not sure that I am capable of that with my struggles and that terrifies me. I've wavered on this decision at times over the last decade but the appeal of children never overcame my fears. When this conversation has been brought up in the past, I have told her that I most likely would not want kids but the door isn't completely closed. We kicked that can down the road for a bit...  
Tonight I told my gf in no uncertain terms that I don't see a future of us having kids. She is absolutely devastated and so am I. In her words, ""Having kids is my purpose in life..."". She went on explaining how much she loves me but feels slighted and hurt. She has had a history of somewhat abusive and manipulative partners and has confided in me that I am the love of her life and she has never been happier.... until tonight. She feels that her biological clock is ticking and it's now or never. She is questioning why she isn't deserving of children and is deeply hurt in general.  
I've apologized for not being forthright or enough for her while reassuring her of how much I love her and see our future together. I'm beginning to question that last part though as I don't want her to resent me. I'm unsure if she will break things off with me over this revelation. I question if I should rip the bandaid off myself to avoid her resenting me in the long run. I can't stress how much this all sucks. I love this woman so very much and I know she loves me just as hard. I don't want to hurt her. I don't know what to do right now.

Should I break things off with her in hopes she finds a partner that has the same life goals as her?

However, we are not being able to do so as we are extremely attached to each other.

"I 21F have been in two major relationships. One in high school/early college that lasted about four years, and another one that I’m in right now. My current boyfriend 23M and I have been together for about a year. FYI The gap between the two relationships was a little over a year.

In my first relationship, I had serious struggles with mental illness and some serious attachment issues. We were on and off for a while and it became very toxic (a lot on my behalf). So after we broke it off, I lived my single life (falling in love with myself and all that), developed some hobbies and, for once, really started focusing on myself. I also moved across the country, to where I met my current boyfriend.

In between the times of my first and second relationship, I also got prescribed medication that severely increased my quality of life and has really stabilized me for the past two years. I also go to therapy once a week, am part of and lead many extracurriculars with my university, I work out, play multiple sports, I have my dream job, and I’m helping start a business in a niche area I’m super passionate about. Objectively, I’m thriving.

So, what’s the issue? When I’m single, there was no trouble focusing on myself. I genuinely thought I really grew from how I behaved and dealt with emotions in my last relationship.

On too of that, for the year that my boyfriend and I have been together, things have been great. We barely fight, communicate well, and have a lot of fun together. 

For the past year, I have been completely consumed by my relationship. In my head, I would probably give my boyfriend about 75% of my thoughts when I’m not with him. I am constantly thinking about the next time I want to be with him. Every time I leave to go on break or vacation are usually have extreme stress, episodes, and cry or break down from anxiety. I try to keep it private, but I know he knows how bad these episodes get.

So that’s where my issue falls. I have literally done everything right to break the habits from the past and get better. Yet here I am, away from him just thinking about how much I want to be with him every single night that I’m gone. He is awesome and I love him but I also desperately want to think about other things. I want to enjoy my time away from him with my family and friends back home. I just don’t know what to do to get there anymore. Everywhere online says to get a hobby or focus on yourself but I literally do that. My therapist is great and has helped me so much, but doesn’t always have the answers. Hence, why I’m here.

"Met my gf in 2nd year, lived together for 2 years, dated for 4.

She found me at a really low point in my life. I lost my father to a violent crime, I never even got a chance to say goodbye.

She supported me through everything, her family is EXTREMELY wealthy, she basically paid for everything. We never worried about money or working at all.

I was infatuated with her. I spent every moment of us dating with her at all times. After my third year of school I took time off and fell back into depression, I started drinking regularly, and I also started eating insane amounts of food. I am 5'10 and was about 145lbs before I started dating her, and I went up to 190lbs.

I stopped hanging out with friends and I was ignoring my family.

She always kind of tried to say something, but I think she was too scared to confront me about my problems.

Eventually it just got to the point where she couldnt anymore and she told me she was done.

I was devastated obviously. I felt like I had actually nothing left. It took me a while, but I started going to the gym, I have completely stopped drinking, I have tried rekindling relationships with friends and family. I also just finished my final semester of schooling.

Im down to 157 lbs now, I feel a bit better and a lot healthier. However, in terms of friendships and my own career, I feel like its a lost cause.

I want to get back on track in my field of work, which is IT, but I have no clue where to even start with that, I have a bit of experience with internships and entry level jobs... but I honestly dont think thats enough.

okay so to start off, im very independent. yes i need help sometimes which is something that im completely okay with, but 90% of the time im fine on my own and im fine without help. recently my boyfriend has been coming over 5 times a week to sleep at my place and every time he leaves i’d get this gut wrenching feeling saying “oh shit, im alone now. what am i gonna do?” and i end up laying in bed the rest of the day not knowing what im going to do.

this time, it especially hurt. he usually gets out of class at 8:30, but today he’s getting out at 3:00. he also mentioned that tonight he’s going to be drinking at his dorm with his friends which is something thats totally fine but i cant help but feel a little uneasy all the time. not like gut-feeling uneasy but like lowkey hurt or just simply not wanting it to happen. and the fact that he didn’t mention wanting to stay here after his dismissal, hit me a little, but i decided not to say anything because maybe he feels too smothered by me.

ever since i was a kid, when i’d have a sleepover at my place and it was time for everyone to leave, i’d cry. when it was time for mom to leave, i’d cry. until around just two years ago, i wouldn’t cry but i’d do everything to keep my friends at my place even when it was time to leave, i’d do anything to let them enjoy. i was never allowed to go out much by myself (with friends) until the 7th grade, and ive never had a sleepover at someone elses place, even my own family’s. i think it’s somehow connected to my attachment issues. but nonetheless, like what am i experiencing and how can i fix this?",i (f18) feel too clingy towards my bf (m19),18mnbky,1703051362.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mnbky/i_f18_feel_too_clingy_towards_my_bf_m19/,

I’ve been with my partner since April of this year, and the relationship is great, but he sleeps a lot and I’ve grown worried about his habits. 

Apart from the usual 7-8 hours of sleep, he will sleep during the day. He doesn’t have a job but he does go and work out or volunteer several times a week. Almost every day, after he comes back from doing something, he will sleep for two to four hours. I have a hybrid schedule and he set up an office space in his room for me, but I can’t get on meetings when he’s asleep. That part isn’t a big deal but it is worth mentioning. 

We’ve had dates or events planned and he has missed them because he’s sleeping. I took him on a birthday trip to Tahoe and we missed our kayak rental cuz he was sleeping. 

I just want to spend time with him but it’s hard because I work and it seems like whenever I can spend time with him, he’s gone or he wants to sleep. 

He doesn’t have any health issues or depression, so I’m wondering if I’m just missing something or if there’s another possible cause. I don’t at all assume this is something he’s doing on purpose, and I don’t want to overreact or disrespect him.",How can I (25F) approach the issue of my partner (30M) always sleeping?,18mn8y8,1703051116.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mn8y8/how_can_i_25f_approach_the_issue_of_my_partner/,
"My girlfriend and I were together for 7 months. At the six month mark, we both left for college, and things were still going good, at least so I thought. About a month later, she flew in to vist me and I felt so in love with her during that visit that i cried 3 times because I was so scared to go back to college where I wouldnt be able to see her again for almost 2 months. Two days after that visit, I woke up one morning and felt absolutly nothing for her. Every drop of, what i thought was, love for her was gone. For two weeks straight, I cried all day everyday and was OBSSESSED with the thought of breaking up with her. I could not think of anything at all besides breaking up with her. I finally couldnt take it anymore and called her and told her that I didnt feel a connection between us anymore and we ended things. We both agreed that I probably needed therapy and that maybe I had some unresolved childhood trauma or abandonment issues that caused that complete switch to happen. Within a few days, we had started texting again more and more. Now we are back no almost normal communication and I cant take it anymore. It has been 3 month, I have been in therapy and getting better, but nothing between us has changed. Im starting to think maybe I never loved her and was just infatuated, which has been killing me. I thought I loved her and I thought I knew what love was, but I guess I didnt. I realized that this probably was something as simple as losing feelings/never loving her when I started thinking about old crushes again.

"I love him to bits and pieces but he's obviously depressed. He's not caring for himself. He's not keeping himself clean nor his stuff clean. I've brought it up a few times as a joke and seriously, he just says sorry or he's depressed or he feels like hes wasting his entire life working and just trying to decompress when he is home and never gets anything done/never happy. I suggested he come with me to my counselor and or get his own and he said maybe. Seemed very awkward. 

  He's very touchy and always wants sex but he has some issues staying up and lately it's a huge turn off Everytime I have to be like no go brush your teeth and or shower first lol. 

He's def not cheating, but somethings wrong maybe something he's not telling me? He doesn't tell me much details about things (like guys do) so he's vague. He has a decent amount of money saved ($14,000). he has friends we have a pretty healthy relationship. We rarely ever fight. Maybe he's depressed two of his friends are both getting married and or getting a home so maybe he feels behind? We live together been together for 4+ years.

 I gently suggested if he can't clean up maybe we should take a break for a week. Not break up not cheat. Just let me move back to my family home for a week or will that make things worse? I suggested and he got very emotional and upset but no change. I didn't follow through yet but it's only been about a week. 

I did sink a lot of my money into going on vacation for 9 days in Las Vegas, in October because I hoped this would help both of our depressed and feelings of burn out from work. I think it made it worse. At least for me I felt worse after lol. I want to fix this I really really love him but it's so gross I don't even wanna touch him. He isn't even putting his laundry in the bin. I do the chores since he works more days than me but he doesn't do anything now... I feel bad but ... What more can I do. He's my best friend. We are both clingy. I brought up maybe he isn't attracted to me bc I gained some weight and he said no he loves me. I started going to the gym anyway. No change....

Maybe it's something I'm doing. I do have my own issues and sometimes I think I'm a little too mean with my jokes but he never said anything about it. I've tried my best to not say anything mean(joke or not). Trying my best to be better.

"I was causally seeing a guy over the summer. We went out for dinner a few times and hangout at his apartment. He treated me well. We had really amazing chemistry, I can’t explain it. I very rarely feel as drawn to men as I was to him. 

We never slept together but I knew he wanted to. I never felt like the timing was right/I just didn’t feel ready. I moved away back to grad school in the Fall and our communication just kind of stopped (we were never big on texting back and forth to begin with except to ask how day was briefly etc and make plans). Neither of us really initiated talking after I moved, if we did speak a bit, it was all friendly. We’re both *very* career motivated people and I’m in an intense program and he’s in an intense job. But I still think about him here and there. 

I’m home for the holidays and am interested in seeing him again. I’m not sure if I want to sleep with him (really dependent on the vibes) but I’m also moving far away to start my career soon so I’m definitely not trying to initiate a relationship or anything.

Is it silly of me to reach out to him and ask him if he wants to see each other while I’m home for the holidays? Or I’m being delulu and if he was interested in me he would have made more of an effort to keep in touch while I was away at school?

"Together almost a year. I (39F) was friends with my bf (39M) for several years before we got together, but always in other cities, anywhere from 2-10 hours apart. We hung out in person maybe once every few years, but mostly would talk over text or online. I was always impressed by how empathetic he was towards me. I'm autistic, and he was usually in a relationship so I never had any idea he was attracted to me. I visited him about a year ago and the chemistry went off like a rocket. We did the long distance thing for a while, visiting every other month, but then circumstances brought us next door to each other about two months ago. I fell for him really hard and fast...at least it seemed that way. I really want to make this work. He tells me often he doesn't know what he'd do without me. 

We both have mental health issues, carry a lot of emotional baggage, so we have problems and have had fights, but we try to work through them. What worries me is I don't know if I can/would/should get comfortable with the difference in his worldview. I didn't realize how different it was to mine until we were together every day. It didn't occur to me it would be a problem because it just never came up all those years. I come from a religious/love your neighbor/be kind to strangers type of upbringing. I walk away from confrontation with strangers, I taught myself to be curious instead of escalating when customers are huffy at me, etc. Basically, I taught myself that A. It's not about me as a person, B. People have reasons to be upset and/or C. They are just miserable people and I don't have to engage. My boyfriends view is very different. He, ""takes no shit,"" from anyone. He yells at employees if he thinks they are treating him unfairly, flips people off on the road semi regularly, has no qualms getting into a cussing match with the bitchy neighbor. But I would just walk away. He says he treats people how they deserve, and retaliation is how he keeps people from walking all over him. I try to explain eye-for an eye makes the whole world blind and that kind of attitude isn't good for his health (it literally will make you physically sick) but he insists he's correct on this. 

I have a hard time respecting him every time it happens. It's a weird feeling because I still love him but I don't know if I can live with that kind of chaos in my life. He's never cussed or yelled at me. I know it stems from being yelled at and abused as a kid, but even his logic agrees with his viewpoint. It's not like he just loses his temper. There's just no empathy for people he doesn't know who he perceives as rude, and is easily triggered. I know I can't change him. I wouldn't want him to resent me anyhow for trying to. I'm torn.

TLDR: boyfriend cheated and is begging for me back 


We've been together for 3.5 years, everything was perfect. Great communication, lots of love, etc.

It all started when he told me out of the blue he needed to take time to himself to ""fight his demons
He said he was dragging me down and that he didn't deserve me. He said he was having a mental breakdown and suicidal ideations. I believed him but I begged for him to stay, trying my hardest to convince him we could work through it together and I'd be there for him every step of the way. But he was dead set on leaving me to figure it out on his own. I was so afraid he was going to hurt himself, it was really bad. We had to tell our landlord that we're moving out, so I also had to deal with getting rid of the apartment while simultaneously mourning my relationship and praying for his safety. Things were seemingly normal after that, considering the circumstances. But then I saw he rented a hotel room. I confronted him about it and he claimed he had anxiety about sleeping at the apartment alone (we still have it, in the process of moving out) and that he was going there with his buddy. It was one king sized bed but I brushed it off because I trusted him. As the week went on we still talked and exchanged ""I love yous"". Until finally he couldn't handle the guilt anymore, and he admitted to cheating on me. He flirted with his coworker while we were together and would hang out with her, then he schemed having a mental breakdown just to leave me to fuck her. He manipulated me into thinking he was going to kill himself all for some pussy. Ever since he confessed he's been love bombing me and trying to get me back. I keep telling him I need space but he won't respect my boundaries. He's writing my parents letters, buying me flowers, posting publicly about becoming a better person, and saying all the things I wanted to hear for the last 3.5 years.

"My boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) have been dating for over a year and a half now. We both were expat sudents in a foreign country. He graduated early this year (2023) and stayed with me in the country, until now. I still have one semester left and will only be graduating next year (2024) in the summer. He has been thinking of leaving the country for a long time now and finally decided to leave for good. His flight was last week. I took him to the airport, we said our goodbyes and since then we’ve been doing long distance with him back in his hometown and me still in the foreign country.

He left because he wants to find a job back home and earn some money, and he doesn’t want to live in this country anymore. He said he loves me and the time spent with me was the happiest he has ever been, so it’s not that he doesn’t love me anymore or something. He seems to be happy to be back home and is not coming back for sure.

However, I am not coping well. Ever since I found out he has decided to leave Ive been dreading the day he would leave and crying about it months in advance. And now that it has become reality, I am really not doing well. I have been crying daily, feel very depressed and I am anxious, constantly. I am unmotivated, uninspired and feel like giving up on everything - my school, my hobbies, upcoming projects. I feel very nauseous all the time, which is why I barely eat, and most nights I am suffering from insomnia. I have never experienced something like this ever before.

All the while, it’s not like we broke up. We do text each other when we can, sometimes do video calls and even play PC games, but I feel like I am grieving the relationship. We have been pretty codependent, constantly texting, being there for each other, and basically living together ever since we started dating. Now that he is not here, I am very very unhappy and lonely. I miss him being here with me, I miss his touch and support, and everything reminds me of the time we spent together. There’s also a 14h time difference which limits our interactions. :( I am having very dark thoughts and I really don’t want to feel like this anymore.

Well his love language is physical touch, so this has caused issues over the years for us. He may not even be putting pressure on me, but I feel pressured any way and won't want to do anything or show physical affection.

We've been married for 3 years now, and have a 2 year old now to add in to the mix, but my own sexual issues of 11 years now is really causing marital issues, and not fights. My husband doesn't put any pressure on me, doesn't get mad at me, genuinely and honestly communicates his feelings.

I can't afford therapy so that's out the window and I'm asking the people of Reddit for some help. Sorry. I know therapy would be the wise decision, but can't pay for it.

I should just start out. I am a loyal, faithful wife (F23) to my husband (M28) I have never had any intimate moments with either of these two friends. We just got married a few months ago and the dynamic in our friend group feels like that it shifted since then. especially the other week. 

We went over to have our typical game night play, Mario kart, and a few other things, when all the sudden’s two best friends tend to get more touchy with me, I don’t think any thing of it. The one best friend he taller (J M27) then me comes up to me give me a big hug and spins me around when we arrived. then, throughout the night, they both would find reasons to touch me like their hands on my shoulder, giving me a hug every now and then if I can get a little butt hurt over a game.

 Where I find it a little more weird was at one point my husband’s best man (B M27) who he considers a brother more than a best friend just casually puts his hand on my knee throughout one of our card games we decided to do while taking a break from Mario kart. I don’t think anything of it until later on in the evening when he does it again, but a little higher than my knee now I care deeply for this friend. I consider him a brother technically more like a second husband because we’ve all made that’s joke when I got married to my husband I was marrying the two best friends as well.

 I don’t know something just rub me the wrong way about it. It didn’t make me uncomfortable, but I also don’t know how to bring it up to my husband or even ask them about it. Any advice I love all of them and don’t want friendships, ruined and I definitely don’t want my marriage ruined if my husband starts noticing these things and I’m not saying anything about it.

"my boyfriend says tattoos are a major turn off for him and his opinion of them is so negative that he cannot force himself to tolerate them on the person he is dating. 

i already have a tattoo of my birth mother’s handwriting (i was adopted) from a letter she wrote me when i was born. it is located and goes across the length of the inside of my bicep, but it’s small writing (korean) and only two lines long. when i got it a couple years ago, he was very upset and we had negative tension in the relationship for about three months because of it. he said it made him sick to his stomach to see it and that it “looked like a sleeve tattoo” (to be honest if i have my arms down to my side, you don’t even see it so it really is not anything close to a “sleeve”)… he also sent me an article of someone else talking about how they find women uglier when they have tattoos, even if they are small ones. i was super hurt by this and even 3 years later, it bothers me that he sent that. he was just trying to justify that other people saw tattoos in the same way he sees them, but it felt like a jab at me. it felt like proving he’s “right” was more important than how it might make me feel to be sent an article about how i’m basically ugly to him now that i got a tattoo, which by the way has a huge significance to me.. he did apologize and said he was just angry and that it wasn’t the right thing to do/send. i get it though, it’s a defense mechanism to try and justify ones feelings. 

it didn’t really stop there, though, because even when i thought we were past it, he would point it out for literally no reason. like we were at a halloween party and it was themed, so we had to dress like characters from the 20’s or something. and my arms were showing and he decided to point out my tattoo and say that “people from back then wouldn’t have that”… it was just unnecessary. so really, it’s not that he just doesn’t prefer people with tattoos or that he wouldn’t get one himself, and if i got another one it wouldn’t just be that he’s not a fan of it — rather, he would make me feel bad about it for a long time. 

i have always wanted more tattoos. nothing huge or crazy, just small/dainty ones. i would consider myself an artistic person. i like tattoos. i think they’re cool/aesthetically pleasing. they feel like a way to express myself. i don’t really need a “reason” to get something tattooed, it’s just that i think it’s cute or maybe it resonates with me in a small way (not the same as my first and only tattoo). like if i were to get my zodiac sign tattooed on me, it resonates but it’s not like THAT significant.  

he said if the long term happiness i would get from having a tattoo would “outweigh” his negative feelings about them, then i “can get some.” but that comparison cannot logically be calculated. and to me, i don’t need a tattoo to live my life, it’s mundane and superficial — again, i just like them. but i think that comparing my happiness with the tattoo isn’t the right approach, it’s more just my happiness with being able to express myself. but i can’t really feel comfortable doing that because of how it will make him feel in return. 

it’s a matter of personal opinion versus personal opinion. i personally dont see tattoos in the negative way he does, and he doesn’t see them in the positive way that i do. i can understand objectively that it’s just a personal preference to him, and that’s literally fine. you can hate or love tattoos, it doesn’t really matter to me unless somehow those views are being pushed onto me in a way that i don’t feel comfortable with. i’ve asked him if he would breakup with me for getting one and he said he would not but that he would just find me less attractive. 

i know it’s also a matter of: he’s expressed his view. i’ve expressed mine. i have the choice/free will to go against his wishes. he has the choice to leave me for it or make me feel bad about it for the rest of our lives. 

i want to compromise with him. i’ve been buying those fake tattoos from ink box and even cheaper ones from amazon that last like a day, just to play around with them. I don’t know if that counts as a good compromise. he’s okay with me buying the fake ones and messing around with them. but i still really want more tattoos. i don’t want a ton. i don’t want anything huge. i have one idea in mind and its just a small vine wrapped around my wrist to look kind of like a bracelet. but i can’t help but feel like im still suppressing a part of myself by not getting more real tattoos, because thats what i want and what ive always wanted even since i was little lol. my desire to have them is probably about as strong as his disdain for them. 

what’s a good idea to compromise with him to where i dont feel like im getting the short end of the stick. i’ve seen online some people say maybe i could just get them for special occasion (like my birthday), and honestly id be satisfied with that and i dont even think id get a tattoo on every single birthday either. because, again, i dont want a lot and it takes me a while to be confident in what i like/want. i honestly haven’t even wanted one for the past 3 years since getting my first/only tattoo. but i don’t know if getting a permanent tattoo would be a reasonable compromise for his end either","my (23f) boyfriend (24m) doesn’t want me to get any tattoos, but i want them. what’s a good compromise?",18mmsyr,1703049610.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18mmsyr/my_23f_boyfriend_24m_doesnt_want_me_to_get_any/,

"I am aware this makes me seem like an a-hole, but right now I do not know what to do.

My girlfriend is Asian and an only child. She loves her family but they often make her very depressed/cry because they can be very insensitive. The last two years or so her family has been making comments about her being cheap, etc. because she’s gotten promotions but doesn’t give them money, buy them expensive things, or take care of them. She also visits them less often than she used to. 

This has made my girlfriend horribly sad, which I hate with a burning passion. I wish I could yell and scream at her family for making her feel this way. Supposedly it seems like, in their culture, when the younger ones make money they are supposed to be very generous to their elders. 

Unfortunately, I have always had a hard time with money. I am very frugal and have an ok job, but certainly don’t make 90k+ yet. In today’s day and age, affording kids can be challenging. Let alone trying to save for kids AND being generous to elders. I feel like I would have a hard time having us constantly give them money and gifts, taking them out for dinners every weekend, etc. I also already resent her family so much because of how horrible they can make her feel.

Here is where I am the a-hole I guess. My girlfriends great, but I see this as never ending (unless we start giving them $$ and gifts) and I feel like it sort of makes us incompatible, as it will just be a perpetual area of conflict and sadness.

"They’ve only known each other for 6 months, I’d say they both have bipolar/borderline personality disorder traits. My sister was diagnosed with bipolar when she had a mental breakdown and lost her marriage/job/apartment/401k/etc 10 years ago. She has repeated the pattern with her current boyfriend and baby daddy. She cheated and has been serial dating (like trips/cruises/48hr dates) with a revolving door of men. Her pattern is lovebomb each other, take trips together, get so toxic she needs to dive in with another man to get over the last one. 

That was the exact situation with this guy she met in June. They began dating but she liked someone else and took someone else on a trip at the end of August. At this time and mid September, this man harassed her, messaged her friends on social media, called her boss, etc. they got back together in October and had been dating since. She spends 5 nights a week with him (not at home with her kid) and pays for hotel rooms and stopped paying her mortgage and all bills. They took a trip after thanksgiving that ended in her coming back home and getting a temporary protective order against him. But of course as soon as that ended she went right back to him. 

Now this man is a walking harasser. He has multiple restraining orders against him by ex girlfriends, my sister is not the first. He’s got a slew of offenses on top of all 5+ restraining orders. In October when I found it all out I called her out on it and asked how she could skip out on her kid’s sports activities to play step mom to his kids and try to incorporate this dangerous man into her kids life. I also said that I love her and we can get her the help she needs. I know I came in hot, but I cant fathom how she can put herself in this situation and neglect her kid like she has been. 

Needless to say we haven’t talked since. Well now she is back with him and I’m scared for her  wellbeing. Mental, physical, emotional, legal, etc. she doesn’t see an issue when she’s with him. 

I know I can’t make her do anything when she doesn’t see anything wrong. I also don’t want to turn a blind eye and make it seem like what she is doing is okay. There is so much more than this guy.

On the request of his first love (he claims he no longer has feelings), he and her went to get boba alone in the late evening (6 pm). He told me this before he went, meaning I was fully aware they were going on an outing, though I didn’t expect it to be so late in the evening.

After, a while at around 7:30 pm I checked his location out of curiosity (we both share our locations with each other), and he was in his apartment. I didn’t think anything of it.

" We've been together 5 years. We have drastically different styles of what sex should be and how one should approach it. I can work on either two modes: romance me and set a mood, then ask me for NSFW things, or tackle me out of the blue, I'm down. 

But it's like he picks the worst of both worlds- he springs out of the blue ""do you want me to, uh, so some things with my fingers?"" Or ""how about we get in bed and do some things?"" Like no, I'm stone cold right now, there is zero action happening here. But he has the sweetest genuine smile, and he's just trying to get consent and initiate foreplay, *why* does that feel so awful to me? 

I have a very weird relationship with sex- love it, will do it all the time, but you have to come in assertive and confident, or I panic like a nervous horse. It also doesn't help that he's started working nightshifts, so sometimes I see him so little he's like a roommate I don't know and barely see.

I cannot do the questions before hand. I can't do the slow brushing fingers over my skin, testing the boundaries. It feels like nails on chalkboard to me and I immediately want to cry or pick a fight- which is often what I used to end up doing before a lot of internal work this year.

How do I tell him that I need him to either come on strong or not at all? Without making him feel pressured to act a way he wasn't want, or like I'm trying to change him? If we're not compatible, we might not be, but for now I want to bridge this communication gap and then see where we're at.

When he wants me to do something I don’t want to do, he’ll beg me until I say yes and if I don’t he’ll say things like “whatever i don’t care this is why i don’t comfort you” or “yea now i won’t do anything for you just wait till you cry again” or “if you don’t do *thing he wants* you’re not going to like me when i get home.” I cry a lot nowadays because I feel like he doesn’t like me.

Days without kissing or hugging, and we don’t even cuddle when we sleep together. I try to be intimate (kissing hugging cuddling etc) and he always turns me down or gives me a quick peck with a huff and an eye roll. he won’t tell me what happened and denies any shift in the way he treats me. he didn’t used to be so mean; he used to be incredibly sweet and give me paragraphs in texts telling me how much he loved me and everything he loved about me and wanted to accomplish with me. it seems like he’s done a complete 180; it’s even got to the point where he’s pushed me down a few times during fights. he usually wants to ignore me or make slide, hurtful comments to make me upset and then blame me crying on me “wanting attention”. he’s caught me asking for advice before and got angry saying that i’m just making him feel bad and accused me of lying about the things that he’s done. even two seconds after he’s done something he’ll deny it, and when i get upset because i know i’m not crazy he gets even more upset and just says “i give up” and stops talking to me. i feel like a lot of times he’ll say things just to make me upset or hurt my feelings because even when i say something that’s just “hey you did this and it kinda sucked for me” he’ll get extremely upset and angry with me and threaten to tell my mom secrets i’ve told him, kick me out, or tell my mom about me hurting myself.

On top of it, every other year we have gone to spend Christmas Day with his family (3 hours away) and stayed over night, but this year they are doing Christmas 1 day early, so I can't go because I'll still be working. This annoys him a lot because (1) he's always bugging me to find a better job with. more flexibility (and I've tried but not been successful so far), and (2) now we won't spend Christmas together (I can't go out on Christmas Eve day and stay over).

  
He's very angry with me and I don't know what to do. I can't cancel on my friends (non-refundable plus it's my one friend's 30th birthday and really important to her). And I can't get out of working Christmas Eve unless I quit, which obviously I don't want to do.

  
He keeps talking like if we don't spend the holidays together then maybe it's better if we just let this relationship go. I am getting angry with him because he's the one who broke up with me in October and I warned him that if he really meant it then I'd act single.

"I'm a 32 F dating a 33 M for the last four years. I've been reluctant to post but I'm just super desperate at this point. Please be gentle. I've already heard the ""just leave him"" remarks and I feel like this is more complex and I truly want to grow as a human. 

4 years ago, I met my current SO at a trivia night. I met his friend group and sister. For a year we ended up all hanging out every week for trivia as friends as a group. Then me and my SO developed feelings for each other and the entire dynamic shifted. His sister became possessive and wanted to be invited to romantic events (e.g. our private vacations, date nights going to the theater, etc.). As I learned more about my SO, I found out he is severely dyslexic and was in special education his whole life. He had his parents essentially make all his decisions including his career. His sister helped him manage his bank account and bills. I'm a speech-language pathologist and work with clients all the time in building independent skills, so I taught him how to use OCR technology and text to speech/speech to text to help him build his independence to the point where he no longer needed to call his sister for help, which made her upset. 

Fast forward to months later and the sister completely iced me out of the original trivia group by making a new text group and having hangouts without me. It got to the point where a whole trip was planned without me, and my SO lied to me about who was going. Me and him broke up during that time because I felt like I couldn't keep up with this whole situation and relationship he had with his sister. It was becoming toxic. 

A few months later he wanted to get back with me saying he wanted to cut his sister out because he realized how weird it was. I said ok that's fine but how will that impact our future with your family. He said don't worry about it, and I kept pushing to talk through it but he avoided it. 

Well, months later his birthday came along and I threw a mini party for him and obviously I didn't invite the sister. She found out, then put me in a large group chat with a lot of mutual friends and the original friend group calling me out for not inviting them, saying I was selfish and immature ( I mean really a lot of things you'd expect someone to do in high school). So my SO blew up at her saying shes dead to him and to lose his number. This evidently caused a huge rift in his whole family dynamic where his parents (who I never met at the time) were upset etc. there was a huge strain because my SO stopped talking to his parents then as well, yet he didn't really express much to me how he felt besides saying he wanted to be with me. 

So we kept trying to make it work. The next thing that happened was his sister started hanging out and becoming best friends with his ex girlfriend of 7 years and his ex best friend who stole the ex girlfriend away from him. My SO felt powerless. Then he started trying to talk to his parents about me to have them meet me but they refused due to the sister not liking me. We tried proposing neutral territory like a restaurant to have a meal or even cooking for them but they refused nearly all attempts but one. When they did come, they said they had a good time but after I asked to plan another time to meet they declined. My SO voiced his concern saying things like why won't you get to know her, what happens if we get married or have kids etc. and they said well we will be there, and he said not if you are disrespectful and not involved in our life. They ignored the issue countless times by changing the subject and flat out just bypassing his remarks, belittling him. 

I was getting tired of the situation because my SO eventually said a year later that he would have trouble commiting to me due to family. I, in a fit of selfishness and yearn for control, suggested that he set a boundary. They continuously asked for his help on handyman type projects and he always obliged. I suggested to do a trade where he can provide the service and then we can all go out to eat. They refused, ignored his request, and would follow up a month later asking for the same service. We hit a breaking point where he said he was being pulled in so many directions and we ended it last year in the summer.

Months later in September we found ourselves trying again and trying to outline what we found to be important to us

Since then, I tried to make amends with his sister. She was resistant to moving on and said I would never be welcome at the dinner table, and both me and my SO (her brother) would be immediately cut out if she ever had a kid. I shared this with my SO and it hurt him because he didn't realize how he was also being cut out. His birthday came along and he asked for his parents to meet with me for a breakfast and they did agree. Upon meeting them, it was as if nothing ever happened. They were cordial and non threatening. However, this thanksgiving I asked if we could meet on another day besides Thanksgiving to celebrate and they declined. Christmas is a week away, and they are not budging to meet.

Due to this drama, my SO has made remarks like ""some days I want to marry you and others I don't,"" ""I fear of failing so I don't want to commit,"" ""I'm worried about my family."" All of these are valid, but they do hurt because I feel like I am trying so hard to build this bridge but the sentiment is not mutual. 

Part of me feels like it's a character flaw of mine to not be able to essentially let go of the situation and let my SO see them and talk to them and celebrate with them because I want to do things as a unit (if that means splitting time, fine). But no accomodations are being made by his family which tears both of us apart in our own ways. Ive been in therapy working on this and just trying to let go of the situation and wanting to gain their approval (which I know doesn't matter) but I can't help feeling this defensiveness when thinking about bringing life into this unstable dynamic. I also can't protect future children from all the atrocities of the world, but I do wonder if it is fair to want a level of stability. Other points to consider are that his dad has severe struggles with alcoholism and doesn't remember conversations he has with my SO and it is so bad that the mom sometimes lives with the sister. So besides being black listed from family events, I worry even if my future kids had some relationship with them without me there that they would be exposed to his symptoms of alcoholism (yelling at family, belittling family, etc.). 

I'm at my breaking point. There is so much more I could talk about but that's my summary. I fear that my SO will come to resent me for placing restrictions on his access to his family. I'm confused as to why he doesn't feel the inherent desire to stand up for us as a unit, but I also acknowledge that he might not have dealt with this before and might not have the tools. 

We are both in therapy as well. It's been hit or miss helping.

Has anyone had a similar experience? How do you navigate something like this? Is this a lost cause?

"So, as the title suggests, I find this guy I've seen around attractive, and after I posted on Instagram, he messages me saying he likes my style, so I take... 8 hours to respond back, because it's not every day that someone you like messages you, so I say ""Hey, thank you"" and compliment him back. But it has been two days and he hasn't opened my message, despite being active on Instagram frequently and posting on his story. I'm terrible at social cues; should I just keep waiting? Do I give up? Do I hit him up once more time, or is that too desperate...? God!! This is just messing around with my head, he messaged me first and seems to be disregarding everything. I know it might have been nothing more than a simple compliment, but couldn't he at least open the message? So, how do I regain his attention so that we can have a conversation?

"Hello!

I have been dating my girlfriend for about 4 months now. This is her first lesbian relationship and honestly really her first very physical/sexual relationship from what I gathered from our conversations about previous sexual experience. I’m also chronically ill, so to be fair, she doesn’t always know when I will feel well enough to be able to have sex. I know body hair is perfectly natural and everyone has the right to keep theirs if they want to. But even on the times that we plan ahead to have sex, and I make sure all my body hair is taken care of, she always ends up saying “I haven’t shaved just to let you know.” This happened twice. This last time she asked me if I minded…like right before everything was going to get started…at that point I don’t know how to say…”yeah sorry, can you just go nip in the bath and shave that puss real quick?” Right in the heat of the moment. 

Is there a gentle way I can tell her that I find it sexier when I don’t have a bunch of hair in my mouth? She’s a little bit of a bigger girl too so I’m already working with a more pungent labia. Which I honestly don’t mind the smell as much as I really do mind the hair. 

Idk, any advice would be so helpful!
I love this girl, and if the hair has to stay, it totally can, it’s just I’d rather it skedaddle.

"Tl;Dr bf thinks i have trust issues because i dont want his female 'friend' texting him asking about me

&amp;#x200B;

We have been together for about a year and a half now, but i have caught him in a few lies. i mostly considered it being due to his certain insecurities and that its not a major red flag.Recently we had an argument due to a lady he used to hangout with (who also happens to be his insurance agent) texting him, asking about me. she asked ""does she work at mcdonalds"". This pissed me off because for one thing, it sounds condescending, mainly because i just graduated this year with my bachelors in a stem field. secondly, i didnt understand why she was so curious about me. And thirdly, why she felt comfortable enough to text him asking about me in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He always says 'he doesn't talk to her' except for stuff relating to his insurance, which im OK with. Im pretty sure he gets some kind of discount going through her, and I should mention that according to him, she really wanted a relationship with him but he didnt feel the same way about her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When we first started dating, i found her stalking my social media's (she viewed my story that he was in) and she texted him bitterly pointing it out to him. that raised eyebrows for me, since as a woman, i would only do that about a man i felt owed me loyalty.

&amp;#x200B;

so after she texted him, i was shocked and i told him 'lets call her! she is so curious let her ask these questions and find out from the source!"" he refused to call her and told me to call her since i ' know her number'. i left his house that night, absolutely pissed. he then proceeded to turn it around on me and saying that i still keep in contact with my daughters father, even though he doesn't financially provide for her. i told him that hes comparing apples to oranges. I have ties to my daughters father, and i have always been ok with his daughters mother. but this lady he has absolutely no ties to and still keeps in contact with her, and has been friendly enough to make her feel comfortable asking about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I avoided seeing him for a week, and on my birthday he never texted me. days later he tried to guilt trip me about how he had a gift for me. we had a lot of back and forth and he doesnt see things my way about how he was wrong for allowing this lady to be so comfortable with him. he told me i need counseling for my trust issues, but i told him i never worried about him cheating, it was more about my respect and how he portays our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i told him if he doesnt plan on us being together then to stop texting me and dont check in on me. since then hes texted me dozens of times and says that us being friends and hanging out as friends is better than not existing to each other.im hurt right now because i feel like i didnt over react and he just refuses to be wrong, and now we arent together. It feels like im not being validated but its my fault were not togehter. He says we can never be on that same level again until i get my trust issues figured out. I miss him and our relationship.

We hit it off online just a month ago, FaceTiming 24/7, even falling asleep together. Met up a bunch of times, and things were amazing.

"Hi all,

My girlfriend of a few years wants me to message her on wherever I'm going/what I'm doing throughout the day even when she's busy at work. This includes outings/events with other people regardless of gender (which I can completely understand and agree with), where I'll be working each day as my work location changes (which I can also understand), but also more minor/daily things such as getting a haircut, shopping for groceries, or eating out by myself. Personally I don't think giving updates (especially the smaller daily tasks) throughout the day is necessary when they could just be talked about at home at the end of the day (we live together).

I'm not sure if this affects the situation but for some extra context, I have had issues with communication in the past where I haven't updated her on some bigger things when I told her I would stay in touch, and I've also had occasions where my phone was on silent and she wasn't able to contact me. Previously I haven't consistently updated her on what I would be doing (big or small) throughout the day, however after talking about it I have started to update her more on the bigger things.

While I agree with updating your partner when you'll be out with other people or a change in circumstance (e.g. different work location), what are your opinions on updating your partner on the smaller things throughout the day (considering we can just mention these later when we're together at home)? Does my history of inconsistent communication for the bigger things affect this? Is this standard among most relationships or just something that depends on the dynamics of the relationship and maybe require some form of compromise, and if so do you have any suggestions?

We met online a month ago and quickly became friends. We would FaceTime 24/7, I mean fall asleep on FaceTime, call each other when we woke up and even stayed on FaceTime when we went out to meet our friends. After a week, we met up in person for the first time and things went really well, he was really cute and sweet. We met up 3 more times after that and it was just as great. The last time I saw him, he told me he loved me. I said jokingly ""if you love me, why aren't we dating?"". He said he thought we already were since I had been calling him my man. I then said ""you never asked me out so we're not dating"". Then he asked me out for real and I said yes. It was very sudden but I was really excited since it was my first relationship. Even though it had only been a month of us knowing each other, I felt a lot of chemistry between us. That night he didn't message me at all, which was strange because he did every single night. I know it wasn't a big deal but I'm an over thinker. I started to think that now were were official, he didn't like me anymore but my friends reassured me that it was no big deal. The next night, I phoned him and we were talking but then I asked him if he thought I was too clingy because that was still in my head from the day before. At first he replied ""no comment"" and then after I asked him again he said ""a bit"". I was a bit upset I can't lie but I decided I would try to be less clingy. However, ever since then, his replies have been very detached and short so I texted him this morning asking if he was annoyed at me and he said he was just really busy with work and I said okay and brushed it off. Later on, I went on snapchat and I couldn't see his name in my chats. I realised that he blocked me and not just on snapchat, but on every other social media. I phoned him to ask him what was going on and I found out he blocked my number as well. I'm just very confused because we are dating, or at least we were, I have no idea.

"

My brother is an idiot. Let's get that out of the way first and foremost. He essentially pulled a royal family. But to give you some context. 

My cousin's (Michael) wife (31F) is from Jamaica. She came to Australia 10 years ago for university. She met my brother at university and they've been together for 6 years. They were married 3 years ago. Had a baby girl back in June of this year. Back in October, ""Jaz"" parents came from Jamaica to meet their grand daughter. My cousin helped them fly out here as a surprise for his wife. We had bbq where our family got to spend time with her parents. Got to know each other a little better. 

This is when my brother thought it would be a good idea to say to Ben (Mike's brother / our cousin) "" I'm glad the baby has light skin, she'd get bullied in school for having a white dad"". Now he claims he was drunk when he said it. This got exactly the reaction you'd think it would from a new uncle / Mike's s brother. They started to argue outside. That's when Mike went outside to see what was going on and he found out what my brother said. It caused a massive falling out. Mike has not spoken to my brother since. He's not spending Christmas with us because his parents wants to spend it with the wider family. He's doing his own thing and wants to be left alone. He said Jaz just wants it to be the three of them this year. No exceptions. 

I'm still pretty close to Mike. We text every day. My parents are putting the screws to me every time we talk to facilitate my brother to talk to Mike. Mike wants absolutely nothing to do with him. They think it's the reason why Mike isn't coming. And because I'm the closest to him, they think that I can somehow bring the peace to the two of them. But it's also my brother who wants another chance to explain himself. And it's just very hard to explain to him over and over again just why it's not possible.

How do you actually navigate a family situation like this? Because no matter what direction i go in, leave it alone or do as they ask.

"TL DR 
I blocked my soulmate. We both loved each other a lot, and it wasn’t because of us that it ended.

We lived together for 6 years since the dawn of our relationship and first separated 4 or so months ago to see if we could work on ourselves separately, we found that we had gotten complacent in our own ways. We were making progress, slowly but we enjoyed the company of each other a lot more.

While still saw each other every weekend (Saturday 16th dec), last weekend her best friend was over and decided to demeaningly talk me down on how I’ll never change and how I’m not getting any help (therapy, medical, physical) and that most of the problems in my relationship was my fault. This rant lasted over an hour, I stood in silence and acknowledged the conversation while reiterating, when I could, how I have been working on making change. From doing part time work (6hrs) while going to school (5hrs) and finding an apartment (which I got offered on Monday) and commuting 3 1/2 hours (150 miles) a day. 

I know I have flaws and it is the reason I decided that we should separate and work on ourselves because I was unhappy with the person I was becoming. I wanted to work on that to be the best version of myself for her.

She had this conversation with my SO there in front of us and she never defended me, it made me feel extremely disappointed. Personally, I felt disrespected as this isn’t her (SO’s bff) relationship to be talking the way she did and stepped way out of line.

She left after a few hours and then I left shortly saying ‘goodbye’ to my SO before walking away. 

My girlfriend apologized in her behalf the next day and said that she was out of line and all but the fact she didn’t stand up for me while it was happening, hurt more than the words her friend said to me.

I told her that it would be better off if we went our separate ways because the way she didn’t say anything while it happens was proof that I have in fact not changed.

The friend also texted asking to meet up for her to apologize but then I blocked them both. 

She called me 10 minutes ago from her brothers phone number and left a voicemail on how she really wants to apologize for not sticking up for me and if we could talk on the situation that unfolded. 

If you were in my position, what would be the proper  way of resolving this?

I really thought I’d live my whole life with this person, and I’m not sure why I reacted the way I did.

(Since 2015) We’ve been through a lot. He has put me through a lot like cheating, lying, manipulating, stealing, sabotaging everything I work hard for, from him becoming addicted to drugs, to us even becoming physical with each other.(which I hated with everything) It’s like he turned me into a person I never once was. I’ve done things I’m not proud of too but never as bad as he has. 2 years ago his drug addiction was getting so bad. He chased me around the house with a knife once. I had no choice but to call the cops on him. They did a restraining order. So at that point. I told him he can stay at his mothers house until he gets some help. So he did. We were working on fixing everything in a mature way but then it came to light that he got someone pregnant behind my back.(someone I knew and who I spoken to about him) I didn’t find out till she was about 5 months. It was the day before my birthday. I was heart broken and then the way he reacted afterwards was terrible. He treated me like I deserved it and he didn’t care. (I will upload a screenshot of what was the first thing he said when I found out) I went no contact and that’s when he started begging for me back. Saying he made a mistake. We never really got back together after that but he does come over all the time and spends the night a few nights out of the week because he wants to work it out. He cut ties with the other girl because he wants a dna test. Since she admitted she had a boyfriend too around the time they were having sex. So she was really wasn’t sure it was his to begin with. I keep pushing him to get a dna test and he stalling. Idk why. He says he wants to go to court instead. She says she wants one but when she’s ready. My thing is that child is a year old already. We all deserve to know the truth to move forward but they are both stalling the test. He got sober now. He went to a program for 3 months. He’s been doing good. Ge says because he has his little family by his side that it’s his motivation to stay that way. Anyways that whole situation broke me and I honestly feel like I’m betraying myself by even giving him an oz of my attention. I feel like him now getting sober and doing good is a little too late.

I asked my mother for advice and she says I can’t leave that I need to be there for him since he can turn back to drugs over this.

So I can be able to take her to her appointments and be there to help her but to deal with him no. I just want to move on. Work on myself and heal the pain he caused me.

"Conflicted and not sure what to do.

I [31F] had a best friend [25M] for years. We met at work and hit it off almost instantly. We started working out 6 days a week together for 6 months and in this time I developed feelings for him. I confessed, he didn’t feel the same. We remained friends but he started dating someone else but would still spend every second of his work days flirting with and talking to me. To the point where people were suspicious that we were actually together. This got to be too painful for me bc I had genuine feelings and didn’t appreciate being toyed with. There was some drama and I ended up leaving the place where we worked to get away from him (not in a restraining order kinda way, just in a ‘I need to move on with my life’ kinda way). 

Anyway, we didn’t speak for 2 months after I quit, during which time him and his GF had broken up. Even though neither of us had reached out to the other I had heard thru the grapevine that he was showing up at my new job periodically hoping to run into me (I worked in a restaurant). He never reached out to me in this time. 

One day he texted me out of the blue and said he got a job at the restaurant I worked at. I was hesitant to let him back into my life. He came up to me and said he and his gf broke up and that he missed me a lot. We ended up standing by our cars after his first shift catching up for 3 hours. Tbh I missed him terribly. 

Anyway, fast forward a year and we are closer than ever but he still didn’t want to date. We would talk all day everyday (one time spent 10 hours on the phone), he would take me out for expensive dinners, every time one of our friends hosted something, he would pick me up and we would show up together. The question became from everyone around us “when are you guys going to finally get together?” He was my rock when I went thru one of the hardest and lowest times of my life. I’ve told him things about myself that I’ve never told anyone. He made me feel so safe. 

I eventually got sick of being in a pseudo romance with someone I truly loved and he for whatever reason couldn’t reciprocate. I told him in October that we both needed a little space and I wished him well. It’s been 8 weeks and I’ve truly grown for the better. I miss our friendship so much and want to reach out but he hasn’t attempted to reach out to me.

"My partner and I have been together for 5 years and previously dated back in HS for 2 years. Known each other for a total of 10 years. He’s told me multiple times he was in love with me. That he loves me more than I love him. Recently, I’ve been thinking about a few things and some situations and things he’s said in the past have popped up in my mind. I’m not sure why. He’s asked me to leave the past in the past. I’ve been doing some healing, self reflecting &amp; research on healthy vs toxic relationships. I came across a question asked by a divorce lawyer. It was something like:

What was the feeling you got when you realized you were in love with a person? Did they make you safe, loved, how did they make you feel etc? I loved that so I chose to ask my bf that question. I said “I know I’m springing the question on you so if you need a few minutes, get back to me after dinner” (he was cooking when I asked so I didn’t ask at an appropriate time) he said “oh that’s a hard one. I’ll need a minute” 

That was two or three days ago :/  he probably forgot but it kind of hurts that he couldn’t answer within like 5-10 minutes. I feel like I’d be able to say one thing about him right away.

Recently I got out of a relationship, hooked up with my friend-couple, and promptly fell for someone who isn't distance-wise that far away. However, not that far has proven to be too far (thanks American driving infrastructure), and I am *obsessed*. But I spent years in a dead bed relationship, only to now be enamored with someone I can't even be with physically... at least for the time being (weather deterring, and family obligations on his end).

Almost every time we’ve gone out (casually or as a date), his sister (F21) will call him. This, on the surface is absolutely fine, but the reason she calls is for him to bring home food. Whilst this (bringing home food for her) is completely reasonable request, I do find it annoying (because I believe that she is old enough and capable of getting how own food) but I won’t do anything about it (bring it up with my bf). 

For context, I was heated up about the time we went on an ice skating date and he picked up the phone while we were on the rink. For me, that feels disrespectful and embarrassing because WE WERE IN THE RINK? but I’m open to interpretations. Sure the call lasted for maybe 2 minutes but there’s obv something going on if it affects me so much that I have to write a reddit post about it.

Last night I brought up the phone calls to him. I said “can you let her know b4 hand that we’re going on a date and to only call him for emergencies”

"I (F31) have been with my fiance (M31) for 12 years and have 2 wonderful young kids together. I thought we were in a happy and loving relationship.

I started noticing something very wrong in my relationship 3 months ago. He started bringing up the idea of open relationships every day for 2 weeks and his opinion went from ""I don't get it"" to ""I can understand why people would want them"". This started showing me some red flags. At the same time as these conversations started, he reconnected with a woman (F31) he went to primary school with and they started talking all day everyday. It got to the point that if she messaged, he would ignore my existence completely.

My intuition told me something was wrong, so I checked his phone and saw some very obviously bad messages on his Snapchat to this woman. I confronted him about it and he denied it, claiming the messages were innocent and taken out of context. At the time I felt like I believed him.

I felt, for the first time in 12 years, unsafe in my relationship. I started having daily panic attacks about him and this woman every day for almost 2 months. My anxiety got to a point where he said he needed to spend some time away from me to feel like an individual. He said he was going to spend the whole day with one of his male friends and then the next day go and stay the night at another male friends house.

A couple weeks later I find our from one of his friends and noticing holes in his story, that he did not to go anyone's house but instead went to an Airbnb and hung out with the woman he has been messaging. It was only then that he changed his story and told me he did see her for a few hours and then went to stay in an Airbnb to be by himself for one night. Again I believed him.

I have just discovered through some messages that he never went to see any of his friends. He spend the whole day with her and then the next day checked into the hotel with her. They had sex. They have been messaging everyday and they have said they have strong feelings for each other and have made plans to be together in the future. My fiance doesn't know that I know the truth.

We had big fight today because I am at my parents, he is at his parents and he texted me in the afternoon „we have some family members over” ane then silence for something like 4-5 hours. In the evening he called me angry at me why I texted him when I knew he is with his family (I texted him few times things like „you having fun?” „what are you doing?”) I didn’t know how to answer to that because I didn’t know what I did wrong so I asked him „What were you doing ? What were you talking about ?” And he snapped at me that its not my bussines that its his family bussines (its not my bussines but his cousins girlfriend of few months can hear everything) and that he doesn’t remember anyway.

We've known eachother for years and we've been dating for more than a year and we're both broke students but I know they already bought me a gift because he can't keep secrets.

So they really want a perfume that smells like coffee or chocolate and I researched and did my best to find one, in the country that I live in it's not an easy task specially because I struggle with going out a lot to crowded places since diagnosed with ASD, but now I'm regretting not going to those markets that are so uncomfortable and full of people because maybe this wouldn't have happened.

I found a one in marketplace (To be clear, I usually buy my own perfume in marketplace, mine smells like nice, sweet and it's a copy but I've never had anything like this happened to me before) I investigated beforehand and everything seemed alright... until I got it and it doesn't smell anything like coffee, it smells like old lady. I opened to smell it because I wanted to see if it was really good and maybe I should keep the contact of the person who sold it to me so I can keep getting for my partner. But no, it smells rancidly like old lady and I've been crying for half an hour because idk what to do. I have the equivalent of ten dollars in my bank account and I feel so bad.

I've making handmade gift for them since we began dating. To name a some, I knitted him a kitten and also did a bouquet of paper sunflowers because they're my love's favourites, but I really wanted to get something nice for them for Christmas.

"So I don t even know what exactly I wanna ask, or IF I wanna ask something, ask for advice(s)... Or if just... ""I need to talk about it"" 😅
*first of all, I m sorry, will be a long post AND thanks to those who has the patience to read it, and to those who, after, will share their thoughts about... or some opinions... or some advices (especially from someone who maybe has gone through something similar) ☺️
*I ll give names ...obviously, not their real names
So, in my second year of college, I met a guy with whom I fell sooo deeply in love. I ll call him Adam. For a certain time (like, about half a year), everything was perfect between us. Even... my thoughts had gone waaay too far, was like ""Oh, I m gonna marry this guy. I m gonna start a life with him. He s gonna to be my children s father. Blah blah blah...""
BUT... I was missing something important... maybe something QUITE important even. I couldn t see myself being s * * ually active with him. Like... everything (else) was good, it was perfect, my love for him was on a very very deep level. BUT, just, I couldn t see him as a s * * ual partner or... myself as his s * * ual partner. He s a good guy, very religious, prays a lot, fasts, etc. And, probably, I put him on... a kind of a pedestal.
At some point, we began talking less and less, until, at present, we can hardly be called friends.
Now, about 3 years have passed, and I STILL sometimes think about him, I STILL sometimes feel like I wish I could go back in time, so we could (re)meet again, so I could do things differently, smarter, so I could have an ANOTHER chance with him, a NEW chance. 
But... things get complicated.
During all this time (more precisely, about this year ... of those 3 ... so 2 years after Adam and I started being distant) I began thinking about having a relationship with a (other) guy. I ll call him Chris.
So, I ve known Chris since my first year of college, now being 5 years since we ve known each other. He pretty much liked me from the very beginning, but I... I don t know... I think... just... idk... I didn t feel the same way, in the past. Plus, I didn t have a good opinion about him, I thought he isn t a serious guy, etc.
But... now... now it s different. Now I m thinking of having a relationship with him. I see myself being s * * ually active with him. I see him as a s * * ual partner. I want him as a s * * ual partner.
BUT, the fact is that, during all this time, I STILL have moments when I think about Adam, I STILL have moments when I feel that I want a new another with Adam.
And... I don t know... I wouldn t wanna be that kind of girl who s in a relationship with a guy, but is thinking at another guy. I do care enough about and respect Chris enough to want to don t do that to him ...even though I d like a relationship with him, even though I can see (and want) him as a s * * ual partner. He even is the first (among all my ""crushes"") for whom I feel this way. Yeah... odd, I know🤣😅😅 BUT, even so, I don t see/want marriage and children with him ...and with Adam I saw/wanted these.
And... I have a real anxiety about something. What if, I finally decide to give a chance to a relationship with Chris. We ll become lovers. And then, EVEN SO, I ll STILL think about Adam sometimes???!!!
So... yeah... that s the short/LONG ""background"".

"I (29F) have been working at this new company for a few months now and my boss (28M) is no longer just my boss, but my bosses boss. 

We work in the construction field and I noticed him in that way immediately but let it go because it was a line I never wanted to cross. However, lately it's been harder to ignore those feelings. Find ourselves constantly making eye contact and staring from across the shop, he's no longer directly in charge of me and has no reason to talk to me but finds reasons to come over through out the day. He is very strict and stern and a serious guy but he instantly smiles and talks sweetly to me whenever he comes over. 

He is also single btw but he keeps taking care of me in ways that make it hard to ignore him and my feelings. A couple small examples would be like when we passed each other in the hall and I had just tried to get a splinter out for several minutes and was on my way to find a tool to help get it out, and instead of letting me deal with it he took me to a private office and held my hand and took it out. He told me id need to speak at a meeting to no longer be considered a newer employee and its needed for official documentation. I get panic attacks when I have to public speak so he made sure no other boss would call on me and forged paperwork saying I did. Or he sees something is happening with my machine at work and I have many coworkers and several Foreman's all around who can help and who aren't as busy as he is but he will stop whatever he is doing to help and just talk and laugh with me. The last time he stopped to help with my machine, he was trying to convince me to come to the holiday potluck since it's on my off day and since I'm single and everyone is bringing their families I said it just didn't seem worth coming in and he loudly exclaimed that he's single and wouldn't be bringing anyone as a way to convince me and just a lot of laughing and flirting. 

Any advice on how I could discreetly figure out of he actually likes me too? I'm an over thinker so some concrete evidence without being too obvious would be good. I don't plan on crossing any lines.... but we're both single adults and life is short so we could have some fun possibly

"My girlfriend \[F20\] and I \[M19\] have been together for almost 3 years and living together for about 8 months.

A few months back my girlfriend went away for a week for a work course and she says she was sexually assaulted by someone at the course. Before she told me this we broke up due to other reasons but after a few weeks decided to get back together and work things out. However less than a week after we broke up he stayed with her and they slept together again - we were not together at this point but it still hurts to know she did that so soon after we broke up. After we got back together she told me about all of this and I thought we could move past it but she kept talking to him over snapchat, which I caught onto but when I confronted her she denied it and made me out to be over bearing and controlling.

I then found out that she had been sending him nudes in the period of time after she came home but before we broke up. I asked her to stop talking to him which she did for a short while but then after a few weeks started talking to him again. She then let him stay again but while I was there as we had moved back in together. The night he stayed, she expected me to sleep on the couch or find somewhere else to stay the night. This absolutely destroyed me mentally and emotionally. I fell into a depression and started drinking heavily which effected my health and my work.

She then found out she would be relocated to his city for work (roughly 4 hours away) and would be attending night-class with him as apart of her work. Since nothing else had happened for a while and she had seemed to have stopped talking to him I felt like I didn't need to worry anymore. I recently went to the city she is now working for the weekend and saw a text offering to let him stay with her if he couldn't get home after night class as a lot of the rounds in the area were closed at the time.

A few days ago she went to the beach with him and possibly a few others from night-class. She was very guarded about who she was with which is what made me catch on to the fact she went with him. I believe there may have been others there but I don't have proof of that. I told her this is not okay given what has happened in the past with him and she thinks I am being controlling and manipulative by trying to dictate who she can and can't be friends with. To be clear, I have only said that she can't spend time with him given what has happened. Am I justified in saying she can't remain friends with him? She keeps telling me I don't understand how friendships work and that I do not get to have a say in this matter.

I do love her but I feel I cannot trust her and do not know if I am being manipulative and controlling. I'm also starting to question if she was really sexually assaulted or if that was just her story to make it okay. She also didn't make any kind of complaint or take any action against him. Any advice would be really helpful as I really don't know what to do now.

"(Posting under new account since other account isn’t showing up)

So what I did is worse than just hanging up. As a shitty explanation of my mindset (and not at all an excuse) I had recently landed from a long plane ride, and found out my professor had fucked up my grade and was being incredibly difficult about it. 

I was talking to my girlfriend (of 1 year, long distance for 4 months) which makes me feel better. She was teasing me which is normal for us and goes both ways when she said that my brother was more attractive than me. I know that she did not mean it and was just pushing my buttons but I was not welcoming that at the time so I just hung up. I guess we are both pretty stubborn cause neither of us communicated til the next morning and which point she asked me why I hung up and I said “because I was already tired and frustrated and did not have the energy to deal with you pissing me off more”. 🤦‍♂️. So I had instantaneous regret,  but the damage was done. 

       Since then she apologized for making me mad, I apologized for hanging up and for that message but she doesn’t want to talk to me. I don’t know how she feels about us but I know she is totally justified in her feelings and would be justified if she wanted to break up with me. (Not that anyone needs justification to end relationships).

       I do not really know where to go from here. I can’t tell if I should just give her space or try to apologize more or if what I did is worse/not at bad as I think it is. Frankly, I just feel stupid and immature. I also know there is no perfect way to fix things like this, but I’m looking for help making it up to her.

"My bestfriend (19F) and I (19M) have known each other since preschool. Our parents met and had kids at very close times. We grew up together. Same neighborhood. Same private school. We always spent time together, mostly because she loved hanging out with my oldest sister (16F) and taking care of my youngest sister (13F). She never had any sibilings. 

She is the sweetest girl you'll come across. I'm like the brother she never had. She always comes to me for advice but its never in regards to personal, love life, or questions about men because she stated that ""it's weird asking my brother about his private manners"".

I've always seen her as my sister. So you can imagine how hard it was for me when she moved to another state during the summer of 8th grade. Even though we made a lot of jokes, I was sad she moved away. I missed her a lot, my sisters missed her more for sure.

Last month, she came for a visit (reunion with her childhood friends) but she looked much different than I remember. She is smart, kind, and absolutely beautiful. We are both grown up now and in college. I couldn't keep my attention off of her eyes. I dont want to sound like a creep but holy shit they were gorgeous. They are like a forest that you can get easily lost in. And dont get me started about her soft and shiny hair. The way she looks at you make you want to have her to hold. 

I couldn't stop thinking about her before when she FaceTimed me and now it has gotten worse. I think I have feelings for her. But the problem is that we know each other so much- whether it's family issues, venting, or anything you could think of. Am I wrong for liking her even though we have a very close bond?

Our families know each other through business as well so I don't want to make it awkward. Once, her grandmother claimed that we would make ""cute cabbages"" (French phrase, I assume. Cute babies?)

We couldn’t find any good restaurant choice, since I would rather go out than make a whole lot of stuff at home because the apartment is quite small. But she felt that I wasn’t really making an effort towards deciding on something because I didn’t really care as to where we went. But since there aren’t really a whole lot of choices since everything is booked we couldn’t really decide on anything.

So I feel like the reason for that why she thinks that I’m not making an effort is because even if there was no option then I would still be okay with staying home anyway because as long as we’re together it would be good right? Maybe I was just acting too melancholy about the plans and not verbalizing my feelings enough at the time?

So with that issue on the back burners we still go along and have a good late brunch yesterday at the same chain bistro where we couldn’t decide on Christmas plans the day prior but at a different location. Where everything is seemingly fine until there was some weird things happening at the restaurant. Where it was kind of a bistro where you had to pay and tip upfront but then sit and wait for the food to come out. So we are just talking about some of the things that went funny with the order like how we got take-out containers even though we asked for it dine-in. My girlfriend’s portions were pretty small for the price and those kinds of things. 

But when we are ready to go I was just going to leave the containers on the table since there was food-runners and such so I thought that was the normal thing to do like we had done the day before at the different location. However she had been there to that location before and knew that there were garbages and a place to put plates and such yourself once you leave. So she insisted that we take the cardboard containers out which I didn’t agree with because of how we had to tip and how some things were weird with the experience even though the food was really good, and it is what we did the day before at the other spot. So after me disagreeing to take the stuff off the table she said “be a decent guy” or something along those lines and sort of frustratedly grabs the stuff herself and throws it out in the bin. 

I’m just genuinely confused about the situation as I felt that I was doing the normal thing because of the circumstances and I’m obviously never trying to be shitty in a restaurant. So as we are walking through town, I’m just talking to her about the scenario and how the bistro is set up in such a weird way. I felt like I was not attacking her or even mentioning what she said, more about how I didn’t like the setup of the bistro place. 

She is not really getting too upset talking about it because we agreed on most things except for how I felt like I shouldn’t have to take the containers away but she felt embarrassed that I didn’t and had to do it herself. 

As I’m still trying to just get to the bottom of how I made her feel embarrassed because I obviously wouldn’t ever want to do that. She is getting more and more mad that I am still talking about the situation and arguing in general even though I didn’t really feel like I was. 

It gets to a point where she doesn’t want to go into the place where we had to run another errand because we are fighting even though I didn’t get the feeling we were, I thought we were just casually talking about the weird place and what happened. All of a sudden she is raising her voice and saying how I didn’t care or want to talk about the Christmas plans, and now I’m talking too much about the little things like at the little place. 

She is getting more and more mad about how we are wasting time talking about the stupid little thing and not enough about the important stuff we needed to do like the overdue errand we couldn’t get to now because we are so worked up. 

I thought that I was trying to de-escalate the situation but she didn’t want to go do the errand because are fighting but didn’t want to leave because we needed to do the thing. But I’m too confused to solve the fight because she is saying that she doesn’t care about what happened earlier and that she has nothing to do with the restaurant even though I thought I wasn’t making it about her or what she said or even how she was embarrassed either. I’m was just talking for the sake of it. 

So it just keeps spiralling on and she is getting more stressed about everything now as time goes on and bringing up the other things I mentioned above here ⬆️. I’m trying to be quiet and not instigate anything further since we’re out in public. But since I’m unable to understand what is even going on I can’t make her feel better. And I have a work party to go to that night so we weren’t able to resolve anything before that into today. She ended up getting so mad she is saying stfu and I hope the rest of your night is horrible because you just ruined my whole day and everything, amongst other things. 

So am I just being too casual and not making enough effort in the planning things? Because I don’t know how she could get that mad when I never raised my voice or called her any names but she said some crazy things in the end. I truly can’t figure out if I’m really in the wrong somewhere or If I’m gaslighting her somehow into feeling like that when that’s the last thing I want. I really need another perspective on this please. I know that was a lot of text and I don’t know if I’m even making sense in this post or not. But I can’t figure out why these fights are happening.

"Ok I know how this sounds. But let me explain. My cousin and I met 12 years ago. I was 11, I call him Josh who was 14 and his brother (Isaiah) was 20. They became the brothers I never had. Currently I'm single, Josh has a girlfriend (they've been together around 10 months) and Isaiah got married 6 months ago. 

We've always been pretty close. I get along with both of them. Although the sibling dynamic is more clear with Josh since we're closer in age. I should mention that I don't dislike their significant others. Especially Isaiah's wife. She's so warm and welcoming. It's so obvious why he fell in love with her. I can't say too much about Josh's girlfriend because I've only met her once, but she seemed more open and friendly than his previous girlfriend. 

It's weird because the jealousy comes specifically from Josh who doesn't seem to make time for me or the rest of his family for that matter. He's so consumed by his relationship. Even his brother who is MARRIED makes time for everyone. 

I really hope this doesn't come off the wrong way. I had a very pleasant conversation with her when we met at Isaiah's wedding. I have nothing against her. 

I WANT to get to know her better and even make a new friend since I don't have many. 

I know, your significant other should take priority, and I'm ok with that. The thing is Josh treats me like I don't exist. He even made fun of me and acted so cold to impress his ex who was a nightmare. He just pulls back and becomes so distant that he treats me like a stranger. I feel like this type of jealousy is so weird because I feel like in most cases like this, the resentment is directed towards the girlfriend for ""stealing"" him. But she isn't who I'm upset with.

"The title says all but I need help with how to help my friend. Please save all the hateful comments because she is remorseful about the cheating and I’ve always known her to be a wonderful person who did a bad thing. 

Long story short, my best friend was in a relationship where they were very much in love. This was her first queer relationship so she was navigating a lot of new experiences. A couple of months into it, she ended up hooking up with an old crush whilst drunk and realised the next day the severity of her actions. She told her partner immediately and they had a long discussion regarding the cheating. My best friend was entirely remorseful and honest throughout and explained as much as she could. The partner decided to breakup anyway and my best friend had respected her wishes. However, she has been an absolute wreck ever since and is struggling immensely. She has panic attacks and cannot stop ruminating over everything. Has been crying non stop and is desperate to get her partner back. She has expressed to me that she’s been having suicidal thoughts and believes she cannot live without her partner or simply does not want a life without her in it which has terrified me. 

Despite this, she has respected her ex’s need for space during this time but her ex has reached out and wants to have a further discussion as to why she did it which is causing her to spiral as she feels this could be her chance to win them back.

My best friend has always been a very emotionally fragile person and I’ve done my best to be there for her through it all. I love her to pieces but on this occasion, I simply do not know what to do. In previous relationships, I’ve seen her lose herself a lot and become deeply depressed and anxious after each breakup. A lot of these were incredibly short term which I didn’t understand the reaction to it. On this occasion, I understand they were in love and had a wonderful relationship but I felt that it was only a few months and unfortunately, she caused the demise of it. Furthermore, I think there is still a slight lack of accountability in this scenario as she feels that she’s been so good to her partner and her partner should overlook this mistake. To which I reminded her that if the roles were reversed then I’d advise her to leave her cheating partner as it is an act of betrayal. I also tried to remind her that she needs to prepare for the possibility that her ex will stand by their decision and not wish to get back together. The thought of this is messing her up entirely and she does not want to consider it. She has told me that she does not wish to hear the harsh truths because she already knows all of this. I tried to be as empathetic as possible and just be a listening ear but the truths came out when she queried my thoughts. I don’t know how to be more gentle than I already have been. 

Part of me believes that she needs to continue hearing some harsh truths as I don’t want her to be “blindsided” by reality and inevitably prepare for the “worst” which is a permanent breakup. I also think this may be cruel but I don’t know. She comes from a conservative background so I was always concerned this relationship was doomed from the start because she’d most likely have to sacrifice her family who would be against this relationship. She did not want to acknowledge or address this whenever I asked what she would do if her family found out. I explained that she most likely cannot keep her relationship secret forever as her family are quite involved in her life and there have been incidents where they uncovered her lifestyle and shamed her for it.

I also fail to understand the severe reaction to it and I think it has caused a lack of empathy that she is seeking. I’m doing my best to be loving and comforting but I find that I simply don’t know how to help. In my head, I’m concerned that she becomes so deeply attached to each relationship that she falls apart and loses herself after every breakup. Frankly it’s disturbing to see and it upsets me that she ties her self worth to someone loving her. And now after this breakup, she is considering ending her life because of it which is so painful to hear from someone you love so much. 

I’m at my wits end because I want to help her so much and be that support for her. However, I find that she makes multiple decisions that have major consequences and wants to avoid discussing it until shit hits the fan and then panic ensues. Now I’m fearing the worst and I simply don’t know if I have the capacity to withstand all of this emotional stress after years of similar situations where I came to pick up the pieces and be that comfort. 

How do I support my friend during this time? How do I push her to seek help and what kind of help is out there for these scenarios? And how can I resolve my own feelings without building resentment towards my best friend?

"This is a throwaway as I am quite self conscious to share this. This will be kinda long but I feel it's necessary for context. Tldr at bottom.

I (m27) and my gf (f27) have had a very close and loving romantic relationship for many years. I am perhaps sharing a very common issue when I say that I feel like things are getting very lukewarm and cold between us. 

When I say that, I don't mean hostilities of any kind, rather that we seem to be getting much too comfortable and are losing the fire that we both shared, that brought us both together in the first place. Our pastimes and values.

For the longest time, we came from a shared place of scarcity and insecurity, and grew close to each other first as friends to support each other through the hard times. We've also overcome addictions that become common with the hard life of poverty.

As of the last two or so years, we've made hard strides towards defeating addiction and making a life together. Today I have a good secure career and a place for us while she takes care of everything else and it works well. Everything is as it should be except for the depth of a personal relationship we have now. It feels like in order to keep up our solid life, we need to sacrifice any human emotional element in order to make the bread and keep the fort down. After all necessities are said and done, we're exhausted, we don't really have passion like we used to it seems. I tell myself it's a temporary hiccup but it's been going on for a while now.

As for her specifically, my gf is very attractive but feels extremely insecure about her appearance. I suppose all women feel this to an extent, but at the same time she really doesn't do much activity and eats sweets while I'm out working. This leads to her gaining weight and in turn feeling bad, and the cycle continues. I always do what I can to try all I can to encourage her to be active with me, but she doesn't seem to get excited like I can at the prospect, so  I let it go and end up laying around with her after work.  If I try and even lightly bring this up, she gets very defensive and insecure and sinks further into her bad habits.

On the bright side, things are altogether well for us, and perhaps I'm edging on ungratefulness, but I really just want her to be happy and excited to engage in our hobbies like it used to be. Comfort kills?

"My family loves parties, dancing and drinking. Unfortunately I do not. 

They’ve been taking me to parties since I was around 12 and I have tried to enjoy it but I never do as much as them. I feel as if I have to force myself to enjoy it and now that I am older, if I don’t enjoy it, they get upset. 

I understand that I’m still young but at parties they tell me what I can and can’t drink, and they get drunk and wild and I’m the more sober one watching their shenanigans. I know some people find it fun but I don’t. They shout sometimes and say mean things. Additionally, I always feel uncomfortable dancing around them. They tell me to loosen up but I feel judged. I would dance a little bit when I am out with them but as of recently I feel so drained from it that it’s not enjoyable to the point I feel like I hate dancing. But if I don’t dance, it’s a problem. They always ask me to dance. 

Additionally, when we are at a party or club I don’t drive or have a car at the moment so I am basically there until they decide to go home. But I am aware I need to learn to drive and try getting my own car so I can solve this. 

Long story short, I hate parties and I don’t really enjoy drinking now. However my entire close family is the opposite so I feel alone. They also get upset that I don’t enjoy the party like they do but how could I enjoy it when I am rarely asked if I want to go, I can’t have my own choice in drink, I now hate dancing and I can’t always leave or stay home when I want to? Aren’t those like the basic things people enjoy about parties and clubs? I feel like I’m just a tag along because they want to go but they are still afraid to leave me home alone. 

But I will admit that even at quiet dinners I don’t feel myself connecting with them. It’s like they understand each other better and I have nothing to say to them. I just sit there most of the time listening or on my phone. 

So I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so disconnected from my family. I love them and I know they love me but I am so tired of feeling like I have to change who I am to suit them.

"This started during covid, and has snowballed out of control. He just sits on Facebook and purposely looks for any and every conspiracy and that’s 90% of his algorithm now. He’s been on some kick about Agenda 2030 this week and he’s been getting hostile with me because I don’t want to watch the Facebook videos or reels or whatever he’s sending me. He’s been mocking my anxiety and shooting insults at me about being ignorant and not on his side. He says when the day comes for global takeover it will be the biggest “told you so” moment he could ever have with me and he won’t even be able to enjoy it because we’ll be too busy fighting for our lives.
I don’t know what the fuck to do or say. He’s making me sick to my stomach. I don’t want to be near him. I’ve tried to let him ramble about it to get it out of his system, but he always ends up screaming at me and I have to tell him to chill out and change the subject. 
Talking isn’t enough now, he wants to “take action, have an escape plan.”
I tried to rationalize, which I really put off until a last resort because I knew it wasn’t going to work… and he just deflected, changed the subject, called me names, and went into his cave to play video games.
I feel like we’re on 2 totally different wavelengths, and it wasn’t always that way. But he’s just changed. And if I’m not changing and blindly following his lead, he accuses me of cheating or thinking I’m smarter than him and not respecting him.
The marriage feels like a chore. Every day I have to wonder what version of him is going to walk through that door, what insecurity or conspiracy will I have to deal with today. 
I was depressed last year, for a lot of reasons. He wasn’t supportive, he cheated, and I decided this year was going to be different. 
I’ve been taking much better care of myself and I know my mental health has drastically improved. I’m out from under my storm cloud and I want to focus on the positives that life has to offer. He hasn’t gotten on my health kick yet, and it almost feels like he would prefer to drag me back down. I’m not confrontational in the least bit, but I’ve been trying to be assertive and set boundaries and therapy told me to try and practice with the people I’m most comfortable with first. 
That should be him, but god, when I try (like asking him to please stop trying to make me spiral about something I have no control over) he snaps on me and says I’m too afraid to speak up to anyone else, but I’m so quick to snap on him. 
I can’t talk to him, I can’t stand to walk on eggshells around him, and I refuse to lose my own identity and ability to come to my own conclusions and views because aligning with his would make him happy.

"To keep things confidential and a long story short, I’ve been talking to a girl who is relatively long distance from me. I’ll call her Kim. We were planning to make it official when we met up, but already were talking about plans for the future and such since we’ve been interested and talking to each other for nearly 4 months now. Also should mention it definitely isn’t platonic.

TLDR at the bottom.

One night I mentioned how I used to be pretty chunky, but lost a lot of weight and she sent a message (what I assumed was humor at the time) about how she pretty much had the opposite happen. I responded along the lines of “looks like we mirror each other in more ways than one” before getting a reply that she said I lowkey called her fat. I didn’t really know how to respond, it felt like anything I’d say would sound bad.

Trying to make it clear that I was just trying to be lighthearted/funny I said something like “at most you’re just a little chubby, and regardless you’re still very attractive and more caring than I deserve” but after that ‘Kim’ said that she didn’t know how to respond and ever since things have felt cold/distant. I apologized, and we had a conversation about her being sensitive about the topic. I even wanted to be sure that I only even said something like that accidentally, since I used to be heavy myself so I never really saw being chubby as a bad thing.

Fast forward to tonight, and we came back to the topic of meeting relatively soon as we planned before but ‘Kim’ only replied that she doesn’t really know how to talk to me anymore and that things feel weird now. Maybe it’s just me reading into it but it feels like I’m only a few days away from a “breakup” text (yeah we aren’t a ‘couple’ but as mentioned we were just waiting to say it in person) and it feels like there’s nothing I can do.

Can anybody give some advice? I really want to be able to talk it out but it feels like I hit a landmine and I fucked up what seemed like a great future together. It also didn’t help that I had a lot of events planned recently with my friends visiting for the holidays, so we haven’t had much time to talk.

"My spouce and I have (37M 32F) been living in separate rooms for years now. And to be honest it's mostly great. We both really enjoy having our own space that is just ours.

Especially sense we both have different mental struggles resulting in different qwerks. They like to keep everything super clean and (mostly) organized. I do too, but when my depression or PTSD is being particularly antsy, my room suffers.

Before you ask, as this is one I get regularly, we have a healthy sex life. Everything is thumbs up in that department on both sides. Basically nothing about our relationship has changed besides sleeping arrangements and nonsexual touching.

Which kinda brings me to my point. We don't cuddle anymore, ever. The only time physical touch happens between us, it's in a sexual way. And as I'm realizing lately, it's a big problem for me.

At first I thought I just wanted cuddles, but as time goes on, it's becoming more apparent that I need that comforting physical touch. Both of us have personal space issues in general, and aren't the biggest fans of someone being in our bubble. 

Over the last few months I started with hints that cuddles would be nice. Which involved into flat out I want cuddles, into when are we gonna cuddle. The last 2 times I've added the word need. Still nada.

Now I want to explain the what and the how, but without confrontation since arguments of any kind are hard on both us for multiple reasons. And I don't want to cause any strife making the topic even more difficult. 

I've googled my eyes out, but all of the advice I can find doesn't seem to fit us, or our situation. 

I tend to ramble when I talk about emotions, cause it's not just any one thing that makes me feel a way. The bigger the emotions, the longer I ramble. I also have to consider how my current mental state is effecting my emotions. I.e. Am I over thinking myself into an emotional frenzy because I woke up from bad dreams, or is this how I'm feeling because I'm actually upset about this? 

They find this very frustrating because they don't fully understand how my train of thought works. (That makes 2 of us, so I don't fault them for this at all, and neither should you.) And the more I ramble the harder it is for them to understand. 

I know they know that I've been having a harder time lately, I can see it in their behaviors. But they seem lost as to what to do.

"(F48) Stuck under same roof as ex. (M60) How do I take next steps? Feeling very trapped and overwhelmed.

I (48F) can’t afford to move out on my own and it’s literally killing me living under the same roof as my ex (60M).

Warning long post: 
I know technically this isn’t a relationship anymore but I don’t know where else to turn. 

We have 5 kids together and separated legally last year. 

After being a SAHM I’m struggling to find full time work I have minimal qualifications and work part time but I have lost all of my confidence and am constantly afraid of being criticised or yelled at and feel dumb.

He used to do things like drip feed me grocery money each day into a joint account and oftentimes I would have to put back items if I accidentally went over. The stress would leave me crying in parking lots each day.

He yells and has a very short fuse, and hates to be wrong and continually is being oppositional or going off in a huff, being dismissive or passive aggressive if anyone is thinking otherwise. If he’s wrong you’d never know as he will never apologise. 

Now all of this to say, that he wasn’t *always* like this. There were definitely some red flags looking back but nothing like this. Although I was very young when what together and remember being bewildered when he stopped kissing and hugging me after some time together. There is zero cheating either side, I look better than ever by taking care of myself although stress now is taking its toll. I suggested therapy and he went once and VEHEMENTLY refused to do it again. I go myself and my therapist says it’s emotional abuse and she admits I’m in a rock and a hard place trying to leave. My older kids help out financially too but it’s not enough. 

Admittedly he works night shift which I know is brutal but even after a good (night’s?) sleep, he is still very much a toxic AH. 

He drinks and watches tv constantly when at home and sits across from our youngest son (12M) in our living room completely ignoring him and puts headphones on to watch his tv programs.  If he suggests something it might be “You should take him to the park and play basketball”. I responded with “I can’t at the moment since there’s too many mosquitoes about”. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with my reply but he heaved a big sigh and muttered something under his breath. This kind of response is typical, day in day out. 

If he pays any attention to our kids, it’s a maximum five minute conversation (I do wish I was just exaggerating), and it’s so eggshell like that my kids don’t even get emotionally invested with him since ’one foul move’, can get him completely off side with you. He might be talking about school and then one of the kids leaves the fridge open too long and he’ll have a completely irrational reaction and break any sense of ease and flow. He’s very condescending and highly critical. 

One minute he’s petting our cat, the next minute he’s saying if she ever needs vet attention, “put her down. Get another one” (I pay for all this anyways.) Even something is simple as when the kids are looking for her and ask if he has seen her and he retorts back “Don’t know and I don’t care.” They are heartbroken.

I now ensure any “conversation” is benign “yep, weather looks like rain is on the way”. Aside from that, he refuses to join in or help out with anything. 

He pays rent and some food. I pay 100% of everything else. Meanwhile he cries poor, saves money (he has thousands saved up), although admittedly things are financially tough. Refuses to contribute to Christmas gifts and birthdays but won’t hesitate to buy himself a new set of headphones. 

Asking for basic stuff around the house is met with nothing but stony silent treatment or his typically filthy look and verbal repulsion at my question. Example: last year we fought hard about putting Christmas lights up outside the house. I bought them but am terrified of heights and wanted him to get in the Christmas spirit and put them up. He became insanely angry and cursed and sighed the whole time and continued yelling at me in front of our kids. It was horrible. I thought maybe he learnt and would be okay this year, but he downright refused. The younger kids were so upset he won’t get involved. Watched tv while we put up the tree beside him. Ignored me while I struggle to carry groceries in the house. 

He’s been like this for years (since our last child was born). I’m heartbroken for my children never knowing the love of a father. 

Rents are INSANE where I live. I’ve done the numbers and no matter where I go, unless I’m earning $1,500 a week, there’s no way I can afford to leave and adequately provide for my children and myself. I’ve spoken to a social worker and there’s not much in child support. 

I’ve now realised I’m fucking stuck and it’s my own stupid fault. I feel like nobody around me understands what it’s like to have been belittled and treated like this for so long. It’s completely broken me. 

How do I make next steps? I’m having physical and mental health struggles and can’t think straight anymore. I’m so utterly overwhelmed by life. It all feels so very pointless.

At the beginning our sex life was amazing and we did things almost every day, but as we’ve been together our sex life has slowed down a lot. We went from doing something every day to maybe once or twice every two weeks. We’ve had conversations about this, he says that it’s nothing about me and that as we’ve gotten older there are a lot of things that stress him out in life. So that makes him not in the mood I guess. The main reason why I’m worried is because I’m pretty sure he still watches porn and all of that, so I can’t help but feel like it’s because i’ve gained weight since we’ve been together. But he always swears it’s not. What is everybody’s opinion about this? Is there any way for me to make things interesting again? Or should I just wait for him to initiate?",My (21M) Boyfriend isn’t intimate with me (21F) anymore. I feel like our sex life is boring now.

"My ex and I got together when I was about 12, he dumped me at 16. I've been with my new boyfriend (21m) for over a year now, and my ex came back into my life about six months ago. Because my ex and I were best friends during a significant portion of my childhood, I agreed to stay in contact with him on a friendly basis. This was fine for a while, but then he started sending me weird, jealous messages and sexually explicit fantasies. I told him to stop, but he'll keep saying stuff like ""I know you don't feel safe saying how you really feel, don't worry I'll keep it a secret"" and implying that I obviously have feelings for him and will leave my boyfriend for him once I ""come to my senses"".

*He* dumped *me*, like four years ago now, and he's upset and refusing to believe I've moved on?

I tried blocking him. He started tracking me down on every social media. He even started messaging me on *Neopets* when he was blocked everywhere else. Or he'll make new accounts, join Discord servers that I'm in while pretending he's someone else, etc. He shows up in public places that I frequent and acts like he's just bumped into me. He's perfectly polite in public, and even my friends think I'm being rude when I tell him to leave me alone. Tried to file a police report, but it wasn't taken seriously because my ex hasn't done anything ""wrong"" and because we were previously in a romantic relationship. Police won't do anything unless he actually threatens me.

I can't just avoid him, other than moving away and hiding. Seriously considering it once it become financially viable. He's on good terms with my parents though, so they'll tell him updates about my life even if I tell them not to. I'm ignoring all his messages, but I'm sick of feeling anxious to go places with my friends in case he shows up.

I recently had a major surgery, and he sent me a text message (no idea how he got my number) saying how hurt he was that I hadn't discussed it with him beforehand, and asking what hospital room I was in so he could send flowers. Obviously, I didn't respond, but it rattled me.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of behaviour before? If I tell him to leave me alone, he thinks there's some invisible force/my ""abusive"" boyfriend keeping us apart. If I ignore him, he just never gives up. Is there anything I can do to make my ex just go away?

"Our relationship started off quite good but i think i lost myself partly because of bad self esteem issues. At its worse i would only see her in my room with the lights off. 

Whenever she does something that offends me or upsets me i just get unreasonably angry and upset. I think about breaking up with her and do things to try and upset her before she has the chance to do this again. I have been a terrible boyfriend especially as of late and i’ve recognised by behaviour but i don’t know how to change it. I try to remember and keep this in mind when seeing her and talking to her but when it happens i just lose control and become a completely different person, then suddenly snap out of it later and realise my actions. It’s just that i feel like everything she does sets me off, for example leaving me on read for ages, changing plans to meet etc. I’m surprised she hasn’t broken up with by now and wouldn’t blame her if she did, i can be a lot to deal with. I will just ignore her or be moody but most of it goes on inside my head.

"So basically me m22 and my gf f23 have been dating for nearly two years, and been through a lot of stuff together, so the relationship wasn’t picture perfect, but we loved each other a lot. Or so I thought. Last weekend we had a great time watched a movie slept over, cooked together and had wine. The wine is important because neither of us really drink so we are both major lightweights. Her more so than me because she is small. She ends up getting drunk. We end up having sex, and she really really wanted it. Whenever she drinks she gets really horny like crazy. So basically she’s on top cowgirl and she puts her hand right on those nerves behind the knee cap. And I’m like “ow move” and she called me a pussy so I was just thinking like what the fuck. I’m not gonna have sex with someone who called me a pussy. Wtf. I thought that was ridiculous, and it really pissed me off so we just stop there. And she goes and sleeps on the couch and I sleep in my bed. Then she comes up stairs and is like I’m sick and proceeds to throw up and I’m still pissed off at her, but I do the right thing and take care of her. Then we go to sleep in the same bed just on opposite sides bc I was low key worried. The next day I’m like we need to talk about it and she’s like no and goes home. I say we talk now or we talk never. A half ass ultimatum. She goes home on Sunday. We don’t talk until she texts me Monday asking to talk. I respond pretty dry because im still upset about this whole ordeal. She was a bitch to me while we were having sex and didn’t even show any appreciation for me staying up all night taking care of her. When she asks to talk Monday night I say “not today” and she responds ok. I said not today because I had an exam in studying for that is the next day. Which she should know about.

"I mentioned maybe going to “our” hotel for our anniversary a few months ago and we agreed that if the weather was nice, we’d travel to Michigan to stay at this hotel we found that has a hot tub. And 🍃 of course! He said he wouldn’t have money so I said I’d pay for it. I talked to him about it a couple weeks ago and yesterday. A couple of weeks ago, I was trying to solidify the plan to make sure we were on the same page and he stated that maybe we could get a hotel room downtown instead of going to Michigan or the other place I suggested (both of which, I thought he was excited about since he expressed interest) i was disappointed but understood the weather might suck and a couple hour drive up there would not be safe. We don’t have snow so I thought maybe the plan could still go on. Yesterday I suggested Michigan again and he suggested just doing dinner. 

He said he hadn’t planned on doing anything since he didn’t have money and that I hadn’t told him about any plans.. dang. I probably shouldn’t take it personally but it stings a bit that he seems to want it to be super chill whereas I want to make it a special occasion and doing something special to celebrate each other. I know it’s the day after Christmas and I seem selfish for wanting to spend money on a bigger occasion, however I’m offering to pay for it as an anniversary gift. He also picked the date of our anniversary, I’d say our anniversary was in July. Anyway, would you consider it selfish for wanting to plan something more than just a dinner date?

"We've been together officially for 4 months now, but we knew each other before for almost a year. Our relationship is pretty good, i would not change a thing except the way we argue, thats our biggest problem. Despite our relationship being pretty good and chill most of the time, we find it very hard to agree with each other in various topics and sometimes this can lead to fights, even in the dumbest topics. I try to convince her of my point of view and really explain it and i get that i pretty much get insistent, then i end up getting her mad and in the worse cases upset. Stuff gets pretty awkward.

Im trying to be less insistent on trying to make her see my point of view on these discussions, but im basically brute forcing it and sometimes i forget. I guess the real problem is the way i talk sometimes, im very bad at expressing myself and even worse when im tired or sleepy. Advice on that is more than welcome.

Yesterday i upset her two times and we were not even fighting. The first time was a pretty dumb topic, when she asked me if i would let her go out with a stranger if he gave us an exorbitant amount of money and i said that i would let her go if he wouldnt do anything and that i trust her. Keep in mind that i asked that to her before she asked me and she said she wouldnt. She got upset at that and we got awkward again.

Later that day we were better and talking, she mentioned that one time she got jealous of a girl i was talking to on instagram, but i said she shouldnt worry because i didnt like her even though she was pretty and i had no interest in her because she was kinda out of my league and rich and had mental problems. Yeah not a good thing to say to your girlfriend. She got very mad at that because she understood i was saying she was just a consolation prize and said we probably should break up and was never meant to be, i tried to explain that i didnt mean that and i was sorry i didnt think before saying that and i dont think like that. I made her cry a lot and i was desperate because i didnt want to lose her in such a stupid way, and we agreed we should take a break so she can heal a bit before we get to any conclusions. I dont even need to say that i feel stupid, right? I've never been in a relationship before and she has a lot of traumas from previous relationships, and i fear i might give her more by saying stupid shit.

"We have been married for 5 years. Together for 6.5 years. When I met him I told myself I met my future husband. But soon those blissful feelings dissipated. There were so many red flags before we got married. To some extent I knew what I was getting into and moved forward anyway. I was burnt out from dating, so I settled for whatever we had because it was better than ending up alone. During our engagement I was close to calling off the wedding but my father was dying and our wedding had become more than just us. It was going to be the family reunion everyone was looking forward to. And my last chance to have my father walk me down the aisle. 

We never had sex on our wedding night and maybe only 1x during our honeymoon though I don’t think anyone even finished. We never had a good sex life to begin with. Early on he had performance issues and eventually would just avoid even trying anymore. It was a big problem for me for awhile and then it got to the point that I was so disgusted that I didn’t even want it from him anymore. We haven’t had sex in almost 4 years. 

My husband is a “trust fund kid” with access to a very nice life yet incapable of providing anything without his father writing the check. Beyond money, he doesn’t know how to cook, clean, take care of our home, fix things, manage finances, communicate properly, be intimate with a woman, etc. I do everything. Literally anything you all can think of that you do in your day to day lives as homeowners, adults, parents, etc. I do it all. My husband runs errands, makes returns and picks up groceries though I’ll give him that. 

I think what keeps us together is a shared sense of humor, and both of our abilities to be complacent in the worst way possible. We just exist together, almost as roommates and usually we are comfortable with things the way they are. We like the same shows, we have shared friends &amp; some shared interests. When life is easy, we do ok but when there is a challenge or a lot going on, reality smacks me in the face. And when I’m miserable, he’s miserable. 

We have a 22 month old daughter &amp; another baby on the way. It’s early but I am 7 weeks pregnant and expect it to be a healthy pregnancy despite my age. How could this be, especially if we don’t have sex I’m sure you’re thinking? Well, we did IVF. Or should I say I did IVF and my husband donated his sperm. That’s what it felt like anyway. It was all my idea and doing. I had wanted so badly for it to happen naturally but my husband’s issues delayed us big time and my clock was ticking. It’s probably easy to judge me for having children when I am so unhappy in my marriage but it was now or never.

To describe what our life is like currently, we live in a beautiful home that we closed on the day before my daughter was born. We moved in after 6 months of renovations (that I coordinated completely on my own with a newborn). I work full-time from home while also  being the sole care taker of our daughter without much help since she was born. My husband works full-time as well but for his father in an office setting outside of our home. If I’m perfectly honest it’s a made up job to justify his checks and he doesn’t do very much. We actually bring in equal money, I may even bring in a little more. The difference is my job is real - a high level director position that I manage with my baby at home and now I’m pregnant again. 

No one in my life knows the full extent of all this so here I am desperately taking it all to Reddit for some advice. Tonight is one of those nights where I am so angry with my husband for constantly neglecting and dismissing me, constantly leaving me to fend for myself with our baby and not caring how sick I am right now being pregnant. He couldn’t even hold our daughter for too long at the function we were at earlier bc she squirms and he can’t handle it. I do everything, I have no respect for him as a man, he makes me feel so sad and miserable. I don’t want my children to grow up in an unhappy home. If I try to leave, I’ll probably end up with next to nothing. And I don’t ever want to share custody with a person who doesn’t even know how to boil water let alone keep children alive and don’t even get me started on what a dangerous driver he is. 

Without harping too much on my poor choices, and knowing what I was getting into, what do I do now? I have my daughter who is the light of my life and one on the way. I love being a mom and I like to think I’m pretty good at it. I was actually hoping to leave my job and just focus on raising both kids after #2 was here. Which financially can only happen if my husband’s income (aka trust fund checks) gets bumped up to make up for my lost income. Which is a likely scenario but of course only if my husband’s father agrees. 

If money was no object I would just divorce my husband and raise these kids on my own. Maybe find real love one day, maybe not, but being alone would be better than this. I believe he feels the same way. Though he has mommy issues, suffers from panic attacks and anxiety and doesn’t like being alone. He wouldn’t want to lose me or his family for his own selfish reasons only. But money is a factor and our comfortable life as we know it - financially - will be more difficult and unknown. Is that fair to my children? How could I work full-time with 2 small children as a single mother? I know plenty of people do it but is it worth it in my situation? Or do I just raise my kids for another 18 years, give them our best &amp; then leave? Can I even do that? Ugh I’m so lost. If you made it this far, thank you.

"NOTE: Title is misleading; I was around 12 at the time this happened.

When I was younger, my mother left me in one of her boyfriend's houses to live with my grandparents for a few months. They (my grandparents) are non-English speaking, can't drive a car, and are pretty much stuck in the house because of this. 

As far as I know, the reason she left me there was because there wasn't any room in the new house that she and her boyfriend moved to (it was under some renovation). The house that my grandparents and I were staying at had plenty of room though, and I was always confused as to why she didn't stay. 

I don't have a great memory of this time, but something about it never sat right with me. I've tried to ask my mother about it and express my concerns, but she just brushes me off. It was a very depressing period to me, and the only time I would see my mother was when she would come drop off food and she would always be angry and upset. 

So I guess I was wondering whether I am overreacting? There is a lot more to my mother and I's relationship, so perhaps that's making me see an innocent situation in a bad light?

She is always saying that I am attractive and that’s one of the reasons she is with me, and that if I wasn’t fit or attractive she would leave me. I am shorter than most guys and she always makes jokes about it which I find a little bit offensive. She made a comment about her weight a month ago and she said that she was going to be on a diet but she never did it. I go daily to the gym and work out for approximately 2 hours on top of being a full time engineering student and working part time on a big company. What I felt was that I was making a huge effort to be in good shape for her but she wasn’t even making the little things as eating better. I saw how she ate cake, cookies and a bag of Cheetos on a daily basis. 

I tried to tell her that I felt that she wasn’t making an effort to look good physically for me or for our relationship she got really mad and she didn’t talk to me all day and right now she just texted that she needed time alone to think things through.

Posted on here several times in the past regarding my relationship to my current boyfriend. We have been together for 5 years. He’s 42 I am 34. Met when I was 27 (almost 28) and really only my third serious relationship. 

Moved cross country to be with him. Overall he was never really excited to have me move. He’s still in love with his ex. Overall I think this relationship has been me pulling the weight. I often think of him as a good person if we were in a relationship. I know he loves and cares for me as an individual- but not as a partner. 

We get along well…like friends. I’ve always said to him I feel like I’m his buddy than his girl. We don’t have the same interests anymore. We’ve drifted apart thanks to myself pulling myself further and further away from him the more I realize we aren’t compatible. 

Most of it is my resentment toward his lies and treatment toward me. And for many others. I’m no saint by any means either. 

Anyways , we’ve been together for five years and I asked him about plans together. He said “why can’t we just focus on being happy and loving each other. Taking things by the day” and then we later had a deeper conversation whereby he indirectly stated he never had romantic feelings for me and that he’d only propose if he felt like it was “the right thing to do” and to “prevent the person he cares for leaving me” and not because he loves me and wants to spend his life with me. 

I of course was gutted but not surprised. And since then I’ve been feeling cold toward him. Christmas is around the corner and I got him gifts. I got nothing under the little tree we can fit into our apartment. Despite my feeling distant from him I still want to celebrate. 

I sort of complained that I’m disappointed I didn’t get anything (yet) and he blew up and said I’m being petty and should just be patient that he’s going to do some last minute shopping….the truth is I always had to beg him for gifts and cards, and all of which have been thoughtless and “just to shut me up for a bit” crap. 

Starting to think maybe I’m the one causing this disparity by being petty and cold. All in all I feel the end is near and it’s making me so depressed. 

Don’t think after five years this relationship would be remotely salvageable but I think we both deserve better. 

Idk - feeling like I should just pull the plug on this already. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Would love advice.

He has been unhappy for a while now. Things going on his personal life on top of us getting into tiffs more frequently. But I have always believed that we can make it through tough times together. I love him deeply. 

We were going to go to Las Vegas together for Christmas. We planned our activities and reservations together and bought our tickets far in advance. I was so excited. I planned every outfit I was going to wear. I had a count down to the trip on my fridge. I couldn’t wait. 

Then, 2 days ago, he broke up with me. He said that it just wasn’t working out between us and that he tried his best. He told me that he is sorry and that he wishes me well. 

I was hysterical. Shocked, blind sighted and so deeply depressed. I cancelled my flight and tried to accept what was happening. 

Soon after, I went to his apartment to get my things that I had kept there and I brought him his things he kept at mine. I packed all my stuff up at his and then we laid in his bed together and cried. It was what I believed would be our final time being in the same room ever again.

A couple days ago she started feeling stressed out and needed space, which I understood and gave her, but what I noticed, is that she was with her male cousin in that time and shortly before all of that happened, which I found okay, since I even spoke to him a couple times and thought that he is a cool guy. But then I noticed her ignoring my messages when I checked up on her when she didn't feel so great and that's when her cousin replied to me through her phone telling me what's going on, I found it very strange, that he even is in her phone but yeah didn't think much of that. But today went a bit different, I texted her as usual and he replied again but this time he told me that she is stressed out and that she isn't feeling that well and that I should give her some space which I agreed too since I only want the best for her. But then I noticed that her tiktok account blocked me and obviously I texted her asking what's wrong or if anything happened, then her cousin replied telling me it was him and that I am apparently stalking her which is a super wild and unreasonable claim, his reasoning behind that is, that I am liking her reposts and since I am liked all of them ( which isn't true ) I must be stalking her account and what not. I then told him that this is not true and he proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want her to have an obssesed guy because of her past relationship and that I should stay away from her since HE doesn't like it.

I wfh and am mostly with my kid and have been noticing my husband getting more and more inattentive to me. While he still loves me and always tells me so, he always fails to notice my emotions or anything with me even when i express it outwardly.
For example, when i'm hurt and crying in bed, when my son hit my head with a hard object and it caused a terrible bruise and i was icing it, when i am injured and have cuts/ new bandages, he never ever notices them first. I have spoken to him many times regarding this before and he says he is just terribly unobservant and failed to notice it. While i believe what he says, i am feeling very disappointed and hurt that he never pays attention to me. it's important to note that I have tried the method where i tell him first but sometimes even with me telling him, he don't take any action to comfort me or ask how i am. It is also extremely hard for me mentally when i am already hurt or sad sometimes and still have to ask for his attention or comfort. We’ve talked about this a lot and while my husband promises to try to be more attentive, he is just naturally too inattentive and insentive to care and there have been almost no changes and in fact things have gotten worse. i’m constantly feeling disappointed and hurt from his inattentiveness. At the same time, i recently found myself ignoring him subconsciously when he has similar issues where in the past, i would have been giving him all my attention and caring for him. I definitely don't want to end this r/s but i am just wondering if i should give up emotionally in terms of needing comfort. How can i overcome this?

"Am I crazy? I had an argument with my husband today regarding his brother who’s getting married tomorrow. I have never formally met the soon to be wife and I’m hurt by it. I brought it up to my husband a few days ago after my hairstylist mentioned a bridal shower the soon to be wife was having and asked if I went. I said I didn’t even know about it and then she proceeds to ask if I met her which I said I have not. 

Today my husband mentions that my mom and I are sitting at one table while my 2 sisters are sitting at a separate table far away from my mom and I. I blew up. I told my husband I feel disrespected like I’m just some random person. My husband tried to rationalize it and say it’s not a big deal and to just sit at the same table. I said what if the ppl assigned to those seats don’t want to move. I ended up calling my mom saying we aren’t going anymore and my mom said it’s okay it’s not a big deal don’t argue about it. My husband then said look your own mom agrees with me and now I’m just spiralling. 

I can’t believe this level of disrespect. My husband said that I’m making this all about myself and that it’s not my wedding and why get upset but truly I’m hurt. I don’t know how else to express this and truly I don’t feel like going anymore. 

How should I express my frustrations and come to a resolution with my husband? Am I overreacting.

"We were invited to a friendsmas at 9 which is 45 minutes away. It’s my girlfriends friends and I hate staying out late. It’s just dinner and drinks. Her friend prefers to go out at later times and I’m the opposite. I told my girlfriend I’m not going and that she is more than welcome to go. She has been mad at me all day. I told her that she is more than welcome to go they are her friends anyway. I told her the issue isn’t her friends it’s the time picked to go out. I’m tired of them planning things late I want to be home around 9 not going out around 9. I think she’s more pissed at the fact that she won’t have a dd and that she cant drink as much. My biggest pet peeve is that her friends aren’t the type to go out have a couple and enjoy the night. They have to get hammered every time. I’m always the responsible one and now I thinks she’s pissed because she has to be the responsible one.

"tl;dr, my partner isn’t very supportive or affectionate and uses relationship trauma from 1.5 years ago as reasoning. 

We started dating about 2 months ago, and this is my first relationship. Side note, my partner has high functioning autism and i am bipolar.

I’ve learned that I’m a very emotional and affectionate boyfriend. My partner hasn’t really reciprocated in the same way. I’m always the one that goes in for a kiss, asks to call, makes dates and so on. What confuses me is that my partner says that they are a very affectionate person as well, enjoying the lovey dovey stuff and described being very affectionate with their ex. Some relationship trauma from the same relationship has led them to think that they are a burden whenever they do things like this or communicate, so initially i understood. But we had this discussion in the beginning of our relationship, and they have said multiple times that they feel like themselves around me and safe around me. But despite this, it’s still the same thing. I have to hug them first. I have to kiss them first. I have to be the one to start getting it on. They haven’t slept over yet. 

There’s a certain event that makes me think about it more. I have Bipolar disorder, and a party we were both at I was very visibly unwell. shaking, breathing heavy, general unresponsiveness and whatnot. They came in after me while i was slumped on the couch, waved to me and didn’t say or do anything. Just talked with their friends. I had to ask them to come outside and start talking to me for them to ask me if i was ok. we went back in and it was the same thing. bottom line, very unsupportive. 

My reasoning is that if you care about someone (especially if they are ill) you should be more concerned about their safety than if they you’re being a burden on not. 

i’m so supportive to them and i don’t want to waste that on someone who won’t reciprocate. i’m just wondering if my partner is that type of person. them having autism also makes this difficult. they do have points where it really seems like they care, but there’s still no effort or energy invested in this relationship. we can’t see each other because of winter break, and it honestly feels like we’re homies lol. how do i ask them if they really care or not?",I think my (20M) partner (21F) is being dishonest about being a “very affectionate person”.,18ovwt7,1703299926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ovwt7/i_think_my_20m_partner_21f_is_being_dishonest/,

From that first year a few months in he had erectile disfunction and got mad at me about it, then finally got help because I made him see a doctor, but it still happened and he has refused to address it for many years, refuses physical and psychological help. He's not a bad person I think, just doesn't seem to care, and doesn't care about my sexual or social life. We have constant fights about it as I also quickly outgrew him career/money-wise, I try to be healthy, love to work out...I've tried until I'm blue in the face getting him to come out with me, eat well, travel, want more from life, trying to help him, expensive memberships and self help, nothing sticks and he is the most stubborn person I've ever known. At this point I don't want him in that way anymore and haven't for a long time, but I'm so attached to him. I'm also just empty and don't want anything, feel hideous and dead inside. I've been celibate for years and even tried getting advise from my family who said to accept my fate and sex isn't everything, at least he's not abusing me etc. But he doesn't provide financially either, I pay for holidays or anything special. Recently he's taken months off work unpaid and we're floundering. This isn't the life I want or wanted and I know things need to change, leave, maybe just accept fate as an ugly spinster.

"So my partner and I have been together for about 6 months now, and it's getting around the point that we make sexual jokes towards each other, but neither of us have ever made an actual move. It's not something we've ever brought up with each other either since I think we both just assume neither of us is comfortable with sexual topics/ sex in general?

I know I'm in love with him, and I don't mind if it's something he's not going to be comfortable with since I don't need stuff like that to be happy with our relationship, but I'd also be lying if I said I didn't think about it sometimes.

I'm curious, and I enjoy the thought of us putting that much trust into each other. I like the thought of intimacy.
But I don't want to bring it up if he doesn't want to expand on the intimate sides of our relationship. 

However, we've gotten drunk and he's admitted that he finds me hot and so on, or makes really unfiltered comments towards me. When he's drunk, he acts like he's waiting for me to make a first move, but that's not something I'm comfortable with doing if we're under the influence. (Note, we're legal drinking ages in our locations)

But the next day when he's sober, he apologizes and calls his thoughts 'weird' and 'gross', so I can't tell if he's actually against stuff like that or if he's just embarrassed. I always tell him it's fine, because like, it is. I genuinely don't mind those sorts of comments.

There's also the issue of me not really being wholely comfortable with being touched(?) I'm perfectly fine with giving my partner attention, or the idea of making him feel quote on quote, 'good', but not the other way around. In sexual terms, I'm pretty sure I fall under the category of a service top. I'm not too concerned with that ever being an issue though.

I'm aware that simply talking about this could fix the issue, but I'm worried that if I bring this up with him, the conversation is going to be really stale and awkward, or is going to get cut off all-together. Or that it's going to make him super uncomfortable.

We've been working on communication, but this subject is completely foreign in our relationship, so I'm not sure how to bring it up. It's also kind of regarded with a bit of a 'Taboo' feeling.

I don't want to give the impression that I need this in our relationship, because he has the habit of pushing himself for my sake, and that's the last thing I want.

"Hiii! (Apologies in advance English is not my first language)

I am a 21F and also the oldest daughter, sister to a 19F. Honestly I am at quite a Crux in my life. My parents have always had a dysfunctional marriage. My dad is a good dad but quite literally a manchild, he is emotionally immature, agressive, mean and keeps score for everything and at times his personality makes him quite difficult to deal with. On the opposite side my mom is extremely sensitive, people pleaser, a crier and loves him more than he loves her. He has been clear multiple times said that he doesn't see her as a woman, much less a partner (but she won't listen and still expects something).

 Thus as you might imagine most of the times my sister and I have been her therapist, added to the fact that she doesn't have friends and won't confide in her family. It's been years since the relationship has gotten worse, they fight, he gets mad and she cries a lot. She also seems to have a very little self esteem due to the fact that my father ignores and belittles her. 

A couple years back he wanted to get a divorce but she wouldn't let him, she begged him to stay because we couldn't grow up without a father. Since we were old enough to reason, we've had to be her therapist, which I don't mind bc we love her, but it also ended up with us antagonizing our father and damaging a lot out relationship. We also found out he has a girlfriend? Even if they are still married. We told our mom but it seems as she forgot.

This whole fun and quirky dynamic resulted in me 
and my sister developing quite the fun issues, she had OCD due to the fact that being in such a volatile and unpredictable environment, she needed control on smth. As for me obviously issues in relationships, anxiety and the lack of paternal figures, obviously made me mature a lot sooner, and to be quite honest I see my mom as a friend more than an authority figure. I've gone through heartbreaks and an ADHD diagnosis on my own not to bother them lol. I went to therapy and it helped a lot, but in the end the core problem won't disappear (their marriage) thus I can only control what I feel. 

After this incredibly long context, my mom is extremely heartbroken because she went away to take care of my sister at college for a couple of months (we both study in different out of state colleges). We all came back for Christmas, and when she came back she obviously expected my dad to treat her as a partner (he won't even look at her), thus she is extremely heartbroken and wants to quote ""disappear"" and ""and go back with my sister to her apartment at college"". She has been crying (and my dad pretending he doesn't hear her lol)  and I am at suck a loss on what to do. 

We are a well off family, and if she stayed here at our hometown, she could see her mom and her family, her car and a proper house. But she insists on going with my sister, where my dad won't support her and she has to work a minimum wage job at an ice cream shop (nothing wrong with that) for very long hours (she suffers from two hernias) even if she has a master's degree. I also don't really want her to go with my sister, because she has her own right to live her college experience without sharing a room with my mom and well I share a dorm so she can't come either.

I am at simply at loss on what to do, for years I've kind of mitigated damage but now it's too much. I don't want my sister to burden herself on taking care of my mom as she has been doing, she deserves her own chance at college. Yet my mom won't stay at our hometown because she doesn't want to be hurt by my father, even if it means not seeing her family. I know she is an adult, but I know there must be something else I can do.

 I can try and pay for her therapy from my internship, but also I should start saving because next year I'll be finishing my major and my dad won't support me anymore. And I also want to have fun and travel (as I've been doing) but I feel a little guilty Abt it. Being away for college on my own has released a lot of pressure on me and I've kind of let the situation go, until I see my mom crying again and remember my responsibility.

Thus, I ask all of you as mature people.

How should I deal with the situation? How should I talk to my mother (who is 50), because above all she thinks everything is her fault? Her failed marriage, our lacking mental health. Do you have any solution suggestions haha or similar experiences. 

She refuses to entirely leave my dad, and also meet new people because ""who would look at her"". 

As a side note I am scared that her life leads to this :/ a failed marriage she deserves more in life, she deserves someone who loves her.

 I've found myself in similar relationships (repeating cycles) and it's so scary that my future leads to me marrying a clone of my father and my daughter seeking advice on Reddit.

It's extremely stressful for them to fight all the time, and then them expecting us to be a family.

Whenever we have sex I always feel like it's under the assumption that we won't use protection unless I directly ask him too. I feel like I've made it clear that I get really paranoid about pregnancy and when I would ask him to use one in the past he would but sometimes make an offhand comment about how it ruins it for him, or it doesn't feel good.

  
There is one incident that has kind of been bothering me. We had already had sex once and I made him use one. And then we were going to do it again so I made him get more and I know for a fact he had them in his pocket before we started. So we were doing it and I assumed he had one on because it was dark and I had made it extremely clear I wanted him to wear one (hence making him go leave the room and grab them). But I look down and he wasn't wearing one, he said he would put one on later, but then never did. He didn't finish in me but I still feel like I was disrespected. I didn't use any sort of euphemistic language when I asked him to. I sort of blame myself for not demanding that he pull out and put one on. And now Im left with all this residual anxiety over pregnancy just because having unprotected sex felt better for him? I don't really know what to think. Other than this he is a great partner and treats me well.. I'd like other people's opinions on what to think of this. I can't tell if I'm actually upset by this or just trying to self pity.

"I think I’m missing a key piece and I appreciate all input as I sometimes struggle with certain cues/circumstances (spectrum).

On Tuesday my partner said I should go to therapy for me instead of us the way she first told me to do, and that we could revert back to friends as she didn’t want to lose me in full and would still be supportive as I went. I naturally did not take this well because it was a sudden change (hate those), the original words were taken back (hate that), and I just overall really loved her. After quite a bit of bargaining she still said that “no matter how much we work on ourselves we’re never going to be compatible,” which she said her therapist pointed out to her Monday. It really kicked me while I was down. It seemed clear to me she ruled me out pretty much forever.

But since then, she’s called daily. Even the day after I broke down, she called while I was getting ready for work. In a rare set of events as I’m a creature of habit, I happened to be on her (job’s) side of town yesterday morning so she asked could I grab her breakfast (factory worker, couldn’t leave.) She woke me up today via phone call and legit saved me from missing a flight to see my relatives after 6 months. When I got off the plane and made it out of the airport, we were on FaceTime the entire time until I got home. Went to visit a friend, she called then too (didn’t keep me, saw friend and we said hi and bye which was fine.) One conversation she said she “didn’t know what the future holds.” 

She also still responds to endearing names without any negative reactions otherwise. She won’t do it to me anymore, but I can “honey”/“babes” her all day in just normal conversation and she doesn’t flinch. I have always strayed from using first names unless I’m upset to drive that point home. Is this some sort of orbiting thing I’m falling for? Or false hope? I’ve had people be totally through with me before and the behaviors afterward were so much colder. This feels so different. Is this what a good friend does and maybe I’ve just… never had that either? Or is the shift from “We will never work” to “The future could be different” now that I’m going to therapy potentially indicative of something in the further future? 

A friend of mine said she’s absolutely being a supportive friend and *maybe* if I get my shit together (that being anxiety/rigidity especially, it’s bad), it could possibly go somewhere again at a future date. I struggle to read between lines genuinely, which is something I intend to improve in someone’s office space. Appreciate you all.

"As the tittle states I have this problem with my ex I can’t let go I’ve posted before about this issue , but with no avail , I can’t get past this I think about her and the situation almost daily and if I don’t , I have a dream about it to remind me 😅🥲. I’m trying really hard to get past this considering I struggle with other mental health issues that sort of cause and add onto this. I’ve haven’t been in a relationship since either and I feel like this is one of the problems. 

I do see a therapist but to be honest anyone that sees a therapist’s knows how generic the information they give is pertaining to situations like this is…. Anyone else have you dealt with something similar and how’d you move past it? My biggest problem with the issue is I’m 23 and she’s 24 currently and we lead two very different paths she went to school met a guy there and has a good job , lives alone and seems happier than ever. While I’m at probably the worst period of my life so far single , lonely , broke and depressed.

"I (21F) was at my boyfriend’s (23M) place folding the laundry when I found a clear pouch with a stack of Polaroids in the pile of his unfolded hoodies. I generally trust him and have never snooped his phone / belongings before. I wasn’t going to look through it but given the pouch was transparent, I caught a glimpse of the top Polaroid which showed his hand grasping the breast of a girl. I had a bad feeling about this and so I looked through the rest which reveals a series of intimate photos between him and his ex. I was shocked and returned everything to its original place (back in the messy hoodie pile). 

Later that day, I casually mentioned that I’ve been doing some laundry and his first reaction was to run to the pile of hoodie to “look for something”. He seemed relieved when everything appeared to be in its original place and I just left it at that. 

I understand it is normal for people to watch porn and stuff, but is keeping your intimate photos with your ex acceptable? Moreover, I feel uneasy about his reaction when I mentioned the laundry… His ex did call him two weeks ago asking to get back together - and he told me he rejected her but did not tell her about us (we’ve been together 4 months now) because he claims “she’s going through a lot” and simply “cannot break it to her”.

"i was dating this person for two months (i know it doesn’t sound like a lot, but bare with me). we talked every single day, sent a ton of messages and really were trying to get to know each other. we also went on a decent amount of dates for living so far from each other (about an hour depending on traffic). they even told their mom about me. i then went on vacation with my friend, something that i had planned almost a year before i had met this person. it was about 3 weeks long, and they knew this going into dating me, it was actually one of our first convos. right before i left, we had a date and ended up having sex for the first time. for me, it was very intimate and way more vulnerable of an experience that just a normal fuck. anyways, it’s still fine between us for the next couple days. i go away and then their communication just completely goes to shit. i try to brush it off and think that they want to give me the space to be on vacation and explore with my friend. when i get back, we are still chatting, but it’s still extremely minimal. i got back on a friday and that tuesday they told me that they were unable to see me anymore. they said that while i was away, they got sick and it just brought up a lot of feelings that they didn’t know were unresolved. for me, i just keep feeling like i did something wrong. i miss them a lot, but i also am unsure of them because of how they’ve treated the situation. everything was going so great before i left, so i’ve just been confused about how this lead up to this.

"I know this isn't a clear cut answer of yes/no and aware I may get confirmation of some displays of narcissism.  
So I've (M34) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (31F) we've moved in together for about a year. Initially the rose tinted glasses were on and I ignored the red flags. So a bit about her. She get up in a household where the mother was hardly present and the father had his thumb down on everything in the household. Whenever GF tried to express different opinions or do their own thing the father would go into fits of rage and disown her and then next time would take what they said back. There had been instances where father also threatened to kill GF as well. For her own safety she moved out on her own.  
Some things I've now noticed where I'm trapped in the cycle would be, when we have a dispute or difference in opinion, I'm given the silence treatment or she'd type something in whatsapp only to delete it moments later so I can't see what was said. She'd make passive aggressive comments like ""it's ok, I know you don't love me"". Moments later she'd buy me a gift/ present out of the blue. Or we'd sit down and try to talk it out but I'm met with a lot of compliments and praise. Such as ""Remember when we first met that I told you that I'd accept you whole flaws and all and that I wouldn't try to change you and let you be you. ""I feel like this would be the hoovering stage where she's trying to let me guard down. The constant violations of boundaries EG. We both WFH for work and she comes in whenever she wants and sometimes during calls. I've expressed to her that this is disruptive to my work and she doesn't take it too well. Or when I need time to wind down or suffering from burnout, I play games to recharge. I firmly tell her that I need this time without interruption and yet she still comes into the room When I point out things in the relationship that I feel aren't working for both of us. EG she over apologises for everything and I ask her what is she apologising for and that this is really deteriorating the quality of the relationship because I'm left confused as to what I've done to for her to apologise. When I called that out she told me that I have a constant moody/ dark face and that if I didn't have that she wouldn't be under the impression that she's done something wrong. Does this sound like deflection and redirection? From the way I see it is like this, ""I wouldn't be doing this thing if you didn't do this to me first"" So it feels like something I've raised is being pointed back at me as the root cause for this unhealthy dynamic.  
She's recently graduated from her masters and I said I'd go with her interstate to be there at her ceremony. We've arranged the flights and accommodation and accounted for the right amount of time to board the flight. She tried to check in and apparently she's missed the check in by 4 minutes and that she had to book another flight. She told me that this was meant to be her graduation trip and that she should've never listened to me. So I'm responsible for someone's inability to check in time? When I brough that up and asked for clarification ""what did you mean by that?"" she said that this was her big thing and that she should've planned it all and when I tried to come back to the point on ""Why did you say you shouldn't have listened to me"" It came back around to her initial response.  
She's told me the other day that she's done some reading and that I display symptoms of schizoid personality disorder. Why did she say that? Well I'm an introvert by nature and large crowds or social gatherings leave me drained and I need time to recharge. She's told me that the amount of times I burn out is abnormal and this isn't within the normal range. She told me that I lack empathy and she's said as an empath herself the amount I have is very disturbing and low compared to of normal people. She's told me that I come across as aloof, disconnected or apathetic and that when receiving praise I don't receive it positively? In my defence, my outlook on life is that if it's not within my control, don't worry about it. There's no point in trying to worry or fight against something one has no control over.  
It's come to a point where I have to make notes/ journal down our interactions so that I'm not misinterpreting things or reflect on what was said to get a better understanding. I'm constantly on high alert and anxious and now believing I may have schizoid personality disorder myself. (not sure if this is a gaslighting attempt to make me believe that I'm the one with an issue)  
She constantly asks whether I'm going to leave her and at first I was replying with no but these days as these small things pile on I am considering the option. Our lease ends in March so I need make a decision.

"How to get over a crush?

I (24f) have a huge crush on an internet friend of mine (27m). We have never met in person and there are no plans to. I have known him since 2017, we use to talk every couple of months for a few days and then wouldn’t talk for a few months. 

Now, about a month ago. We have a snap streak going and are each others number 1 best friend (juvenile, i know. but here we are). Despite this, he is horrible at texting back. sometimes it’s a few texts a day, just the streak message, or he will just suddenly disappear from the conversation and not reply until the next day with a totally different topic. Other times he will be texting back almost immediately and it’s deep in depth conversations that we are both invested in. We have sexted a handful of times, but only the first two weeks. It feels very clear that he is not interested in really pursuing anything. 

Unfortunately I have someone managed to develop a crush on this man to a pretty big extreme. How tf do i stop being so damn sad that this man isn’t texting me back and doesn’t want to develop a relationship with me? I keep thinking about him nonstop and want to not, lol. I have a few men who live in my city that i’ve been texting (like dating apps). and I want to put my full effort into developing a real relationship. Which, tbh if he said tomorrow he wanted to commit to me and start making plans to meet, I would 100% do it. But, I don’t think that will happen and I’m trying to not get caught up on that tiny possibility and move past the crush. Somehow i am so extremely stuck on this man i’ve never even met. I ideally want to stay friends. I use to be so unbothered by the sporadic and inconsistent texts. I also genuinely enjoy our conversations. I just do not know how to proceed further.

So when we first got together he was so loving , like the way he acted . We went out and did things together all the times, he picked up when I was sad and got me flowers as did it. 
Now we're 4 years in 1 year married. I do all cooking and cleaning , run his bath , do snack rings for him , make sure he has his meds. I ask him to come clubbing with me I'm 21/he's 26 he refuses says he doesn't like them . I constantly show I love him all the time in every way possible. There's no spark in us I know I feel hard saying it but he doesn't show he loves me , he says it every now and again but is the words enough He never runs a bath , never buys flowers , refuses to even go on a walk with me . He's always up for going out with his work mates but never me , if we go out it's a hour at most then he's back to gaming but others he's litterally out like 16 hours for. He complains I work too much but when I'm home he doesn't want to do anything says he just enjoys my presence there. 
 I love him so much but I don't know what to do I feel like his mum like I'm taking care of him , I've spoke to him about how I feel but he says I'm just too needy.

"My Husband and I got married this year, we also just got back from our honeymoon and finances are tight, like almost everyones.  
My husband and I went around our house to sell as many things as we could to be able to afford Christmas presents this year because I brought home covid last week from my co-worker who knew they had it but didn't care and both my husband are still recovering (tested negative yesterday but still recovering) So we both had to take unpaid time off work since we used all our annual leave.  
The issue about going to my parents place for Christmas (we would have to leave today) is that they live over 9 hours away from us. We would have to drive as plane tickets are extremely expensive but so is fuel. We also forgot to book our dogs in early enough to a kennel so everything was booked out.  
So a 9 hour trip with 3 dogs in the car, one is 6 months old and just grasped the concept of toilet training, one is extremely reactive and the other is an angel.

"Hello. I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now and I think it’s time for us to part ways since we are trying to go into 2 different career life choices and because she’s just an overall burden on my life.

I’ll explain her personality: she has extreme anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. She has hardcore mood swings and gets angry/anxious over the smallest things. She has a lot of body image issues due to her weight. I have to treat her like my own baby and do every chore for her. She can’t drive and she has terrible grades. I have to do her homework sometimes and I do her tests when they’re online. She has every problem in the book, but despite all that I still love her and I don’t see her as lesser of a human for her issues. The problem arises when she takes up too much of my time and money. She’s never worked a day in her life and she doesn’t even try to move forward with her life besides school. I recommend therapy for her every single day to the point where she gets angry and annoyed with me even though I only want her to get better. She’s never even attempted to get help, just lies about trying. She’s super picky about food so I have to buy her specific foods every time  or else she doesn’t eat. She gets angry when I reccomend healthier stuff. She hates my humor and the stuff I like so I just have to shut the fuck up instead of talking to her because she just doesn’t care. All our conflicts arise because of her mental illnesses. She even admits it. She always tells me I deserve better. 

I still love her because she makes me see the world differently. Our few good times are very very good and we have likes and some beliefs in common. No woman has ever loved me as much as she has and I’ve been so alone.
Now she wants to go to school in Japan and wants me to go with her. I don’t want to go because I’m just not ready to move to a new country and learn a new language . I have no money to do so anyways. I think our time is over. 

I want to end this, but I don’t want to destroy her already extremely fragile mental state. She’s the type to do something drastic if I would to leave her. I’m her only real support because her family sucks and her friends are all too busy with their own lives. I feel so desperate I don’t know what to do.

I met a male friend about a year ago. Let's call him John. John was new in town and I recommended my local favorite bar to him as a hangout. 

Over the course of the past year John has become progressively more obsessed with this bar in a really weird way.

He drinks there - usually alone - practically every night. If I drop by the bar he becomes clingy and will intrude on private meetings I'm having there with other friends. 

Despite being a fully grown adult John's obsession seems to be drinking as many happy hour drinks as he can at this bar. 

He speaks of practically nothing else. Friends he's made through the bar. Upcoming events at the bar. Who's working shifts at the bar. 

I like John as a person but am beginning to find him very unpleasant company. He repeats himself continuously, buts in on conversations and seems surly and depressed unless he's drunk enough. 

I feel bad for the guy. He's alone in a new city. But I also don't want to get sucked into a spiral of alcoholism with him so have begun cutting back on contact with him (not responding to every text, declining invites to come meet in the pub etc). 

I don't feel like it's my place to comment on his drinkings given that he's older than me but should I? Is drifting away without providing a reason acceptable?

So… let’s start from the beginning. I’m 99.9999% sure my father is a narcissist along with the majority of his family. He feels the need that everything needs to swept under the rug and forgotten about even when someone has laid their hands on you and will often blame the victim for continuing to create ‘tension’ by not moving on. I suspect it’s an ‘image’ or ‘saving face’ thing because he always compares how my siblings and I are like with my mothers side and how we are different with his family - his side has done some messed up stuff like get physically violent, throw tantrums, inappropriate attention-seeking behaviour at parties by causing numerous scenes like leaving a party because someone did a group wave and didn’t personally say hello to them or when someone forgets to say hello, leaving parties because they didn’t like where they were seated and are generally judgemental. He also has a thing where he feels the need to always support them and can’t see what they are doing is wrong-often blaming us instead -like I get it’s your sister, but she’s acting like an entitled brat. Example: I got engaged and made a public announcement, they never congratulated me, I didn’t say anything because I honestly didn’t care but my grandparents sure did and asked me for months if they congratulated me, dad later blames me because I didn’t call them, my response was to calmly inform him I didn’t call anyone and everyone else managed to congratulate me, including those of the same familial level. He gets frustrated and goes on a rant about respect (this is the same aunt who wished me happy birthday and later called me a disrespectful liar and how my siblings don’t deserve our family name).


I just had an argument (not really, I verbally told him I’m not engaging in conversation until he calmed down and he got angry and frustrated, I just reiterated my point by staring at him and repeating myself whilst continuing wrapping Christmas presents- I will admit, it was low-key entertaining to watch a full grown adult throw a temper tantrum because I wasn’t giving him what he wanted) he later called me rude and unable to talk to people properly, even though he was the one yelling? Yeah, don’t know how that works. He also has this thing where he continually brings up crap from 10 years ago in an argument and wonders why we’re not close to him and blames mum for ‘poisoning’ us against him. I’ve literally said to his face that it’s ‘because you hit my mum, I’ve seen you do it since I was a little kid, we all have…how do you expect us to call you a father when you can’t even be a good husband’ (I don’t think he realised I knew) and once I said this he calmed down. Another time he got in my face and it appeared like he was going to be violent and I responded by getting in his face and saying ‘hit me- prove to me that you’re the monster I think you are’ to which he backed away and left.  

When I confront him like this or refuse to engage it seems like he has extreme anger issues, because since I’ve done this he becomes avoidant and refuses to broach the topic even to defend himself (I don’t broach it either, I always have the thing that if you want to talk to me, you need to be respectful otherwise you can talk to a brick wall), and tries to make out that he’s ok and everything’s back to normal (act happy, try to start conversation etc)  but I’m not too sure.",How do I (27F) deal with my dad (60M) who is obsessed with ‘saving face’,18ov580,1703297405.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ov580/how_do_i_27f_deal_with_my_dad_60m_who_is_obsessed/,
"My wife \[32F\] and me \[35M\] have been married for ten years, no kids yet.

Recently we have been going through some rough times, and potentially even looked at divorce due to some big differences in how (and most importantly, where) we want to live the rest of our life.

In the past two months, I started talking to a girl at work using the company chat. A few days ago, it moved over to WhatsApp. Not sexting, and not talking about deep things (or my marriage problems), just stuff like music or tv shows, or some work stuff. But there was some flirting that I always subconsciously knew was flirting, but I never stopped to fully realize it until it was too late. Sounds like bullshit, but it's not (what's the point of posting on reddit if I'm gonna lie).

The next day after moving to WhatsApp, my wife noticed me typing and kindly asked me ""hey who's XY?"" I was totally oblivious of doing anything wrong, so I said ""oh just this girl from work, we talk about random things, exchange some funny memes on games we like and so on"" (which is true).

Actually, the next day I was even listening to some podcast and the word ""cheating"" got mentioned, and I thought yeah weird how people let it come to that. I was absolutely f-----g oblivious that I was in the middle of doing that as well.

My wife, being someone who knows me well and also who's very emotionally intelligent, kept pushing me and eventually made me confess (and realize) that I pretty much fell in love with this girl. I admit, I did. Not as strong as I fell in love for my wife back in the day, but some feelings are definitely there. Or actually, they were. At this point I don't feel anything any more besides being sick to my stomack.

I would like to mention that during this period, I wasn't cold or distant to my wife. I thoroughly enjoyed our time together. But I was developing some feelings for someone else and instead of stopping it right away, I let it go on and on.

After the whole exposure and whole hell breaking loose, I have cut off the contact with the girl and I sincerely regret everything. I love my wife with whole my heart and want to fix things. But I don't know if it's fixable. No redditor can answer that, only she can. If it makes any difference, I never came even close to doing something like this, ever, until now. I have some cheater friends and I hate that stuff.

My question is - how did this happen? If you like someone, which can definitely happen to anybody, do you immediately draw a hard line? How was I so blind and stupid? How did I let it go so far? Enjoying a little bit of excitement and forbidden fruit, thinking I'm not doing anything wrong, but in reality it was very wrong... I learned my lesson the hard way and I would NEVER do something like this again, but I'm afraid it came at a cost of ruining my marriage.

"I (21f) don’t want to rekindle my friendship with a ex friend(20F) after us falling out

This is gonna be a long story and I apologize, but I’ll try my best to summarize the events.

I (21F) was friends with a girl called Amy (fake name,20F) for a year now. I used to consider her my best friend and I would come and talk to her about anything. Now I suffered from chronic depression throughout my teen years but I’ve been seeing a therapist on and off due to work and life events not giving me time to follow up with my appointments.

A months ago, I got the news that my father passed from a stroke and it destroyed me mentally, as a result, I hid away from friends and family and whenever I did hang out with them, I unintentionally let out my negative emotions which I acknowledged was wrong and seeked helped.

This Monday, Amy confronted me and told me how she no longer felt safe being around me as she feared my mental health was going to ruin her own health and asked to end our friendship and asked that I give her space/ no contact. Although I was upset, I understood and let it happen. 

Today was one of friends birthday and we celebrated by going out and getting drinks and Amy was invited as well. Throughout the whole night, I greeted Amy, made small convo whenever she asked me questions but otherwise, I remain to give her space as she requested. 

Tonight while on my way home, I recieved a call from Amy saying that, shortly after everyone went their separate ways, Amy felt that I was so rude to her when she tried to talk to me as she wanted to rekindle the friendship again and that, it made her begin to feel uh, not wanting to be present anymore and how she said that me ignoring her was the cause for making her feel like that. She ended the call with her saying that “I have to make this up to her”  

I truly don’t know how to feel in response to that. I wasn’t trying to ignore her at all, I wanted to give her space as she requested. I don’t even know what the hell to tell her

What is an appropriate response to this?",I(21f) don’t know what to do with my ex friend (20F) after we had a falling out,18ov38h,1703297226.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ov38h/i21f_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_ex_friend_20f/,
"I know this isn't a clear cut answer of yes/no and aware I may get confirmation of some displays of narcisissm.  
So I've (M34) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (31F) we've moved in together for about a year. Initially the rose tinted glasses were on and  I ignored the red flags. So a bit about her. She get up in a household where the mother was hardly present and the father had his thumb down on everything in the household. Whenever GF tried to express different opinions or do their own thing the father would go into fits of rage and disown her and then next time would take what they said back. There had been instances where father also threatened to kill GF as well. For her own safety she moved out on her own.  
Some things I've now noticed where I'm trapped in the cycle would be, when we have a dispute or difference in opinion, I'm given the silence treatment or she'd type something in whatsapp only to delete it moments later so I can't see what was said. She'd make passive aggressive comments like ""it's ok, I know you don't love me"". Moments later she'd buy me a gift/ present out of the blue. Or we'd sit down and try to talk it out but I'm met with a lot of compliments and praise. Such as ""Remember when we first met that I told you that I'd accept you whole flaws and all and that I wouldn't try to change you and let you be you. ""I feel like this would be the hoovering stage where she's trying to let me guard down. The constant violations of boundaries EG. We both WFH for work and she comes in whenever she wants and sometimes during calls. I've expressed to her that this is disruptive to my work and she doesn't take it too well. Or when I need time to wind down or suffering from burnout, I play games to recharge. I firmly tell her that I need this time without interruption and yet she still comes into the room When I point out things in the relationship that I feel aren't working for both of us. EG she over apologises for everything and I ask her what is she apologising for and that this is really deteriorating the quality of the relationship because I'm left confused as to what I've done to for her to apologise. When I called that out she told me that I have a constant moody/ dark face and that if I didn't have that she wouldn't be under the impression that she's done something wrong. Does this sound like  deflection and redirection? From the way I see it is like this, ""I wouldn't be doing this thing if you didn't do this to me first""  So it feels like something I've raised is being pointed back at me as the root cause for this unhealthy dynamic.  
She's recently graduated from her masters and I said I'd go with her interstate to be there at her ceremony. We've arranged the flights and accommodation and accounted for the right amount of time  to board the flight. She tried to check in and apparently she's missed the check in by 4 minutes and that she had to book another flight. She told me that this was meant to be her graduation trip and that she should've never listened to me. So I'm responsible for someone's inability to check in time? When I brough that up and asked for clarification ""what did you mean by that?""  she said that this was her big thing and that she should've planned it all and when I tried to come back to the point on ""Why did you say you shouldn't have listened to me"" It came back around to her initial response.   
She's told me the other day that she's done some reading and that I display symptoms of schizoid personality disorder. Why did she say that? Well I'm an introvert by nature and large crowds or social gatherings leave me drained and I need time to recharge. She's told me that the amount of times I burn out is abnormal and this isn't within the normal range. She told me that I lack empathy and she's said as an empath herself the amount I have is very disturbing and low compared to of normal people. She's told me that I come across as aloof, disconnected or apathetic and that when receiving praise I don't receive it positively? In my defence, my outlook on life is that if it's not within my control, don't worry about it.  There's no point in trying to worry or fight against something one has no control over.  
It's come to a point where I have to make notes/ journal down our interactions so that I'm not misinterpreting things or reflect on what was said to get a better understanding. I'm constantly on high alert and anxious and now believing I may have schizoid personality disorder myself. (not sure if this is a gaslighting attempt to make me believe that I'm the one with an issue)  
She constantly asks whether I'm going to leave her and at first I was replying with no but these days as these small things pile on I am considering the option. Our lease ends in March so I need make a decision.

"My partner [24M] and I [23F] are currently contemplating a breakup and trying to work through a rough patch. For context, he is currently in his first year of medical school which we moved 5 hours away from our hometown together for. I’m currently working full time in our new city and in my first year of a full time online grad school program. Needless to say we’ve been under a lot of stress the past few months with us both managing our various stressors and we didn’t show up for each other the way we should’ve - frankly we had moments where we let the stress impact our relationship and weren’t very supportive or nice. There was a brief period several weeks ago where he was taking every effort to avoid being home because he didn’t want to be around me anymore. For additional context, he has a very avoidant response to stress and I have a very anxious response so I of course latched on harder because I didn’t feel validated while he withdrew more. We also weren’t having conversations about this stuff as it came up which made it way worse. As you can imagine, the energy got pretty negative. 

Fast forward to this past weekend, I finally sat down and forced a conversation even though it was uncomfortable. We discussed what’s happened and I asked if he wanted to try to work on the relationship or break up. We agreed that we want to fix it if possible because neither of us wants to break up. We still love each other and our little family (including ourselves and our 3 cats). We planned on spending our lives together until this point- we got rid of a lot of the furniture we had separately, invested in joint things for our home, and trusted each other enough to move 5 hrs away together from everyone we know to support his dream. Neither of us could foresee ourselves in this situation. Now he says he struggles to envision our future together because he doesn’t feel connected anymore. He said anything and everything made him feel connected to me in the past but now hardly anything does. I also feel a disconnect but not to the same degree. 

We are trying to find ways to reconnect but struggling. We are talking more, having daily check ins and addressing difficult feelings as they arise, and trying to maintain intimacy through both platonic and/or sexual physical touch daily. I am making efforts to verbally acknowledge my appreciation for him, planning activities to do together, staying curious about his life and his interests. He says he’s just not feeling that connected to me through these things and I can tell he feels guilty because he wants it to work and it’s not. I have reminded him throughout the process that he is not obligated to keep trying if he thinks it won’t go anywhere but he maintains that he wants to keep trying for us. This is significant as in our past relationships we have both tended to give up and run when it gets hard.  Is there anything else we can try? How long do we try before giving up?

TLDR; My [23F] partner [24M] and I are trying to rekindle our relationship after a difficult and stressful period but our efforts to communicate/regain intimacy don’t seem to be working despite the fact that we still love each other and are both trying to fix it.

As of late, he’s been putting extra pressure on me to make money and be motivated. I really want to and try hard to do so im in therapy and move at my own pace, however, he has moments where he says things like “your broke” “you think I owe you something” “ im tired of doing for you” and completely shuts me out, blocks me, goes days without talking to me, and im left to chase behind him to try to explain im doing my best. He doesn’t understand when he does these things it takes me steps back because I feel unworthy when he makes those comments to me and I begin to self loath &amp; takes up my days. This is a cycle that keeps repeating, I finally finished a paid project I’ve been procrastinating on for 2 months and his response when I was excited to show him was “why are you telling me” completely blew me off.

"Me (21f) and my bf (21m) have been together for 8 months. We are the complete perfect match on paper. We laugh together constantly, i think he is attractive, we have incredible sex, we have super similar hobbies, similar views on life, similar political stances, and we both have extremely healthy habits together (think going to the gym regularly together as well as eating healthy). He just moved in with me 2 months ago. This is his first major relationship, as well as mine.  
I have an incredible opportunity to move from the USA to Europe next year. The deal is done, and this is something I have been clear about since we started dating, that I would be moving to Europe next year. I cannot emphasize enough how life changing the opportunity I have is. and he has said that he is ecstatic to come with me for this opportunity.  
All of his family and friends currently live where we are right now, and the place I am moving I have friends and family, but he has nobody. I have never pressured him to move with me, I have just told him that is what I am doing. He is free to do what he wants but it would be his choice entirely.  
This all sounds perfect right?!?!?! right?!!?!??! I don't know what is wrong with me but I keep continuously thinking of breaking up with him. I think about it so extremely frequently, i DREAM about it multiple times a week and wake up feeling awful and guilty.  
I have absolutely no reason to think about breaking up with him. We have had problems (he never plans dates, sometimes i feel like an accessory to him, he is extremely protective of my appearance, and has issues with me drinking 1 alcoholic beverage), but we very quickly resolve them and move on. We are an excellent team and living together has been extremely easy as we divide chores very well.  
I keep having these nagging feelings of boredom and a lack of excitement about him. We have never had major issues, our relationship has been GOOD. I haven't had to give our relationship any hard thought at all, it maybe just comes naturally. He is my best friend, and I love spending time with him.  
like the excitement thing is what is bothering me most, will this same feeling of boredom return whenever i date someone else?  
I keep having really large feelings of guilt about permanently moving abroad, with him uprooting his life to come with me. He is too good for me, to kind, and the fact that he wants to do this just to stay with me is insane. He is very deeply in love with me, and I feel like a villain for even coming close to these thoughts.  
There is another component where if he achieves his dreams, my relationship with him will falter. He is looking at the entertainment industry, and for a job which would allow him to travel constantly. If he achieves this (which is currently far away) he would be living a lifestyle antithetical to what i want.  
I cannot for the life of me understand why I keep thinking about breaking up with him. It would make everything worse, I would lose my best friend, and i would undoubtedly severely regret it, but also I have this nagging feeling.  
I don't even have another partner in mind which is so awful. I have NO REASON TO FEEL LIKE THIS. That is my vent, I feel like an asshole, I am the villain of this story  
He absorbs a lot of my time and is very interested in where i am at all times if i am not home.

Me and fiance have been planning the wedding and getting input from our families, visiting them, having get togethers etc. The problem is sometimes issues arise between the family and always when he expressed a concern about my family that something annoyed him I analysed the situation and supported him when my family was an AH (99% of the time), siding with him telling him that they had no right to do that etc. When the problem was the other way around, mainly his mom with typical overly attached controlling MIL behaviour causing me to get upset he would say no bad thing about her and finds anyone else the culprit, telling me to be the bigger person etc. I told him that I would like to sometimes hear him say that she is no saint and have his support in venting about her - something like ""Yes what she did was bad"" just for validation. He told me he would speak no evil about the people he loves and feels he creates conflict by saying this. I feel like he is still treating his mom like his current family by doing this, not me.

"Husband and I are looking to buy our first house after renting for the last 5 years. I’ve wanted to move for over a year but my husbands company was doing layoffs and we weren’t sure if we would affected. Luckily we weren’t and now have the freedom to move. We have a mortgage in principal so just need to find the right house. 

I’ve found a house that ticks every single box, it has all our needs and wants, and is in budget (although at the very top of it). We’ve been looking together for two months, and I’ve been looking casually online for the last year. We haven’t seen any that are anywhere near as good as this and I have a feeling it’s going to be gone very quickly. 

My husband likes it a lot too but doesn’t want to put an offer in because he wants to “wait and see what else comes along”. I don’t know why he’s saying this, there’s no reason for us not to buy this house. He thinks because it’s the first one we’ve seriously considered buying we should wait for another serious option and weigh them up. He doesn’t think the house will go quickly and said even if it does it just means we wait for another good one. 

I don’t understand why he’s pushing the brakes on this. Is there something I’m missing here? It’s frustrating me a lot because we really do need to move soon as we’re trying for a baby and I really don’t want to go through all this stress during a high risk pregnancy (I have health issues).

"Many of you may not know my situation but I am a young person that is dealing with relationship issues. Such as arguments, I even broke up with him twice. He has gotten me well.. yk in a place where I cannot leave. We have our positive outcomes but it's just makeup sex... I hate it and love it. But I am genuinely trying to put aside my insecurities to love him. I have written this essay for him of my feelings and perspective. I will make some more edits but here is my First Draft.  
There might be typos sorry Should I confront him soon yes or no?  
You matter to me, but it hurts to keep trying to reach you when you don't seem to care. I can't keep investing time in this when you don't make a similar effort. I understand where you are coming from. What hurts me is the sarcastic moves and smart comments you make. Even if it’s just worse I can’t stand that disrespect. I know I hurt you in the past and tried to make an effort to show how I feel but you make it hard. I try to put it my way like you said to and it’s not going to work. I know you will find a girl similar to me. I know I a replaceable and not good with words but you hurt my feelings still. The times I show appreciation, faith, and pure effort to make you feel happy it goes to nothing. I know I am young but I still care for you just as much as any girl can. I have put my own needs aside just so I can be here for you All I ask in this relationship is not humility but faith, appreciation, and equivalent effort. I know I have shown some toxic tendencies but my love is just as pure. I wrote this not to argue but to explain how I am feeling. I do not want to leave. I have seen your pattern though. By this, I mean how you reflect some of your negative feelings on me as well. I just want us on the same page. Even if I cannot communicate properly in person the words you said hit me deep inside. I know I have said some words I am not proud of but so have you. I have forgiven and forgave each moment just for the effort I put to get into waste. These patterns you have shown me were reassuring when I tried to go and then back the same way. Clearly, in these chats, I have shown improvement, yes I fuck up and that's okay at least I can show what I am doing with that issue and try to fix it. With you, I cannot judge but I will tell you my perspective of what I see. I see your sarcastic jokes and negative mindset. I have proven to judge myself and others. I have been toxic and nasty, that wasn't right. Now here are the positive outcomes, such as ME telling you good morning, trying to call you, putting in an effort, and even cutting out my flaws to show I am the person you met. You haven't been doing so well either. I know adult shit and life can fuck up your day. I try to comfort and show the side I am, you have not shown to accept it. You want me how YOU want me and not how I am. You have manipulated the situation. Me breaking down on the ground wasn't enough for you to show I am tired not of my life but of the time and love for myself on to you. Yeah I know I have fucked up BAD but my emotional effort to even pick up the broken pieces of me and you I have broken on my own has cut me to bleed out and be in so much sadness and anxious feelings. I am not upset or happy. I care and I think I have more of an emotional attachment to you rather than a physical one. You get upset when I put myself down even though my attempt to do my best to carry these emotions saddens me. For weeks I have been crying almost every night myself to sleep, with constant nightmares and good dreams of me and you together. That is bad, sometimes I wake up gasping for air from this anxiety I feel. Although I don't have issues like you have emotionally I feel at my lowest I can’t bear to be happy for a whole day straight. I should say positive emotions but those are temporary for me. I don't even know what's going on with my body. I will be discharged from therapy due to a lack of communication, and problems at home will affect me. I have fought with my sister physically not even playfighting. I was sore for 2 days. I won't speak for you but this is my perspective. I wish I didn't care this much to write this all out but I do and it will take me a long time to get over you. Trust me I know, your bare minimum effort to show you care is all I accept. I know you have been through shit and things you don't deserve. The past cannot shape you to be you. If you keep this mindset I can’t bear to be with you anymore. This is not a competition to see who has it worse but this is a written explanation by me of how I love you too much. You have sworn to protect me but all you have done was hurt me. I have made some big issues in your life and you could've left me but you didn't. That doesn't mean you can't put in the things I do for you as well. You have been hurt and lied to but that will not be the case in this relationship. You deserve a lot such as what I have tried to give you. You have told me that you care and love me. Even though you don't have to say it twice maybe some reassuring can help.  
I cannot leave him because let's just say we went unprotected one night. Someone please show me how I can show I care but will not make it about me. I will not run away anymore and face him.

Its important to note, he travels for work, and is only in town a few weeks out of the year, but I have also went to visit him multiple times. He'll be in town but leaves before I have a day off. He also lives a little over an hour drive from my house. My only day off is xmas, and i want to spend it with my father. At first he said he understands and whats to be there for me /support me. My work schedule is awful right now, I get off at 11, sometimes 1am. So I will sleep until 10 in the afternoon the next day, and when I wake up I basically have to start getting ready to go to work. I don't have a lot of time and I also have to make sure my dad has something to eat. 

He's leaving before I have a day off but also coming back to town 1 week later. 

He said he would be there for me, I took that as he wont blow my phone up with emotionally neediness (this is a big issue we've talked about multiple times). 

But now he's saying that I'm ""not allowing him to see me"" and ""what is he suppose to think. I mentioned we can do brunch or something even tho it would be inconvenient for me. 

Now he's saying ""you're obviously seeing someone else"" ""if you don't want to see me forget about it"" ""I canr believe you'd treat me like this when I come home"" 'you did this not me"" 



Am I being unreasonable? I'm actually very upset he's putting pressure on me like this. I find it extremely selfish. He always resorts to this kind of toxic behavior when he is upset/doesn't get his way. 


He bought my a nice Xmas gift, and he keeps saying ""it was for nothing, i got you your gift for nothing"" am I taking it the wrong way when I feel like when he gives me gifts he thinks he's entitled to me/my time, even over things like my job and family?",My (37m) SO is putting pressure on me (30f)to see him when I have been busy/want to spend time w my dying father.,18outed,1703296360.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18outed/my_37m_so_is_putting_pressure_on_me_30fto_see_him/,
"My \[29f\] boyfriend \[29\] is my best friend - and we started to go out for that very reason. I was 24, very lonely in my new city, and I think perhaps the reason why started a relationship with him in the first place is because I was scared of losing him as a friend, and equated that with wanted to be with him romantically. Now it seems clear to me that I never really fell for him, and was forcing something that wasn't coming naturally me to me.  
I am now 29. I have had some rough times in the last few years, out of which I have just started to emerge. He has helped me through this times, being kind, loving, and supportive. But, as I regain more and more confidence, and start to widen my friendship group beyond his, and begin to achieve my own goals in life, I am beginning to wonder whether I will only be able to grow as a person if I leave this relationship. I want to have the freedom to be my own person - something I have never done. My whole 20s were spent hiding behind him, so much that to many people I had no identity beyond being his girlfriend - and I was so miserable and full of self-loathing, I was content in that role.  
Now, the only way I can really move on in life is to shake off the identity entirely. Even though he is good. Even though he is kind. I feel so terrible, but I feel this is true.

"Looking for support at this point, or someone who has gone through something similar. My girlfriend(F21) and I (M21) of almost two years broke up a few days ago. Throughout our entire relationship she struggled with her mental health. She has really bad anxiety, ADHD, depression, and compulsive thoughts that her anxiety don’t help with. It was never something that I wasn’t ready to stick by her side for. We lived together for a year (we are both about to be 22) and it was the best but hardest time. We didn’t fight, but a strain was put on our relationship because I was doing all of the cleaning, laundry and taking care of our cat. I never ever made her feel like a burden for it though, I pushed it down for the worst honestly until I finally found the courage to talk about it. It was a fight and she said that I wasn’t recognizing what she did do for me which was make dinner for us every night. I was always very appreciative and thanked her every night and she wanted to do dinner because she liked to cook and it was the one thing she could contribute. When we lived together she would sleep in until noon and go to work at 2pm. I asked her multiple times if she would like to have a routine with me and wake up to go on a walk or have breakfast together and she never entertained my ideas. I was never being a clean freak, I just wanted things to be put away after using them or changing the paper roll when it was out. Putting the laundry in/near the bin instead of on the floor. Little things that just built up in my mind over time. I love her so much and all I wanted to do was help her through this. I had felt her pulling away for awhile but she had told me it was because she wasn’t doing well mentally. Another thing is, I am a trans man and she is bisexual, but has never been with a woman. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times she ever went down on me. I have found myself in a previous relationship in the same situation where our sex life was one sided. She argued that she needed to be shown what to do and it was my fault. I feel like if she wanted to she would have made the advances to show an interest in wanting to learn. She was insecure because she had only been with cis men, but she was the first person who I was willing to try and learn how to go about that with. I ended up never wanting her to because it didn’t seem like she wanted it. During sex there was only ever foreplay for her, she wouldn’t even touch me sensually or touch my body. I would just go down on her and it was over. It got to a point where I knew I wouldn’t get anything out of it so I started to resent having sex with her and we eventually stopped. She also brought up while breaking up with me that I always had these intentions and never went through with them, but I feel like I did so much on my side to make our relationship work. I put so much work into myself to try and be there for her and learn to be patient with her when her anxiety was getting the best of her. Another person wouldn’t have dealt with it in that manner and would’ve treated her differently. I never loved her differently because of her mental health. She said that she has never been alone since high school and she needs to learn to have her independence. She said she has gradually been feeling differently and that this isn’t what she needs anymore. She also brought up that right before we got together she discovered she was bisexual and never had an opportunity to explore that. I just feel then we should’ve never gotten together then. She says I didn’t do anything wrong and that I was wonderful to her and always made her feel loved. Somehow that makes it worse because I don’t know how to process all of this. While I knew we hadn’t been having sex and things were different I never thought it wasn’t something we couldn’t come back from. I was always willing to put in the work but I never got anything back from her. And in her words she was giving me all that she had. She wants to remain in my life and eventually stay friends and while I would like that eventually I am too broken to see her. I want her to be happy and be able to find her independence and finally get her mental health on track. Do you guys think her mental health and her being numb to everything or her medication could have led us down this path? I remember when she started her meds I confided in her that I had read online that someone said they had fallen out of love with their partner and she said that would never happen. I know meds can decrease your sex drive but of course my broken heart makes my mind wander.

"I had a 9-month long distance relationship with this guy (he is American) and then he decided to break up because he said long distance is too hard. After that, we tried no contact but he kept coming back, so we have been talking ever since that (another 9 months so far). We talk about going back together once it’s possible to break the distance. 

Meanwhile, everything is fine, but some days I get pretty annoyed because he often tells me that is hanging out with a specific female friend. They go to trivia bars together, watch horror movies together, exchange Christmas gifts. Often just the two of them, even though they’re part of a bigger group of friends. One time I asked him casually if he had something more with her, and he said no, that he would never do that because she used to be his best friend’s girlfriend (for quite a long time). 

I’ve met her at least 3-4 times when my ex and I were still dating, and she is a nice person, and was hoping we could stay together. However, I am really bothered by this intimacy they have.

The very few times he has woken up before me, he gets up, uncovers the bird cages and just sits on the couch. Waiting until I get up so I make coffee and feed cats. 
He also doesn't really clean the apartment either, maybe vacuums now and then or will do our laundry. But never cleans up clutter and laundry consists of putting it from the washer to he dryer and leaving it there until I put it into the clean cloths basket (it never gets folded) 

Basically the advice I am searching for is this: 
Would I be unreasonable to sit him down and ask him to do more? I do get three days off a week and he does do all of the dishes and sets the trash out to be valeted (he also cooks food once to twice a week so I have meals for work) 
I do clean and dishes and cat/bird stuff on my days off but I feel like the mess if never ending and I'll never be able to actually have a fully clean apartment.

When I switched schools in 6th grade he was the first guy I knew I wanted to be friends with. I even had a crush on him. We weren't best friends but we were classmates who would relentlessly tease each other. I became friends with my best-ish friend in around the 10th grade and we drifted apart after O/Ls.

She got brand new friends and basically ignored me for like 3 or 4 years. While this falling out happened I was in the same school with the guy. We were casual friends and then became really close friends soon after.

After A/Ls I became friends with my 22F friend again and we've been doing great. She's someone I know I can entrust any secret to and she confided that she really like my guy friend. I asked if I should set them up and she refused (I come from a place where affairs are kinda a big deal). I had no feelings for him at this point. She later said that her attempts to be his friend (logic: first friend then couple) were useless and she would give up on him. Would being the key word here.

Me and him flirt teasingly. We have for a long time and sometimes it feels like its not actually teasingly. I came to realize I have feelings for him and at this point I'm pretty sure he likes me too. I want to take a jump and ask him, or at least lay down the ground so he knows I'm ok with him asking me.

Thus brings about the question, would I be doing something wrong by going for it? I really like the guy and I've known him for a whole and he's really really sweet and fun to be around. We have oodles in common and we always support each other when the other os gojng through something. Not to mention my mom likes him and he's got a great personality. And to add to it, I feel like I'd regret it if I let him go without at least trying.

"My (23m) long term girlfriend (22f) is struggling with major depression. We just had our third anniversary last week and we’re now coming up to Christmas and New Years. My girlfriend has stage 2 autism and is high functioning and has always had a problem with anxiety and depression. However, for the last three years she has been perfectly normal regarding her anxiety and depression levels and has been going great. However, over the last two weeks her depression has skyrocketed and she is having multiple suicidal thoughts each day. 

We have sought professional help with psychology and it does not seem to be helping. Most days during the holidays this year she has not been able to get out of bed. 

I myself sometimes struggle with anxiety and am on medication for it so I am not unfamiliar with her struggle, but I have never faced issues to this degree. 

I have tried everything I can. Supporting her, comforting her, offering solutions, and providing support from psychologists but to no avail. I don’t know what to do next and I need help. I feel as if she is going to descend even further into her depression if I don’t find a solution soon. 

I feel terrible for even thinking this for a split second but suicide seems like the only thing that would remove her from feeling this way. I love her so much that I would do anything to help her feel better, even if it were to allow her to feel nothing. I feel sick even thinking about it. 

I don’t know what to do and I need help. Others in the group what did you do to get through depression? Autistic people as well, how do you find a way to continue forward in life? She is on medication for anxiety and depression but it doesn’t seem to be doing much to help her through this period.

"Was sloppy with taking my birth control pill some months ago and ended up pregnant with this guy I met at work.

He decided he didn't see a future with the relationship a few weeks after our last in-person interaction so contact is slowly fading (we still occasionally text). He said he was fine with being ""friends"" who checked in on each other and nothing more yada yada. 

I'm currently 14 weeks pregnant and not planning on aborting as it goes against my personal morals and religious beliefs even though I am still in school and live with my parents. 

However, I'm not sure how to go about 1. Telling him I'm pregnant in the first place and 2. That I see placing the baby up for adoption is the best decision for both of us. 

He still lives with his parents, works a retail job making roughly 30k a year, and is saving up to move out. The reason I think adoption would be best is that he didn't even want a relationship with me. (Don't get me wrong though, I understand why an almost 30-year-old might not want a relationship with a teenager.)

Where I'm struggling is the fact that I knew I was pregnant really early on and was denying it for a very long time. I was planning on telling him if he ever decided he wanted to call me which he doesn't seem to want to do. It's unlikely I will run into him either even though we live in the same city.

I haven't told my parents if you're wondering. Maybe I should be more concerned about that. I also no longer work at the job where I met him.

Tagging this as NSFW because this post references sexual assault from when I was a minor, even though my current relationship (the one I am asking for advice on) is consensual and is between two adults.

I was sexually assaulted repeatedly by my ex girlfriend when we were both 16, and while I’ve had another relationship in-between the assaults and my current relationship, I was in no state to consent then. I’ve done a lot of recovery work both in and out of therapy since my last relationship, and I’ve never felt about anyone like I do about my current partner. If they wanted to have an entirely sexless relationship, I’d still want to be with them. That said, my sex drive is much higher than theirs, and we’ve discussed the possibility of that being hypersexuality due to trauma. We’ve also discussed the physical similarities between how they look and how my ex girlfriend did, as there was one night when I drunkenly mistook them for her and started spiralling. I hope it never happens again, but due to their evolving relationship with gender and also literal physical similarities to my ex, I know they still draw a comparison between themself and her.

While my partner is primarily a sub, we do occasionally switch it up, and that’s where the problem lies. I truly enjoy being dommed and had fantasised about it long before my assault, though I now recognise they’ve become almost retroactively linked. While in the moment I consent to everything with my partner, I’m worried they doubt me and think they’re hurting me. We’ve discussed this too- they’ve outright said that some things I say in bed with them seem like I’m slipping back into the headspace I was in when I was assaulted. I can’t even fully say they’re wrong.

I don’t think they want to break up with me, nor do I with them.

"TW: Domestic violence 

I’ll start this by saying December is always a rough month. Last year I lost my best friend and home over night. This year I’ve been fired! 

October 11th I started dating a wonderful guy! Only problem is that we worked together. I didn’t care and he didn’t care either. That’s just how we met. I really like a lot of his traits. He really likes me. 

Obviously fucking in the office will cause problems. The only exception is if the couple is dating for marriage. Honestly, that’s our intention. My manager met his fiancé in the business. His manager met her husband in the business. There are several other examples of this. 

Well, my manager was nice to me about it at first. Said we hold each other accountable which is why it worked. Along the way my bf stopped holding me accountable because emotions got involved. 

From the start my manager was giving my boyfriend a lot of shit. I was protected from this. This last month, I became fully aware of my managers feelings about the relationship. 

He kept getting in my boyfriends head. Telling him he will never succeed in the business if I’m more than a friend to him. Asked why he picked me. Every other girl is significantly better.

I lost the most trust in my manager when he used my previous relation against me. I mentioned earlier how last December I lost my best friend and home. That’s because my ex was arrested for aggravated assault / domestic violence. I haven’t seen him since. Last I heard he’s going to NA. 

A month in he broke up with me during the work day. My manager was painting a picture of how awful his life will be with me. Once the day was done I left asap. I didn’t say bye to my manager. I was distraught. 

A week later, we are back on. Haven’t stopped dating since, despite our manager attempts to end the relationship. Now it made the last month hard. But it strengthened our relationship. 

Any time we spend together, the manager is pissed and feels disrespected. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend lives with the manager. Also with 5 other employees, managers fiancé, and baby. 

Now the reason I was fired. Honestly it’s a pretty good reason! I stopped communicating with my manager. I even no called no showed twice. Valid reasons to let someone go. 

I feel a type of way. What if he didn’t try to break us up? I would still have trust for him if he didn’t use my previous relationship against me. He said my ex tried to kill me because I was too much to handle. He didn’t know my ex.

Just lately, I feel like she's kinda coming on to me. The other day, there were 5,6 of us for coffee. And then some of us arranged to go for a drink as well. She said she doesn't have much of an appetite etc so she wouldn't come. Finally we went and she came because she changed her mind and didn't wanna leave her friend (me) by himself. That was a joke between her and one of our friends.

I was going out of the club every once in a while to have a cigarette, she would come and sit with me. While we were inside the club, she asked me at some point ""What do you think? is anyone getting laid tonight?"". Also, because i wasn't in the mood at night, she asked if i am alright. I nodded and said ""you deserve some fun after what you've been through lately"" . And one time when we were out of the club, we found a couple of kittens and asked me if we can come to rescue them the next day.

The next morning, she sent me a good morning and how I feel after the hangover. And 2 days ago, I sent her a message to tell her why she beat me in a game we playetc. and she sent me an apology and something like a joke and then ""how do you wannna get even? what do you want to do to me""

"Been together 5 years and spending time with my family has almost always been a point of contention for us. Family is very important to me and I have expressed to him many times that for me, the person I am with has to have a good relationship with my family and agree to occasional family time. I am talking 3-4 times a year. He does not have a good relationship with his family and struggles to see why I require this. He also feels uncomfortable around my family, they are very welcoming and try to talk to him but he has social anxiety. Earlier this month he agreed to come to my graduation in mid December and Christmas with my family for a day (he hasn’t seen my family in a year). The other day I brought up the logistics of getting there and he said he did not intend on going. He mentioned the typical reasons, feeling uncomfortable, and that he is mentally not feeling up to it (he said being around my healthy family makes him feel bad about his dysfunctional family). I tried to accommodate for his feelings in advance, by having him come for only one day, before my other siblings come (he does better around a few people vs a big group).

"My husband and I have been together for 8 years this February and married for 6.5. When we first started dating I would give him a bj (I enjoy it) but he would always pull me up to move on to intercourse after only a couple of minutes and for as long as we’ve been together he’s only cum one time during oral and we were really drunk and I let him face fuck me (which I’m all for anytime lol). He would occasionally go down on me and I remember he did say once he wasn’t experienced in that area and that I needed to give him direction as to what I liked, to which I did and he did fantastic! Over the last almost 8 years though he has given me head less than probably 10 times. And most of those times that he’s willing is only when he cums before I do and he says go wipe off and I’ll do it and I’ve just said no to that because it’s clear he’s not doing it because he wants to but because he feels obligated. I’ve always really enjoyed oral giving and receiving and I have to have foreplay to be turned on whereas he likes to just stick it in and get to it. Now over the years we have discussed our sex life and made strides in bettering our bedroom time which is great, but every time it comes up, he is very clear that he just does not like oral and it really bothers me. I’ve asked if it’s me and he’s adamant it’s not and I’ve seen his previous porn history and he has never watched that type of content. It’s the one hurdle in our sex life we can’t get over and I don’t know what else to do…

"Dated a girl for 4 years, almost, who lived with me and my family. Outside of the first 6 months (before she moved in), it was essentially hell because I learned the hard way she was BPD.

I tried very hard to reconcile differences and find my way forward. I loved her. I gave the relationship my all, despite the pain. In my worst times, I would tell my family how she was treating me, and was always told that I must just be misunderstanding and that I should try harder. So I did...Spent years doing so. It was hell. It killed me.

My family saw an angel, mostly, on the surface. I knew the woman who regularly ripped my heart out when I just wanted to be loved. It was very on again, off again, but I finally gained enough courage...

Fast forward one year since my break up, I'm with someone fantastic now. Things have moved fast, and now I'm married, but very serious about my new woman. She is unbelievably good to me, even helping me heal from the psychological trauma from before. I cried in front of this woman when I had a very bad moment, and she just held me close and loved me more in the end. We get along better than I could have imagined, and the depth of connection is incredible.

When I split with my ex, I explained to my family that I understand how 4 years of cohabitation and friendship is hard to stop, even if I was ready to move on. I'd ""grieved"" longer, sure... I told them to take some time, make their peace, and find a way out. It has been one whole year. Four months after the break, my sister invited my ex for her birthday, and just weeks ago they partook in a birthday event for my ex. Neither time intending for me to know about it, but it eventually lands in my lap.

I am hurt by this, and I feel like I'm treated as a crazy person for feeling so. Everyone tells me of feelings and people needing time to process, but apparently my feelings don't factor in despite asking nicely. My whole family rejects my ask to move on. My ex is serious with someone new, so I feel that she should spend time with this new guy's family, but they all dance around me instead. 

My feelings are that *if someone treated my sister the way my ex treated me, nobody would be having these get togethers*. I feel that my family should consider how this girl ruined me, and for how long, and be more willing to cut contact - but they're sticking to her. I feel like I come second place - although I understand individual relationships...

This is in the face of the fact I am now married, to the new girl, and despite knowing all of this - my family continues to associate with my BPD ex while juggling with this one. People I talk to in person say I need to be considerate and understanding, but nobody is being considerate of me.

I'm angry. I'm hurt. I ask little from my family and even that is too much. I don't know what to do... I feel like I'm going crazy. My wife is hurt by the notion too, and I don't blame her.

I want to skip Christmas with my family. I feel so turned off and discarded.","Family Interacting With My [29M] BPD Ex [29F], But I'm Married Now To Someone Else.

"Hi everyone, 

first of all thank you all for reading. I appreciate your time and hope you’re doing well. I don’t want this to make it super long so I’ll just go straight ahead about all the signs I see in my brother for a past year and a half: 

- he lost job
- he lost a lot of weight
- he ended up on a street as a homeless for one month 
- he start to talk out loud strange thoughts which don’t make sense (lots of existentional philosophical questions) 
- deconstructing words in a way which does not make sense 
- he start to use very formal language with everyone in a family and then again changing it informal
- he isolated himself and does not see any of his friends 
- he canceled his phone number and I had to beg him for telling me his new one
- he does not take calls
- he stopped to reply (I had to threaten him calling police as well as my divorced parents, once I did call them) 
- he cancels plans all the time (change his mind back and forth) 

For this moment I don’t know his new address. Every conversation with my mom turns a around her depressive episodes. I’ll probably see my brother on 25th of December at my dad’s place. My dad for this moment helps him out financially. My brother does not believe in psychological help and refused to go to see a professional. No one can forse an adult to do so. I’m upset with myself I did not call the ambulance when I once saw him at my place during an anxiety attack. I’m worried that if he does not get help in a right time it will get much worse. 

What is the right way to approach the situation? ",I (30F) suspect my brother (28M) shows signs of schizophrenia.,18ou1hl,1703293915.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ou1hl/i_30f_suspect_my_brother_28m_shows_signs_of/,
"Firstly, I (32M) love her(32M) a lot! But I feel like she's taking more energy than she's giving.

I'm having huge troubles with feeling sympathy for my wife's burnout. We have a baby boy who was prematurely born by 2,5 months. He has always been  healthy and he's a full year soon. He's really a very easy baby to take care off, he's mostly happy, sleeps 10h per night and is easy to care for. Every now and then he needs to be bottle fed some time between 5-7 AM and then goes back to sleep for 2-3 hours.

Due to her burnout she needs to sleep 10-12 hours per night and because of this I have a permanent nightwatch. On top of this we also have a 1 y/o puppy who wakes up 2 times per night who I care for during nighttime too. Our schedule pretty much is I have the baby from 11 PM to 10 AM, go to work (80% workload), get back and have him from 16-20 and then rinse and repeat. Weekends are a 50/50 split aside if nightwatch.

Due to her eczema I do all dishes, cooking and cleaning. She does do laundry tho. I'm the CEO of a crashing company. We recently moved to a house and at the same time I got my driver's licence.

She antisocial and seldomly leaves our home, pretty much never takes the baby out for walks. I myself IS a very social person but stay home not to stress her out. (Yes she is in therapy.)

Like I get that she's exhausted and I know what it's like to have run out of fumes but I just don't know how we're supposed to live like this in the long run when everything is a chore, every mention of planning gives her anxiety, everything that isn't 100% disassociation and recreation is ""hard work"". All this when I have to muster neverending energy to keep marching. And tbh I can't do all the chores often enough or well enough, I just manage to get them done at a good enough ratio for our home to not be a complete embarrassment to our guests the few times we have them.

To be honest I just can't fathom why I chose this, like wtf why. But I still love her to bits and also kid and dog.

"My wife has struggled with mental health issues for the majority of her adult life and was confirmed to have PPD after 2 weeks postpartum. Her anti-depressant dosage was doubled. I work a retail job, with retail hours to support my family. 9:15-7:15 Monday-Friday every weekday. 9:15-4:15 every other Saturday. I wish I could be home more. I have been trying to apply to become a cop to have a real career and support my family. Right now the problem we are facing is the toll being taken out on my wife while I work my jobs hours. I am also the general manager which means many last resort responsibilities fall to me. Lately every day I am asked “can you go in late? Can you come home early?” I actually was lucky that my boss and I were able to come to an arrangement where I could take days like that here and there to help out at home more often than a normal schedule would permit from October through december. Obviously time I miss directly affects my income and I can only afford to miss so much work. 

I have become very frustrated lately because for my wife it’s very easy to ask me to find a job that pays better and has better hours. Like duh easy solution right? Okay where is a job like that? We live in austin and unfortunately i’ve been facing the difficulties of looking for opportunities in a concentrated job market. 

We have made a list of tasks I can fulfill between work shift and sleep and taking time with the baby to help around the house and I am maybe getting through with 75% of it. 

I just wanna know if there’s been other families that have had to face the challenges brought on by having one parent with baby 85% of the time. 

I get at least 2 calls a day where she is sobbing and saying she can’t do this. I genuinely feel so horrible. I understand how difficult this must be for her but she is also so stubborn and it makes me find myself wanting to say “You need to grow up and be the mom you said you wanted to be” now that we are reaching 3 months old I would love if she would reconsider putting in our son in childcare because I dont know how else we would be able to make it.",My(M23) wife(F31) is struggling as new SAHM.

we broke up 1.5 years ago although we still loved each other it wasn’t working out. i still had hopes we’d get back together for about 6 months after, but accepted then it wouldn’t happen. we snowboarded together within those 6 months and you could feel we still loved each other, but when I brought it up, he said essentially he wasn’t interested but still loved me (which is why I accepted we didn’t have a future). 

now, fast forward to a few weeks ago… I saw him at a local bar and cordially checking in with him and said hi. I asked if he was going to a dj set that night that lots of locals were going to. he said maybe, and I said let me know if you’ll be there. that night he texted me he was there and came and found me… we danced the night away, but I wondered if he had come alone just to see me (he said his friend left early, which didn’t make sense for a 5 hour dj set/for around $100). he asked if he could Uber home with my friends and i and I said yes. it was pretty jarring that he was seeing where I lived and meeting my friends because I had come such a long way since we had dated (moved on, found myself, healed myself in some ways). We hooked up and the next morning we talked for hours till he left. okay: one night stand, whatever. 

Two weeks later, he was in town again and came over. this time, in the morning, he took my to brunch (a place we went to for my birthday) and we walked around the shopping center for the 40 minute wait time- it felt like we were dating again (especially since he was holding my hand and whatnot). He paid for brunch although I practically begged him to let me pay for myself. when we parted ways he left it with saying “let’s go on a weekend snowboarding trip sometime soon”. 

We’ve texted on and off since. He was going to come over a few nights ago, but I went to bed early cause I had travel the next day.

"I am a 60 year old widow with 4 grown children.  My husband died 3 years ago leaving our home in the middle of a DIY renovation.  I hired a contractor friend of my late husband’s to help complete the Renos.  
He is a very nice single guy, friendly and honest.  We became friends as he completed my kitchen and both bath remodels.  We talked a lot, he wanted to find a girl friend and get married and have a family.  He already owned his own business, and 3 houses and was buying a farm.  He showed me pictures and I told him he could use the farm as a venue for weddings and parties.  He finished the remodel but remained friends.  He pops in every couple months to see if we need help with anything, replaced ceiling fan. Then worked on an electrical issue we had.  He wouldn’t accept payment.  I have given him so many job referrals to friends and neighbors.  He is hard working and charges a fair rate.  

Fast forward 2 years.  I hadn’t seen him in 5-6 months.  He came to visit because he was remodeling my neighbors basement.  He brought me pictures of his baby daughter.  A product of a bar hook-up.  He accepted his responsibility and had fought for and gotten 50-50 custody.  Baby lives with him Thursday-Sunday.  His parents live in his house so mom watches baby while he works.  He brings baby to visit us (my daughter and grandchildren who live with me)often.  That summer I had finally gone through all my husbands construction equipment and tools and he helped me organize a sale, priced the items for me as I had no clue, He let other people in construction know about the sale and helped during the 4 day event. His baby was with us each day.  We talked a lot more, I thought he was being so helpful because he was interested in my daughter but her eyes were elsewhere.  

Now almost 3 years have passed I saw him about once a month a so, and finally decided to build the addition on my house I have always wanted.  Another master suite so my daughter can have a larger bedroom, walk in closet and her own bathroom.  He helps me finalize the plans, I get financing and we start the work 2 weeks ago. 

Today he brought the plumber by to discuss his part which starts next week and I want a change from a fiberglass ADA shower to a tiled shower with a rain head and a side head and sprayer.  He says no problem, I’ll do the tile work and it will make it less than the fiberglass and it will be big enough for 2 like your shower.  (Remember he had remodeled both my bathrooms)  I knew a bigger shower would make my daughter so happy!  I jokingly say X if you were 20 years older I would date you instead of trying to date on-line.  He stopped laughing and said “Yes.”  I just looked at him.  The plumber looked at him.  He then said, “I’ve been trying to go out with you for months”.   We were outside and the plumber walked away about 15 feet.  

I said “X” I’m 60, you are 45.  I’m way too old for you.  He said, “Age doesn’t matter, I like you.  You like me.  We could have a lot of fun together, we like the same things.”  I again repeated “but, 15 years!”  

The plumber (one of his many cousin’s) piped up and said “my wife is 12 years older than me.  It’s just a number.  He really likes you.”

Then X said, “Think about it.  Come to my baby’s party next week, (he had invited our family a month ago so we were going) you already know my dad  (he helped with our tool sale last year). You can meet my mom, and the rest of the family and then maybe we can go out, just you and me.”

I honestly didn’t know what to say.  I just said “We’ll come to the party. I don’t know about a date.”  He got such a big smile.  Then he said I will be back Tuesday to start whatever came next on the project IDK what it was.  And started to walk away.  Then he asked if he could stop in on Christmas Day.  I said yes and he jogged to his truck, got in with his cousin and left.  I just stood there stunned.

When I walked in my daughter said “Did X finally ask you out?”  I said “Yes, how did you know?”  

She said “He’s been coming here for over 2 years, never lets you pay him, always mentions where he is going on the weekends hinting you could come too, he’s been trying to ask you out for a long time, but you don’t get it.”  I’ve been thinking about it all day.  3 months ago when he was replacing our dead microwave over the range with a vent hood I was working on my on-line dating profile and talked about how nervous I was about putting myself out there.  He said “ Don’t do that, there are lots of guys local who would want to go out with you”. I laughed and said then I wish they would start coming over because this on-line stuff is crazy.  He said “they will,  just wait and see.”  I laughed and said “okay, if you know anyone between 55 and 70, bring him over.”  He left soon after saying “you don’t need an old man.  You need someone fun who wants to go places like you do.”  

Looking back I can see where some of the things may have been him putting out feelers.  Would it be wrong to go out with him?  In-line stuff sure sucks, it seems like all those jerks want it nude pics.  My daughter says do it.  He has a 1 year old!

"My apologies in advance, for this might be a long story. My now ex boyfriend let’s call him. Tyler and I first started dating in high school. I was a junior, and he was a senior, and I was the one who had made all the advances. I asked him out. I initiated being intimate on my 18th birthday And I was the one that would always make dates for us. Honestly, at the time it wasn’t really a problem, because I enjoyed planning things and making events special for him and I. After I graduated, I decided to go to university two hours away from him. I knew it was going to be rough to maintain a relationship with him being so far away but we are both confident we could try and make it work. Quickly into my freshman year. I meant lots of new people and had lots of new experiences, things that Tyler and I will never get to experience together because he still lived at home with his parents and worked a blue-collar job. I’m not saying blue-collar work is bad most people like her up with end up doing that and it’s a completely acceptable job field. However, I was more into academics and now I am almost done with my business degree. during my first year of college, I met this other boy. Let’s call him Kyle. Both Kyle and I when we met were in relationships however, he was substantially more unhappy with his than I was with mine. We eventually grew closer together and spent admittedly, too much time in each other‘s company, late at night. However, in the beginning it was completely honest and innocent, we spoke about home life and relationships, and, everything. We discovered that we had both had very similar upbringings, and had bonded over stories about our fathers.
It was something that Tyler and I were never able to share together because his home life is so much different than mine. Getting to know Kyle more made me realize that I wasn’t sure if Tyler really understood what love meant. I was falling in love with Kyle. Every time we spoke, and realizing that Tyler and I might not have been made for each other.
During this time of getting to know Kyle, I try to maintain as close of relationship with Tyler as I could. He would come visit me on occasion and spend the night. However, when he would leave, we would have a hard time maintaining a texting or calling relationship. Again, I found myself to be the one always pushing to talk with each other . During winter term, Tyler broke up with his girlfriend admittedly because him and I had grown so closely together, and he realized how unhappy he was with his ex. That same month was the month that I told him I liked him (Kyle). I also told him that I knew we couldn’t be together because I was still in a relationship that at the time I thought I still wanted to pursue. However, I felt in my heart that I needed to tell him the truth. I couldn’t imagine not telling him the truth. He knew everything about me and I knew almost everything about him. Fast forward to winter term, the University has mandated that we all take Covid test before returning to campuses. And Kyle comes back with a Covid positive answer. He is sent to a hotel nearby to which she hast to stay there for five days until he’s able to come back to university. On the fourth day after Kyle had taken a Covid test and it came back negative I went and visited him. I brought him blankets and some food I made him and other items to make him feel more comfortable during his last day in the hotel. We proceeded to chat and watch a movie, while I was there, one thing led to another, and we ended up on the bed together and we were acting playful. At this point we had started “platonically” cuddling. Looking back at this I know this was absolutely were things went wrong. At one point our lips got close to each other, but they never touched, we playfully kept going like this, knowing we couldn’t actually kiss, because I was still in a relationship, but the excitement was almost overwhelming. And then I kissed him. It was surprising to both of us, but I couldn’t stop myself anymore. The amount of emotions I had for this person, the amount of happiness he brought me that I had not felt ever before would make my heart jittery and flutter. Every time we talk, and it all just came rushing to me at once, and I just kissed him and I went for it. I felt so guilty afterwards, but at the same time I didn’t have any regrets. Nothing else happened that night, but we continue to play around this fact that we couldn’t kiss, but had in the past just once.
I never told Tyler that Kyle and I had kissed. Admittedly, I don’t know how and the guilt made me nauseous every time I thought about telling him. So instead instead of telling him the truth, I started not texting him. Tyler knew something was wrong with me, but he just didn’t know what was. So the space ended up growing in between us. 
One night Tyler called me and we had a really long call about what was going wrong. I never told him that I had kissed Kyle but I didn’t tell him I was having a hard time with being long-distance. I told him all about how I was getting frustrated with me having to initiate everything with him, and how I wasn’t sure if he And I were made for each other. He knew I still really cared about him, and I did. But we agreed that we needed to talk more about what was really going on. That night Kyle came over and my roommates are gone. I was upset from the phone call with Tyler and he was comforting me. It felt nice, something I wasn’t used to, not having to be the strong, one in the relationship, not having to be the one to reach out and make sure everything was OK. Not having to be the one to start some thing. That was the second time that we kissed, and the first time we had had sex…
The week, following that night, I was a mess, I cried, whenever I was alone, and was acting recklessly with alcohol. I told Kyle I needed space. And stopped seeing him but I also never texted Tyler or would call him back. I needed a break, so I went home that weekend, and I ended up seeing Tyler. I cried when I saw him and tried to ignore what it happened. I never told him what happened between me and Kyle. But I did tell him that I wasn’t in love with him anymore. I told him it wasn’t his fault, that I was the one that couldn’t handle the long distance. It was too hard for us to maintain a close enough relationship that I needed to feel whole and happy. We both cried, but I know I cried more.

Fast forward to now, two years later. Kyle and I are dating and living together. And I am the happiest I’ve ever been. My parents love him as a person, some thing that they had never had with Tyler . They always thought that I could’ve done better than him. We have talked about marriage and are both relatively on the same track of where we see our lives in 5 to 10 years. As much as I am happy a part of me as always, still upset with myself with how I acted back then. I stumbled across a photo of Tyler yesterday and I can’t help but think that I should go and see him.  The thought of telling him what had happened those years ago doesn’t make me nauseous anymore.

"Hello everyone, seeking some guidance regarding my relationship dynamics. Here’s the context:

	•	My boyfriend (47M) and I (37F) began our relationship long-distance and eventually decided to live together in his city.
	•	Our relationship has faced challenges from the get-go, and I’d appreciate some understanding as I share my concerns.
	•	We frequently engage in arguments. We’ve been in therapy for about three months now, but the progress feels incremental.
	•	Communication remains a core issue. During disagreements, he tends to bring up past traumas. Additionally, we currently live in his house, which was previously utilized as an Airbnb. While this information isn’t directly communicated by him during our disputes, it’s relevant context for understanding our living dynamics. I contribute by paying a reduced rent.
	•	I’m trying to determine if my emotions stem from genuine concerns or are exacerbated by my personal traumas. Is our connection authentic, or is it built upon trauma bonding?
	•	There are moments where he exhibits signs of wanting to change, offering a glimmer of hope for our relationship.
	•	Given our tight living quarters, especially with both of us working remotely, I’m contemplating a temporary move to gain some perspective.

"So as the title suggests, I met the loml two years ago and I knew pretty instantly that I wanted to be with this girl. For simplicity I will call her O. We met online and she's from Finland while I am from the UK and we spoke all of the time, everyday, without fail. 

We spoke to each other about marriage and our lives together when we got older. She introduced me to her brother, and would always talk with her mother about our relationship. Talking to her was the biggest joy, and was smart, funny, creative and just an all around pleasant girl to be around. Introduce J, someone I used to call a friend. One day O and I were messaging and I got asked to choose some photos for her Instagram. She was so gorgeous and I couldn't stop looking at her. J sees over my shoulder and asks to see another photo. I was so happy to share the woman who I loved so much with my friend. Pretty quickly J starts telling me how the long distance isn't worth it, that she would cheat on me etc and that sowed the doubt in my mind. Eventually after weeks of J non stop complaining about the relationship between O and I, I snapped and thought that he was right. I was scared that O didn't feel for me as I felt for her, scared that when she felt lonely and we couldn't be together that she would find somebody new and it would break me so I decided that I was going to let her go and try to move on. 

So O and I were talking one day, and she made a harmless comment about God which I decided I would use as my anchor to stop talking to her as much as it hurt to do so (I'm a Christian) and that's what I did, even as she profusely apologised and told me that she loved me for the first time. I felt the same about her but didn't say anything. 

Fast forward 5 or 6 months and I've been so lonely, depressed, and angry at J (who was no longer in my life) , myself and God that I decided to talk to O again to try and mend things. I messaged her and we got to talking again like nothing had changed, and I tell her I loved her too. However, she had found a boyfriend in that time. I was heartbroken and we didn't speak again for another few months, and since then we haven't spoken for well over a year. 

The problem is I think about O all of the time. I try to talk to other girls and just compare them to O and none of them ever compare, she set the bar so high in my life I know that no one will ever replace her. 

I need advice on what I need to do here, do I wait for O as I love her so dearly? Do I try and move on and let her live the happy life she deserves? I spend all day in bed just drinking thinking about how much I regret what I did and how much I hate living without her.

[TL;DR I ruined my relationship with the love of my life and need help with where to go now]",I (18M) ruined my relationship with the love of my life (18F),18otgu8,1703292146.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18otgu8/i_18m_ruined_my_relationship_with_the_love_of_my/,
"I (34f) have recently lost a lot of trust with my husband (32m) over some lies he told me, the ease with which he was able to lie to me, and not respecting some boundaries I set with him over the last 2-3 years. He continues to reassure me that he has never cheated (physically nor emotionally) but has finally taken accountability for the lies and boundary crossing. Last night he finally spoke the words I’d been waiting years for “I’m sorry I did those things. I did them due to my own insecurities and didn’t want to take accountability for them.” He teared up and looked genuinely remorseful. 

Lie situation #1 involves a woman at his gym. You can find a more detailed description in my post history. Lie situation #2 happened a few weeks later. We had a conversation where I told him I wanted to get everything out on the table so we can start over fresh. Try to rebuild trust. He concurred. I then asked him who the women was he had looked up on insta and he said he didn’t know. When I told him I could access his insta chat history by requesting logs he then said “well wait, okay yea it’s a girl from my class at school”. Do I think he’s cheating on me with this girl, no. But why lie about who she is? All he did was look her up online. It’s the lying that bothered me more than the action. 

Anyway, now I’m at a crossroads. I can either write this relationship off as a loss and leave him or I can choose to believe that even though he’s lied and hidden things he hasn’t cheated and try really hard to rebuild that trust. For those of you who have gone through similar situations and stayed, did you ever build that trust again? If so, what worked and what didn’t? We are both at the point where the emotions have worn down and are at a good place to make a go/no go decisions terms of where to go from here.",I (34f) need to know how to mentally move on after my husband (32m) lied to me.,18otgtm,1703292145.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18otgtm/i_34f_need_to_know_how_to_mentally_move_on_after/,
"For context, I’ve (27f) been with my bf (26m) for almost 3 years, and we live together and have for 2 years. We are basically always together because we work from home but sometimes he’s out with friends or we go to the gym separately etc. 

For reasons I’ve been feeling uneasy about some things..
a few months ago I woke up around 3am and he wasn’t home, called him and I guess he went to a bar with his friend who lives in the same apt building, his friend got on the phone to basically “prove” that, without me even asking. I didn’t really appreciate it and also didn’t understand because bars in CA close by 2AM (we live in a very big city where we walk everywhere) but I just let it go. 

This month Some fights we have had start with him getting upset with me of things I can’t control, aka one of his friends called my phone, then texted me he was trying to get ahold of my bf and he wasn’t answering. I didn’t answer and told my bf to call his friend and showed the text and let him know he tried calling me so it must be important. He flipped, started feeling like I was doing something with his friend. So he wanted to go through my phone I gave him my phone and he starts saying I must delete my messages then. He then says that I deleted the “recently deleted” thing on the iPhone. The fight continued but I ended telling him to let me see his phone since I started feeling this was more projected on me because of something maybe he’s doing? (When he’s done screaming at me he gets dressed and just leaves. Sometimes he’s back in 45 mins and sometimes it’s 2-5 hours I really never know) 

Asking to see his phone resulted in him calling me a gaslighter. He scrolled through his messages super fast, there was so many unknown numbers and I tried my best to ask about at least one and I saw a “❤️” on one so I told him to open that one. He had texted a number at 2:30 am with his name and the person responded “saved❤️” and he never responded back and said it was a guy from the gym he wants to workout with. (Why did he text his name at 2 30 am and not when he got the number at the gym) I asked the name, and said okay text him using his name asking when he’s free to workout and he said I was weird as fuck and started saying he doesn’t feel like our relationship is even anything anymore and called me a whore and a bitch. He then left for most of the day. 

These fights have been happening like this a lot and in the end he apologizes says he was in the wrong and that he was just being insecure. 

Well now I’ve been insecure. I went through his phone when he finally fell asleep and the messages I saw before were deleted like several. I looked up online how to see the newest contacts added and did just that. 

There were soooo many girls names, from this month…and so on I got to July and was hurt enough to keep going So I obviously couldn’t see any Convos since deleted so I looked through him and his best friends messages. 

He explained to his friend how through a instagram meme that he pulls girls in that certain way because it’s easy to do having a gf and can even do it in front of me. I realized exactly what he does which is literally sometimes done in front of me and these same girls act like my friends (which when I hit them up they have never responded back to me) and I never would have expected anything from it. In his words “it works” his friend said “you’ve tried it?” He said “yeah and it works trust me” 

He had other messages that he deleted but said “deleting this so my GF doesn’t see” and his friend responding saying to marry that girl, and my bf saying he would get bored of her to easily. THIS IS ALL THIS MONTH. I don’t even know what to think or how to bring it up!!! 

I’ve been distant for 2 days now since seeeing this stuff and we usually have sec everyday at least once (my bc stops me from having a period) and I have NOT been interested. He’s cleaning, cooking, trying to figure out what’s wrong with me and guilting me saying “is it because I’m not good enough for you anymore?” And I just tell him “no I just feel you’re not being honest with me and if there’s anything you have done just tell me” he denies.

"My BFF lets call her Ann, she has a boyfriend lets call Mark. Originally we were supposed to take this trip in Early 2020 but that kind of didn't happen due to COVID. We luckily managed to get a refund on majority of things, this trip served two main purposes. Firstly for a vacation we have both wanted to do since we were young, and secondly she was going to go see a big chunk of her moms side of the family she has not seen in over a decade. It was kind of split 50/50, since this was supposed to be almost a 2 month trip I personally have been saving for years now. One thing to note is that Ann is fluent in the primary language of where we are vacationing while i am not. I can talk to some city people enough to get by, but once i leave and the slang and dialects start popping in i am lost.  
  
It was just supposed to be me and Ann, however a last minute addition was made with her including her current boyfriend of 3 years with. This was more or less dropped on me pretty much 2 weeks before we left, I was really unhappy with this because well it messed up a lot of plans. But i begrudgingly accepted him after we reworked some stuff. However i told Ann multiple times and her boyfriend that this trip is about us not Ann and her BF.  
  
The first night we were there Mark dropped to one knee pulled out the ring and asked her to marry him. Since then i feel like a third wheel who is no longer welcome on this trip. This has changed EVERYTHING, the trip is now basically about Ann and her new fiancée, multiple times we had a lot of plans. Including some stuff that was paid for, and instead she ended up ditching me to go spend time with Mark.  
  
Tomorrow we are supposed to catch a train and travel for the next leg of our trip, and she wants me to go alone. Instead she confronted me and that she needs at least a week to figure out feelings and organize her thoughts so instead they booked without telling me some fancy couples thing. Instead she wants me to go on a trip alone as a woman in a country I can barely speak the language. Even worse i am basically going to have to show up to some extended part of her family alone and ask to stay there. She said its fine, but it is really not comfortable at all.  
  
I tried to talk to her and she got really upset and told me this vacation isn't just about me, and that hurt me a lot. Now pretty much i am going to spending Christmas alone in a country where i don't speak the language. I got pretty emotional and asked her WTF am i expected to do. She got really defensive and said its just a week and we are here until early February, she will meet up with me on news year eve or the day after.  
  
My question is how can I talk to her and make her understand that she cannot just ditch me without coming off like a massive asshole?

"I (24F) was with my ex partner for 7 years. He is a textbook narcissist, he abused me physically and mentally throughout our relationship more times than I can count. I'll spare you the details, I don't want you to have nightmares after reading this. I didn't want to accept any of it, I'm overly empathic and I always focus on the good in people, so I stayed, but I realised he's never going to change and so I finally gained the strength and  left three months ago. This ex has been giving me the hardest time ever, telling me how much he regrets what he's done to me one day, then threatening me and telling me I'm a disgusting person for leaving him the next day. Over and over again. He even accused me of leaving him for another man, like I wouldn't leave him out of fear of killing me once, or hurting me all the time and talking to me in a disgusting way, only for another man. He blames the world for everything and unable to take genuine accountability. I tried to go no contact, and he even came to my home. I didn't go outside. I blocked him everywhere, and now he found me on Whatsapp and started his rage all over again. He's been threatening to come to my house, I told him if he does I'll call the police. Then he said he would ""send his pals"". And that I'm disgusting and an enemy for even mentioning the polices name to him.

Throughout all this time in the past three months, I did start healing and had much fun though. I tried to not care about him. Now I met a sweet man whom I really like. I initially told him I didn't even want to date due ""going through a lot"" but destiny kept bringing us together. He's been also asking me how I was and I just gave an honest answer ""I've been a bit on the edge lately"". Because of the scary harassment and threats of my ex, but I didn't specify that part. We ended up going out. I didn't even expect it but he kissed me, and I liked it. I like him a lot. I want to see him more. On the date, he asked me a few courious questions. One of them was ""What's an important life lesson you learnt?"" And suddenly all I could think of is what this ex put me through. And so I said: ""What I learn is, just because you are nice and good to someone, it doesn't mean they are going to be the same to you.."" He asked me to ellaborate. I tried to hold it back so hard, but my tears won. I told him my last partner abused me. And was very cruel to me. Then I don't know, I felt ashamed to show my emotions to him and tried to cover my face. I told him sorry I don't mean to pour this on you. I said ""you bring out the worst from me"". But he suddenly held my hand, and said ""I think the best"". This for the first time, made me feel heard. And seen. And accepted and understood. He asked if this is why I was on the edge lately, and I just said to him ""kind of"". My soul wanted to open up, and tell him the whole reason, that I'm scared and this ex obsessively harasses me, but I couldn't help but feel as though telling him this would make me seem complicated and not over it and too much to handle. I thought he might just discard me as a troubled woman, after all who wants that in their lives? Especially on the first date, with this man I fancied so much and felt so comfortable around. 

I've been feeling scared and upset ever since, because this ex keeps on harassing me and won't stop, but when the sweet man I'm dating asks how I am I simply don't feel I can tell him I'm scared, and upset, and just say I'm okay. I don't know what to do. I feel like telling him all of this would be too much for him to handle. And I don't want to seem like that troublesome woman who brings you into her issues. I really do want to date him. And as I'm writing this, the obsessive ex is texting me right now that he's at my house again and to come out. Without my agreement of course. Thank god I'm abroad for Christmas, and he doesn't even know I'm not there. I'm not even texting him, I just see the messages he sends on my pop up notifications. I'd block him on Whatsapp too but I'm scared if he doesn't have any other way left of pouring his disgusting thoughts onto me, he will come to my house more often and my sister and mum also live there. I don't want any distress to come to them. 

It would be amazing to confide in the man I'm dating, but I'm not sure how he would take it.

"DOES IT COME OFF AS MANIPULATIVE? Please be honest.


It's been sometime now and I want to be honest. I miss you. I think about you everyday, even when I don't want to. I've tried moving on with how we ended but it just doesn't sit right with me. We were once friends who cared for each other. And I would like to assume that our love for each other was genuine because it wouldn't have been so hard to walk away from each other. 

I feel as though I've lost a piece of myself. I don't know if you've felt the same way, but I think the years we spent together deserves a better ending than the ones we've been giving it.

I must admit when we first ended I was so angry, about a million different things. I was so anxious to lose someone I loved, that I made it worse 😐. I've said some things I can't take back, and behaved in a manner that is unrecognizable to me now. I guess the saying ""hurt people, hurt people"" is true. If there's another stronger word for hurt then that's what I felt with all the events that led to us ending. On top of that I was struggling with my own issues with my mental health 🫠
To add I cant seem to understand when we would talk, you would tell me, ""you're scared to be alone"". Hearing that while we were dating only deepened my insecurities and I'm sure it manifested in ways that were unproductive and hurtful towards you. So I can see how it only amplified the dysfunction on my part. 

The feelings I felt when we ended were deep and unbearable at times. I thought I was dying bro lol forreal. Knowing you weren't choosing me just turned my whole world upside down.... Even though I knew from the beginning that's the choice you wanted to make for yourself. I still had a piece of hope that you'd choose me, so I acted out of character with anger when I should've recognized my self worth and let you go. It caused so much more damage than I expected. And it's unfortunate that it took me a long time to see through how my own behavior poisoned the friendship. To top that off, it took awhile for me to distinguish what parts were my responsibility and what was not. I see why people go no contact because it does take time to grieve and see things for what they are. And it's true people do say things they don't mean when they're hurt, angry, and more. That's what I tell myself so I can continue to see you in a positive light. Isn't it almost like an immediate defense mechanism where your brain tries to protect itself?

Whether this matters to you or not. I'd like to apologize for my hurtful actions, down to the way I spoke to you, the ultimatum, my perfectionism which made you feel imperfect, and the micromanaging. I'd list all the things but I forgot some haha (darn memory) and this letter would be much longer than I intended if I did. I don't know how deep my actions made you feel, but I am sorry. It may be hard to understand but I didn't do anything to ""intentionally"" hurt you. I was trying my best, and my best came with some pain. I finally understood what you meant when you said this to me. 

Before I wrap this up, I should address my latest actions. It wasn't right for me to speak that way towards you or create tension when I messaged you and when we would talk. I wanted to tell you what hurt me and I wanted you to acknowledge it, acknowledge that we were both hurting from the end of it all. I wanted my feelings to matter to you, and that pushed you further away. I assume I wasn't approaching any of it in a healthy manner. I deeply regret it, and it doesn't reflect the person that I am or the person that I thought I was reflecting. &amp; I guess you don't really have to acknowledge any of this. It'd be okay for you to respond the same way you have.

I also want to address the last conversation we had. I guess I just assumed you were okay talking about the past in person, but I see that it might not have been the time to discuss painful memories. I don't think I was even ready to hear it. Being triggered by your truth/side of it all hurt because I thought I was giving my all to you. I thought I made enough sacrifices to show you that I'd walk with you through it all. It was like hearing all the efforts I made with and without you knowing was stomped on by your words. It felt like you were making me the sole problem for us ending. I'm not sure if that's what you meant to imply, but if it is your truth then I guess that's something I have to accept.

With that being said it was okay to speak up for yourself then and now. I can't make anyone do that for themselves. When you arrived at my apartment it seemed like you weren't okay with having that conversation. But you were there so I began talking. I was nervous and a bit flustered and defensive to speak about certain things so yeah, I turned out not to be ready either🙃

My love for you has never changed even when I thought the last disagreement and the things that were said would be the one that would make me hate you. Like damn bro, I kind of wish it did haha. But here I am wanting to right my wrongs and move forward. The care I have for you is somehow still present. Also I should've said this the last time we spoke but ""in no way am I trying to make you change your mind about what has happened. I've accepted our end a ""long"" time ago and I just want to be honest and vulnerable. It takes time to heal and I'm okay with that 😊."" I miss you dearly as a friend. I just don't know if you feel the same, or if we've grown so far apart that we wouldn't even like each other.

I do hope that we can end things in a healthier manner someday 🫠. You don't owe me anything and that's your right but I'd love to end peacefully. I still hold space for you as a friend. &amp; I don't know if it'd give you any peace of mind, but I hope so.

But the other holidays like July 4th I like going to see the fireworks but he HAS to do this “tradition” where him and his whole family hang out at their country club and eat and watch fireworks.

I just wanted to do something with him, I don’t want to do something with him and his family every single holiday. I’m in a relationship with him not him and his family. I practically had to beg him to just have Christmas morning with me, we just got our first house together this year, all I wanted was to have Christmas morning with him and that was if we would both go out separate ways for the day no big deal but him and his “traditions” almost made that not happen until I just asked his mom what their plans were. Same thing for new years he HAS to be with them for new years which is weird to me because you’re supposed to kiss your significant other on new years… not your family lol.

Hi all, so I (26f) have been dating my bf (31m) for almost four years now (3 of them living together).

We have had the same issue popping up a couple of times and that is that he will usually say something which I later find out is not entirely true… or he starts getting too “technical” if what he did was a lie or not. 

All of the things that I found later where mostly because when questioned about, my boyfriend said contradictory things. 

For example, he tells me in the beginning that he is not that romantic and then I find out from his family he chased down a girl to Australia (we are in Europe) just after 2 weeks.

OR He mentions he has not met up with his last FWB ever eince we started dating but while I was in my semester abroad, he saw her at a party of his friend and interacted her. I found this out years later through him  but he said he did not meet with her, that they just happened to be at the same party and that is why he did not count this ocassion as seeing her. 

OR he will tell me he is guy to a mixed sports event weekend with his guy’s team and they do not invite girlfriends. But that I should not worry as with his guy friends they only drink between themselves and nothing happens. Then when I see his friends they laugh about one of them being too loud in the tent with a girl he met there. 

OR that he will not drink like crazy in this event to prevent any misunderstandings and then when he shows me the group chat there is a video of him with a friend competing to down a big glass of beer. When I ask him how is that drinking responsibly as we agreed, he said that did not count as it was his second beer. 

OR he will tell me his dad used to send him and his brother in a whatsapp group random girls’ n&amp;des &amp; p0rn  but not anymore. Then it beeing that it still happens and bf has not asked his dad a single time to stop even though I have clearly expressed my discomfort with that and how I feel that is disrespectful to me, our relationship and the dad’s gf. (Not to mention, is this normal for father &amp; son relationship???) his mom (father’s ex )also told me it is not my bfs fault fhag to receive those type of messages but IMO he can at least ask once his dad to stop. 

OR he will tell me he will not take me to meet his grandad as he can be a bit rude and is an alcoholic. That he has not introduced him to any of his previous gfs. But in another conversation it was mentioned he was rude to another gf of him and when I asked how is that possible if he never introduced them - he said it was because his grandad came over to his place and his gf was also there at the time. That he did not lie to me because he did not “introduce” them. 

OR… and what really made me sad today… he called me his ex’s name during dinner with his family (they broke up about 9 years ago but she recently texted him for his birthday so he says that is why the name was on his mind as it was so random she texted after no contact for years). 
He asked his aunt (who accidentally took my plate): - Hey, I think you accidentally took “ex’s name” plate. - She said nothing and he apologized immediately but I was fuming. I kept cool during dinner as to not ruin anyone’s evening. However, the aunt then mentioned that the ex liked a certain plate on the menu. This made me wonder as my bf told me from the beginning of the relationship he had never brought a girl home and I was the first one to spend time with his family like that. When I asked him how did the aunt then know about his ex’s dishes liking, he then tonight admitted to his ex as well coming to family events but that he had not thought about that as it was his first gf and many years ago…


Am I overthinking these scenarios? If he really wanted to lie why would he come clean / contradict himself later?

Am I dumb for wanting to work on this relationship? Am I expecting too much?

"i’m going here because i don’t know who else to go to, or what to do. i’ve just been in so much pain and i need advice from multiple people to gain perspective but i’m lost.

me and my ex-boyfriend dated for 2 years, and we brokeup 3 months ago because we had to have been long distance for college. he treated me like a princess. i did not take the breakup well at all. i went into the deepest depression of my life my entire first quarter in college because of it. ive been trying so hard to move on from our relationship, but i constantly feel like i’ve been ripped away from my home. i can’t stop crying, ever. i wrote him several letters, both because i needed a way to let out my emotions, and because he had blocked me on everything so it was my only way of communicating with him. 

we met up a few days ago just to talk things through, but we ended up spending almost 12 hours together, practically on a date: we looked at christmas lights, got dinner, and we ended up having sex. 

i asked him if he was seeing anyone multiple times, and he denied, but he finally broke and told me he’s been seeing this girl for the past month. i don’t understand why he lied to me about it, i don’t understand how he was able to move on in 2 months to someone else. i don’t understand why he had sex with me if he’s seeing someone else. i know he’s not over me, because he voiced his pain to me and told me he wishes we were still together, and i desperately want to be with him too. he says that if we ever workout in the future, it means that we can’t be together right now, because he needs to heal from our past relationship, but if that’s the case, why is he pursuing a relationship with this new girl?

i want him back so bad, i just don’t know what to do about it. all i want to do is text him, and tell him that i want him, but i don’t know if that’s the best idea in the long run. i know that he’s right and that we need to take more of a break from eachother before getting back together, but i’m afraid he’ll find someone new during our break and will choose her over me.  and i know i’m young, and there’s more fish in the sea, but he genuinely felt like my home, like he’s the one. i haven’t met a single man that treats me nearly as well as he did, and i don’t want to lose that. i want my man back, but how do i get him?",i (18f) want my ex boyfriend (19m) back but i dont know how,18ot3gb,1703291010.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ot3gb/i_18f_want_my_ex_boyfriend_19m_back_but_i_dont/,
"What do you do when someone thinks you’re gaslighting them but you are not?

Ok this is a long one. Sorry for the length but I feel context is necessary. 
TLDR at bottom. 

My boyfriend is convinced that he is hearing me text at night. Multiple times a week I am awoken in the dead of night by him saying things like, “Who are you talking to??” Or “You think I’m fucking stupid?” Or “Do you even want me here?” Or “Do you really think I deserve this?” Etcetera. 

He says that he hears clicking/tapping and he knows that it is me texting an unspecified someone. I used to sleep with my phone next to me to turn off my alarm and check the time and whatnot. So to prove that what he’s hearing is not me texting, I now sleep with my phone and all my devices across the room, as far away from me as possible. 

In response to this, he suggests that I have now just “changed my tactics” and I have some secret device (like a watch) that I could still be texting on. I tell him I already have an Apple Watch, it’s over there with the phone and the iPad. He says that I could have another secret watch or device of some kind. I said that an Apple Watch is far to expensive for me to buy one specifically for the purpose of secretly texting at night. He says that someone could have bought it for me. 

And when he wakes me up hearing the noises, I encourage him to look for this device. I ask him, “Where is it, where would I hide it, there’s nothing here I promise. Look for yourself.” A few times he has looked and found nothing (because there’s nothing there) and now he won’t even look and says that he won’t find anything, not because there’s nothing there, but because I am somehow sneaky enough to expertly hide it in a split second. 

I ask him to please think about this logically. Why would I try to secretly text someone at night while we’re sleeping right next to each other? If I really wanted to secretly message someone, wouldn’t that be a terrible time to do it? And if I really was trying to hide some device, why would I encourage him to search for it? I am encouraging him to investigate the sounds he hears and try to find out what it is. I tell him, when you hear that, turn on the light and just look at me! You will see that I am asleep with nothing in my hands, I promise. 

Now he has suggested that now I’m whispering at night as well. He says that since he has “caught me texting” that now I am using some sort of walkie-talkie feature on whatever secret device that I’m hiding. Which leads me to question him further, “How does that make sense? Why would I change to a louder method of communication if I supposedly ‘got caught’ communicating in a quieter way? Why in the world would I be so desperate to communicate with someone throughout the whole night?” He says that I am just gaslighting him and that he KNOWS that I am texting at night. 

Along with confusion about what to do about my relationship, I am worried that these are signs of a potential mental illness. I am worried that he is experiencing auditory hallucinations (as much as I try to listen for the tapping that he hears, I don’t hear anything) and increasing paranoia. 

I’d also like to note that he hears the tapping no matter where we are sleeping, my house, his house, airbnbs, hotels. But he says he only hears it when I am there. I asked him what can we do to get to the bottom of this? He said the only solution if for me to stop doing it. I said that it is impossible to stop doing something that I’m not doing in the first place. 

I love him very much and other than this weird problem we have a good relationship. I want to spend the rest of my life with him but I don’t want to continue living with the distrust. Please help if you have any insight/advice/experience with something like this, thank you!

"My girlfriend refuses to block her ex.

Me(F20) and my girlfriend(F19) have been together for almost 8 months now. She has a ex girlfriend that she dated for 3 years. She started dating me pretty early into our relationship and most of our arguments in the past were about her and not blocking her ex. She told me before that the reason she doesn't is because her ex is her friend and that her ex knows her more than anyone. Her ex is someone who is always there for her, is there when she needs someone, is there when she feels alone and needs someone to call. I told her that I'm not friends with any of my exes and I know 100% that if I did, she wouldn't like it either. She refuses to block her but gave me the option of just muting her messages, barely texting her, barely even looking her messages. I told her if she's just gonna do all of that, why not just block her since it's the same thing. She said that her ex would be really sad if she blocked her ex. I asked her why her ex's feelings matter so much, and she said it's not that, it's the fact that her ex is her only friend. We've argued about the same thing over and over again, and each time I gave in and just say something like ""Okay, I'm sorry, you can be friends with her if you want. I trust you."" and it'll be the end of it. I still feel very sad whenever she doesn't just do this one simple thing for me, but I can't ever convince her. 

What should I do? should I just allow this to happen? It bothers me a lot, but I feel like she's just sick and tired of this conversation over and over again. She refuses too even when I've asked her over and over again, and this is the only thing I've ever asked her to do. She believes in the thing where exes can be friends, but I'm not like that.","My girlfriend (F19) refuses to block her ex, and I (F20) is fed up with it.",18oszte,1703290704.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oszte/my_girlfriend_f19_refuses_to_block_her_ex_and_i/,
"So me and my girlfriend have had a pretty rough year. To make a long story short, November was a rough month, we were on a “break” and she told me she was going to Miami to celebrate her friends birthday. She had also bought a ticket to a YouTubers party in Los Angeles for December 15. She invited me but I told her no because I wanted to save money for the holidays in case I wanted to go home to New York.  I had no problem with the situation whatsoever and her going on her trips. She never goes anywhere and I was the one that encouraged her to make friends with the girl who invited her to Miami. On November 17 we “broke up”, I called my mother and vented to her and she told me to buy a plane ticket and come spend Christmas with them (Dec 15-Dec26). On November 18th me and my girlfriend had a huge heart to heart and got back together. I told her of my intentions of going to New York and she said she couldn’t afford it, so I offered to cover her flight. I understood that it wasn’t in her plans to come spend Christmas with me and my family when she bought her trip to Miami and Los Angeles so I didn’t hold it against her. There’s no way she could’ve known. Her Miami trip was from November 27- November 30 and her Los Angeles trip was from Dec 15- Dec 17. So they day before she left to Miami she told me she also had bought a plane ticket to go see her friend in Long Island and that she was going to go to Boston with her to a doja cat concert (Dec 1 - Dec 3). So now at this point I’m starting to second guess myself and her “i can’t afford it”. I didn’t necessarily want her to cancel one of her trips, but she could’ve cut back on some expenses to “help out” in something she couldn’t afford. I didn’t offer because I was rich, I was offering out of the kindness of my heart. When she left to Miami she was over there having a blast eating great food and having fun, one of the people she was with said they had a 250 dollar budget and my girlfriend said that wasn’t enough so that tells me she must have spent over 250 dollars while in miami. I picked her up from the airport on November 30th and she left on November 31st to go to her doja cat concert with her friend. So at this point I think back to November 18 when she said she didn’t have any money to go to NY and I offered to pay her flight and I start to regress. I take back my offer. She asked me on Dec 3rd if I was buying her flight still and I said no, her immediate response was she’ll stay home with our two dogs. She didn’t ask why not or if she can do anything to help, she immediately resorted to staying home, which made me feel like if I wasn’t paying for it then there was no other reason to try. I felt like if she really wanted to go she would’ve cancelled her Los Angeles trip right then and there and tried to pull Pennies together to go, not that I wanted her to cancel her flight but I did want to see some type of effort. So fast forward to a little later in the weeks, she had to cancel her Los Angeles trip anyways because she said she could not afford to go to Los Angeles and take Ubers and eat there.  I ended up flying to New York by myself and left her at home because I felt like she could’ve atleast offered some type of help to pay for her trip but she didnt. So now I’m trying to understand if I’m wrong in my assumption, I offered to pay her flight under the assumption that she couldn’t afford it, but seeing her snap stories and seeing both trips she did in one week and the trip she had planned in Cali, I thought I was just being taken advantage of so she wouldn’t have to cancel any of her trips. Neither of us are rich so me paying for her flight was an honest gesture so she wouldn’t be home alone, but I told her that the day I offered to pay her flight she could’ve cancelled her trip to California and atleast offered me 100$, she said why should she if I offered to pay her flight to NY. Her trip to California also interfered with the trip to NY. I left to New York December 15, and she would’ve left to Cali December 15 as well.  So I would’ve had to pay her flight from Cali to New York and from New York back to where we live in Florida. Her point is that I offered to pay for it so none of her plans should have been affected, if she wanted to go to Miami and Rhode Island and Cali then that was she could do so because I offered to pay for it. And that makes sense, but saying you don’t have money for something and having three trips planned is also absurd in my eyes. You could easily re-budget your expenses and help some way. Now she isn’t talking to me because I left her at home alone with our two dogs instead of bringing her with me. Despite me saving money since September for this trip. I bought her a bunch of gifts and that’s when she made the point that instead of buying her all those gifts I could’ve paid for her flight to New York, so it’s not like I shit on her for Christmas, I just felt played. Lastly, she said those trips were to help her ease her mind and feel at peace since she was having a rough year SPECIFICALLY because of me.

"Hi, I (28f) and my housemate (32m) have been living together for around 3 years now. We were friends before we decided to move in together, both were single at the time and still are. We have never been romantically involved not have expressed romantic interest, but we have lived very comfortably together. Any arguments we have, we resolve almost immediately, and any reservations we have, we voice right away and it is met with understanding and acknowledgement to do better.

As for hobbies, we match hobbies basically one to one. We are into the same games, pop culture,   theatre performances and musicals, and movie taste. Basically, we are exactly what I envisioned my daily life to be when living with a best friend.
I'm very happy with my life at home, and he seems to be to. 

We both try going on dates with others via apps or meeting up with new people, but it is hard to stick to. We tell each other about notable ones we've been on, but not the ones that were ""meh"". We've been meeting new people and giving ourselves the opportunity to find someone.He's also met my parents since they come to my apartment a lot to visit, and they really enjoy his company. 

Recently, my mother honestly stated to me privately that if we decided to start dating, she would be whole heartedly in support, since she sees us being so friendly together and getting along. Another friend I invited over asked us both outright if we would ever consider the idea of, if we still remained single for many more years to come, if we would just decide to be a couple out of conveinience and comfortability. My immediate reaction was, my housemate is a great friend, I love our dynamic and shared interests as it is now, and  that I believe that companionship comes in different shades, and my HM also agreed to this statement. We haven't spoken about it further, since we both really don't think it's a topic that's important right now as we are navigating our lives with friends and work.

It's not my priority to want a partner so that I won't ""die alone"",  but I'm giving myself the opportunity to see if I can find someone I can be romantically interested in by going on dates as I have been.

The short of it is this, I wonder if, in the event that I never find anyone I'm attracted to romantically would it be so wrong to just be as I am, living my life as I am, with a friend and companion in a domestic setting, would it be a defacto relationship? Would it just be ""housemates forever"" kind of situation, or is there an actual status for it? 
What qualities in this companionship would turn it into a defacto one?
I'd love to hear if there are people here who are in a similar dynamic, where romance isn't involved? 

Its a kinda off my chest post I know, it's something I've been thinking about for a while. Any advice or insight is appreciated, since I really don't know what to call this relationship.",I'm (28f) wondering what makes a defacto relationship and if I'm on the path to one with my housemate/friend (30m),18osygj,1703290588.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18osygj/im_28f_wondering_what_makes_a_defacto/,
"This is fucking hard. 

And it’s going to get harder before it gets easier. 

My brain is tricking me into trying to find a way to prevent something painful from happening. 

————————————————————————

I’m trying to remember these things:

-He’s almost 37 and has a lot of bad deeply ingrained habits 

-He’s overweight

-He spends most of his down time playing video games or watching YouTube videos

-He makes good money but has no savings - he’s actually in debt 

-He doesn’t exercise 

-He drinks almost everyday 

-He uses cocaine to focus his (undiagnosed ADHD)

-He drinks and does cocaine by himself 

-He’s only nice to me and only says nice things  when he’s drunk or high on cocaine

-He shifts blame to me, he gets defensive, he stonewalls, he can’t admit fault, he doesn’t take accountability, he doesn’t think about my feelings 

- He doesn’t like to give me compliments because compliments make him feel uncomfortable 

- If I didn’t ask to hang out, he wouldn’t ask me, unless he was drinking 

- If I didn’t initiate serious conversations, they wouldn’t happen 

- He goes silent for 12 - 36 hours sometimes 

- I can’t ask him to hang out on the same day that I’m asking, or else it makes him uncomfortable 

- He’s been so standoffish and distant lately 

- He’s not very affectionate or supportive 

- We seem fundamentally incompatible 

- This relationship is negatively affecting my mental health 

- My needs are not being met

- We don’t live together, not married, no kids, this should be the easy part, but this 2 years has been anything but easy 

-He doesn’t have any goals that he’s working towards 

-He’s been saying he wants to clean his apartment for TWO YEARS and hasn’t done it 

-He’s not someone I want to build a life with  

-Love is not enough - of course I love him, I’ve been with him for 2 years 

-I want the potential person. Not the person that actually exists. 

-When I imagine a life with him, it’s not actually with HIM. It’s with this idea of him in my mind - THAT DOESN’T EXIST. 

————————————————————————

Thoughts that I’m having as my brain is trying to prevent me from doing this: 

- I’m so attracted to him, his eyes make me melt 

- Maybe things will change, maybe he will change 

- I love our long conversations about random topics 

- I don’t want to be alone (even though being with him makes me lonely)

- I want someone to watch Christmas movies with 

- What if I don’t find anyone else

- I’ve made a lot of mistakes too 

- Am I blaming him for things in my life that are not his fault 

- Do I have unrealistic expectations 

- Maybe I should just wait until after Christmas (but I wanted to do it today because we each have 10 days off for Christmas which will give us time to process)

Okay so me (19f) and my boyfriend(19m) have been dating for a little more than a year and a half. So I’m not totally proud of myself for this but I went through his phone I think it’s a total invasion of privacy and I’m not proud of it. He is never apart from his phone but I found one of his old phones in a drawer and it still had battery. I decided to look through the photos and the most recent 100 pictures and videos was porn. I don’t think watching porn is cheating so I didn’t think that much of it actually just kinda weird as to why he’s keeping it on his phone. But then I went back and saw that I actually knew some of the people. They were all pictures of snaps taken from a different phone. Some people i didn’t know but one of them was a a snapchat that something like “I need it daddy” with a  girl sticking her tongue out. I couldn’t tell if they were sent to him or maybe one of his friends and he just took a picture of it? The most concerning one was pictures of my friend. He has always had an issue with me being friends with her and I know that they had some history long ago. Another was a snapchat of this person that I have seen him snapping before. These pictures were from like October to May. I don’t really know how to feel like maybe there is a logical explanation. Basically I need advice on how do I bring this up with him?

TLDR; I'm often fantasizing about an MMF threesome that includes my girlfriend and some other guy. It makes me uncomfortable and hurts my ego yet I feel strongly aroused by that idea. Over time I started watching porn only from that ""category"". This contradiction bothers me, as it is like 2 years since I started having such strong fantasies.

Hello, I'm 24 years old male, bisexual. We've been in a relationship for about 6 years now and our sexual life was always pretty casual. We talk about everything and we're open about our fantasies and ideas regarding our sex life and everything else, basically - but this one thing is a complete exception. So, we talked about it once. I purposefully brought it into conversation but made it seem like I did it not intentionally. After a couple of minutes of talking, she asked if I would want to have an MMF threesome and seemed curious. Idk. what happened to me (I'm usually really calm and open about everything), but I kinda snapped, felt attacked and said something along these lines: ""Yeah!? What about an MFF threesome, would YOU want that?"" - no, she answered, it sounds disgusting. So then I forced her to tell me why she really would want an MMF. At this point, this conversation absolutely lost any sense, because I forced her into one, expected answer. Now I feel stupid about that, like a freaking neandertal, because who the f am I to tell her what should she think - that's first. The second point is - but at the same time that's also my desire, so why did I react in such a defensive manner? I don't know if that's an ""ego"" thing, but I feel lost. I know that some fantasies are not supposed to come into real life, but this one is really strong and it always comes back (i.e. often when I'm outside the home and I miss her, for some reason).

My ex girlfriend dumped me one year ago in October. We remained friends until she started dating someone in January, then we went NC.

I'm aware that over the years I became increasingly attracted towards him but never did anything because I was always in a mono relationship, or my friend was and now I have a bf(34m) who I sincerely love and live with, we've been together for 7 years. I'm more attracted to my friend physically than his opinions and views of the world, some are almost unacceptable for me (he KNOWS it's not right but sometimes he makes or enjoys racist or sexist jokes even tho he's not directly attacking anyone he share those with me or he says with his friends).  
Currently I feel I'm not as much as inlove with my current bf because he has broken up with me 4 times: first time because he loved me but wasn't sure if he wanted to be with anyone anymore, then because I was too depressed to work (still provided my attention and love for him and attended the house), then after I got a job he broke up with me because I was frequently stressed because of my job and sometimes the depression used to come back (I was still functional still worked full time, provided now not only money but love and company for him the rest of the time and attended social and family events). Last time was just for the same reasons I just said and it was also because our sex life declined a bit... it was only a month after my dad died.  
I know being depressed lowers your libido and I recognize it's my fault I don't initiate and we can go weeks without having sex because of me but despite this when we do it's  mind-blowing amazing for both of us. My bf and I both have been affected by my lower libido BUT I also have been affected personally by his lack of ""romanticism"" (he doesn't care much for anniversaries or giving special importance to my bday more than asking me what I want to do that day, not surprises or romantic preparations so I also stopped doing them). I have been deeply affected by his lack of physical demonstrations of love, he kisses me (just lips touching) every day but we don't make out, he doesn’t kiss me goodbye when he’s leaving during the day, about french kissing when I try to make it happen he just breaks it off quickly or won't open his mouth, it’s weird, I am a highly hygienic person people and I know I'm a great kisser so I don't get it. He used to be more physically expressive at the beginning of our relationship but it has faded horrendously to the point that I crave it. We almost never shower together, we only make out passionately when we have sex, he ALWAYS breaks first when we hug (he's almost always sideways which I find annoying) or ask me to get up not long after I sit on his lap or lay over him just to talk to him and cuddle 'cause he has something else to do (sometimes it's not even an urgency so I don't understand), he caresses my back and hair when we watch tv and that's it. He although has other beautiful and meaningful ways to show me love, he buys me gifts, he cooks almost everyday, he's supported me financially when I needed it, he takes me to places when I can't drive, he gets along really well with my family and I know he loves me... I just feel I have romantically distanced from him and when we fight I always fear he's going to break up with me. I crave physical affection, it can be very erotic for me and we have talked about this but he's just not that much into it I conclude or he’s being extremely contradictory. This has caused me to fantasize more about people I know in real life... like my friend I mentioned at the beginning. I think that if this type of need was more fulfilled by my bf my libido would increase. A few days back I was all hormonal pmsing and asked him if he could be more sweet and loving AND HE TOLD ME NO “I think I’m already loving enough towards you. That was really sad for me  
Now about this friend, last time we personally met was a few years back... we went for coffee (at a public place) and I admit I was desiring him right then and there and I think that I could sense he also liked me but again I was already with my current bf so we just had coffee and chatted for like 1hr-1hr 30min we hugged for a few seconds (which is normal in my country we greet people with a kiss on the cheek btw) and we both left to our respective homes, neither of us has proposed anything against our mono relationships or even ""confessed"" anything to each other EVER. We have spoken over the phone like 3 times over the years and after some casual talk we both told each other we suffered from depression, we connected because of it and sometimes we give each other some advices but one of those times around last or previous xmas he very subtly but clearly told me he tried to do something harmful against himself but I don't know the extent or severity of the self harm when I asked him a bit more about it he told me he was doing well atm. That was shocking for me, heartbreaking and since then I have been worried about his wellbeing even if we go months without talking  
Since Nov we have been messaging frequently, some weeks even every day about random things, sending each other memes, funny videos, chatting about how’s the other one doing with work, how’s the day going for the other person. We have not mentioned this but I think he’s currently single otherwise he might have told me (?) and I told him I’m still with my bf (I don’t share ANY intimate information about my relationship with him I mean the “bad” things I always say I love my bf and we’re doing well). But through my friend’s voice notes and a few pics he has shared (literally like 1 per year during xmas or with his dog) I can clearly see he’s getting worse. Last week he sent me a disappearing picture on instagram of him laughing about a funny video I sent but I was so thrown aback by his appearance he’s looking almost ill, I don’t know if it was my imagination, I don’t know if he’s doing something else than weed… I feel he’s in his lowest even tho he’s not telling me this I just somehow sense it. I have asked him if he’s going to therapy but he didn’t say anything, most personal thing he recently told me is that he has always needed sleeping pills, that he almost never sleeps well and that currently he’s unemployed looking for a job and living with his mother and brother.   
I feel guilty for liking and thinking about my friend every day basically since last month, and having ‘nsfw’ thoughts about him. I have never been unfaithful to my bf or ever in my life so I don’t know how much of a risk it would be to ask my friend to meet up with me AT A PUBLIC PLACE just for lunch or something like that and try to ask him more deeply how he’s really doing, I fear for his life, I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I also know he doesn’t have a lot of people he can openly talk about mental health… I think his most of his closest friends might be a bad influence for him he should know better but well he might be lonely. It’s also very confusing that I feel(felt?) very physically attracted to him but I haven’t seen him in years, I didn’t like him on his last pic but it disappeared so quickly I’m not sure. This is so messy I don’t know what to doooo help, we also don’t have friends in common so I can’t simply tell anyone else to reach out to him.   
TLDR: I(30f) don't know how to help my friend (30m) who is going through a very harsh depression. I have a long term relationship with my bf(34m) who I love but he’s not fulfilling my physical affection needs, he blames my low libido because my depression I blame he’s not a physical touch love language type of person and we’ve broken up 4 times over the years. I fear for my friend’s life and I want to see him and provide my support if he needs a friend but I also like him dammit

"Hi everyone, Want to start this off with the fact that my boyfriend is an incredible person and I owe him so much for the things he’s done for me in the past 10 months of us dating. This only recently became an issue and was incredible unexpected but here we go:

 My friend group has about 17 people in it (8F,9M) and we have all been friends since high school. Within this group my ex bf from junior year of high school whom I dated cumulatively (through the course of 3-4 years) for probably less than a year. He hadn’t been around our group much since middle of last year as his now ex gf didn’t like that I was there even though I was also in a relationship prior. Don’t get me wrong I understand the uncomfortability of this situation and please remember that as I go on. When they broke up about 3-4 months ago (when I had already been dating my current bf for 6 ish months) he readded me on Snapchat* note that he only unadded me so it didn’t require me to add him back or anything* and as I went to clear it from chat so it wasn’t at the top I accidentally pressed remove as friend. He then texted his group of friends being like “I was adding her back bc ___ made me remove her and she blocked me wtf” and I read that to my bf because I was weirded out that it was so deep and try to be completely open about these things as I believe it’s better for trust. I saw him out one time after and we both didn’t acknowledge each other and the second time before thanksgiving at a pregame event with about 15 of us he approached and asked “do you hate me” to which I responded “no” and he asked “so why did you block me on Snapchat” and I said “I didn’t, I accidentally removed you but wasn’t and am not going to add you back cause I think that’s disrespectful to my bf” he didn’t believe me and I showed him my block list to prove it just to get rid of the awkwardness when we are all around one another and bc we’ve always been civil, never go out of our way to communicate but can bear being in the same room with one another. He expressed his like for my current bf and that he respects him and what not and the convo ended. But This is where my bf got upset as he thinks I handled it improperly because he believes I don’t owe him proof that I didn’t block him and it’s weird I showed him. I semi understood this but explained it was to keep civility and he still didn’t like it. 

NOW over this extended break from college our friend group will go out often and he has been at pretty much every event so I assume he’ll continue to be. My bf expressed that he felt hes “lapsed in holding his boundaries” and does not want me to be at (really pregames) social gatherings that he is at. I of course acknowledge this and want to show him I care enough about him to appreciate his boundaries and why he’s uncomfortable (as I would be if it were vice versa I’m sure). But I’m now feeling stuck as I only think I can escape those situations once or twice before my friends get annoyed with me or him and try to call him controlling. My other point is I only go out with these girls specifically and have no other groups of friends and I can’t be with him at him and his boys pg all the time so I’m not sure what to do to mitigate the division this would cause and how to both respect my bf and not make the situation with my friend group “worse” per say.

"Boyfriend's personal grooming

Hello! I would really welcome some advice. I (35f) have been going out with my boyfriend (31m) for three months. He's lovely, intelligent, and kind. We developed a slow friendship after meeting earlier this year and things are quite good on the whole. 
The problem is that I sense he wants to get more serious and I am not really there yet. He developed romantic feelings for me before they were reciprocated...and one of the reasons was his personal hygiene/grooming. When I accepted a date it was because I had developed an attraction towards his enthusiasm and zest for life. However, he was alone for a long time before we got together and had only had one relationship before me. If I'm being honest, I think other women were likely put off by the same things that are stopping me getting more involved...which feels incredibly shallow. 
Here are some examples:
His dental hygiene is poor to the point that I thought he was a decade older than his real age. I have brought this up and he says he just forgets to clean his teeth. I find the smell quite a turn off at times. He also forgets to wear deodorant. 
He is still wearing the same clothes from when he was a teenager, which tend to be faded band tshirts much too small and thick with pet hair even when washed. He always wears conspicuously odd socks.
He is bald on the top but has not cut the rest of his hair for many years so it hangs to his elbows and sometimes smells fusty.
I don't have masses of dating experience outside a couple of serious long term relationships and am torn between feeling like I am hoping/expecting someone to 'change for me', rather than just accepting them for who they are (which feels fundamentally wrong) and thinking that basic hygiene isn't too unreasonable of a request? His house is also quite dirty sometimes and I am put off spending time there.
There is part of me that quite likes that he doesn't care what people think, especially as he is 5'3 and still has plenty of confidence...but sometimes when we meet up I don't feel very attracted to him based on hygiene and presentation. I am always well groomed and clean. 
I have mentioned the teeth issue and he said he will try to remember without seeming too offended; is it reasonable for me to ask for a bit of effort in the other departments or is it inappropriate to request change from someone who I haven't been dating long? He's such a lovely guy that I would be disappointed if this turned out to be a fundamental incompatibility.

"
I met my gf's about a year and a half ago. Things are good on almost all front but there is one issue that's starting to wear me out. She expects me to attend all of her family's events: holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas,4th of July, etc), birthdays (mom, step dad, brothers), expects me to even go on vacation, go to random dinner... Their family is very emmeshed. They talk about everything to each, gossip, et. 

For me on the other, my family is very loving but we don't do all those ceremonies. We love each other, help each other and would give everything to support each other but we never did all that stuff. Thanksgiving maybe... But birthdays were seldomly celebrates. We buy each other gifts but we don't usually have party. My last birthday party was probably when I was 8. 

When she invites me to those events and I say no, she makes me feel like a bad boyfriend. Lately she keeps saying how her mom will get mad if I don’t go. I told I don’t have to do things to make her mom happy. Not even my mom has that kind of expectation of me. 

It also doesn’t help that we are an interracial couple, she is white, I am black. Whenever, I hang with them, it’s so awkward. I spend most of the time basing the clock. Some of it, it’s because we are culturally different. She is white American, I am black Caribbean. But also it’s because their personalities are so different to mine. They are loud, rude to each other (jokingly), makes sexual jokes to each other and generally more wild. Me I am quiet, “well behaved, too proper for my own good… so I tend to look bored and out of it.

When I tell her how I feeel, she pretty much tells me I’ll have to get used to it because she expects me to be part of her family.

"Manually crossposted because not sure where best to post.

I’ll make a long story extremely short.

Me and my partner have been together for over a year. Exclusive from the beginning, no conversations about changing the dynamic.

Recently, we’ve spent a month apart because I’ve had health issues. He told me he’s not going anywhere.

Well, I heard through the grapevine that he’s active on hinge.

I don’t want to burn my sources when I bring this up to him. We live in different cities, and won’t be seeing each other until at least next week. 

My question is, would it be in bad taste to text him about this and question him? Or should I wait until we see each other in person? 

The issue with that is that the waiting is KILLING me. I hate pretending everything is fine and chitchatting while this is in the back of my mind.

"Hi! So my girlfriend and I recently started with long distance - we are both doing a season at ski resorts but far apart. It hasn’t been working out, mainly because she hasn’t had the time nor energy to give me the attention and love I need. I voiced this with her and she has also noticed it. Both her and I can see a future together (at least she says so), but are afraid that the next couple of months apart from each other will tear us apart and eventually cause us to break up. So we are considering taking a full-on break(up) for the remainder of our trips and then meeting up and eventually getting back together after. Does anyone have any experiences of something similar?

"We’ve broken up once before bc of lack of communication and feeling like my needs aren’t being met but I got back with him these are all just about my thoughts some I have already said to him and some I wanted to say. We were together for 6months before breaking up and a month later we got back together and it’s been a month. This is a lot to read so no one might read this but I really could use some advice on what to do am I wrong for this? He said I’m setting unrealistic expectations and demands

I have worked on myself I’ve changed myself not just for me but mainly for you(samua) so I can treat you better and improve this relationship but what have you done to improve us? Like I appreciate everything you do do I’m happy you’re there for me whenever I need to vent about something, you respect me and compliment me and make me feel pretty and like someone actually cares for me you check up on how I’m doing what I’m doing if I ate drank and how my day or sleep was and those are all great things I’m really glad you do that for me but is that all you expect us to be? Do you expect us to remain stagnant for years until we’re in person and suddenly you’re my fiance and then things change? I’m ready to take our relationship to another level I’m ready to be more serious with you. We have taken a lot of time into improving me so I communicate my feelings more instead of bottling it up pushing it aside and ignoring it. We’ve worked on not attacking you or the people around me when I have shit going on. Now I want you to communicate I want to see something from you I’m trying so hard right now and I need to see that you’re trying too. I’m not even asking you to do anything for me anymore besides talk to me and communicate you know that main key thing in relationships. What did you expect our relationship to look like when we first got together? I’m your first girlfriend you’ve never had to be a boyfriend to anyone before so how did you expect this to go how did you expect to treat me? bc it almost feels like I’m just a friend that you really love but nothing more like you won’t open up to me and I am not getting that same effort and energy as I did when we first got together. Things are different now. Just a good morning goodnight and checking in is not enough anymore I need us to communicate to understand each other better I need to understand you better I don’t want to continue us like this, it feels so one sided like I’m trying to give you my everything the most important parts of myself I’m being vulnerable and opening up everything about myself to you but with you it’s almost like I don’t even know you you never really talk about how you feel or what you’re really thinking. I’m not just your friend that likes more than a friend I’m your girlfriend I’m trying to be your wife and you need to treat me like you wanna make me your wife bc I do not wanna be treated regular like im just basic or wtvr. In the beginning of our relationship I already told you how terrified I am for later on into the relationship that youll put in less effort into me that you won’t love me as much anymore but won’t ever admit to it and how it’s hard to let myself trust you if that could happen. I’ve said how I’ve seen this happen not just with peers but with my own mom who’s literally perfect besides some issues communicating she is so pretty looks young is smart hard working athletic can cook is funny and has an amazing personality and she still is being treated like shit and regular becuase her fiance got what he wanted he did it so he stopped putting in any effort which just killed the relationship. It feels like that’s what’s happening now ofc it’s not the same but definitely something like that is happening. Do you even love me the same? If you don’t would you ever admit to it? Do you value us? Do you value me? Do you want to do whatever you can to fulfill me and make me happy just as I want to fulfill you and do whatever I can to make you happy? Do you still think of me throughout the day? Am I even one of your priorities? Are you trying to have me be a part of your life and involved or am I just an accessory like I just carry the label girlfriend but you’re not going to try to keep me involved with your life. I do my best to keep you involved in mine our relationship is so difficult I mean like we’re literally across the world from each other, a nine hour difference and not only that but you’re autistic and I might be. I’m really trying so hard to make this to make us work I’m feeling really frustrated right now. We have to put in a lot of effort to make this online relationship work I don’t even get anything physical and I won’t for years even though that is my top love language and now I’m also not going to get what I need emotionally? Just please talk to me I’m not those other people maybe I am who know maybe you’ll send a long ass paragraph like this explaining how you feel and I’ll read all of that and still not understand but maybe I will understand even if it’s just by a very small amount. You have to give me the chance to understand you, how your brain works, how you process things, what you value. You not telling me any of these things makes it seem like do you even care like you say you do, do you want to put in effort for us or do you think you can just be comfortable bc you got me and even after I left you becuase of this exact same issue where you’re not communicating and my needs aren’t being met I came back to you do you think that that means you won’t lose me? We got back together under the agreement that we would BOTH do better and communicate more and I’m doing exactly that. What are you doing? It’s so frustrating I’m at an emotional state where I’m mad enough to be sad and ngl I almost fucking want to cry now. Everything I’ve said so far you’ve just completely shut down. You completely shut me down and now I feel like an idiot and I like I should’ve never even said anything idek if you really care about this or if you think this is another one of those times where I’m blowing it out of proportion turning something small into a big deal. But it is not small I am literally right now only asking you to talk to me and help me understand you and if you have stuff going on in your life right now one you can always talk to me if you need someone to listen but I’ll of course never force you and two if that’s what’s making it so hard to communicate and you don’t want to talk about it I understand just let me know that please. At this point I’m begging you to talk to me. And now I’m going to keep feeling stuck and shitty bc we haven’t resolved this now you’re asleep and I have to wait until late tonight when you’re awake again to hopefully work this out.

We got married quickly because she got pregnant during one of our trips, but she miscarried.

She enjoys working with her coworkers and is due to finish her associates in 6 months but won't see much of a pay increase. I am trying to think about our future together (children and a house). The company has locations in Massachusetts, and it seems easier to move locations within the company after getting hired than to find another job that is just as good. I'm always told the first job out of college is important and this company could mean a stable future. She is adamant about not moving and gave 2 suggestions. To not take the offer and try finding another job in Massachusetts even though most of the jobs I applied to in the first place were in Massachusetts or take the job and be long distance in our marriage until I find work in Mass.

(my question is: i just want to know if my anxiety is getting to me and maybe it is kinda weird to talk about that stuff too early or if he lost interest in me)


my boyfriend and i have been 'together' for 6 months and officially dating for 3. when we went on our second date he told me he wanted to make me his gf but he was respecting that i wanted to wait. i just wasn't that attached to him and he still wasn't that important to me but once i realized he was important to me and i did want a future with him i decided to start dating him. 

i am 23 and i haven't dated in 5 years prior to this and all my relationships were very bad before this. idk what its like to be in smth healthy and this feels healthy. we communicate so well and we talk about our feelings,
but recently my boyfriend and started calling our emotional discussions (with no voice raising and all ""i feel"" statements) arguments. (when i say emotional discussions i mean ""this happened and it made me feel this way"") he's also shutting me down when i talk about our future and says ""it's too early to talk like that we've only been dating 3 months"" and i expressed that it made me feel like he wasn't rly as in this as i am, yeah if he tried to marry me rn id say no bc idk him like that but at the same time... my guy it's been 6 months...whv is it so uncomfortable to discuss another potential 6 months? esp when we started dating he wanted to jump the gun so quick..


basically i'm just asking (and pls sugarcoat bc im sensitive rn) is this just him losing interest and deciding maybe he didn't want to date me? where is this coming from when we don't fight? I'm just so confused and im so dumb in this realm bc i avoided dating for so long because i enjoyed being single.


i would like to add: i am a very anxious person and my perspective of situations is usually a very pessimistic one and anxious one. but this is concrete, i just want to know if my anxiety is getting to me and maybe it is kinda weird to talk about that stuff too early or if he lost interest in me. idk how dating as adult works.

"My boyfriend and I are in a pretty new relationship, we started dating officially in early November, however we've been 'dating' since very early October, I'm using a throwaway account so as to not have this trace back to me so he doesn't find out I'm having these doubts.  
  
For some background context, my boyfriend and I first met last year, and we were 'exclusive but not dating,' which sounds silly, but for some reason, it's...super common if you're a British University student lol. We were in this phase of being super affectionate and liking each other for a few (we were never sexually intimate, just to note) months , then it fizzled out over Summer, and we both began seeing other people- no issue with that; I don't care about who he hooked up with in Summer.  
  
In September, the beginning of the academic year, we returned to university and had to see each other again. Initially, it was a bit awkward, but we eventually moved through it and were back to being just friends as we were in the same friendship circle at university. One thing to note is that one of the girls I live with at University (shared house) is my BEST friend, and she and I had always talked about how attractive we found my now boyfriend. I figured this was just girl talk and there was no more to it, but one night at the club the two got very drunk and she came on to him.  
  
They ended up making out in front of me, and while I wasn't seeing him at the time, it still hurt to see. I ended up leaving the club early and breaking down to my other housemates about how upset I was. One important thing to note is that we were all very drunk, so my best friend made a move on him, that he reciprocated, then after she had made the first move (making out with him), she asked me for permission to do it again. At this point I was drunk, upset and confused and told her to just go for it. The two went home together that night.  
  
The next morning she woke up and we talked it through and she apologised profusely and promised it was a drunken mistake, so I forgave her. It took time but he and I ended up rekindling our old 'situationship'. It eventually started out as casual friends with benefits, to cuddling and then love confessions, etc. We moved pretty quick, but I made sure to tell him I didn't want to be with him because I wasn't over what happened with him and my best friend.  
  
I thought I had healed from it, so I gave him a chance, now we're dating. He's truly the perfect boyfriend- he's always there for me, he treats me like a princess, and most importantly he's kind and he loves me. However lately, I've been up all night stressed, I know he would never have a wandering eye or cheat on me, he's not that sort of guy.  
  
But every time he comes over to my house, and she walks around, or they have a conversation, or sit next to each other, I want to be sick. I've always been a jealous girl, but I'm starting to realize I'm not over the situation like I thought I was. All I can think about is what those two did, it makes me feel sick.  
  
In short, I don't want to leave my boyfriend because I love him and I've never been treated so well, but I don't want this to keep plaguing my mind, especially when I've brought it up to him before and he said he doesn't want to talk about it again because it'll just upset me, which is fair enough. I'm just wondering if it's best to leave now, while we're still new, so I don't waste more time stressed over a past that I cannot change or control. I don't want a boyfriend I know has sexual attraction to my best friend, more so that he was sexual with her before he was with me.  
  
  
  
TLDR: My boyfriend hooked up with my best friend before we started dating. I don't know if I'm as over it as I thought- should I just start over with someone else, or wait to heal with my boyfriend?",Am I (19F) wasting my time with my BF (19M)?,18osae3,1703288658.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18osae3/am_i_19f_wasting_my_time_with_my_bf_19m/,
"(Yes, my girlfriend is 14 years older than me, I've gone over this in other posts)

I need advice regarding what should I do in this situation.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years. Every year, my side of the family goes to my aunt's side of the family for Christmas. This year it will be the same.

The thing is, my mother and my girlfriend don't get along. My mother doesn't approve of my relationship and has been disrespectful towards it from day 1, and because of this, the two of them have fought like 3 times with shouting.

Since the last time that happened (months ago, can't remember how much time has passed), my girlfriend hasn't been to my house, so the two of them haven't even seen each other.

My girlfriend's family doesn't celebrate Christmas, and that's why every year, my girlfriend has been included in my aunt's house reunion. She now lives by herself and her cats in a rented apartment.

Today, my mother angrily told me that if my girlfriend shows up at my aunt's house, she will immediately call an Uber and leave. To where? I'm not sure. I don't think she would return home because she doesn't like staying indoors.

I really don't want to leave my girlfriend to ""celebrate"" Christmas alone, but I really don't want the drama of my mom just not being there, and only her, just because my girlfriend is there. And I really am just fed up with this stupid nonsense. All of this would have been avoided if my mom wasn't so disrespectful almost all the freaking time.

I guess now I need to choose between ""kicking my mom out of the reunion"" as she probably will feel like, leaving my girlfriend alone, or don't go to the reunion myself and spend with my girlfriend.

Or what else can I do.",My (27M) mother won't be there for the Christmas celebration if I bring my girlfriend (41F) to my aunt's house (?),18os9sk,1703288607.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18os9sk/my_27m_mother_wont_be_there_for_the_christmas/,
"Hi guys, I (31M) accidently ruined my girlfriends (29F) Christmas gift to me.  
  
For context, I love gift shopping for people. I make mental notes of when my partner mentions something they think is cool but expensive, and I store them until an occasion comes up.  
  
She is also very good at gift giving, but in a slightly-less grandiose way. More meaningful, useful gifts, but leaves her feeling like she was outdone (She never is). This year she mentioned she went over budget (which is totally fine) and was incredibly excited with what she got me. She's usually worried about if I'd like the gifts.  
  
Unfortunately, I just walked in to the other room to grab my wallet where she had been wrapping gifts but had to step out. I knew that she was in the process, but completely blanked as I needed to grab my wallet before going out. She caught me coming out and immediately knew I had seen the box of 3D filament that was left near my wallet....I don't have a 3D printer.  
  
She's incredibly upset, and I feel like a bag of shit for ruining a surprise that for once she was so confident and excited for. I tried expressing how meaningful it was to me, and that I was very excited but she is convinced that the entire thing is now ruined and that I was supposed to be excited on Christmas morning. She's obviously right, but I can't take it back.

"We have been together 9 months and good friends for even more than that. We had just done a short trip together a couple days before this happened. We had about 5 months where we lived 5 mins away and it was amazing and we were so in love. Basically, the distance has been really hard for him. We are 830 miles apart. We have been doing it for 4 months and saw each other about once a month. It’s hard for me but I feel like I can balance things fine. 

Basically, we talked about how hard it’s been And how we feel disconnected and he said he doesn’t know if he can keep doing it. I told him that I can’t go back to school with that anxiety of not knowing. I wanted to know if he would believe in us and work on it or not. He kept saying he didn’t know, but then eventually said we would work on it. Throughout this time, he keeps saying he loves me , I’m his best friend, kissing my head, calling me babe, being loving, saying he doesn’t wanna be without me. He said how the love hasn’t disappeared but it’s not as strong and I used to be his absolute world but being long distance forced him to focus on other things and he is bad at balancing it. We’ve fted a lot and he said that doesn’t make him feel complete. 

After a bit of alone time, he came back and was sweet and we sat in silence for a bit. He said he loved me again too. Then, he said maybe we need to take a break. I was like “You know I don’t believe in breaks.” And he said “I know.” And I was like “so we’re breaking up then?” And he didn’t need to say anything after that. I wanted to leave immediately but I couldn’t compose myself to go downstairs and leave his house. He kept saying that it doesn’t have to be permanent and his parents broke up (they were high school sweethearts) and got back together. He said maybe in the summer?!?!? Like what. I was like “I don’t think it works like that.”

Immediately after I left, I left him on opened and we haven’t had any contact ever since. He told our mutual friend he missed me and that this feels weird and hard. He’s posted some sad stuff on his private story as well. I don’t know what to think. I’m so sad I haven’t been able to eat. I want to talk to him so bad but I know he needs to be the one to break no contact. Maybe we really did need space but breaks have always scared me and the fact that he wants to wait until summer.

I graduated high school in 2021 and for around a year after i tried to stay in touch with some of the people in my friendgroup We all went to different colleges but I do go to college in our home state thats no more than 20 minutes away from where we all live. As of now, i do not speak to any of them. Nothing bad or significant happened, we just lost contact but I see on social media that the rest of the friendgroup (excluding maybe 2-3 others depending on the setting) seem to be in contact quite often despite some of them going to schools abroad and only being at home during the holidays. I stayed in the same state for college, so i just don’t understand why they all put in so much effort to stay a friend group but not include me. I admit i could have done better at keeping in contact but after so long if i am the only one who’s trying to keep friendships i will stop and thats what it felt like. Throughout high school i would sometimes feel left out by them despite never having a fight with anyone and helping them through all of their fights between the group. I feel like i should be glad that ive moved on and made better friends in college but i can’t help but feel sad that they never put any effort in to reach out to me. 

I am stuck between reaching out and attempting at rebuilding my friendships or just letting it be and moving on. I just don’t know if it’s worth it or if i need to take the hint and realize they would invite me and reach out if they wanted to.

Hi! I’m already thankful for your advice and the time you’ve spent writing it. I’m in this very weird phase of my life : between childhood and real adulthood. I’m 18, and I’m getting my pre-university degree anytime soon. Anything can happen from there, and I am accepted in every program I’ve applied to. I’m reaching out because I’m in this phase of uncertainty, and someone I really care about is taking our relationship very seriously. 

Let me give you some context : we met during summer, he was an international intern from France at the family business. (I’m also French, but lived in Quebec for most of my life). We were together for four months. We knew it had to be short term. We separated in September, as expected. We went no contact, I decided to. It felt wrong, forced. In the beginning of November I decided to reach out. Long story short we’ve discussed a lot about us, he told me « I was the right person but at the wrong time in his life », and I clearly told him I was looking for something serious. He thought about it for a long time, and is clearly making efforts for us to get together. (I’m not being delusional this is based on what he said and what he does for me, no yapping).

I like him, feels good when we’re together, same values, all of that. Today he mentioned something in a very subtle way about living together in Canada, during college (he’ll be done studying by then he’s 20). 

So now I’m kind of overwhelmed by all of that, I thought this is what I wanted, but i dont even know what I wanna do with my life or what’s my purpose. I don’t know anymore. But I’ve never felt that way for anyone before. Should I go with the flow and follow my heart or follow my mind and my logic (what I usually do, but never brought me pure happiness)?",I (18F) don’t know if I want something serious with him (20M) anymore.,18oru2t,1703287337.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oru2t/i_18f_dont_know_if_i_want_something_serious_with/,
"So let's get down to it. I'm an entrepreneur who has been dating this model for the last 6 months. Our intimacy is incredible and we have the most insane time together. We both live in different countries so I fly out or fly her out to see me 10 days a month. I've been extremely busy this month as it's December and not had a chance to see her and it was her birthday on the 19th. I told her she can have a free pass for the night and we talked about it. She was not keen to be with anyone else but I told her it was a fantasy of mine to see her being intimate with someone else and having it recorded. We had a lot of conversations and reassured each other that we love each other a lot and this is a one time thing. Given it was a fantasy of mine and we are also planning to get serious next month I told her it would be her last night of freedom with another man. 

She is a famous Instagram model so has a lot of men sliding into her DM's and one guy in particular stood out to her and she replied to him and they scheduled to meet tonight. She kept telling me she won't go ahead with it and I kept reassuring her that it's ok and to just enjoy her night of freedom and that it's a free pass. She's currently with him as I'm writing this and she's probably getting her brains fu**ed out right now. Hoenstly speaking, I have a hole in my heart and don't know if I should have even allowed it.

"I (f23) have been dating my bf (m23) for 5 years now and we’ve had some issues where I caught him in lies several times in the past. Me being young &amp; stupid &amp; wanting to give him another chance decided to move forward with the relationship on the condition that he’s completely honest with me going forward and I can check his Snapchat whenever if I’m feeling doubts about what he’s telling me. This worked for a while until I stopped feeling the need to check his Snapchat and he got lazy with what he was saying to his friends in his groupchat. (I know this dynamic is toxic and unhealthy ok) I got a gut feeling that he was lying to me about his whereabouts a month ago &amp; I was right. He said he was at work but was actually at home gaming. I’m not shocked he lied because we had a conversation not long before about him calling off of work way too often. Like 1-2 times per week and he agreed he shouldn’t be doing that especially since he’s broke and calls off when he’s just feeling lazy or hungover from the night before. Anyway when I caught him lying we had a big argument about it and I got notified a few minutes later that my grandma had a stroke and was about to die. We rushed to the hospital together and the argument was forgotten about. He’s been very caring &amp; supportive since this happened so the lie was forgotten especially due to me being preoccupied with such a big loss and him providing comfort. Last night he decided to go to the bar. His mom who he lives with texted me asking if he was with me and I said no and she thought that was odd. I got a gut feeling immediately that he lied to one of us and I checked his Snapchat for the first time in a while. He drove to pick up his friends and they went to the bar. He had about 12 shots &amp; other drinks then drove home according to what he said in his group chat. After reading that I was livid. He thought it was funny and was shocked he made it home “without killing somebody or getting a DUI” in his words. I asked him today how he got home from the bar and he said he ubered. I then asked his mom if he drove home from the bar. She read my message and took a few minutes to reply then said, “no his car was here last night when I got home lol.” But when she got home last night she texted me asking if he was at my house… because his car wasn’t there. Again I’m not shocked at this behavior. I’ve heard him in person coerce her into lying for him to prevent him from getting in trouble before. When my boyfriend could tell I knew what really happened from the tone of my voice over the phone he started lovebombing me (I believe this is what was happening at least.) After the phone call he began sending me old pictures of us having a great time and telling me he wanted to take my nephew and I to play basketball tomorrow and then take me for steak because he just got a gift card. This is unusual behavior from him. Especially sending &amp; saying all of those things to me within a 2 minute span of time. I think he’s trying to manipulate me into not being upset with him, and from what I’ve learned online, that tactic is a form of lovebombing. It was just a really random thing for him to do and I didn’t explicitly say I knew he was lying to me about drunk driving and that I found out from his Snapchat. I just listened to his lie, said “really? Are u telling me the truth?” and when he replied saying yes I said okay with obvious doubt in my tone of voice.

"Im in a rough spot and I am honestly frozen on whats the correct step.

I have been with my partner for four years and we have a 6 month old daughter. (Not married)

The last few months have been very rough for us. I work very fare away from home and put in long hours. I do it for the family to try and give us a more stable future. I usualy leave at around 6am and come home at 9pm.

The job is very stresfull but its fare above the average pay. The weekends im so exhausted I feel I just need to rest to prepair for the next week. Prevouisly we lived closer and I would come home at decent hours but since our daughter was born we moved closer to her parents for extra help. Some days I am on the road for 5+ hours.

Overtime she became resentful and angry that I am not helping out more with our daughter. I understood her and always made sure she knew she was valued and is the best mom. I planed to leave my job a few times but she does not have much savings and In my head securing our finacial future would help us out more for the long run. Sadly its hard for her to understand this.

Things exploded. We started arguing back and forth for weeks and we just kept going in loops. One night things got bad and escalated. She trew something at me and did the same it back at her.

In this moment I could only think about my daughter and I decided I need to leave the house right now. I packed some things and left. 

Regarding our arguments I take 100% responcability for my actions and understand I am also guilty of many things.

(This is where things get scary)

I have tried to talk with her and she has completly shut off. She does not want to continue the relationship and wants us to come to a agreement on our daughter. Shes gone and not willing to work on it. (I offered couples counsoling)

I want to put our daughter in day care so her mom can start working but...  Following a convo with my lawyers if I start paying for this and if we cant come to a agreement and if it goes to court I will 100% be stuck paying the hole amount. Im already paying fully for the apartment(a nice one that im not even living at) and all the bills.

I want 50/50 with our daughter and I have a agrement offer for her but once we talk about it she will know I spoke to a lawyer and Im scared it will open pandoras box.

My lawyers told me exactly what to do but it will completly destroy our relationship and on the other hand if I dont act I could get screwed big time. (I know my lawyers personally and its all free: there is no motive but to help me. They are also very good lawyers)

I feel likes its a lose lose for me here. If I protect myself I am hurting the mother of my daughter who I love, possibly ruining our relationship forever. If I dont Im risking the future with my daugter and myself finacialy.

I quit my job finaly and have been working on myself. I started seeing a therapist and have been seeing my daughter almost daily. No real contact with mommy except for pick up times. If I try and talk about the relationship she just shuts off. I dont think she loves me anymore. 

Im honestly so scared on what to do... I cant sleep at night and the pain of this reality hurts deep.

Any advice for me guys?

"I (32F) have been dating my bf (31M) for 2 years now and for about 2 to 3 years prior fwb. Im currently in the middle of a conversation with him as I’m posting this. So for the past 2 weeks I’ve been staying with my mom after he and I gotten into a physical fight outside of the house we were staying at (currently homeless). I had to go to the hospital and he was locked up. Now he was released and has been calling me. And we spoken but I haven’t really been feeling like going back. Now I should explain something about myself; im a mother of 2 girls (one biologically his) and no i do not work. I do receive food stamps and a check (yes government assistance) every month. For the past two years, he and I have had disagreements that have led to us being physical more than twice. And each time I forgave him and thought we were moving forward. Now the reasons he says that we gets physical is usually on me because 1) I talk with a smart mouth, 2) I have a nonchalant attitude and act like i don’t care,and 3) I don’t know how to communicate. Now I started to notice/feel that he really cared for knowing about my past and comparing our upbringings (usually about how he wouldn’t have done what I chose and that he’s was focused on other things) now I usually brushed them off (cause Ive cane to terms with my past) and he’d never seemed to let go of the issue (or i never learned) so we basically have the conversations over and over; sometimes resulting in physical confrontation. Now I’ve never been the tell my past or my issues to people (even loved ones) but I told him a few things here and there about my past; he uses them as examples to get me to understand where he’s coming from. Now where he’s usually standing on the ground of i don’t cook enough (use to cook twice a week went down to once a week cause he barely ate), don’t clean up enough ( the house has 2 bedrooms and 3 of us use 1; i clean the house every 2-3 days), I don’t listen to him (aspics in which if he tells me to do something (money wise and all)), and I’m not sexually active enough (im not even going there). Now outside of the argument/disagreements; whenever he was frustrated/upset he would compare me to his ex(s) and pretty much everyone who’s been negative to him, he’s told me that his ex lover’s were better women then me (sexually, communication,and financially), has called me everything but a good woman, called me basically a stoner in a negative light, has told me he’s made my life better, called me ungrateful, blamed me for putting his life on the line (got into a an incident on the first and they pulled a weapon on me but he stepped in between). He works 2 jobs, rides a bike yo and from work (on the days he doesn’t catch a lyft since he no longer gets free rides from an ex lover), and pays for most things (things like tree, food… every now and then clothes and such) and with my small government check i cover whatever else we need (cleaner, entertainment: Netflix, crunchy roll, family plans, self care) as well as things i may want or need.  Now he’s complained/vented about spending money on me and my girls especially since becoming my boyfriend and has been insinuating that if I wanted anything from him I need to earn it as well as everything that he has bought me i don’t deserve them. And yes all of these things was said before and after the latest episode that i led me to be with my mom. During the conversation he actually asked me if he could have my permission to have sex with another female? Yet want to remain admit that he’s horny and lonely?

"My ex and I (27) broke up because he lied to me about getting a job. We were living together and he wasn't working. We agreed that if he didn't get a job (ANY job) in the next 30 days, he would move out. On the 30th day, he told me he managed it - he had applied as an Uber Eats driver, gotten accepted, and would start soon. He just needed to receive an ID in the mail. One week passed, no mail. 2 weeks, no mail. He said he inquired about it. Week 3, no mail. It felt off, so I asked him if he even got accepted to the job, and he confessed that he had never even applied. He said he lied from a deep shame of letting his depression prevent him from doing simple things like applying for work. As a gf, I can work with depression and shame; I stayed with him through 2 years of it, but once lying starts, I'm done.  


I ended our relationship of 3 years, and a few months later began dating my bf (who knew why I broke up with my ex). Also, fun fact, they had the same name.

  
He was very different from my ex. My ex and I never fought, but my bf and I had crazy spiraling fights bc a trauma from his ex made him very fearful I would lie or cheat. I ended it after 5 mo. He sent me a letter saying that it was his fault and he would do x,y,z to make it work if we tried again. One reason he gave was that his life was changing for the better, one thing being ""I'm going to start working at a hospital as a part-time job"". I agreed to try again, and I asked him on our first day back together how it was going at his hospital job. He said that he still had to hear back from them if he got the job.

  
I got very upset because it seemed so similar to my ex. I made big relationship decisions like living together or getting back together, partly based on info they gave me about their work. My bf said I had interpreted his phrase """"I'm going to start working at a hospital"" incorrectly - he meant he applied and would probably get accepted, but I took it as him already having a start date. I let him convince me that I had read into his words incorrectly and that my intense feeling that ""something was off"" was coming from my ex trauma. The coming weeks, I asked if he heard a decision from the hospital, he said no, that that was weird, and that he would follow up with them.

  
1.5 mo later, things started going bad with us again and he confessed that it was his fault bc he was stressed from living a lie - he had never even applied to the hospital. He said that he intended to do it right after sending me the letter, but was too stressed to do so. Then hearing I wanted to get back together, he was distracted. Then, he was ashamed.

  
Two boys of the same name, lying to me for weeks about waiting to hear back from a job when neither ever even applied, and their reasoning being shame. Am I partly to blame in this dynamic? Could there be something about me that makes my boyfriends fear my judgment, with the only option being to lie? If I am partly to blame, does it make their lies forgivable?

Her country is very expensive to stay at and so is mine therefore not more often, but due to work we can’t usually meet for more than 2-3 days at a time. She has recently been on a 2 week work trip to China where we have a 7 hour time difference but we are still able to chat with each other. Her work trip has been very hectic and stressing, which I totally understand and the first week we were chatting and talking on the phone as usual, but the second week I was ignored for more than a day at a time where she would text me when I was sleeping that it had been a hectic day, ignoring all of my messages without replying to anything I wrote. This continued for several days while I could see that she was posting stories on instagram of her having fun with others, drinking, playing games and although I mentioned to her that I didn’t appreciate it, she would never apologise and instead just say she was busy. She did it again yesterday and I couldn’t take it anymore.. I wrote and asked what her problem was and the only thing she could say was that she was busy, although she had just posted stories of her playing pool with others. Now I don’t know what to do.

"Long story short my BF has been sick since last Saturday. He had chills and body aches. He seems to be doing better he just has a bad cough and throws out phlegm now. Anyways lately I have been having chest pains, and shortness of breath. My boyfriend took me to urgent care to ensure I am okay cause I have asthma. I took a flu and Covid test to ensure it’s not that I tested negative. How ever the doctor says the flu is strong on those with asthma so just in case she told me instructions I needed to do. Anyways I decided to go back and stay with my parents for the time being since he is still coughing. My boyfriend is upset with me but I don’t know why. I think cause he thinks I am scared of getting what ever he has, but it’s like how can he blame me when I have asthma. 

Also I’m not sure if he has the cold, flu or Covid. On the first day he started with symptoms he tested at home for covid which was negative. He still should have taken a second test on the third day he didn’t want to and was being stubborn. He didn’t bother to go to the urgent care or doctor to check once again he was stubborn. 

Anyways he didn’t even communicate with me today as to why he is upset he said that if he said anything it would just make me mad. I feel bad cause I know he wanted me to go to the Christmas party for his job and I’m not sure how Christmas is going to turn out considering he is still on the mend. He didn’t  even say bye when I left, so he is upset and he was just quiet the whole time. I’m not sure if I made the right choice to stay with my parents for the time being. 

I also don’t understand how he could be mad when I’m trying to protect myself considering my immune system sucks and I have asthma. I have already been told if I get sick it will affect my asthma really bad. Now I’m stuck
Between wondering if I made the right decision for myself. I don’t want him to be upset I feel bad cause I know I really wanted to go to the Christmas party and I’m sure he wanted me to go. I just don’t know I feel bad. Did I make the right decision of staying away from him till he gets better? I feel like Christmas is ruined entirely.

"A bit of history: my husband hasn’t always been the greatest at being on time. His work is very fluid and he decides his own schedule and this tends to bleed into other areas of his life. This includes things like telling me he’ll be home at a specific time and not showing up until hours later because he got caught up in something. I’m very flexible and don’t mind him having a fluid schedule and changing plans, I just wish he would send me a quick update when plans change.

Due to his very fluid work schedule, he also often gets last minute cancellations so he decides to do something else instead. The most common one is that he goes skiing a lot in the winter, which is about 1.5 to 2 hours away from us. If he leaves early in the morning he can make it there in less than 1.5 hours, ski for a few hours, and then head home and be home by dinner. This has never bothered me before. What does bother me is that oftentimes if his work for the next day cancels, he will decide to stay up the mountain for the night so he can ski the next morning too without the drive. Once again, I have never minded this, but I do mind when he forgets to tell me. I’ll be waiting for him to arrive home at 3pm because that’s what he told me, and then by 4 or 5 I’m calling and texting to make sure he isn’t dead on the side of the road somewhere, and he’ll finally tell me that he decided to stay up because work cancelled for tomorrow.

I’ve told him many many times that him going out of town or to meet friends or to have his alone time, whatever, is totally fine with me, I just wish he would keep me in the loop better when plans change. But for some reason he doesn’t understand this. He keeps saying that I’m “mad” at him for “needing [his] own space and wanting to do [his] own thing.” No matter how many times I explain to him I don’t mind him needing his own space, I just want to be kept in the loop when plans change, he still keeps insisting that the real reason I’m “mad” is because I don’t want him to have his space.

So last week, he went up to go skiing while I was also away visiting my parents. He had a doctors appointment and work that night so he said he was only going to do a couple hours then head home. He was texting and chatting with me all morning and then around noon he stopped. I’d sent him a couple random messages and then a few hours later I tried to call just to check in which he didn’t answer. I then sent another text asking how everything was going. Around the 6 hour no contact mark I called and texted him again asking him to just let me know he was ok. He finally responded saying he’d hit his head and went to the car to go lay down. After a while he then decided he wasn’t feeling well enough to work or drive, so he contacted work to let them know, contacted someone to cover for him, and then got a hotel room for the night. He didn’t tell me any of this until I had been calling and texting him for 6 hours.

This time I was really mad. He’d had a concussion and went to the hospital due to a ski injury last year, so this was extra concerning. And I told him that in all the time he’d been able to contact his work, contact someone to cover, and set up a hotel room, he never thought to just shoot his wife a text saying “not feeling well, going to get a hotel room and lay down” or something. I told him this made me feel like I wasn’t even an afterthought, I just wasn’t a thought at all.

Once again he continued to defend himself as if the reason I was mad was because he didn’t go home. He said things like “I didn’t feel safe to drive, do you want me to drive when I don’t feel safe? Sorry next time I guess I’ll just get on the road regardless.” No matter how many times I explained to him that he made the right decision staying up, I was just upset he hadn’t kept me in the loop, especially when his health was potentially compromised.

Also during the time he was no contact I had both his job and his doctor calling me to ask where he was and if he was ok. The fact that I couldn’t answer them was super frustrating for me.

Anyway, he promised he’d communicate better. Then today we both had to work so I bid him goodbye in the morning and even said something like “it’s a shame we can’t go skiing today because it snowed there last night” and he agreed. Then a few hours later I get a text from him with a picture of him skiing and no other explanation. I assume his work was cancelled so he decided to go up. I told him I wished he had let me know he was heading up there. At first he apologized but had changed his tune by the time he called me just now on his way home.

I explained to him AGAIN that I didn’t mind him going up and didn’t mind him doing whatever he wanted, I just wanted to be kept in the loop. His argument was that he did text me when he got there to let me know, and that should have been enough.

On the one hand I suppose he’s right. He DID let me know, even though it was very delayed. But on the other hand I’m just so fed up with being treated like an afterthought. Especially since every time he goes up there he ends up spending more time than he says he will and often ends up staying overnight. Oftentimes this will disrupt my plans too because I’m expecting him home at a specific time and then told hours later that that’s not happening. Sometimes I have things planned for us or something I need him for, and he won’t even think to ask me first before deciding to stay up. It just feels very disrespectful to me and makes me feel like he doesn’t value my time at all.

Anyway, he’s mad at me now because I was frustrated and in his opinion he did let me know so he “doesn’t know what you want from me” anymore. I understand his point of view, but I’m also just so frustrated and burnt out from trying to guess his next move and not being able to rely on him to be where he says he will at any given time. And he still thinks I’m just mad about him wanting time to himself, which is not the case at all, but no matter how many times I try to tell him that he doesn’t seem to get it.

How can I make him understand the real reason I’m upset, without him feeling like I’m trying to be controlling or telling him he can’t do the things he enjoys or have time to himself? I really don’t mind him doing his own thing, as I frequently do my own thing too, but I’m always very communicative about it. Is there a better way to make someone understand why your upset when they’re so hung up on their own narrative?

"My brother sent me this email a week and a half ago. 

Short backstory. I am very low contact with my fam. My brother definitely doesn’t see our family in the same light as me. He is a hardcore evangelical fundamentalist. I grew up Christian but am no longer. His and my Mom’s affiliations are a big reason why I’m not around much.

I know my brother does love me, and I still love him and all of them. But I know that he wants greatly for me to be a Christian. He must, I’m sure. And that of course bothers me because how can I be in a close family relationship with that going on? 

He’s 8 years older than me. And I always looked up to him growing up.

“Dear obvious sea” 

It's been too long. I've been thinking a lot about  you lately: how you've been, what you're doing, what you think about, and hoping you are well. 

It's odd, growing up I never would have thought our family would be as fragmented as it is. I rarely see *our other brother* and you less, but I guess this is just me saying I wish it wasn't always like this. 

Anyway, I'm hoping this finds you well and I wanted you to know that I was thinking about and praying for you. 

Love, 
*u/obvious_sea’s older brother*
“

I don’t know. Aside from everything, I also feel weird reading stuff like this. There are things in this letter that I would never say to someone I love. I don’t even really know how to respond. There is a lot that our Dad has done in just the last few years that would illuminate his understanding about why I’m distant. But like I said, them being such hardcore Christians is another reason why I’m so distant and you can’t just explain that to that person.

He moved out when I was in 6th grade and got married when I was in 8th grade. I haven’t really thought about us as the family of 5 that we were in 90’s in a looong time. He’s a lot older than me, so he wasn’t around that much growing up. When he moved away when I was 11 even less so. And when I stopped being a Christian around 10 years ago, even less. 

The last time we talked on the phone was two years ago and he was kind of not that cool. He runs a lot and I was telling him about the little I run had done around that time which I was proud of and he was like being competitive about it. And I was trying to just keep the convo light and he seemed to resent that I wasn’t giving him much to work with or I don’t even know. After that I haven’t wanted to reach out a lot

Even though he’s a very accomplished and successful dude, he just doesn’t get why I’m not receptive about certain things, or why I deflect certain stuff.  Like the running competition stuff. But in general too. And he’s like, “ why aren’t you letting me get close to you.” (I’m just saying that’s what I’m getting. He hasn’t said that specifically or anything.) And then getting frustrated with me and ending the call abruptly lol. I’m describing our last call which was over two years ago.

I mean, I’m extra on guard because he thinks I’m going to hell lmao. He must think that. It makes talking with him so tricky. It makes me sad because I do love my brother. I do think he is a good dude, but EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY. It makes people tricky!

We have another brother in between us who may be autistic and N? He’s has always hated me. A lot of character assassination. 

All of this is so exhausting to even think about and is part of why I’m so distant.

Idk. What do you think?

I was thinking about just messaging him today,

"Was having a birthday celebration with some friends, and their GF’s. We’ll call the two involved here, Lucy and Kyle. Kyle, myself, and my other friend are hanging out in the other side of the room, and Lucy spills a coke all over herself. 

Lucy freezes in place, and repeatedly calls for Kyle to drop everything he’s doing, interrupt his conversation, and come over and clean her up. She repeatedly was yelling over to him, “Can I get some damn help over here?!” Kyle immediately sprints across the room, and proceeds to clean her up, while she just lets him clean her. 

Everyone noticed what had just happened and we all thought this was the weirdest thing we had ever seen. I’m all for assisting your partner if they make a miss, but making the other partner drop whatever they’re doing and clean you up like an infant is sooooo strange. 

This isn’t the first time she’s done something like this either. She did something similar with pizza.

I’d like to hear everyone’s opinion on this, and what Kyle should do to prevent this in the future.","My friend’s gf 25F, treats him 24M, like a bus boy",18oqtxa,1703284485.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqtxa/my_friends_gf_25f_treats_him_24m_like_a_bus_boy/,
"Hi,

Been with my gf for 10 months.

I introduced her to a group of friends and one of the guys there (who I don’t know) and her were chatting for a while. I felt he was being flirtatious and mentioned it to her (just as an FYI and in a jokey way but also clearly a bit irritated) and she disagreed that he was flirting.

Fast forward 3 months later and I am about to go to a friends party who was there when I introduced her. She then in a very obvious way asks me if “that” guy is going to be there. Keep in mind I don’t know him and we never even mentioned him since. I told her that was weird and she responds with “just joking, trying to wind you up and I am not going to be there anyway”.

It’s not in my head. Why was she thinking about this random guy?

I am fairly new to relationships, would this be something that is a red flag? Or a harmless joke?",My (30M) gf (30F) made a joke and now I can’t stop overthinking,18oqt7m,1703284426.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqt7m/my_30m_gf_30f_made_a_joke_and_now_i_cant_stop/,
"Hi, I have just seen my sisters rings and she is wearing quite a few family gold pieces. I’m really resenting her lately and I’m going to ask her to stop wearing them. 

She’s 3 years older than me but very immature. We are both recent graduates from uni so in our mid twenties. I have been lucky and worked hard and have a stable job in the finance sector that I managed to sign for before graduating. She studied law, and managed to land a stable long term job after a year and a half of her graduating. She recently lost that job but didn’t tell us(her family me my mom and dad), she lied to us and was secretly using my moms card linked on her Apple Pay, spending about $3000 on the card over 6/7 months. My mom is awful with technology and online banking so this went unnoticed, when I confronted her she was so defensive and came up with a plethora of lies. Only to our father did she slightly apologise but was still denying it blaming her phone/Apple Pay as if it made a mistake. We could tell all the transactions she made as they came up with the ApplePay reference no on the statements when we checked. 

Now after the first time we noticed, my father kept an eye on my moms bank statements but after a few months he must have slipped and my sister then started using the account AGAIN. My dad then drained my moms account so any transactions would be declined and that’s when my sister finally learned her lesson.

So as she had lost her job and was using my moms account, now that she didn’t have this she must have been using her overdraft. Her bank was in overdraft and because she didn’t pay any of it back it was sent to debt collectors, we got repeat letters asking for $2000 to be paid. She was hiding these letters, as well as letters where she hadn’t paid for petrol and got fined or paid car tax and got fined, which had also been sent to debt collectors. 

My parents in the end also paid of this £2000 debt. Finally the reason she had lost her job I’m pretty sure is because she failed out of her masters, I went on her laptop a few months ago and looked for her certificate and could not locate it , I found her test results and found she had failed her exams for her masters. 

Recently my dad has moved away to live back with his mother, so that means I was left to pay the bills for our house. I have my graduate job and have started paying for the bills as soon as I started, my mom pays the rest of the mortgage. While I was at uni, my sister had graduated and did not pay anything towards the bills, and now has left to live with a friend who I think is letting her live there for free until 2024. 

I really resent her for everything she’s done and she still seems to hold no accountability especially as she’s not at home anymore. But to be honest I don’t even mind if she lives with her friend, pays rent and has a job but I just don’t even know if she is working or what. She’s just floating through life. Anyway I’m going to ask her to give me those pieces of family gold, I don’t think she deserves them.",Am I (23f) right in asking my sister (26f) to stop wearing our family jewellery?,18oqsct,1703284358.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqsct/am_i_23f_right_in_asking_my_sister_26f_to_stop/,
"Hello, so first of all, sorry for my bad grammar, English is not my first language.
So for background I am 20 years old female, and I still live with my parents, because I still studying at university, and afford my own place is too expensive here. I have a boyfriend. He is 21 years old male, and he is working now, and also lives with his parents. We planning to rent our own place in the future. I love him very much, and this is my first ever relationship, so idk, how exactly I need to react to this. 
But okay, let's start. I don't know if this is a big problem, but I'm starting to think that he is getting tired of me, and i fear the worst. Last time we met, he was acting a little bit different, he played a lot on the phone, sometimes ignored me, that's never happened before. Also I always trying to make some plans with him, and when I ask his opinion about some plans i have made, he just shrugs like he doesn't care. But it's not about just plans it's also about everything when I ask something. But today is the day that I started to fear for our relationship.Today after work, he just straight away started playing that stupid game, and not texted me like he used to text. Also every night he and I texts goodnight messages for each other, and it doesn't matter if we are angry at each other or not in the mood, we always text goodnight. But today he didn't wrote any. I was waiting for him to stop playing that game, that we could chat a little bit before going to bed. I also texted him a few messages, but he just straight away ignored them. I don't know how to react to this behavior. It could be that I watch too much tiktok videos, that the man just out of nowhere start loosing feelings. 
Maybe I need to talk to him about this? But just to be honest, I don't know. Like I said it's my first relationship and I'm still learning some stuff. I don't expect much out of you, but maybe you have some advice, what I should do. Or maybe I'm just overreacting, and everything is fine. Also don't tell me to broke up with him, because I'm not the type, that if something goes wrong, I need to broke up right away. I really want to things work out between us.",I [20M] having some problems with my boyfriend [21F],18oqs5q,1703284342.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqs5q/i_20m_having_some_problems_with_my_boyfriend_21f/,
"My bf (24m) and I (26f) have been in a relationship for over 2 years now, and recently I am constantly wondering if we’re really a good match. There are a few things about his behaviour that really upset me. He isn’t giving me nearly enough attention. Most of the time when we spend time together, he’s sitting on computer playing video games with his friends while I am just sitting on the bed minding my own business (reading, sleeping, scrolling through TikTok or watching a TV show). That’s not my definition of spending time together. When I tell him that I feel neglected, he’s just laughing and shrugging it off, telling me that we’re spending enough quality time together and that we are constantly with each other. It’s true that we spend a lot of time together, but in my opinion there’s a big difference between actually interacting with each other, having a conversation and just being in each other’s presence. At first, it didn’t really bother me that much, but when I hear my girlfriends talk about their relationships, I kind of envy them. My bf doesn’t seem to put mich effort in our relationship. We are not even intimate with each other that often because he never feels like it. Sometimes, I am feeling sexually frustrated because of his low libido. But I can live with that, even though I keep wondering whether or not he still finds me attractive. There’s one thing; however, that really pisses me off: he often doesn’t read my text messages on WhatsApp. He just leaves them unread, even when we’re spending time together. How hard can it be to at least click on our chat. You don’t even have to fucking answer me because I am already there. He often keeps my messages on unread for 2 days…it makes me so angry, and I told him so many times to at least click on the chat. He’s texting back and forth with his friends, so why can’t he just click on our text messages?! How hard can it be?!
He also doesn’t want to move in with me. When I talk about eventually moving in together (like in a few years) he always has a certain look on his face. I hate that look because it makes me feel insecure and unwanted. He’d rather move in with his two best friends, sharing an apartment with them instead of with me. When he talks about his future plans, etc. from the way he talks, it sometimes seems like his future doesn’t include me…It makes me sad, and then I am constantly thinking about it because it upsets me. Maybe I am being too dramatic, but at times, I just think about leaving. He treats me well otherwise, but it feels like he’s taking me for granted. I don’t know how to bring these things up because when I do, he tells me that I am overreacting/overthinking things. But I have been having doubts every now and then, and for the past few weeks, these doubts become more and more prominent in my head…I don’t know what to do…should I just end our relationship? I don’t really want to but with how things are going, I don’t know.",I (26f) am not sure if I should stay in a relationship with my boyfriend (24m),18oqq0j,1703284188.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqq0j/i_26f_am_not_sure_if_i_should_stay_in_a/,
"First of all sorry, as you will see english is not my first language. So I am a 22 yo guy and I recently broke up with my boyfriend who’s a bit older than me, to be precise I broke up with him twice, the first one in June and the second and definitive one in August.

I started suspecting he was a narcissist around May after quite a bit of what looked like red flags to me, such as: he was self-centered and selfish, obsessed with positions of power, he had pretty empty and robotic sexual interactions, displayed little to no empathy, wanted the conversation to always be about him or what interested him and in general things weren’t good anymore between us, oh and I also started to believe I was trauma bonding with him and that he was gaslighting me in some occasions.

We knew each other already before being a romantic couple. After I broke up with him in August we saw each other for the first time in late September becuase I had been previously invited to his best friend’s wedding. He came to pick me up, said I had nice hair and was being very friendly. We talked a bit about cars and videogames and everything was fine throughout the day up until I met a guy, (what are the odds, it wasn’t even a gay wedding!!! so I swear to God I never went there with the intention of doing something like that, it just happened with the alcohol and stuff like that), and I started talking to him, it ended up being nothing, but that night we just walked around a bit because the music was very loud and we couldn’t hear each other. Mind that we broke up in early August with the intention to maintain a civilized-hello-how-are-you kind of relationship and maybe play some online games with people we usually played with. When I got back to the table we were sitting at he didn’t even look at me, didn’t talk to me and when he dropped me off he stopped at the beginning of my street, he usually entered my street and dropped me off right beside my building instead this time he dropped me off nowhere near my building. He did it out of spite of course, like a child would do. After he dropped off his friends that were in the car with us he called me and started yelling at me things like: &lt;are you stupid or what?&gt;&lt;do you realize you made me look ridiculous in front of my friends?&gt;&lt; first you break up with me and then you come to my best friend’s wedding and you do things like that?&gt; Then he didn’t even give me a chance to reply because he hung up. Was he just jealous? You wanna stay friends but as as soon as you realize I can have a life outside of you you go crazy? I think it was a sign that I was moving on and he started to realize that he could lose his source of primary supply. Again, was he just jealous or does this sound like something a narcissist would do?

In October I underwent surgery, nothing serious, I know he knew it because a mutual friend told him or whatever, he didn’t text me to ask how it went or if I was ok, nothing at all. Then in November, on my birthday still nothing. The day following my birthday I deleted him from twitter, discord, everything we had. Only then he decided to text me saying that he behaved like that after the wedding because he still loved me, and what I did hurt him and now I was deleting him from everywhere after how I behaved at the wedding and then he wished me a happy birthday. I thought he was just pissed/afraid after he realized he was losing his supply forever. I didn’t reply to this message. After some days he called me twice, I didn’t answer. Yesterday (late december) he texted me &lt;can we please put an end to this madness?&gt; and sent some images of a game we played together. Still nothing from me. This morning so the following day, he texted me &lt;I now realize because you’re not answering me, it’s because you’re a coward with no balls and you not answering me only shows that you are a psychopath&gt;. I got tired and I replied, saying like I’ve said before that in my opinion he was the psychopath feeling no empathy, that I was wondering when the devaluation stage and the insults would start to come, that I find funny how the day before he wants to be friends again and after less than 24 hours calls you a psychopath with no balls because I’m not answering him and that I don’t want anything to do with him anymore and he’s no one to me now. He immediately came to my place, my mom basically forced me to go downstairs to listen to what he had to say. He was almost crying, or at least in my opinion he was forcing himself to cry, he said he behaved like that because he still loved me, that he doesn’t want to throw away the years before we got together because we were like brothers, that he doesn’t understand how I became an antagonist towards him and stuff like that. I told him that a message asking how I was after surgery or for my birthday would have been appreciated. Is he sincere or what?! The day before you wanna reconcile and the day after you insult people?

So, to my eyes this looks like his last or at least an attempt to get his supply back by pretending to cry and to make me remember all the good times and stuff like that. I was cold like a stone and basically I didn’t even flinch. He left saying I wish you all the best.

The problem is, even during the relationship sometimes I thought am I the narcissist here? am I depicting him as someone he’s not? am I evil? am I a huge asshole? And usually I manage to say no to myself, but tonight I felt like that again, or at least he made me feel like that again, I guess. Now his sister is texting one of my best friends saying he’s crying and he’s desperate. Is this what they do when they lose their primary source? I genuinely don’t know and I am going crazy because if he’s not a narcissist I’d be throwing in the trash a nice friendship, or at least as I said before a civilized relationship. If you could share your experiences or if you don’t feel comfortbale just tell me what you think it would really help, thanks a lot. I need to know I’m not a cold-hearted asshole and/or if I’m being gaslighted and manipulated again. After all the reading I’ve done some things he’s doing don’t seem like something a narcissist would do, while some others yes. I need to understand if I’m acting this way because I convinced myself he’s a narcissist or if he’s really one, therefore the silent treatment would be what I should be doing and what I’ve done for the past 3 months, whereas if he’s not and I am just crazy I would be feeling like a huge idiot.

"Hi, just maybe hoping to get some advice into why this might have happened.

I’ve been seeing this guy consistently 2-3 times a week since September. I left for two weeks for a vacation (with my fam and he knew about the trip when we first started seeing each other).

He seemed a bit distant during the trip but I put that down for the time difference.

We just saw each other Wednesday night - he told me he didn’t want me to spend the night and then Thursday morning he texts me he’s not interested in seeing me anymore.

It seemed so random and out of the blue I’m reeling at the 180 of it. Leading up to when we hung out he kept texting how he couldn’t wait to see me, hear about my trip etc and then the text.

I was thinking either he caught feelings and didn’t want to admit it or he met someone else? Thoughts?",I (31F) randomly got dumped by this guy I’ve been seeing (34m),18oqnbu,1703283971.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oqnbu/i_31f_randomly_got_dumped_by_this_guy_ive_been/,
"Please don't judge me. I just need advice on how I can handle this situation.
I've been in a LDR for 3.5 years with this guy [23M] and it was only in the second year that we got to see each other atleast once in two months. I've always felt like he doesn't put in much effort and that I'm putting in his part of the effort in the relationship. I'm someone who needs their partner to spend time with them. But he is extremely busy with his internship and habit of procrastinating. I've told him repeatedly how it would mean a lot if he could take out an hour's time in an entire week for me, but it never happens. I always try to come up with activities we can do on video call. Since I was the only one coming up with and actively seeking out things we could do, despite repeatedly asking him to come up with something, combined with a bunch of other things, I felt exhausted. But this is not to say he doesn't do anything. He has helped me with my assignments and resumes. He was saving up for a laptop but took out some of his savings so we could go on a vacation. He looks up and shares articles he finds related to my field of interest. He's learning how to comfort me.
But towards the end of November I had gone numb. I had no feelings left towards him. And honestly all I could think of was the things I've done for him (I wasn't keeping tabs) and the things I've asked of him that he's never done. My brain just couldn't think of any good things he had done in the relationship. I asked him to list down things he had done so that I would get out of my head. Anyways we decided to take a months break because we both were feeling a bit distant. We decided that this break was to focus on ourselves and also look into whether we were together just cause we liked the thought or we actually cared for each other. The break comes to end on the 1st of Jan.
During this time, I started interacting with this guy [23M] in college. I didn't expect anything to happen but then I started craving his attention. I felt like it had been very long since I'd received any form of attention. I thought to myself that this would just be me trying out different things like the concept of flings. I've never done it before and I'm too emotional for those kind of things but I wanted to experience wild stuff. So I started flirting with him. After some time, he too reciprocated. Now he's the kind of guy who fucks around is what I've heard. And deep down, I'll be honest, I'm not proud of associating myself with him. But slowly he started opening up to me about his family, purpose in life, etc. and he doesn't talk about this stuff with anyone. He was being himself with me and I didn't have to put up an act either. I found it easy to talk to him and be myself around him. He also showed great concern towards me. But then again he doesn't have the best of friends, other people judge him badly and he doesn't have a good dressing sense. Which makes me not want people to see me with him. 
But recently we started talking a lot more and even tried to kiss, but I was too shy and couldn't go ahead with it. But I can't stop thinking about it and imagining things. 
I don't know what's gotten into me and why I'm doing this. I want to be with my boyfriend and he's someone I really appreciate and is the kind of person Ive always seeked out. I'm just confused about the love part. 
I just extended our break because I couldn't have myself talking to the other guy while I was with bf. 
College ends on 17th and I expressed my wish for non-commitment and sort of lied about how I don't like relationships just so that once college ends, whatever I have with the new guy ends. And also so that he doesn't take whatever's happening seriously.
But it just seems like things with him are picking up pace and I'm scared and feeling indecisive.

"My boyfriend and I have been having a bunch of problems and I would like advice/opinions on what I should do! The main two problems we have are Him prioritizing his friend over me and his fixing his sleep schedule. For a while, both him and I had terrible sleep schedules and I had been talking to him about fixing it. I eventually fixed mines for my job but his stayed the same. As a result, we began to spend less and less time together. I had an issue with this, so I did bring it up to him more often about fixing it. Nothing ever changed though, it basically just caused more arguing in our relationship. This made me think I was going about it the wrong way and I talked to him about how it may feel like i was pressuring him, and I decided to just let him fix it on his own. A week passes and still nothing changed. I started to tell him how I felt alone in this relationship and for one day he got up earlier than usually and hung out with me.

"Hi everyone, I'm going through a tough time and could use some advice on how to process a recent ""breakup"" 

About 6 months ago, I met a guy online while studying for our medical license exams. We are both medical students graduating soon, preparing for license exams, and so on.

 Initially, it was all about studying, but over time, we developed feelings for each other. We confessed our feelings two months ago, and while we didn't officially become a couple, we enjoyed chatting about our days, sharing interests, and flirting. 

However, we had several arguments that led me to end things. There were fundamental issues that made the relationship seem unsustainable. 

**1.** I don't like how he believes the stereotype of girls, as being dramatic, superficial  
I sought reassurance about it, and he reassured me, but to me, I wouldn't feel safe with a person who holds the slightest pinch of misogyne.

  
**2.** When I tell him I am uncomfortable with a particular topic or question that he asks, he continues asking and nags me to answer. No matter how many times I tell him I don't like this way of being forced to answer, he says he knows my personality better.

  
**3.** In all arguments we have, he thinks I make an issue out of nothing, and he cannot see his mistakes.  
he even told me once, after he made get mad, that u got mad by yourself, so you gotta resolve it by yourself. he doesn't check up on me neither apologize when he makes me mad or pisses me off as it is my responsibility.

  
**4.** Even after I stated to him what makes me hesitant about us, how he handles these situations + how I find him to be harsh, he denied it and said it is about how I perceive it.

Despite my love and admiration for our potential, I ended the relationship due to the insensitive way he handled disagreements. I had recently left a toxic relationship with a dismissive partner, and I couldn't ignore the parallels. My question for you all is whether you think ending it was the healthy and mature choice. Do you believe there were other options, and can I hope to find a fulfilling relationship in the future? I'd appreciate your insights.

I liked the game, but whenever I start playing it, she wants to join and we barely win because of her. We also recently started a playthrough of Baldur's gate 3 just the two of us, because we tried playing with friends in a party of four, but someone always kept dropping out or abandoning the playthrough, so that kind of ruined the game for me because I had to start anew several times.

"Insecure husband

So in the past I apparently never complimented his dick. 

I told him I think it’s just a body part just like any genitalia. It’s not too big and it’s not small. It’s perfect to me and it pleases me. 

Now he is insecure about this pecker because of a past relationship and said he’ll always be insecure about it and that I’m not helping him get over that insecurity. 

How can I help him when he doesn’t believe what I say ? Keep disregarding my comments and my sexual comments and attempts to make him feel good about his dick? 

I compared his dick to tits. Not to big and not to small but they are perfect. I said exactly what he would say to me if I was insecure about my body. Do I believe him? No but I accept it and move on cause I know it’s my problem and not his.

"My bestie(24M) accidentally read a private text my gf(24F) sent me(24F). I told her and now she is upset. Idk what to do now to solve the situation.

I think I've messed up. My gf is coming to visit me (both 24F) and has asked me to book an appointment at the aesthetician to get laser hair removal. I went to my aesthetician with my bestie (24M) since we were already hanging out together and it would be the last day I could book before the holidays. As I was asking for prices etc I was texting my gf to ask what she wanted to go for. In the end she settled for having her privates and legs shaven. 

Once we got out of the shop,, my bestie told me jokingly: ""I'm so sorry but I accidentally saw one of the messages your gf sent you."" 

He was talking about her message saying that if I would help her shaving the above mentioned parts, she would get those done. 

He didn't make fun of her or anything, he was just curious about it since he had never been shaven by his previous bf. I explained to him that I actually thought it makes a lot of sense to have your partner help you with shaving since they would have a better view of the hairs on your body. The conversation ended with me telling him jokingly that maybe his future dream boyfriend would also help him shave and he agreed saying he would love that. 


Later tonight I was on the phone with my gf and when she asked how our hanging went and after telling her about some stuff that happened, I decided to share about this as well in a ""I found it funny"" kind of way.

She found this pretty upsetting, she is not mad at me but at him and called it a dick move. While I understand how that was a private text, I know for a fact that my friend was not reading it maliciously and was not judging her in any way. If he knew how upset she felt about it he would immediately apologise. Just before going to the aesthetician we were talking about the differences between lesbian vs. gay relationships, I think he was simply curious about this and wondering if it was a ""normal"" thing all lesbian girls did. 


I tried to explain the context to her and make her feel a bit better but she didn't really seem receptive. I feel really bad, especially since they were supposed to meet up next week and she was genuinely excited about it since she doesn't have many queer friends. Now it feels like I've spoilt it. I realize now I shouldn't have told her about the exchange, if the roles had been reversed I would have felt a bit embarrassed but ultimately found it a funny exchange but I realize she is a more private person. Now I'm not sure what to do to solve this issue. 

Tl;dr: My gf texted me while I was at the aesthetician to book her appointment that if I would help her shave her privates and legs she would get those done with laser removal. My gay best friend accidentally saw the text and asked me about it afterwards. I told my gf the story thinking she would find it funny but she got pretty upset - which I understand since she is a private person. Now I feel really bad, especially since they are supposed to meet up for the first time next week and she was genuinely excited about it.",My bestie (24M) accidentally read a private text my gf(24F) sent me(24F).

"So, I've been working with this guy for roughly the last 2 years. We hung out a lot before and I kinda felt like we had a thing. I was in an open relationship so we had sex, but I wasn't sure if casual sex was for me so we didn't do it again. After that some drama went down at work and we didn't really talk for a few months. 
Now at a work happy hour he was flirting with me a lot but he always does that when he's drunk. We felt eachother up in my car, but we both ended up crashing at a friend's house, and nothing happened. 
Today we grabbed lunch together on our lunch break and he was asking me about if I was seeing anyone, what I thought about dating, like so many questions regarding that. At one point I felt like he wanted to ask me If I would ever date a coworker, but Idk if I'm just reading into that. He also made a point though of saying how he wasn't really looking to date and that girls are always into him, but he doesn't want it. He was also being really flirty though like when we were heading out to my car he asked if I cared if he ate an apple in the car and I was like yeah w.e. and then he put his hands behind his bag and was like ""you're not gonna arrest me?"" He literally smirked at me and then laughed. LIKE.... IM PRETTY SURE ITS FLIRTING. 
I gave him a drive home after cause his car's in the shop and I was going that way and he took a picture with me for Snapchat which he never does. There are like never people in his Snapchat stories let alone his coworkers. Then when we stopped he hesitated getting out of the car and idk it just felt like there was such a sexual tension in that car. He does have a bit of a history of being hot and then cold though and definitely not the best communicator. I'm just at a loss for what this means. I think he's very hot and Id be down to see where something goes now, but I don't want to be wrong and make things weird.

"For context we’ve been together for a year &amp; half &amp; we both took different paths in life. I’m a recent college graduate with a stable job beginning my professional career while she never went to school post high school &amp; she barely makes ends meet. We both still live at home but we’ve spoken about wanting to live together. She’s a great partner overall. 

But there’s always something up in her life.. lack of money, issues at her job, with her parents, her dog, her car, something is always going on that’s constantly affecting her life &amp; in return affecting our relationship.

I worry about having to deal with all this stuff. I like stability &amp; routine &amp; for things to always be going well but im scared of being with a partner that comes with a lot of baggage.

"Most of my life I’ve dated beautiful women that are often referred to as “unconventionally beautiful” and more than once I was referred to as either the “cute one” or the “smart one” in the relationship. That isn’t really the case with my current partner. 

Basically, how do people handle being thought of as the average-looking, occasionally funny (but not necessarily “funniest”) person in a relationship/group of friends? Sometimes I feel like I’m just… there; without adding much to the conversation. 

Now, I don’t often indulge in self-hate. All my life I’ve thought of myself as an attractive guy with lots of talent and ambition; but I know I’m not the kind of guy that most girls would go crazy for. I’m a 7 or an 8, if I were to do that shitty ranking, and I’m fine with that but my girlfriend has made me feel completely different and I don’t know how to handle it. 

She’s the kind of woman people stare at when we walk into restaurants and pretty much everywhere else. Just to illustrate how beautiful she is; more than once, big celebrities like actors and musicians have hit on her through instagram and tik tok (she’s jokingly shown me the conversations and they were funny until I started feeling like shit after a while). At first, I found that extremely hot but with time, it’s gotten tiring. She’s done modeling before but right now she’s focused on her own restaurant, which is small but successful. Every time we hang out with friends or family, she stands out because she’s funny and very extroverted. In short: she’s truly a 10/10 and she makes my heart go crazy every day. 

Now, currently I’m doing my best to push my career but it’s hard. I have trouble finding jobs, which makes me moody every other day. I’m also an artist which makes it difficult to have a stable income and lifestyle. I had to quit working out because it’s hard finding the time and money. Basically, my head and body aren’t the best at the moment yet she’s thriving.

I love her very much and I’m happy for her. I will always support her. Yet there’s a part of me that also feels like she doesn’t deserve me. She could be with any other guy that already has a successful career or is more conventionally attractive.

"This is the recurring issue throughout our relationship: my partner (imo) is deeply insecure about herself, our relationship, and greatly distrusts others due to bad past relationships and experiences. Two recent scenarios:

I amicably broke up with an ex nearly 2 years ago (current partner and I started dating this year). My ex and I remained friendly but distant, as my ex remained closely knit into my friend group and then I moved out of state. If I go back to see my friends and they organize something, I *will* run into my ex. We still follow each other on social media but I have her muted/restricted. Blocking her would cause a lot of issues in my friend group, and also she has done nothing bad to me that imo merits a cruel spontaneous no contact blocking. She comments occasionally on my posts, and my current partner is livid. She wishes I blocked my ex entirely, not because she doesn’t trust me, but because she “doesn’t trust other people.” My ex and I are 1000 miles away and we broke up because we felt no romantic attraction to each other. I don’t know what more I can do. 

Second, I am currently traveling abroad with my family and my partner has voiced displeasure with how casual I am with solo exploring cities. I’m currently in one of the world’s safest countries, and I lived for several years going in and out of one of the world’s largest cities, frequently coming home solo on public transit from bars at 1-2am. I’ve never had an issue, and I struggle to understand why I can’t go take a walk around the neighborhood at night in a quiet city where most speak English as a second language. My partner has basically forbidden me from doing so. She has never lived in a large metro area in her life—her hometown is a rural hamlet of fewer than 2,000.

"Hey folks, I've been navigating some tricky emotions lately and could use some advice. My girlfriend and I have shared a deep and loving relationship for the past 5 years. Before me, she was in a kinda long but toxic ""semi-relationship"" with a guy who treated her terribly – cheating, giving her an STD, borrowing money and not paying it back, catching him with her best friend. She dealt with this on-and-off from her freshman to junior year in college. At the time he would always find ways to squeeze himself back with her.

We started getting serious towards the end of her junior year, and although she was still somewhat involved with him when we first started seeing each other (non-exclusively), she cut ties as we got more serious. About half a year later, we officially became a couple. Fast forward, we've moved to a different city, and he's been trying to message her constantly for the past 5 years. She's consistently ignored him, actively showing me she wasn't interested, and we'd even laugh about his desperate attempts together.

Recently, I found out that, while super drunk at a wedding, she sent him a ""closure message"" after 5 years, expressing forgiveness, etc did not go further than that and kept convo fairly short. I learned about this accidentally when she misunderstood a sarcastic comment I made. She felt guilty and confessed everything, but when I asked to see the messages, she had already deleted them out of embarrassment. She felt it made her seem pathetic and stupid, that it was pointless given the time that had passed, and that she lacked the confidence to send such a message sober and realized nothing of value would come out of that.I already knew but she reassured me with 100% certainty, that she did not have any romantic feelings toward him at all, in fact she felt the opposite she explained that she held alot shame for enduring his mistreatment and not leaving sooner. She said she could not understand why she was so obsessed with him at the time and regretted her lack of self-respect and felt disgusted by it all. She said it was intended completely for her and not for him and she would have preferred it if she just wrote it and never sent it. She said she is at complete peace from it all now. She is very remorseful how she went about it all and very apologetic.So I discovered this nearly a year after it happened, 

My primary concern is the honesty aspect – should I forgive her for keeping this from me? The dishonesty bothers me. Also, I'm unsure if this is a red flag indicating she's still thinking about past relationships while with me. Also is it wrong that I don't feel like I should help her work through heartbreak from her past Any advice would be appreciated.?","BF (27M) here, caught my GF (26F) sending a secret closure message to her ex.

"Okay so obviously it sounds great on paper, but here's the context.

We're constantly together in our workspace and we get along really well. We're always talking and laughing, and we both love to take the piss out of each other, to the point where I call her out on her bullshit and she'll laugh like ""ah fuck he caught me"", which she definitely should because I think she's adorable and I only challenge her on that stuff because of how fond I am of her. 

One of my other female coworkers, who I used to get along with well but has recently started getting really nasty and goes out of her way to say stuff like ""get a room"" when me and my crush are talking, made a ""joke"" that one of our customers that came in looks like me, and my crush went ""oh the hot one"" which immediately made me jealous, then the co-worker said ""yeah but a hot version of him (referring to me)"", and continued to elaborate how if I was as tall as him I could be hot too (im literally 6ft like come on man when is ""enough"" enough). Now I don't know if it's body dysmorphia or an accurate perception of myself, but I would agree. The guy is taller and slightly better looking than me in my own opinion, but I just don't really enjoy being told that to my face in front of everyone else. So I straight up told her (not my crush) to go fuck herself and walked away from them.

After that I was really silent, which is rare for me, especially around my crush, and she came over and started helping me with what I'm doing without me asking, and being extra attentive. We get along well so I could clearly tell she was being extra nice cause she'd noticed what a baby I was being over something as minor as being called ugly. After 10 minutes of us chatting and me trying not to sound pissed off and probably failing horribly, she straight up acknowledged what was up and said ""I think you're hotter than that guy anyway"". I laughed out of embarrassment and jokingly told her she's an asshole and she was just saying that to make me feel better, and she laughed and said she wasn't lying. I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me really happy, but part of me just couldn't accept it at face value given the scenario.

She was extra amicable for the rest of the day towards me and she even stayed behind whilst I locked up the shop, which she usually won't do. I don't know what to think. If she'd told me I was hot in regular circumstances, I'd be over the moon. But I'm worried she just told me that because she noticed how miserable I looked after what our coworker said about me. What do you guys think? Would you call a good friend of yours hot out of pity or would you be entirely honest? I don't want people feeling like they aren't enough, so I admit I would say something like that if it meant they don't end up doing what I'm doing now. I feel like women wouldn't admit if they genuinely find someone more attractive than someone else out loud because that would give up a lot of the ambiguity they enjoy in the chase of a romantic relationship. I hope I'm wrong.

TLDR: I got called hot by my work crush, but it was after I got called ugly by another coworker and went quiet for a bit, so I'm not sure if it was a pity thing or something I should pursue.","My (22M) female work crush (20F) told me I was hot, is she into me, or is it pity?",18oq2mi,1703282380.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oq2mi/my_22m_female_work_crush_20f_told_me_i_was_hot_is/,
"Hi everyone.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. We had sort of a whirlwind romance. I moved to a new area where I was starting a PhD program and he was in his second year of a PhD at the same school. This was during the tail end of Covid but most things were still shut down. We were both pretty lonely and more or less moved into the same apartment (even though we still had separate ones) two months after dating. Within 6 months we had a dog. Then a year in we started to rent a small house together.

I know the mistake we made here was renting a place far from campus. We have to share his car, I don’t have one. This makes me pretty dependent on him and causes a lot of issues in terms of getting to work or leaving work. Often he wants to stay at work until 7/8 pm, or he just has no idea when he wants to leave, tries to make an estimate, forgets he gave me a time, I get agitated, he gets angry at me, and we have some giant fight. I’d say 90% of our arguments are about something related to transportation.

Perhaps the solution then is to move within walking distance of campus. However, the place we rent right now is really great. Good price, lots of space. I also wonder if his inability to just be a reliable partner and my inability to mask my agitation after several hours of waiting for him to be ready to go is the real problem. Maybe moving will fix things but IDK maybe it won’t.

Has anyone else been in this sort of situation before? I know my boyfriend and I love each other and we share a common culture and love of learning and cooking so I really don’t think our relationship is doomed to fail. Do you think we should try to break our lease asap and look for somewhere new to live? Were average like 2 fights a week but seriously it is always related to transportation.

"So… this man and I had been together for almost two years. In that short amount of time; he admitted he was ‘just now’ leaving his wife, had slowly introduced me to his 15 year old son, needed blue pills to keep himself going  but I started to noticed he got super weird over his phone in October. Such as it would buzz, but he wouldn’t pick it up or would wait until I got up to get a drink to look at his phone. 

I saw some messages between him and a female friend but he swore up and down he wasn’t cheating on me and that they’re just friends. I put it to the back of my mind but also requested of him to leave the apartment I pay for if he was truly cheating on me. Big fight- said that he wasn’t cheating but he should just go if I was convinced that’s what he was doing. I broke down and begged him to be honest and he said he was not cheating. So I allowed him stay. 

Come this past weekend, he invited his friend mentioned from above to his basketball game where he coaches and his son plays on the team. Her daughter brings a sign, they’re taking photos of them, like whole ten yards. After the game; I went up and asked her what was going on between her and my (ex)boyfriend. She says “nothing, we’re just friends.” My boyfriend insisted he didn’t want me to wait to grab the jerseys and just to head out after the game. I moved my car and FBI the shit outta him and he came walking out with her and his son, get into the car together, and go back to her hometown for the rest of the weekend. 

Monday morning- I no longer can stand the thought of what is on his phone. So I grabbed it - within 10 seconds I have proof of everything I need. Him lying about the attending a basketball game with his brother (it was with her and her 4 kids), texting each other hotel address when his dad was in the hospital, and intercourse talk and the disappointment of not finishing one another. 

I wake him up and tell him he’s got to go.. it’s 6 in the morning... He instantly went for his phone and I mentioned to him I already had proof and I could unlock his phone right now and show him how exactly he’s cheating on me. He puts the phone back on the table.  All he says is “okay, I’m sorry”. Gives him the spill of my thoughts and tell him to leave my key under the mat; to which he did. 

It’s now Friday- it’s been 5 days and he has not tried to contact me what-so-ever. He watches my stories on Snapchat. I still have a crap ton of his stuff but since he was never on the lease, I don’t know what to do with the rest of his stuff? Do I break down and message him first and ask?

"Last year I moved back home because of issues with work and decided to study a bit instead. I saw this as an opportunity to finally get my drivers license, which I had been struggling with for almost a year. I’ve put in so much time, money and effort into this and I was so happy that I finally made it. However my dad still barely lets me drive. When I got my license a few days ago he congratulated me but also gave me a big lecture on being careful.

He wont even let me park inside the garage. I have to call him when I’m close to home the few times I’ve been out driving and he will park it for me. He says that he’s okay with me going to the local store but other than that I’m not allowed, cause he said he doesn’t trust me. He has made comments before about how women are bad drivers. He said that he might let me drive more when the snow melts and spring comes. This upset me and we had a big fight about it.

"My boyfriend (28M) and I (30F) have been dating for nearly 4 years. The first year we had amazing sex, and often. Now it's nonexistent. I feel absolutely no desire for him at all. He's a really handsome guy, very sweet and caring, smart, great career, etc. I don't look at him the same way anymore sexually, yet I fantasize about other people. It's not that I'm asexual, it's that I'm not aroused by him at all anymore. He hasn't really changed physically and neither have I. Now I just have sex with him to satisfy his needs, and it feels so empty and boring.

I'm not sure if this is an emotional thing that's been deteriorating my attraction towards him, but there were weird ties he kept with his ex girlfriend (only other relationship for him). He blocked her completely about a year and a half ago when I asked. I found out about her continuously reaching out to him during our relationship, him entertaining the idea of going on essentially a date with her during this time, him holding on to very romantic mementos from her, etc. and it really hurt me deeply. I would have broken up with him if we weren't living together to be honest.

Since then we have gotten to a good point with open communication and no lies, but I almost feel like that's what made me totally lose sexual attraction to him. I fantasize about people in my life who I do have a strong connection with, and I know that's shitty and feel guilty about it when I have someone who wants me. I try not to fantasize about other people during sex, but it's hard when you have nothing left to satisfy your sexual needs. Thinking about my boyfriend doesn't turn me on. Our sex is so vanilla and boring. He isn't adventurous at all, not that I'm looking for some wild night, but the same two positions for 20 minutes is just so meh. I think I'm fantasizing about other people to spice up my own imagination, when I really just want to feel this way for him. We've talked about spicing it up but he has absolutely no ideas and I've pitched a few that have fallen flat. It's gotten to the point where I don't like certain qualities about him and I hate this way of thinking because other than the qualities I don't really like, he's an amazing person who I've had the pleasure to make so many new memories with. The things I don't like aren't deal breakers for me, but not having any sexual attraction is... I wonder if this is normal in a long-term relationship.

"I don't want to put my issue in the title because I feel like it is very specific and my SOis a redditor and I don't want him to see this:

&amp;#x200B;

My facial expressions are a detriment to my relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to start, but I guess I will start from when I was young. My brother was super into calvin and hobbes when we were younger and we would always mimic his faces -- you know the ones he makes on picture day or when he eats his mother's horrid cooking (lol). It always stuck with me I guess. I have super over exaggerated facial expressions now 25 years later. It is subconscious to me now, and I don't even realize I am making these faces.It has come up time and time again in my relationship with my SO. He tells me that they are annoying or that I am doing them on purpose to make him angry. I tell him that they are a part of me now and it is very hard for me to stop doing them, and that I really don't have control over them unless I am always thinking about it. He says that, that is bullshit and I just need to try harder, and that I am just making excuses for myself. I guess he is right. I just need to focus harder during social situations as well.

The other thing is that my SO is an only child and his family is a very quiet, reserved family. On the other hand, I have two siblings and my family is very loud, vocal and excited. During family events we yell, laugh and make fun of each other. So sometimes I can get excited and raise my voice, and talk a lot. A lot of the times he tells me to be quiet, and that I am annoying when I am like this. As a child, I was extremely shy. I was very reserved to the extent of only having 1 or 2 friends during my childhood. As I grew up, I came of my shell, and I am happy with who I am. I am more sociable, and outgoing in social situations. But, my SO always mentions how I get too excited/loud and interrupt and annoying I am. I struggle sometimes, knowing he is calculating my every word, and watching me.

I use to see a therapist, and I am thinking of going back, but I don't know how that would help with my facial expressions. Is there a therapist that helps you work on that? I just don't know what to do about it. I feel like it is apart of me now, and the habit is going to be impossible to break. I have been with my SO for almost 10yr now, and I love him a whole lot and I don't want to lose him to me being annoying, and having no idea how to handle myself in social situations. I feel really bad, embarrassing him when we go out and I want to change that.

"First time posting here but I'm really struggling to figure out what to do, for some background me and my girlfriend met through online games beginning of the year, she said she had a crush on me around march and we started talking a bit and I confess to her May and she felt like she wasn't ready for relationship especially her fiancé died last year in a car crash so I told her I'll wait however long she need, and she finally asked me to ask her to be her boyfriend on October and we are finally official. And this is also the first relationship I have ever been in due to me being a huge introvert.

I love her a lot, and I want to take care of her but she lives in California and I live in Arkansas so is a bit far but I tried my best to occasionally by her drink or food through doordash to help her out. We also met in person 3 times, one for a gaming event in vegas 2 time at her house. And I thought things are going great, her car broke down and it cost a lot to repair I offered to pay for it but she said no point since she plan to move to me next year she'll just take lyft everyday. And since is california and pretty busy area, lyft take a lot time and money, we end up had a discussion and I bought her a tesla I know this sound crazy but I was ok with it. I grow up with the moral that if I give anyone anything I should not expect anything back, but since my name is on the car I can basically track her location anytime but either way we were already sharing locations to each other when I visited her. 

So 2 weeks ago I felt like something was wrong and called her and asked, she said she feel suffocated by me and I'm everywhere in her life and she need space. So I tried to distance myself a little by calling less and text slightly less, and after about a week after the first snap happened because she was late to work and I noticed because she usually text me in the morning and was super late so I use the tesla app and saw her location and text her back ""I got coffee for you shortly after you get to work"" her immediate response we how do you know? and said this is why I feel suffocated because you are checking on my location and that's crossing boundaries, I apologized and told her I will respect that boundary and never check on it again which I have not touched. I also felt very guilty because it is kind of a stalker behavior even with the right reason, is suppose to be a safety thing and not use to keep checking my gf location for no reason.

literally 3 day later, we were playing game together. A person in the game showed up that use to be her friend, and the person use to stalk her a lot base on what she told me so I teleported to her location want to ask everything ok. Her first reaction was why did you teleport to where I was, I told you to give me space. And told me I don't understand boundaries and keep overstepping them, I explained my reason and she said since the game has instant message system I should have use that instead of going to her location in game instead of stalking her. 

Next morning, she texted me back said she is gonna give this one more shot which really irritated me for some reason and felt like this relationship is a charity and not on both side. I told her that it hurts me that she no longer trust me, and was responded that she does not trust me because I lost it by overstepping boundaries and that made me lost it and I just did not want to respond to her anymore and give her a really bad excuse (I'm playing game with other people, and I need time to think) and stopped texting to her. 

so now I got a text ""I don't exactly know how I'm supposed to explain that to you better, we literally have an unresolved issue on the table. you feel as though space means never speak to me until I come to you. Space comes after a conversation was had. after the issue has been spoken about and we both agree to take some time away. Not ignoring the problem. I'm tired of waking up wondering wtf is going on. the longer you go on like this the farther you push me away. so, go ahead and continue doing what you're doing. I was ready to talk the other day when I confronted you. and you said you needed time to think. What you need? A month? a year? the rest of your life? figure it out. I will not reach out and unless you're willing to talk don't text me. telling me to have a nice day? save it""

"Everyone I'll try to sum this up quickly as possible.

17 years ago, i was divorcing my wife of 10 years with 3 young children. I'm at the time met a young woman.  She had no kids and actually accepted mine and took on that major major task.  Amazing right.  
Of course she wanted to have kids of her own So we ended up having 2.  

As the second baby was born  felt inaduquite i felt no love. Which was my wife raising babies..... so soon after the wife's party sister came to llive with us,  I ended up sleeping with her. It didn't last long but yes i screwed up.. 

Our life continued on. We bought 2 houses. The kids grew up 2 moved out. Our 18yr old had a baby who lives with us. Hopefully she'll be able to leave 1 day. But she's autistic and will always need help. The 2 others They love me, but dont respect me.
Ill sum this up by my wife raising them very very sheltered.b

 Now for the first 10 to 12 years i was gone 3 to 5 days a week flying alll over the nation, so basically raising the kids was all on her again that huge task.
Love life is always good, but you can tell she knew

Sure respected knowing now for sure,  but it ooened a door to more and more arguments.

"My new husband won't give me head anymore!!

Okay idk wtf to do. We (F30 + M33) got married less than a year ago. Things were great. We've always been a really sexual couple. The honeymoon stage is kind of wearing off and things have slowed down as is to be expected. However, one thing that has upset me is that my husband no longer gives me oral. I don't need it to get off or anything necessary like that, but it upsets me because I give him head nearly every time we have sex. He used to eat me out all the time, and now...nothing. I was worried I might smell or something so got checked out for BV: nothing. 

I finally just asked why he didn't want to give me head any more. He was very nonchalant about it and said he just didn't really like it. Our sex life was fulfilling without and I'd never complained. I said that I would very much like to still receive head and then he started to get upset and said that he doesn't like it and it's unfair of me to ask this of him knowing he doesn't like it. The way he was talking made me feel like I would be...assaulting him for asking him to do this for me. This just kind of spurred the argument. I kept pressing him wanting to know if I smelled or what had changed. He said he had never really liked it, that it's emasculating, and I should have picked up on that a long time ago. He also said as an afterthought that I get really wet and the texture grosses him out, but that seemed like an excuse because I kept asking him what he meant by emasculating. That was really upsetting to hear because it's not like I LOVE giving blow jobs. There's aspects I dislike! I then said I think we should just take head off the table entirely since neither of us are really enthusiastic about it which kind of spurred another argument because he said I was just doing that to be vindictive! Idk. This has blown up so much and I honestly regret even bringing it up. I just feel disrespected, I guess.

I just don't really get what's emasculating or demeaning about oral?? I was watching him play video games about a week after the fight and he was doing a fetch quest for this lady who kept giving him the runaround and insulting him. I was like ""why are you letting her boss you around like that,"" just being funny and flirty and he responded back ""that's just what it's like trying to please a woman."" And I could tell this was a jab at me after our argument. I was like ""how is this applicable to our relationship,"" and he just sighed and didn't explain  anything. 

What should I do?? I don't really want to go my whole life NEVER getting eaten out again...

"I need some help forgiving my mom after we started having a horrible, ongoing fight starting one week ago. We overall have a great relationship and love spending time together, but I’m really having difficulty getting past this.

**TW**

One week ago my mom made some not great comments about my body/losing weight while I was in recovery for an ED. 

This initial fight was horrible specifically because she kept defending her right to make comments about how my body should be after telling her multiple times I’m in ED recovery and while I was in the middle of a call with my boyfriend who heard us fighting (he was supportive after and just encouraged me to be healthy). 

Eventually, when she saw how upset and sad her comments made me she said sorry many times.

However, now we keep getting into fights because I’m still hurt/angry and get triggered anytime the topic of bodies/weight in general comes up (it’s not another comment directed at me- it’s about dieting and bodies in general). I basically relive the argument and feel like I have to explain to her again and again why what she did was hurtful.

I think a part of me just wants to fix her views related to my body/dieting in general, which is why I keep getting angry and we keep having fights.

Any thoughts on how to move on and accept my mom? She’s a loving person- she just makes these mistakes and is genuinely sorry.

(FWIW, I also go to therapy in addition to ED treatment.)

EDIT: I should’ve been more specific- views related to my body/body image/dieting keep coming up i.e., not views on “bodies” as in other people’s bodies, but as in “body image” and how “bodies” should look.",**TW** Need help forgiving my (27F) mom (58F) after making comments on my body while I’m in recovery from an ED,18opiv4,1703280824.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18opiv4/tw_need_help_forgiving_my_27f_mom_58f_after/,

We talked and got to know we have a lot of coincidences and similarities. Numerology, accidents, etc. And it was all you know fine. He wanted people to treat him like a friend and not a boss but I was one of the few who would actually do so. And while working he would share random stories with me, which I found normal.

It had gotten a bit awkward when it started getting a bit touchy, u know touching arm n all, but then he just held my hand and we would call it you know ""we have a connect"".

Now for more context, I have a boyfriend, i love him to pieces, he is my heart. And everybody nows about him. EVERYBODY.

My boss just asked me whether i am in this journey with him or not, and i thought he meant professional journey and i said yes.

"A week ago, my girlfriend left for a three-week vacation in her home country, which is 6000 km away. It's our first relationship. We've been together for two years, and the longest we've been apart is three days.

When I was dropping her off at the airport, we discussed her trip. She mentioned that she might not have much time to talk as she would be on vacation but promised to keep me updated, told me that she would miss me. I completely understood and told her that I would be busy with work too. I asked her to call when she could and to continue sending goodnight messages despite the time difference; I thought it was a cute idea. She also mentioned catching up with friends, including old male friends, and asked if I was comfortable with that. I agreed but asked that she give me a heads-up about her plans – just a brief note on where she was going and with whom.

It's been a week now, and our communication have been 1-2 messages a day or a 3-minute call. She hasn't been telling me about her plans as we discussed. I haven't commented on this because I want her to enjoy her vacation, but it does bother me. She is her own person and has the right to socialize as she pleases without telling me. However, I am also my own person, and I need to process the fact that she isn't respecting the only boundary I stated and is barely keeping in touch.

"31M and 32F, married for 2 years, together for 6 years. No children, but I've always wanted kids. I love my wife and am rooting for her, please don't get the wrong idea. I'm stressed and do not know what to do.

My wife has suspected she has been on the autism spectrum for a while. I didn't exactly know what that meant, nor did I find it much of an issue for awhile. At the moment she is emotionally spiraling almost 50% of the time. When I say she's spiraling I mean that she'll get upset over something then progressively get more upset about it. If she continues to spiral I usually have to cancel all my plans for the day and hug her and tell her everything is going to be okay. Her triggers include people knocking on the door, bad drivers, any socializing, health issues, dentists, doctors, interacting with anyone that is not me or her mom, or reading text messages or emails. She will avoid these interactions, even if it causes her a great deal of inconvenience. If left unchecked I believe she might forgo getting health assistance out of fear that the doctors will make her feel bad about herself by shaming her poor health choices. She will not answer our home's door and ask me to whenever someone knocks, she avoids driving typically and she'll ask me to instead because she's usually stressed most of the time. I'm honestly scared of her driving, in her worst moments she is emotionally charged I worry she'll just snap and just run our car into some other driver because they are just very rude and not following the rules of the road. She's chalked these rage episodes that have concerned me up to her being on her period or that the drivers in our area suck. She's never struck a stranger seriously ever, but I still feel concerned over this because she will really become unhinged with her words in the car.

My wife has been diagnosed with a horrible health condition in our time together. About 2-3 or so years in she was diagnosed with something called POTS, which means her heart rate goes very high whenever she stands. She cannot stand when the symptoms are bad, period. Most people with this end up getting it diagnosed as a disability because of how devastating it is. I usually do most of the chores because of this, I perform most of the shopping, any manual labor in the house, or whatever else would require standing. I do not mind being her rock for her POTS, I even wheel her in a wheel chair around the blocks in our neighborhood. I've never had a serious issue with her POTS. My concern is the amount of time it's sucking from me to be her caretaker if she's spiraling during all of this. As I said earlier, about 50% of the time she's emotionally spiraling. This puts me in an emotionally exhausted state most of my life now.

Now we own a house together, and her behavior has become more obvious. I can't have guests over without it causing her emotional discomfort. I can't leave the house because it causes her emotional discomfort, and if I did try to leave, I could very well just be leaving while she's going through a bad emotional time. When she's left alone she's had a history of abusing herself in her worst moments. Not the kind where it would be suicidal, but the kind where it would just be plain suffering through self harm, usually through punching herself or maybe cutting.

She grew up in severe poverty, so her parents were never going to be able to afford her to get diagnosed with autism or POTS. Fast forward now and her dad has passed and her mother is so poor and suffering so much from health issues that we are inevitably going to be her caretaker when the time comes.

I have always wanted to be a Dad... but I'm starting to doubt my wife can be emotionally ready to be a Mom even if she remains strong. I have fears that she'll resent her child if the child does a stupid behavior, like hurt one of her cats. I don't know how to have this conversation with my wife. She is so out of luck, and I need to be a good husband for her. But, I just can't help but feel like I'm being taken advantage of on some level. Every time I feel this way or explore these thoughts, I feel so guilty. I know she is suffering both emotionally and physically. I personally believe that most people's suffering causes them to lash out often so I don't really hold it against her a ton. And I know her potential autism does not help her navigate her issues at all. But at what point is it a husband's responsibility to love someone even if they are causing me emotional damage? I'm so scared and I know she is too. I'm cheering her on to get help from the doctor or something that she'll be seeing for the first time in 2024.

"First, my (28f) boyfriend (30m) have been in an off/on again relationship for about 5 years. We were long distance and then he finally moved up here this year. 

He’s been around my family a frequently as we get together a lot and had a decent relationship with everyone up until recently when my grandparents moved in with my parents. 

He generously was helping move my grandparents stuff into a storage unit on a busy weekend. There were people pulling in and out all day. Imagine a kind of pull through style storage system. It’s hot and we’ve been moving things all day. My brother (34m) was supposed to be helping us but stayed up all night and ended up showing up later in the afternoon. 

Things are going fine everyone at the storage unit is being kind and courteous moving their vehicles when needed/sharing moving dolly etc. Then enters this older couple  (mainly the older (60sF) who is yelling at a younger lady (20sF and her boyfriend (20sM)

My boyfriend, Jake, steps in to intervene and defend the younger couple. He basically tells the lady we’ve all been working just fine and that the couple will move their truck when they can. The older lady, then starts coming at my boyfriend and yelling at him. He basically tells the lady to fuck off, he’s not dealing with her anymore and starts to walk away. The older lady then follows him yelling at him calling him names pushes on him in his chest/face then splashes water from her water bottle on him. At that point Jake pushes her - she falls to the ground (somewhat dramatically) and chaos ensues. Me, my brother, my mom (55f), and sister (30f) go towards them to get them separated.
 When the old lady realizes she’s being rescued she starts coming at my boyfriend again and she and her husband are yelling they’re going to press assault charges. Jake is yelling “bitch, I’ll show you assault.” My brother, Greg, then for some reason has jumped in started yelling at Jake and tells him he’s going to unalive him several times. Jake doesn’t realize it at first, but when he does he starts telling Greg to come outside and fight him. 
All the while I’m trying to get my boyfriend out the door and to calm down and so is my sister. Jake’s furious everyone is focused on him trying to get him to back away/calm down and not focusing any attention on my brother and what he’s saying doing. 

I eventually get in the car with my boyfriend and leave. He’s mad at me for leaving because he wanted to stay for the cops, but I didn’t know what to do and didn’t know how to de-escalate without us leaving. 

As soon as we get home my brother calls and apologizes to me and my boyfriend. He said he shouldn’t have said the things he said and he was just trying to hurt Jake to get him to back away. He realizes he was manipulated by the lady who basically antagonized my boyfriend. My boyfriend talks with my brother but is still angry doesn’t really accept his apology because he feels like it’s insincere and basically tells my brother to pull up so he can be a man of his word (fight). 

Jake basically tells me he’s done with my whole family because we allowed my brother to act a fool without any repercussions. 

Things cool down a little and Jake decides he’s willing to talk and squash things with my brother but he will only give him a certain time frame (7 days) to come talk to him with no one else around to ensure my brother doesn’t “get smart” again. I let my brother know he wants to have another conversation but my brother never shows -he just made excuses for being busy - which made things worse. Then Jake is again made at me for not making sure the conversation happens.

It’s been going on 3 months and my boyfriend is still mad at me and my family. It continues to come up in any argument we have that he thinks my whole family is a bunch of cowards. He consistently says how we should’ve let him handle the situation and handle my brother. He feels unjustified. I don’t know what to do. Things were good and now he doesn’t want to even be in the same room as my brother. Anytime he talks about my brother he’s hateful and talks about how he wants to beat him up. 

Christmas is coming up and obviously my brother will be there. Jake says it will be fine as long as Greg doesn’t talk or look at him.

"Lot of context here.

Early in 2023 I (23F) decided to go back to college while my sister (19F) was going for the first time. I met two of my sister's male friends (19M, 20M) she had met at college orientation, and we all hit it off and became fast friends, deciding to get an apartment together starting with a one year lease.

My sister's and I's parents are helping pay for housing and are quite conservative in beliefs. They were OK with letting us live with two guys because they're both great people and we're all very chill individuals. I do remember, last year when my sister told us she wanted to room with them, my mom joking ""as long as you don't date either of them!""

School started in August but I hung out with one of the guys, let's call him Jax (20M), starting in April. We were drawn to each other from the start, calling and texting all the time. We quickly found out we had feelings for each other and began a relationship. I was worried because we hadn't signed a lease yet and I was pretty sure my parents wouldn't like the idea of me living with a boyfriend. So we decided to tell them we liked each other after June, when we ended up signing for an August-August lease with my sister and the other friend, ""Brandon"" (19M).

Jax and I had a wonderful summer. We told his parents about us and they were cool with it, his whole family loves me. I had to tell my family I was seeing other friends when I was really going on dates with him. It made me feel terrible at times. He came over to visit my family a couple of times and my parents love him as well. Sometimes, though, early on, my sister would get jealous that Jax talked to me so much. The three of us are on the autism spectrum and my sister especially has a hard time keeping friends. I have also been hesitant to tell her about the relationship because I don't want her to think she isn't good enough of a friend for Jax. So we wanted to wait until she got more sure that our friendships were secure, first.

But I've made excuses ever since. I wanted us to tell my family in September, a month after we moved into the apartment and could've realistically, in their eyes, developed feelings for each other. However, my sister was taking a long time to warm up to the living situation, so we didn't mention it. The next goal date was at the end of October before Jax's birthday. I was getting him some extra gifts that wouldn't make sense coming from just a friend. But I used the same reasoning to put it off. Jax is just as uneasy as I am about telling my family, as they can be very opinionated and are in financial control of my living situation. We told Brandon in October, planning to tell my sister soon after, but she got into an argument with Jax that had them avoiding each other for a bit. That threw things off, and now it hurts that she is the one person in the apartment who doesn't know about the relationship. It's not fair to her.

The four of us roommates really get along. My sister's temper can get out of hand, sometimes, especially towards Jax, but overall, we're all friends. We do stuff together and care for each other, and we are planning to renew the lease again next year. It's a good living situation overall.

I even brought the situation up to my counselor, and we both agreed that there never will be a ""perfect time"" to tell them and that I have no control over how they will react, and I can't predict it, either. But now it is nearly 9 months into my relationship, the most wonderful relationship I have ever been in, and my family is none the wiser.

I am truly in love with him and he is equally devoted to me. We want to tell them so badly, but the times he actually sees my family in person are few and far between. We go to college two states away from where our hometowns are. I am home for Christmas and he may be visiting on New Year's before we drive back to school, me, him, and my sister. I really want to tell my family but won't mention we've already been dating. Jax and I want to tell my parents first that we have feelings for each other but don't want to change the vibe of our living situation. The problem right now is that we don't know how to start the conversation. Jax and I have had lunch with my mom a few times this winter and we've gotten close to telling her but just don't know how to broach the topic. Does anyone have any ideas? I know I can't control their reactions, but I want to bring it up in a way that makes sense. It will probably come as a shock, which is why we want to ease in with saying we have feelings, first. The whole reason we've kept the secret is because we don't want to hurt any feelings, which sounds caring, but to me it's just become selfish. Even his family hasn't been able to talk about it with mine, which is just totally unfair. How can I bring this up to my parents? They love him, but me and him, especially with an age gap, would be out of left field. What about my sister? My sister is just so sensitive to things like this, even though she doesn't have any romantic inclinations at all, especially not towards Jax, whom she sometimes has a hard time getting along with.

This whole charade has been to prevent hurt feelings and ease them into being comfortable with the idea, but the excuses need to stop. Jax and I would like to get married someday and we have to take this step before we can even think about the future of the relationship.

TLDR: I have been dating my opposite-gender roommate for 9 months and have not told my conservative parents or autistic sibling out of fear of hurting feelings and potentially having my roommate situation impacted. I want to tell them but don't know how.

"I think my bf lied about his age

I'm 26 F, my bf is supposed to be 29 M. 

When we first met he told me he was 30 but that it was just a joke and he likes to joke about his age often. He was telling me just the other day about how he was joking with his coworkers and settled on being 32 but they still didn't believe him.

He told me he was born Dec 31, 1993. 
Today he got a phone call from a credit collection agency and said Dec 31, 1990. 

I confronted him on it and he didn't immediately deny it and said stuff like ""what you think I'm turning 33 is that it?"" and ""remember when we first met I told you I was 30? *Shrugs*"". Then he told me I just misheard him because we were in a loud mall and he really was born in 1993. I really didn't believe in misheard him and said ""I'm going to need to see your ID now"". He said no. 

Then I remembered that the other day a CAS worker visited us and he said 1993 then. But when she asked for his ID he said he didn't have it. He later told me he lied and just didn't want to give it over. I wonder why 🤔 because he lied about his age? 

We have a child together. It's such a small difference but the lie is big still. What do I do now?

First of all, English is not my first language, so I apologize if there are mistakes.  
  
To contextualize, I have had a group of friends for a few years now, but for the last few months I have felt that the relationship between all of us has been fading, not because of any specific event but simply because we don't care about getting together or making plans together. I have been trying to keep in touch with everyone to keep the group from breaking up but for weeks now I have felt that it is not worth it, especially since I feel like I am the one who is breaking up. A month ago was my birthday and only one friend was able to send me a message on the group chat, apparently the others either didn't see the message or just didn't care, which hurts me a lot. So I've been debating whether it's worth continuing the friendship or even doing something. I'm really angry and I've thought about sending a message to the group chat telling them how jerks they've been and how little they care about keeping in touch. I have a moral dilemma because I don't know whether to continue the friendship or send it all to hell.

"Throwaway cuz my bf also uses Reddit and yeah idk. Just feeling a little stumped and would appreciate an outside opinion. 

BF (30M) and I (31F) have been dating almost 6 years. For the past 5 years at his job, people have regularly asked him when we’re going to get married. It’s gotten to the point where both of us have gotten a little frustrated/rolled our eyes when the question inevitably comes up. I know it’s not quite the same thing as when people ask couples when they’re going to have a baby, but it still is tiring to hear. 

Yesterday, one of the people who he looks up to that works where he does asked the question under the assumption that with the holidays come up, it would be the time to ask, and my bf seemed a little flustered sharing about it, and said he responded with “I don’t know”. Feeling frustrated the question had popped up again and had put my bf in the position to have to respond, I said somewhat jokingly, “At this point, maybe it’s better to tell them it’s not really something we’re planning, and maybe that’ll get them to leave you alone about it.” 

My bf responded saying, “But maybe there is a plan in place. I don’t know if the plan will happen within the next few days or in the next 50 years, but we’re not ruling out a maybe.” 

His response just sort of caught me by surprise. We’ve talked about marriage. Our views align on it, but given his familial history of divorces in the family, we’ve also discussed that marriage isn’t for everyone and there are other options, and that we don’t need a formal marriage to continue to love each other. 

Anyway, guess I’m just asking for any thoughts on what’s going on, any advice on how we can speak with people who might ask in the future, and any thoughts on my bf’s response.

"I started seeing m32 in june and it was going great. But as the relationship progressed he started  being very controlling. He had this dominant male trait and it felt like he was keeping secrets from me. 

I asked about why he had 3 cell phones and a lot of cameras around the condo he stated the phones were 1 for personal, 1 business and 1 from the home country to communicate with his parents and family. The cameras were to ensure that the neighbor who was watching his pet parrot wouldn't be snooping around his condo when he wasn't around. Everything felt off. 

In the start of September (3 months into the relationship) he lost his job and started getting very needy and demanding. I offered to be his reference and see if any of my friends or contacts were hiring. I know when it comes to work he is super organized and focused. During the time he lost his job he started being demanding, needy and rude. He would sometimes say very hurtful things and didn't xare about my feelings. He even constantly forgot I was a vegetarian and would cook dinner only for himself.  We would only meet when he had time and not when I had time.

On my birthday our argument over text got out of hands as he kept blaming me for him not getting a job and that I wasn't helping him. He rejected coming to my birthday as he was depressed. He didn't even wish me till he saw my posts from work that day.

I stopped talking to him after our argument just to avoid any more arguments it was my birthday. I thought let's give him some space. When I replied to him saying can I come over for Thanksgiving he said no I am busy and kept pushing me away. I thought let's give him sometime is why waited till Thanksgiving which was 5 days after my birthday. I live in Canada so Thanksgiving was on Oct 9.

Since he said he was busy on Thanksgiving I just stopped talking to him. I figured if he wanted to talk he will message me.

He messaged me 2 weeks ago and I told him what I thought. I told him it wasn't going to work but now am not sure. He has apologized and I told him what if things happen again. He had no answer.

First, my (28f) boyfriend (30m) have been in an off/on again relationship for about 5 years. We were long distance and then he finally moved up here this year. 

He’s been around my family a frequently as we get together a lot and had a decent relationship with everyone up until recently when my grandparents moved in with my parents. 

He generously was helping move my grandparents stuff into a storage unit on a busy weekend. There were people pulling in and out all day. Imagine a kind of pull through style storage system. It’s hot and we’ve been moving things all day. My brother (34m) was supposed to be helping us but stayed up all night and ended up showing up later in the afternoon. 

Things are going fine everyone at the storage unit is being kind and courteous moving their vehicles when needed/sharing moving dolly etc. Then enters this older couple  (mainly the older (60sF) who is yelling at a younger lady (20sF and her boyfriend (20sM)

My boyfriend, Jake, steps in to intervene and defend the younger couple. He basically tells the lady we’ve all been working just fine and that the couple will move their truck when they can. The older lady, then starts coming at my boyfriend and yelling at him. He basically tells the lady to fuck off, he’s not dealing with her anymore and starts to walk away. The older lady then follows him yelling at him calling him names pushes on him in his chest/face then splashes water from her water bottle on him. At that point Jake pushes her - she falls to the ground (somewhat dramatically) and chaos ensues. Me, my brother, my mom (55f), and sister (30f) go towards them to get them separated.
 When the old lady realizes she’s being rescued she starts coming at my boyfriend again and she and her husband are yelling they’re going to press assault charges. Jake is yelling “bitch, I’ll show you assault.” My brother, Greg, then for some reason has jumped in started yelling at Jake and tells him he’s going to unalive him several times. Jake doesn’t realize it at first, but when he does he starts telling Greg to come outside and fight him. 
All the while I’m trying to get my boyfriend out the door and to calm down and so is my sister. Jake’s furious everyone is focused on him trying to get him to back away/calm down and not focusing any attention on my brother and what he’s saying doing. 

I eventually get in the car with my boyfriend and leave. He’s mad at me for leaving because he wanted to stay for the cops, but I didn’t know what to do and didn’t know how to de-escalate without us leaving. 

As soon as we get home my brother calls and apologizes to me and my boyfriend. He said he shouldn’t have said the things he said and he was just trying to hurt Jake to get him to back away. He realizes he was manipulated by the lady who basically antagonized my boyfriend. My boyfriend talks with my brother but is still angry doesn’t really accept his apology because he feels like it’s insincere and basically tells my brother to pull up so he can be a man of his word (fight). 

Jake basically tells me he’s done with my whole family because we allowed my brother to act a fool without any repercussions. 

Things cool down a little and Jake decides he’s willing to talk and squash things with my brother but he will only give him a certain time frame (7 days) to come talk to him with no one else around to ensure my brother doesn’t “get smart” again. I let my brother know he wants to have another conversation but my brother never shows -he just made excuses for being busy - which made things worse. Then Jake is again made at me for not making sure the conversation happens.

It’s been going on 3 months and my boyfriend is still mad at me and my family. It continues to come up in any argument we have that he thinks my whole family is a bunch of cowards. He consistently says how we should’ve let him handle the situation and handle my brother. He feels unjustified. I don’t know what to do. Things were good and now he doesn’t want to even be in the same room as my brother. Anytime he talks about my brother he’s hateful and talks about how he wants to beat him up. 

Christmas is coming up and obviously my brother will be there. Jake says it will be fine as long as Greg doesn’t talk or look at him. Jake says if he tries to shake his hand he’ll slap it away and tell him to get fucked basically. So I’m clearly having anxiety about us all being together. I have nieces and nephews and don’t want them seeing any of the adult drama unfold…

Edit: to clarify he did push her out of reaction after she threw water on him. It was just to create distance. The police watched the video and said he was well within his rights to defend himself from both the woman and my brother who was yelling threats at him.

I (32F) and my brother (28M) had an agreement that we would not do Christmas presents this year.His partner (28F) went against my wishes and dropped gifts off with my parents to deliver to us anyways. 

The more detailed story: 

My nana had just passed and all of a sudden my brother tells my parents they owe him money because “they had an agreement that for the 8 years he lived with them they were saving his rent money and going to give it to him when he moved out.”
This isn’t the deal- but my brother is adamant it is. The real deal was they saved his rent for one year and gave it to him at the end of the year so he could buy a truck. Which he did. They did the same with me, but I used the money for a trip. 
He’s adamant my parents are lying and he never got money or bought a truck. ( he did. I was living there at the time and witnessed it all. He says I wasn’t living there. ) 
Big blow up. He came to my house to collect a birthday cake I had made for free for his daughter and told me he was finding another sitter for his kid because he couldn’t trust my parents. I asked why? As any sister would do,  and he said he was going to cut them off, and he would do the same if I agreed with them in any way over the situation. 
I kicked him out of my house as I felt that was a threat- he denies I kicked him out and we had a a very civil conversation? 
Fast forward to birthday party and brother takes my husband outside and basically tells him the same thing he told me. Husband comes in upset and tells me about it and I call brother out. 
Brothers partner (28F) comes at me for asking my brother why, and said I should have not questioned him and left it. She said certain things were ‘situational’ and in that situation I shouldn’t have engaged. They then took their kids and left.
Nothing ever really got sorted out. It just got drug out more that brothers partner never wanted to buy a house with my brother and regrets it. Turns out when they were with the lawyer signing paperwork she ‘forgot’ to pay $1500. She turned her phone off and left. My parents paid this cause if it wasn’t paid the deal would fall through. They tried calling and waited for over an hour after closing before paying. Brother and partner left everything to the last minute. My brother messaged me a few days later and said no hard feelings, yet we’ve seen them around and they hide when they see us ( very obviously ). I decided I didn’t want to fake a relationship on Christmas so am doing a family Christmas with just my husband and our kids. Inviting grandma and grandpa over for brunch. Told brother that and asked for no presents to be exchanged between families as the kids have enough toys, and both families could benefit from the money savings. Well. Brothers Partner dropped off gifts for us to my mom and dads so they can deliver them to us. After everything, and even going so far to make a plan for no gifts, I feel this is an insult. I would have received this better if they showed up to my door- but instead they’re hiding and going against my wishes. Do we accept the gifts?

"My (22f) boyfriend (24m) of over a year and I are at our family homes for the holidays. I asked him if he'd like to videocall this evening and we decided to call after we'd both had dinner. 

Once I'd eaten dinner, I texted him to let him know but he replied saying they'd just plated up. 

I'm a very anxious person so I looked at his snap maps and he was 15 minutes away from his family house. It looked like a residential area too. This was just 10 mins after he said that they were plating up dinner? 

Also he doesn't have family in that area of town. I know his family well and have even stayed over at his family home a few times. 

Is snap maps just really inaccurate? Or is it possible that he's not being honest with me?

I know this sounds like petty drama but I moved a long way from home to be with this man and I don't know if I'm being made to be a fool.

He also recently met up with a girl for drinks without telling me. This is a girl that he was sexting 6 months into us dating. I only found out because she messaged me about it.

"So my (21F) fiance (21M) and I are getting married next summer, and we've been making plans, as you do, and recently we've been making our wedding playlist. We have very different music taste so we've been showing each other songs we like to see if the other likes it too. Each time I show my fiance a song, I play the entirety of the song and am silent so he can REALLY listen to it and see if he likes the whole song. He, on the other hand, shows me clips of songs before switching to other songs he sees (ADHD) and sings loudly alongside each one. This in itself is a miniscule issue, I can always go back and listen to a song on my own, but I'm anxious about what it means for our wedding. I just KNOW he's going to be singing these songs just as loud and hard as he sang them in front of my because he's very proud of his voice. Now this bothers me because my fiance is the type of person who sings not for the sake of singing, but to hear himself sing. In other words, he's got a big head about his singing abilities. Now I believe in NEVER shaming anyone for their singing, because music is such a big comfort thing for me and I know that other people feel this way too, and if anyone ever shamed me for singing a song, especially one I really connected to, I'd freak out. Despite this, I can still think someone sounds bad singing, and my fiance unfortunately falls into this category. He puts so much effort into everything he sings and it ends up sounding like a nasally and corny pop punk ballad. Usually this doesn't bother me because we're either alone together or in a spaced-out-enough public area where no one will hear. So how do I tell him that I don't want him to sing along to anything on our wedding day without sucking the fun out of the music? Because usually when I shush him for singing loudly in public he gets sad. God I know I sound so mean but my family is so judgemental and I know they're going to say something embarrassing and cruel to me and I don't want to be burdened by that at my wedding, you know.

"I am quite nerve wracked right now about this

Quick story: LDR for 2.5 years, spent \~6 months in person, moderately experienced in romantic relationships, my first serious and long one, her second at that, she might be projecting a lot of her ex on me (had a 4 year crazy strong &amp; 1st relationship with him), late bloomers so started working late

Issue: we committed ourselves to each other over distance, met in a couple of months, things went well for 2 years during which she lied many times ([My(28M) girlfriend(26F) is making up stuff, so is she cheating?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/18ohj6l/my28m_girlfriend26f_is_making_up_stuff_so_is_she/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Not entirely her fault, my family has been at a bit of fault as well since they are conservative and I am not, and she is big at quid pro quo, returns a hurt caused to her 10x. Cross religion so there is imbalance there too though I am bridging the distance. 

Her conditions: migrate from India to some good country like CAN/AUS, have kids in 2 years. I had promised her this out of foolishness all along but lately I am realizing and getting a lot of strength to discontinue the relationship. I am not being an escapist in any sense, I also don't like the idea that I have been lied to. My other reasons:

1. being a late bloomer in literally the end stages of my productive life, kids will steal that away from me and I am more concerned about being financially independent by 40 than of being married. Regret mechanism
2. no other country is as easy as India is for a married couple with kids; being late bloomers if we migrate it will be an immense pressure on both of us to get our individual dreams and family dreams fulfilled all in time (background: her father is a resourceful man and she is scared he won't let us marry if I don't ""prove"" myself to him or escape it all by flying out of the country)

But I feel that her lying to me, the distance, and my heart not being into it completely has desensitized me to the idea of being with her though I love her a lot more than I ever loved anyone before. Now I can't talk about these subtle things because I would be accusing her and I can't do that; I will be ruining our planned time together. 

So I am looking for a safe way to put it across to her because my overthinking mind is telling me that if I go outside of a safe zone she may become an emotional wreck and she is a speeding train when she is emotional. 

Either I am going nuts justifying the reasons to myself or just mentally freezing. We are about to meet in 3 days to spend my birthday (I turn 29)  and also some time together for four days, but I am wondering when I should break this to her; straight up and fuck the entire plans up or at the end at the risk of being accused of wanting to enjoy our time first and thus being an asshole",How should I breakup (28M &amp; 26F)?,18onzc5,1703276477.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18onzc5/how_should_i_breakup_28m_26f/,
"Something is ""off"" and I don't know what or how to assess it. Help please 🙏


Okay, so I (40f) been with my partner (32m) now for one and a half years and in that time we've traveled to multiple countries and had an amazing time exploring the world and gotten to know each other really well. We live in different cities, him in London and I in New York City. We see each other every 6 weeks for 2 to 3 weeks at a time. 

I trust him. He is a kind, caring loving person. He likewise thinks the same of me and our fights are really about misalignments on expectations of how things should be done and we have worked through it. We have a pretty great sex life and he is fun and creative in bed. 
Now on the job front he has not worked in this time although he has income coming in (It's a long story and not one of his doing, but he is suspended from work until the investigation concludes. It's a team thing that's turned political).
So our relationship is bit of a fantasy in my view because even though we seem to align on values, I don't know how he is in ""real life"" with work, stress and schedules and quite frankly I have not seen him work through any professional situations with me.
Whereas I have a successful, stable and thriving career.
I was previously in a long-term relationship where works stress would be a major contributor to stresses at home. He would bring them home basically. I'm not traumatized about it so much as I want to know what my current partner is like under those circumstances because I think it's a pretty big part of everyday life. Is that fair? Is that an important factor? He seems to not think so.

There are other little things that are niggling at me. Such as when I'm sick or stressed out at work. He is present for me however doesn't actually ""do""anything.. when he is sick or incapacitated I send him groceries and food and take out because these can be ordered online. Is it unfair that I expect the same thing back? We had a fight about this and since then he seems to at least ask if he can do anything, he seems to need to be prompted to actually do it. He feels like he is stepping on toes are being too dominating if he just did it. It makes me feel very unloved and very uncared for.
My love language is acts of service and he is great when everything is good and he does do little things for me but not when things are bad? He expects me to communicate every single thing I need and want even if it's the same thing after knowing each other so well it should be known?

He went through a bad breakup before he met me so after they gave up their place, he moved in with his parents temporarily at which point he met me and since I'm very settled with my own home where I am, we had decided early that he was going to move to me. But it does play on my mind that he technically does live with his parents now. How much does this matter?

I bring a lot more to the table in terms of financially and career stability versus he's kind of starting from scratch due to his situation. He has a little bit of assets but not much. Again, it's confusing to think about this because society tells you that you should at least be equal at a minimum and social media throws out constant garbage about how women should be ""taken care of"" and I'll admit that occasionally I do crave this security. Or at least a sense that my partner can pick me up if I fall. He's not in a position to do this for a long while yet, even if he wants to. 

Health and fitness is also a concern. He is currently thin, which he argues is fit, but as someone who works out with a trainer four times a week (and I'm in the best shape of my life) I would argue that strength training combined with cardio is important. His diet is okay in terms of macros and he does take my advice on keeping on track but he seems to lack discipline?. He is positive and has the right intentions, however he doesn't actually consistently ""do it"". I don't nag him or tell him what to do because I don't feel that's my role. But if I did tell him he would do it.

I do love him, but I feel all of these factors are important for me to feel safe that our future is aligned to our values because I feel like a lot of the things that he does, he does it for me. Because it's important to me.

I am driven and focused and constantly planning on achieving big dreams(and doing it, different projects etc) and he is sweet and stable and calm and loving. So it works to a certain extent, but I wonder what it would be like to do with someone who is also like-minded, ambitious and driven? Is that wrong?

 We are both very faithful to each other and I am not looking for anyone else but I don't want to get years down and then realize that we were wrong for each other all along.
I'm just not 100% that he's ""the one""?. At least not in the way that everyone describes it. 
Is there even such a thing?
I don't think about anyone else or feel like I should be pursuing other people.

Had a brief relationship with a coworker a while ago. During that time I was preparing to go on paternity leave but did not want to tell anyone at work because I was not planning on returning, I had just transferred to this new store and everyone was new to me and i did not want to share too much about myself because I thought i would never see them again. 

My relationship with my baby’s mom was pretty much done at that point. She was no longer living with me, and we would only communicate about the baby. She had had a miscarriage a few years back and at that time I was not ready for a baby, I believe she always held resentment towards me for it and when she was pregnant again I guess it all resurfaced so we decided to separate for her and the baby’s health.

Eventually things got physical with this coworker. We quickly ended it but when she found out I was having a baby she did not care to listen to me, i also for some stupid reason tried lying to her that it wasn’t my baby (? Idk why i didn’t that i often think about it) but i quickly walked it back and admitted to it. Now im back at this job part time to help with my finances, and she won’t even look at me, talk to me, or anything. 

I texted her a few days ago from a different number because I wasn’t sure if she had blocked me and I thought she would just ignore me if she knew who i was. I wanted to apologize for making the work environment awkward and uncomfortable for her, and find out if she hated me. 

She basically told me she wasn’t going to be part of my pity party.

For reference I'm 5'6 160lbs, wear a size 8 in pants and s/m shirt. When we met I was ~145lbs and a size 5. I know I'm not at peak physical fitness but I'm not fat either. My body type is dense, I have thick thighs and a butt but really no belly. I've worked a lot of outdoor jobs and physically demanding jobs so I'm strong. Additionally, him and I are the same height so maybe that's a factor. 

We used to have sex in the beginning, he seemed into it but after 1 year he barely touches me. I brought it up to have an open discussion and it came down to him being attracted to physically fit people and I'm not ""fit"" and if ""we hit the gym it would probably solve this issue.""

I feel very worthless and its tanked my mental health. Its hard to be touched or looked at by him because I feel revolting.

I asked him for sex and I've never seen someone try to rush through sex like he did. I could tell he wanted to get it over with as fast as possible. Additionally, now he is saying his penis feels raw and sore after sex when he's never said that before. We were very sexually active in the beginning and it wasn't sore then.

"I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for over three years. At the start of this year, I started pushing him to propose. It didn't get too serious until we went to look at rings mid-year. The salesperson we had for our ring appointment was rather lackluster, and unfortunately took some wind out of our sails. We dropped the idea for a bit after that but were still very serious about our relationship and were even looking to buy a house together. And - yay! - we ended up being able to buy a house come August. 

We had our parents out to see the house in August, and I know he asked my dad permission to marry me during that time. I even know - because my family is pretty traditional - that my dad requested he propose before I moved into the house with him (which I did at the end of September). So I fully expected a proposal before the end of September. Well, the end of September comes around, and; no proposal. I reminded my boyfriend that my dad wouldn't want me moving in before I was engaged, but he claims he thought I was moving in at the end of November, so he thought he had more time. Thanksgiving rolls around, and still, no proposal. I figure SURELY I'll get a proposal before Christmas so we don't have to go see family with still no ring on my finger. I push him again when he asks what I want for Christmas by frankly replying ""a ring."" I've already spoken to him about how the delay in a proposal is making me feel like I'm not a priority, and just generally like our relationship has stalled. 

To add insult to injury, my brother (29M) and his girlfriend (26F) started dating just a year ago and I know my brother has a plan for a romantic proposal right after Christmas. He told me he didn't want to propose to his girlfriend before I was engaged, but at this point, he can't keep waiting. Now, just a few days before Christmas, I learn that my boyfriend hasn't even gotten me anything for the holiday. We leave Christmas Eve to go see family and were supposed to open our gifts to each other before heading out, so he doesn't have time to get me anything truly meaningful. 

The fact that he hasn't given gift-giving or the proposal any thought is very hurtful to me. I've communicated the hurt from the lack of a proposal, and he keeps saying he ""wants to do it right' but I know he hasn't even gotten a ring yet. And every time I bring it up, it becomes a stressful and not fun conversation, which makes me feel worse about everything (shouldn't this be an exciting, happy thing?). We both work from home so I know he hasn't had a super busy workload lately, but any free time he has seems to go to other very random things, not figuring out a past-due proposal. The saying ""if he wanted to, he would"" keeps running through my head and I'm left wondering if I've made a mistake. Since we have the house together, I feel stuck as to what my options are. I never wanted to be dating for more than 3 years without getting engaged, but I feel like begging someone to propose to you really takes the magic out of it (and yes, I know I could propose, but my boyfriend is fairly traditional and I know that would just upset him). I've already been pushing the subject for the last 6 months. Is there anything I can do to ensure a proposal in the next month or so? Any resources I can point him to?

"Im 19M and have been dating my gf19 for almost a year now. We met at the beginning of my freshman year and we are sexually active. Even though we've only been dating a year, we are sure that we will marry each other. I've lied to my parents a couple of times abt stupid stuff for a while, but recently I did abt grades and I got caught (normally I’m a A, A- student, but I lied abt doing summer courses and didn’t get credit for them, wasting around $4k of my parents money). After this, they went through my phone (they paid for it) and found some things that they didn’t like (us talking abt sex, comments that don’t seem like jokes when in context they are). They seem to think that college has changed me and that I need to ""detox"" from my gf in order to rework my brain and figure out what I want and if this is the right path. However, this includes no seeing each other, no texting, calling, FaceTiming, nothing for 2 weeks. I voiced my many objections, but they said ""I wasn't thinking objectively and that I need time to take my emotions out of it and think objectively"". They are also religious, and do not want me to have a baby out of wedlock before i'm ready for it bc thats what happened to them and it was very difficult. I understand that they are looking out for me, but Im not sure this is the way to do it. And not only that, but they are threatening to pull me out of school and make me spend a semester home (they pay for abt half of my college). I do not know what to do, bc I know my gf probably will not make it out of this bc she feels like her trust in my family has broken and that nothing will be the same. Not only that, but it turns out my parents have been using my money to pay for credit card bills and things of that nature (we have a joint account where the money I earn goes), where I earned just under 20k and I am now left with just under 2k.

On a side note but kind of related, my mom tried to force me to get the new vaccine for covid, and when I told her no, she told my younger brother to “get ready of the promotion to godfather” (my god daughter was just born and they’re worried me not getting vaccinated would put her at risk, but I didn’t feel comfortable getting it so I didn’t and they used her in an effort to get me to cave and get the vaccine). I rly just need advice, so any would be appreciated. If my parents force me to choose between them and her, who do I pick? I understand that I’ve only dated her for almost a year, but I rly do love her. Not only that, but it is no longer a choice between my parents and my gf, but my entire family because they all believe my parents over me, so nothing I say will ever change the way they feel. I feel like if I do pick my gf, they’ll pull me out of university for a semester, holding me back from graduation early. The problem with picking my gf is that my family is my family, they’ve been there my entire life and I’m terrified of losing that. Do I break up with her for good? Do I tell my family to suck it up and deal with me being w her and risk destroying the relationship with my parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, etc? I need some guidance badly bc I rly don’t know what to do.

"F21 have been dating this guy M24 for a little over a year. Our connection isn’t like one I’ve had before, we really understand each other and love spending time together, I and was pretty sure I wanted to spend my life with him. 

However, the last couple of months have been tense. Neither of us has done anything major, but there seems to be a breakdown in trust. He has started to believe I’m a liar - which I will explain as I know it sounds bad. I DID lie/exclude information once or twice, none of it was related to our relationship or concealed major information. One time I spilled something and didn’t want to tell him, I tried cleaning it myself. The other time I think I didn’t tell him I had plans on a certain day, we were considering having a date and since I didn’t tell him about my other plans, he said that’s lying. He now has said he’s having trouble trusting me in other aspects, like he’s unsure if I would cheat on him even though I’ve never given any indication of that. I did apologize for the lies but he was pretty unreceptive. He still wants to be with me for now, but I feel guilty that he still doesn’t trust me. I’ve given him access to my phone password and location but that didn’t make a difference. He keeps saying things like “manipulator, lying ass” that kind of stuff and it seriously hurts me.

"I (18F) and my partner (19M) have been dating for about a year. We’re getting an apartment together in january, and the closer it gets the closer I don’t know if it’s going to work out. He currently lives with me and my mom, and the reason we wanna get the apartment is so that we can both have our own space in a way, that we make together. The difficult part is he has a hard time working, and struggles with mental health and sleep issues. He works small shifts and that is almost too much for him. These past few days he’s been saying how he just wants to quit and never leave the room. 

I love him so much. He makes me so happy on his good days, he’s such a good boyfriend. He’s told me when he gets his license how he’s going to take me places, and he’d do anything to make me happy. The thing is, he’ll go to work, but he’s miserable. He’ll do things, but he’s miserable. He has started telling me he won’t complain to me so that I don’t know and don’t get worried. When he’s grumpy in the mornings, he’s just very dramatic with everything and has a blurred lens on life, saying how he can’t do anything. Then when he actually wakes up it gets better. But i’m worried how if this is something he can get through or it will stay the same. 

He’s seeing a therapist and about to go to a psychiatrist for meds. He wants to change for me. The thing is, I don’t think he cares enough to change for himself. I just don’t know what to do. Should I wait, get the apartment and see how he does? I don’t know if his treatment will eventually make any difference, it did for me at least, when I was in a similar spot as him. I also have no idea what will happen to him if we did separate. I don’t know if he’d hurt himself, and it breaks my heart to imagine him gone. I don’t know if i’ll ever love someone like this again. I just don’t know if I can stay in this one room I grew up in with him for much longer, as it gets more crowded, and I need to have area to walk around in. And even if we took a break, I don’t know how he’d function without me. It’s starting to interfere with my work at this point by how stressed I am. I just need advice from anyone who has been in this situation — he has autism and ADHD, so I just hope with the proper treatment plan it won’t always be like this.",I (18F) need advice with my partner (19M) about if moving is a good idea.

"Hello everyone, I am female, 32 years old. My husband is 42 years old.

We have been together for four years, he lives in the Dominican Republic, and I am in New York. We are legally married, we have a two-year-old son and although we are at a distance, it really hasn’t been an issue since we see each other regularly, I am always traveling and I stay over there for months at a time.

I know he loves me, he has done and worked on a lot to show it, I love him as well, I have seen his efforts in pretty much everything. 

However, my husband tends to be very insulting, when he’s mad, he goes from 0 to 100 really quick as they say. Before I continue, I am not excusing him, I am very well aware that this isn’t right, but I do want to point out that this is how he is with everyone around him. So it’s not an issue that happens with me only.

Whenever there is a disagreement, no matter how small, he is quick to call me out of my name, pretty much every bad word you can think of. 

Again, I am not excusing him, but I want to give you as much information as possible.  There came a point in the relationship where he admitted that he is aware of how harsh he is verbally, he would explain to me that this is how he has been all his life, and that he would do his best to try and work on this.

It’s been about a year and a half of small but evident progress,  He has walked away whenever he has felt frustrated as a way to avoid verbally offending me (like getting up and going to another room for example) 

On my end, I approach things as lovingly as possible. I have managed to leave him alone when I feel he is angry, I have managed to stop any discussion or any conversation, and for things to calm down, and then go over it a day or two days later.  

I have worked a lot on not being confrontational, at the beginning of our relationship the arguments would have a mutual back-and-forth because I had never in my life had a man insult me, or call me out of my name for any little thing, so I would reply back, I would stand up for myself, I would correct him on the spot and this would lead to very loud screaming and agitation.

I eventually began handling things from a different perspective, this is my attempt to try and keep my relationship together, so I began staying shut and waiting for things to calm down and revisit the situation at a different time, I started writing love letters and love messages during our calm moments, I would address with as much love as possible how much I want for him to reflect, and work on how he handles his anger.

I have always received positive and loving answers whenever I would send out these messages.

Little by little, the outburst have been less. Little by little I have given him his space whenever I think things might get too heated. I’ve worked on understanding that not everything needs to be addressed in the moment.

Now I wish I could tell you that there have been actual reasons or topics for him to get this way, I wish I could tell you that I have failed him, that I have done something hurtful, and that’s why he has had these moments, but I really haven’t. 

You just never know when he will take something as simple as a comment the wrong way. 

And again, this is not something that he does only with me, or with our relationship. He can be a very loving and helpful person, but everyone around him knows him for being very impulsive and for having a short fuse, that is literally how people describe him.

He eventually calms down, and tries to find ways to let it be known that he feels bad about the way he exploded.

Here is the part where I need your help ; 


As I mentioned, for sometime now, things have been much more manageable, and I have seen some small improvements, But last night I made a small comment about some new tactics he could implement into his business (handling clientele messages on website) this is a normal topic between us, I usually cheer him on and give him ideas, and help out as I possibly can. 

He blew up and just began calling me all sorts of names, his reaction does not connect with the situation, so maybe he is backed up, stressed, frustrated, and he is projecting onto me.  But that is no excuse. This is why I say or think he needs some sort of anger management help. 

Now this is what I have replaying on my mind which it’s pushing me to finally just end things; 
It broke my heart to hear him scream at me and call me out of my name after I had thought he was getting better, Because it seemed like he was… I don’t have it in me to argue back, because I promised myself that I would really address the situation differently than he does, I would reply back lovingly telling him to please calm down, to talk things out because I was there to listen to him, I would tell him that I was not offending him, so I don’t think he should offend me either, he would speak over me, and the insults just kept on coming

I started to cry, and I cried not only because of the insult, but because in that moment I felt like there is nothing else for me to do to try and change this.
In that moment I felt like despite him handling things differently for a few months, things really haven’t changed. As I cried, he would say things like “cry all you want, I don’t f* care, you’re not going to change change who I am”

I cried myself to sleep. I am not weak, I am usually someone that would stand up for herself, and would easily walk away from a man if I ever felt disrespected. But our relationship is pretty solid in other areas that are important to me (fidelity, I don’t have any concerns or worries about his lifestyle, because he is pretty much a home person, he’s a hard worker, great father, when things are good, he is very expressive about his love for me, intimacy is also doing well, spend time with me around his loved ones, these are just some examples of the things that I feel are important in a relationship and I’ve never had an issue in these areas with him) but his lack of control when he is angry, and the way he speaks to me is something that makes me reconsider everything. And I just don’t know if perhaps I should be the one working on somehow learning how to block this out, let him be, and not let it affect me, after all, when he calms down, it’s like nothing ever happened. But I just don’t know if that is what I should do, can, I even really learn how to block this out? Is that a thing?

"I will start this off with much needed context because there is a lot to blame on my end. I went into our relationship with the belief that checking out others is cool because I never felt weird if my previous partners found others attractive. The important context begins when I was caught looking at women and their butts multiple times in our relationship from the beginning and at first I would lie and deceive her once I realized that we disagreed on what was right and wrong. I was in the wrong for not being truthful about the times I was and I admit that I was being manipulative and an asshole because I didn't want to lose her. Stupid I know.  
  
I have worked on being honest and have gotten much better but we have issues where she doesn't believe I'm telling the truth now and that's 100% my fault but I will admit its very stressful still. We have slowly gotten to the point over many discussions and hearing each other out that I shouldn't be looking at other girls butts and that its fine if its unavoidable (which we still disagree on what that means) but if its on purpose its wrong.  
  
Still not sure how I feel about that but a part of me thinks she's right, especially if it bothers her. Another part of me thinks that its unreasonable and that the extent to which she restricts my eyes can be mistaken for controlling. I understand trying your best in your conscious effort to not check others out in front of your SO if its something they don't like but when does it go to far?  
  
We got in a fight today because I truly accidentally glanced at a women's butt when driving by and looked away immediately. She says I shouldn't have looked at all and is staying firm on that stance. She also claims that she never looks at other men with attraction and that the fact I find other women attractive is baffling to her. I find it hard to believe she doesn't find others attractive but maybe she is telling the truth and is demisexual. Anyway I wanted to know where the line gets drawn because I understand how relationships are all about compromise and I want to limit my behavior as much as physically possible for her but sometimes I feel like what she expects is a standard that cant be reached. I feel guilty about my behavior but also feel controlled and wrongly condemned for it. I don't want to hurt her, and that's why I'm trying for her, but she lets me know that its not enough.",My fiancé (21F) and I (20M) argue about wandering eyes.

"a little background, im dating my boyfriend from 4 years now, we're very compatible together and i do love him alot.
 He used to watch porn in the start of relationship or say we watched it together but after a while i did tell him that i dont like it when he does that , it sort of felt like cheating to me and he agreed to keep boundaries. 
watching it together was okay to me from the start. over the years i have jokingly asked a few times if he still watches it 
and he always denied doing so. 
yesterday i found out about his reddit account that was 2 and a half years old , purely used for looking at nudes of other girls and nothing else. and the fact that he followed alot such girls made me feel very disgusted. especially the fact that he lied about it from a long time. i didn't even know it was a thing. 
when i found out about it he deleted it right away which seems kinda suspicious to me. although i went through his likes which broke my heart. 
I've always provided him with my pictures when we weren't together and it bothers me alot that he kept lying about all this.
i felt very betrayed, 2 years being a long time. He's been crying alot about this and says hes sorry, he was stupid, he knew it was wrong but for some reason he did it anyway.
i had made up my mind to break up with him but he broke down in tears and begged me for another chance.

i couldn't see him like that and said okay, however it is still bothering me from inside, i don't understand what i should do to feel normal around him again. i don't want to do the things that i used to do with him. he feels like a stranger suddenly. 
my question to guys would be that, if he knew it was wrong to do why would he do it anyway? why would he be guilty only after i found out ? why would he need to look at other girls if i was doing the same thing that they did? what should i do to feel normal around him again. he did betray my trust and im having a hard time not thinking about it everyday.

"Hi everyone,

Sorry for long post but I have a serious problem that might break us up with my fiancee who I love very much. We dont have any problems with each other it makes it so much worse. I am really at a dark place and cant think straight.

I had a lot of dating and couple of failed long relationships before I met with my fiancée. I have been with my fiancée for 2.5 years now and has been 8 months since we engaged. I love her so much and I never had such a great relationship before. When I met her first, I knew that one day I will marry her. Between us even though we had arguments / heated discussions before it was literally so few that I can count with fingers. She is so beautiful, so humble, successful, loving and more importantly super kind. In addition to my love for her, I also love how great a person she is.

We had our first argument when we were about to move in. We made our plans and have been aligned on many things, including moving in, wedding, having babies etc. Way before. I had a career change at a similar timeline at the time we were moving in, left my really high paying job (I ll explain why I mention this), to start my own investment fund which is supported by very successful investors. I am making way less now but there is hopefully a bright future for me.

Plan was, she was going to graduate from her residency and I was changing jobs then she would move in with me and we were going to marry in a year or so. First problem arose before she moved in. she visited her home and I guess she mentioned about it. her parents, especially her father was very much against moving in.though I cant blame them, since we were not engaged or married back then the way they talked really made me sad. I can understand a father can be protective of their kids. She told me about it over the phone while she was still there, and she also mentioned about couple of things her father said like:

\-	Why is he leaving his job? What if he cant pay the rent? What would you do?

\-	What if he ends up very successful and cheat on you.

Maybe it was a mistake on her behalf to mention all these to me, but regardless I really got angry and sad and very disappointed. Because, i know it is not ok to say that but I have always been extremely generous to her and her family, and by now they should know that I am man of my word and would never ever put my fiancee in a difficult situation especially financially. Though I also was sad because in life there is everything, you can have bad days and you are supposed to support each other. I always wanted to have a big family, see her family as mine and vice versa. I thought they really liked me and I really liked them too but these comments were really harsh for me. I don’t know what my fiancée, back then my girl friend would do if I didn’t put my foot down, but I will not second guess. At the end, my fiancée convinced her parents and we moved in together.

I proposed her in April, I wanted to make sure I propose her before she moves in (June), so that everyone can feel more comfortable about this. After I proposed to her I realized, it was a bit untoughtful for me to not get blessing from her father. I got his number from my fiancée and texted him. We talked over phone , I told him that I will propose to her and wanted to get his blessing first. He asked me if I can wait till June, he will come to city, so we can talk. Though I already proposed, I went with it, said sure. Fast forward, he didn’t come to city and he never followed up with me on this. That kind of added to my frustration.

But biggest argument, that almost broke us happened couple of weeks ago when he visited home. At the very beginning of relationship, right or wrong I told her that ideally if things go well, with right partner and I am sure she will be the right partner for me I want to get married and have kids in 2-3 years. She was onboard with it and said she wants the same. This time when she was back from her visit, we had another talk. She said, I know you ll be upset but my parents want us to wait for marriage and baby till 2025. The reason is they went multiple fortunetellers and fortunetellers told them, it will be bad luck or bad things will happen to us if we don’t wait till 2025. Apparently her father said, we cant ask you that but would really appreciate if we consider. My fiancée told me, she wants to be with me and have kids but she also doesn’t have to go with this bad vibe with her parents and also she kinds of culturally believe in fortunetellers too (they are Korean). Of course this made me extremely angry, not because I cant wait another year for baby or marriage but I was done with her parents getting involved with such intimate things. Also, I was so sad and upset that she was clearly ok to have bad vibes with me because she knew this could even be the end of our relationship but she still chose to go with this path anyway. She was ok to be known bad terms with me instead of her parents. Of course, I felt so much anger even hatred towards her parents. We had very heavy arguments and I seriously thought we will break up. She is super nice and kind but I think when it comes to her family she cant stand up. Problem is when I see these dynamics, it immediately bring back childhood memories where / we had so many problems and fights at home because of my dad’s parents involvement in out family. I made a lot of compromise for her and have zero issue. I also had some issues from my parents side but never ever let that known to her, I solved them myself.

In our last argument, she said she feels uncomfortable that I make having babies such importance and she said she feels like I wouldn’t be with her if she didn’t go with making babies. I told her very clearly, I do want kids, but I really don’t care if it is now or later but we did talk about it and I tried to be very sensitive about it but I have mostly been worried about her age. I know, now people have babies very late ages, but I also know there are a lot of health problems. More importantly, I told her this is not about marriage or kids, but it is about she letting her parents decide such important things about us.

At the end, while I was at an international trip, we had a facetime. Talked over 1 hour, because I couldn’t sleep and was tired of sleepless nights, due to anger and all these thoughts. I said whatever gonna happen lets discuss. I think we had a great heart to heart conversation and she said she understands me and if I want we can get married and have a baby this year if that will prove that she loves me. Of course when she said that, it made me so happy because I love her. I told her that is unnecessary but I asked her to promise me that, she will never let anybody other than me and her make these decisions. She promised me that this will never ever happen again and we both agreed if this repeated it meant end of our relationship. I told her clearly, I am not aligned and I don’t find this acceptable and I am really angry but I will go with it for sake of our relationship. I told her you tell me when you think is the right time for the kid (since she said she feels like I am only with her because of babies) I am happy that we resolved, but of course I have so much resentment. I promised that I ll never bring it up and I think I am doing a good job (not great) but everytime her parents come up I realize my heart hurts and I have so much anger and hatred towards them. I really don’t know how to navigate this, how can I overcome those feelings, and I trust her with my life but don’t know what if same thing happens and she again chooses her family over me, because that is how I feel to be honest. 

I dont know how to manage this situation.

Maybe it was a mistake on her behalf to mention all these to me, but regardless I really got angry and sad and very disappointed. Because, i know it is not ok to say that but I have always been extremely generous to her and her family, and by now they should know that I am man of my word and would never ever put my fiancee in a difficult situation especially financially. Though I also was sad because in life there is everything, you can have bad days and you are supposed to support each other. I always wanted to have a big family, see her family as mine and vice versa. I thought they really liked me and I really liked them too but these comments were really harsh for me. I don’t know what my fiancée, back then my girl friend would do if I didn’t put my foot down, but I will not second guess. At the end, my fiancée convinced her parents and we moved in together.

I proposed her in April, I wanted to make sure I propose her before she moves in (June), so that everyone can feel more comfortable about this. After I proposed to her I realized, it was a bit untoughtful for me to not get blessing from her father. I got his number from my fiancée and texted him. We talked over phone , I told him that I will propose to her and wanted to get his blessing first. He asked me if I can wait till June, he will come to city, so we can talk. Though I already proposed, I went with it, said sure. Fast forward, he didn’t come to city and he never followed up with me on this. That kind of added to my frustration.

But biggest argument, that almost broke us happened couple of weeks ago when he visited home. At the very beginning of relationship, right or wrong I told her that ideally if things go well, with right partner and I am sure she will be the right partner for me I want to get married and have kids in 2-3 years. She was onboard with it and said she wants the same. This time when she was back from her visit, we had another talk. She said, I know you ll be upset but my parents want us to wait for marriage and baby till 2025. The reason is they went multiple fortunetellers and fortunetellers told them, it will be bad luck or bad things will happen to us if we don’t wait till 2025. Apparently her father said, we cant ask you that but would really appreciate if we consider. My fiancée told me, she wants to be with me and have kids but she also doesn’t have to go with this bad vibe with her parents and also she kinds of culturally believe in fortunetellers too (they are Korean). Of course this made me extremely angry, not because I cant wait another year for baby or marriage but I was done with her parents getting involved with such intimate things. Also, I was so sad and upset that she was clearly ok to have bad vibes with me because she knew this could even be the end of our relationship but she still chose to go with this path anyway. She was ok to be known bad terms with me instead of her parents. Of course, I felt so much anger even hatred towards her parents. We had very heavy arguments and I seriously thought we will break up. She is super nice and kind but I think when it comes to her family she cant stand up. Problem is when I see these dynamics, it immediately bring back childhood memories where / we had so many problems and fights at home because of my dad’s parents involvement in out family. I made a lot of compromise for her and have zero issue. I also had some issues from my parents side but never ever let that known to her, I solved them myself.

In our last argument, she said she feels uncomfortable that I make having babies such importance and she said she feels like I wouldn’t be with her if she didn’t go with making babies. I told her very clearly, I do want kids, but I really don’t care if it is now or later but we did talk about it and I tried to be very sensitive about it but I have mostly been worried about her age. I know, now people have babies very late ages, but I also know there are a lot of health problems. More importantly, I told her this is not about marriage or kids, but it is about she letting her parents decide such important things about us.

At the end, while I was at an international trip, we had a facetime. Talked over 1 hour, because I couldn’t sleep and was tired of sleepless nights, due to anger and all these thoughts. I said whatever gonna happen lets discuss. I think we had a great heart to heart conversation and she said she understands me and if I want we can get married and have a baby this year if that will prove that she loves me. Of course when she said that, it made me so happy because I love her. I told her that is unnecessary but I asked her to promise me that, she will never let anybody other than me and her make these decisions. She promised me that this will never ever happen again and we both agreed if this repeated it meant end of our relationship. I told her clearly, I am not aligned and I don’t find this acceptable and I am really angry but I will go with it for sake of our relationship. I told her you tell me when you think is the right time for the kid (since she said she feels like I am only with her because of babies) I am happy that we resolved, but of course I have so much resentment. I promised that I ll never bring it up and I think I am doing a good job (not great) but everytime her parents come up I realize my heart hurts and I have so much anger and hatred towards them. I really don’t know how to navigate this, how can I overcome those feelings, and I trust her with my life but don’t know what if same thing happens and she again chooses her family over me, because that is how I feel to be honest. 

I dont know how to manage this situation.

He's upset because he can't go to his dad's house on Christmas eve. Also, because we're going to my mom's house the day before Xmas Eve to help setup. I told him this weeks ago. He claims I only told him we're staying at my mom's on Saturday. His grandpa from Kentucky is also supposed to be there on.

"Roommates don’t like new bf

(27f)Recently went through a pretty nasty divorce and was not looking to date anyone. My lesbian roommates who are engaged are really excited about the prospect of me hating men so much I become gay like them. They hate men.

My ex(28m cis,white,conservative) was a piece of shit, but I have several male friends in my life whom I love very dearly, and my life wouldn’t be the same without them. I don’t hate men. I hate certain behaviors.

Anyways, me and this guy that met at a gay club went out last night and had a wonderful time truly, he came back to my place and slept over. We didn’t have sex, just cuddled and enjoyed each others company. He’s aware of the divorce and all other factors and seriously is such a great guy. Great person. 

My roommates both met him at a climbing gym the other night and my roommate told me I could do way better, that he’s a basic white male, not very cool or sensitive. Typical unimpressive male. It upset me. She told me to have fun with him but don’t take it seriously.

Anyways, this morning I texted my roommates that he was over and they asked me to let them know when he leaves. I thought that was rude? Like he’s not welcome here? And then I went and talked to them after he left and I said to them “yeah I mean it went amazing I think I might date him for a while”. And they just said “oh wow…” and fell silent. So then I added that I was going to ask a girl out that we all knew, and they started jumping for joy and saying “yes do that instead”. And it really upset me. 

I’ve only ever dated men, and while I’m interested in a relationship with a women, I don’t care about the gender identity. I care about the person. And maybe it’s because I’ve never been with a women I don’t know what I’m missing? But I’m not desperate to find out either I’m just curious. But I like him and I’m truly feeling like that’s wrong or I must be an idiot for liking a cis white man again. I just don’t know what to do.

I don’t want to move out because I’m staying here at a discounted rate and everything else has been great between us. I am friends with my roommates, they just hate men.

I’ve been seeing this boy for not overly long but we’ve been getting on very well and we have the same sense of humour, I hung out with him on Tuesday and it went really well, Spoke once I got home and also the days after then he says to me “why are you still messaging me” when we were chatting, we usually joke about things like this but this time I did just stop messaging him, literally the next day he’s blocked me on Snapchat but still follows me on instagram? What’s up with that? Why not just unadd me or just we stop speaking? I’d understand if he did it on both socials but he never, why do people do this🤦🏼‍♀️

"So I have been with my girlfriend for over 2 years. Before we met she had a fling with her best friends brother which she had told me. My gf and her best friend did not talk for a while bc of this but they rekindled and are now friends. She has been sleeping over pretty often since they are friends again and the brother is always there. I voice my concerns about it and she ensures that nothing is going on which I believe. I still however make it clear that I do not like her being around him. A couple of weeks ago we were fighting because of certain things she has said to me that bothered me. Only a few days after we stopped fighting she was out with her cousin and didn’t have a ride home and who did she ask? Her best friends brother who she knows I don’t feel comfortable with her being around. She then deleted the messages with him and never told me. I confronted her about it and she kept saying how she only did it because he was in the area and was told that by her best friend. I am really bothered by this because she straight up would have never told me if I didn’t look through her phone. I really don’t think anything is going on but yet what do I know, she has said in the past that I would never find out if she was hiding something so that’s in my head all the time.

"So, bit of a long story but it's kinda like a school romance. I met this bloke over ten years ago and hated him for a few years, cut to studying together and low and behold we start hooking up. Well I say hooking up. We were not sleeping together, but touching one another in empty classrooms and whenever we had a chance. Horny drama students. Need I say more. Every waking moment we were together, it didn't matter if other people were there or not, but we gravitated towards eachother. He's a SoundCloud lad (you get the idea) but not matter how much shit I'd talk to him or about him (when it was needed, like when he left him high and dry in a exam) he was there, ish. As much as he could be, he payed more attention to whoever he was hooking up with... We were kids but even when we left school every six months or so we'd be back at the bar, a few drinks in as if nothing happened. Making out at the back of the club or taking a ""long walk"" smoking together. Before I left for college we slept together once. I didn't think I'd see him again, I thought if we didn't see one another 6/7 days a week he'd grow bored of me (massive ADHD) so I took my chance after a joint or two and we slept together. Once. That's it. That's important. 

Fast forward and he's had some hardships and seems to have grown. I've watched him grow for a decade and I really like who he is now. All the same ideas and attitudes but they seem to be settled and he's more comfortable and confident in himself. It's sexy, shut up but not the point of this story. 

Over ten years he's picked me up and dropped me a lot. I've done the same, always taken him for what I thought we are to one another. Mindreaders who loved to hookup. We've always had that attraction and I'm really not bigging this up for the story when I say it takes two hours for us to be making out after seeing one another. I know him like the back of my hand, and he reminds me of the things that make me me. 

We went out of a few drinks and he apologised for dropping me in the past. I saw the realisation on his face when the penny dropped as what his behaviour had been like towards me. I told him I was made of stronger stuff and that he never really hurt me. Only my ego. He wanted to date me this time.

Well, that was six months ago and we've been casually dating since that night. I've been introduced to his friend (who lays it on thick that I'm lovely and he shouldn't mess things up) and his friendship group approve. My dog approves of him and so does my mum. Priorities. He's never tried to overstep a line, we meet when we can and we're not exclusive so are both talking to other people but we're not sleeping together or with anyone else. we're being adult about things... 

If I didn't have to go in for surgery we were going for a Xmas brunch at a fancy place at his suggestion. He seems to want to actually take things further and become exclusive. I told him my run-down of how I think dating words, now a date is something casual to test the waters and a date date is when you love me and napkins on laps are a standard. He picked the latter. 

This is where the question comes in. 

Is it too convenient or to good? Am I panicking at getting my hopes up? I don't seem to have any excitement about this step. Is that normal? Am I actually just used to being let down by him or do I not want this? Was the lead up more inviting than the premise of being with him. 

Or, am I just being bored at a good thing.

"My ex and I broke up in August of this year. Somewhat civil breakup, no real bad blood, still friends since we’ve have been in the same friend group for years. A few months passed and she ends up dating a friend of mine from the same group in November. I don’t take it well but I’ve adjusted, healed and have continued to go on with my life, what can you do, yknow? Our contact since then has been very short. A quick conversation every few days maybe, nothing big. A week or so ago as I’m about to fall asleep I get a text from her in which it reads
 “You know, I really loved you, right” 
What the fuck? Since then I’ve barely been in contact with her because it’s not something I care for. To my knowledge, my friend who’s currently dating my ex doesn’t know about this and I’ve yet to see him since to bring it up. When I see him I will talk to him about this but it’s just left me in a state of confusion and shock. On one hand I genuinely do not want back in that relationship, I’m happy to be single right now and to grow as a person. On the other hand I’m afraid she hasn’t moved on and is possibly using my friend. They seem happy from what I see so hopefully not. Just not really

"So I think I'm about ready to open myself to the concept of having an open relationship. Cause I don't want to give up on my current relationship, but my so called fiancé keeps talking to other women like I didn't just have his baby back in July.

I am really tired of him acting like I don't exist lol. The last time he was talking to a co worker, led to a 9 month affair with her reaching out to me on FB after he decided to cut ties with her (only after she decided to take a job in another state and during her celebration party, she made the mistake of sleeping with her ex). Yeah I know, the back story on this is crazy but long story short, he projected himself to be a different person and after about 1.5 years of pursuing me, I finally gave in and we got back together.

So long story short, in October last year I noticed he was talking to some of the girls he was talking to/ having s\*x with/ etc during our break. So I said look, the next time you pull some shxt like this, we are just going to open up this relationship because I am tired of this with you. You're not cheating but you're not being respectful either and I'm over it. So recently, I looked at his Google chats (work) and he's just talking, talking, talking with these females on his job (he works remotely) and like I have no problem with that. He obviously needs lots of attention that I simply cannot give rn.. HOWEVER, my problem is that he NEVER tells these females about me. Everytime they ask him what he is doing for the weekend, its ""oh I'm hanging with my friends.."" or ""Oh I'm going to go see my mom.."" like n\*gga for reals? Like I didn't help you get your mom into rehab and we use my car every other Sunday to drive an hr to go see her? For reals???? And whooo tf are these friends you hanging with? The guys on Destiny??? So me and the kids just don't exist right? LOL (I have 2 older kids) 

I would love to find myself someone who appreciates who I am. I am not the perfect woman, if she exists, but I'm pretty damn supportive, loyal, fun and a real s\*x kitten when my needs are being met. Yes, I gained alot of weight during this pregnancy but that doesn't mean I should be treated like this.  Like I don't even get head in this realtionship.. tf am I really doing here LOL...

Anyways, as I said, we just had a baby. I love our lil family. But all this talking to other people and secrets is blowing me.

I'd like to find a way to blow this up without making it known that I was on his Google chats but like also don't care at the same time. I'm struggling with trying to decide if I want to keep things the way they are and go thru with just telling him this is our new norm or if I should just make his raggedy aaassss leave and pay child support.

"I used to be in love with a long time friend I’ve known since middle school about a year ago, I had told him my feelings abt him at the end of our junior year and he said he needed time to think about it. Through out that time it seemed as thought he liked me back since he acted very flirty and suggestive with me, until nine months after I told him in our senior year of high school he tells me he doesn’t like me in that way and just wants to stay friends and then goes to get with another girl where their relationship only lasted a month. I was actually happy i finally got an answer and was perfectly fine with staying as good friends and that’s how our friendship went the rest of high school. I stopped hanging out with him as much since now I felt I didn’t have to put much of an effort into the relationship since he told me he didn’t like me back then so I just treated him like I treat all my other guy friends. 

We graduate and now we go to the same community college and everything is normal at first, until his behavior took a weird sudden turn. He started waiting for me after most of my classes even when he didn’t have classes that day, he somehow found classes that I didn’t even tell him I was in and even waited for me outside of those too. When I drive home in my car he would follow me in his car to make sure I got home safe, and he would just want to be around me all the time. At first I just thought he was being a good friend, but then his behavior got even weirder. I talked about a guy I thought was cute in one of my classes to my best friend who was in my class and he wanted to know who it was and what he looked like and if I was gonna date him. I told him to relax and that I wasn’t really looking for a relationship at the moment and ever since then he wouldn’t stop asking me about the guy. 

Fast forward to now where a guy in my class told me he saw my guy friend follow me out of one of my classes with his hood up acting very suspicious, then I found him waiting for me outside the class I said the cute guy was in and he said “I analyzed every guy that came out, which one is it” and I still refused to give him an answer since I didn’t think it was any of his business. And when he went out of state to visit his online friend and I asked him over text if he could give the phone to his friend so I could talk to him too, through the texting his friend said “I’m sorry I have to give you back he (my guy friend) is giving me the puppy eyes” I didn’t think anything of it at first but looking back I wonder if that meant anything and why he didn’t let me talk to his friend more when I wanted to talk more to him. 

 And now he started buying me a bunch of gifts, it’s like everytime I see him now he has something new he bought me. He even uses it as an excuse to always come to my house and give me a new gift and then stay until late in the night. I tried asking him why because he never bought me gifts before and why he is spending so much money on me and he just smiled and changed the subject each time I ask, like he’s avoiding the question. 

So maybe his behavior isn’t exactly obsessive but he’s become this entirely different person now who always wants my attention, texts me all the time and worries when I don’t reply for an extended period of time, and is giving me an overwhelming amount of gifts. I just wanna know if this behavior is normal with guys? And any kind of advice is appreciated because I’ve already tried asking why he’s doing this when he’s told me he didn’t see me as more than a friend before and he won’t answer my question.

So I’ve been at my current job for almost three years now. I had a rapid series of promotions but pretty much kept the same manager that whole time. This man has been my manager for two full years now. My name being spelled wrong was not ever a problem in the past but randomly popped up on a schedule with an “e” where an “a” is supposed to be. No big deal, I thought it was just a simple typo so I marked it out on the schedule, corrected it, and went about my day. My name is not hard to spell. I’ve never even seen a different variation of my name (will not be sharing it here for the obvious reasons). It started showing up spelled incorrect more often, though sometimes it would be spelled right, which is the weird part.  I don’t know if he just doesn’t really care and isn’t paying much attention. But it is now consistently spelled wrong in writing, text, and emails. It’s gone on for about three months now and so I feel like it’s been too long for me to now say anything and I’ve just been silently correcting any schedules that get put up with my incorrect spelling. Because I didn’t do anything the first time I’m in an awkward place and don’t know how to bring it up to him. 

Things are already a little weird with us, we technically get along okay but he’s not a great manager and has let a lot of things fall on my shoulders and I just avoid him when I can. Trying not to build bitterness towards him but he really is incompetent at his job and the whole office seems to know that. (Which is a much bigger problem that management is kind of looking at)

"Ok, I feel so dumb for even asking this but I'm just so confused. 
We agreed on going out tonight and he went out to get some drinks 

Meanwhile I checked my wardrobe and tried on a very revealing, sexy dress with rhinestones and cut-outs that made my boobs look great. I thought it was too much though, but wanted to leave it on and wait for his reaction when he comes back. I dress very casual normally so I wanted to see his reaction. 

When he came back, I was in the living room with the dress on - he greeted me, put the things in the kitchen and... Completely ignored the dress. He just said nothing. I was so confused. He didn't say ""Wow"" or ""Nice"" or even something like ""that's too much"". Just *nothing*. So I asked him if he didn't like it. He just stared at me and said yes, he likes it. Why I needed to hear it from him, if I was that insecure. But nothing more. I felt like a moron somehow. I suddenly had to think of the one and only time I sent him a sexy picture of me very early in the relationship - and how he reacted in no way to that pic. He simply ignored it, left me feeling stupid and pathetic. 
Don't get it wrong, he normally makes me of compliments under daily circumstances. But when I feel sexy and want to involve him in it...He shows no reaction at all.

Is he playing hot and cold mind games? 

He literally just up’d and left quietly. 
He hasnt spoke to me in 8 days and ive made no interactions since then myself. 
We were laying in bed and were about to get intimate however we were interrupted by a call he said it was his niece inviting him to her game but i feel like he had got “Another call” or text right after and it pissed him off. 

He came back into the room and laid in my bed with his hand over his head and stayed quiet for about 4 mins during that next moment i decided to grab my bra and latch it back on. I had already felt his vibe was thrown off. 
As soon as i had put it back on he said “you might as well put the rest on too” i tried to lay on him to comfort him to see what was wrong but before i could land on his chest he grabbed me and kinda tossed me back over to where i was laying. At that point i turned around with my back toward him and gazed into my phone. About 1 song passed and he got up quietly put his clothes on and walked out my home without saying a word or giving and explanation. He texted me to lock my door and i didnt say anything after that. Im not sure if he is testing me, or playing hot and cold to get me hooked on him. I have had the urge to text him what was up that night but i dont want to take away from him being responsible for his actions or emotions &amp; distracting me from the REAL ISSUE. I feel i have the upper hand in this situation because im sure putting a bra back on didnt cause all of that. Do you think he will be back or he has ran his course. He has shown me to his friends and has gotten comfortable. The energy he brought into my bedroom was not the energy he had at first…which kind of made me uncomfortable thats why i put the bra back on. He’s is very sweet, and considerate and joyful around me but i see when he is angry he only thinks of himself.

"So I've been in relationship now for just over 2 years, I think she might be the one. We dated for about 8 months before we got into a  relationship and I feel very blessed to find someone like her. Whilst there are ups and downs in any relationship, I have one issue that is driving me slightly insane and its more to do with me than anything than the fault of hers.

So at one point in our relationship we were both curious to know about our past relationships and how many sexual partners we've had during our pillow talk. I really thought I would be okay with it but I was really suprised in knowing how many people she ended up sleeping with and this makes my blood boil just thinking about it.

I've only had one partner prior to her, where as she has had 2 relationships with one of them where she ended up cheating with. But in the space between she had slept around quite a lot with a few guys from dating, hook ups and one night stands. I slept with around 2 people with both whom I was dating with the intention of being in a relationship but both of them not being compatiable in the long run. I never been the sort of guy to be in a hookup culture and just wanted a genuine connection with a partner.

For some reason I feel really emotionally triggered when I think about it. I know I shouldn't be judging her past and I'm trying desperately to move on and focus on the relationship itself, but for some reason it justs keeps coming back to me and I'm feeling more and more frustrated eveytime I think about it and in turn I become emotionally distant from her.

I know that this isn't any of her fault and it's more to do with me but I just can't let it go for some reason. Am I just insecure? Any other guys or girls feel similar in some way? If so how did you over come it? Looking to get some advice and I'm also considering therapy.

I got invited to a new years weekend that sounds like so much fun, but my boyfriend of a year wants to spend the time with his family (even though he aparently never does). 
They got a cottage this year and he want to spend the time up there renovating. Even though I came up all this week helping them do Reno's and spending holiday time with his family instead of mine, he wants us to come up and do it all again. 
Part of me wants to just go to this weekend trip alone, but it wouldn't be the same without him and I'd feel like a tool ditching him for our first New Years together. On the other hand, he just told me this is what he's doing, didn't really make it about us or try to have a conversation. Honestly, new year with his family sounds really boring, they just watch movies, don't really drink. And we don't often hang out with people are own age or cut lose. 
I feel a little like I'm getting old before my time.

"We've been close friends for over a year and have dated for around 9 months. Being friends accelerated our relationship. I think even at the start, we knew we were pretty different people with different love languages, but we get along super well.  
  
Five months ago we went long distance. I really wanted her to get a job where I live (she wanted to as well but couldn't due to the market). The salary is a lot higher and the weather is a lot better.  
  
She blindsided me with a break up recently. She pointed out issues from two months ago and to me they seem very fixable.  
  
One thing we've had conflicts on in the past is money. I am more frugal, and she wants someone to spend a lot of her so she feels taken care of (she is very generous though).  
  
When she last visited me, I did some things like buy discount store presents (I thought it was fine and thoughtful because it was related to her interests like cats or Minecraft or inside jokes) and take her to free food at my office (tech company).  
  
After the trip, in the two months leading up to the break up, she hinted at stuff she wanted such as a bouquet and a fancy dinner, and I agreed but not enthusiastically. She also wanted a necklace, and I didn't get her one (I personally thought it was too early in the relationship). I think I didn't realize how important those things were to her because I thought the stuff I was currently doing like paying for meals and getting her small fun gifts was enough.  
  
In the two months, I was also going through stressful times with work and hanging out with friends so I didn't Doordash her flowers or buy her gifts like I would normally.  
  
I realized I should have checked in on her more. I heard from a mutual friend that my ex also complained about me pressuring her to get a job where I lived. I have not heard about this issue a single time. I would have stopped immediately if I knew.

She's also really mad at me and doesn't even want to stay friends. We're no contact which I'm fine with, but I'm just confused how it got to this. The day before the breakup we were calling and playing games and talking about future trips for 2024, and I was about to fly to visit her (flights booked and everything).

"My sweet sweet baby boy(11 months). He wakes me up every morning at 4:30. Once in a blue moon, he sleeps in until 6, but since birth he’s been an early riser. I’ve recently started sleep training, which has helped him get 10 hour stretches, but part of that means that when he wakes up at 4, if he doesn’t go back to sleep, I have to keep him up until ~9am so that I don’t reinforce waking up at 4, napping at 7. 

It’s not the worst, I usually make a pot of coffee, start the fire, feed him, then unload the dishes while he plays. But the key to this is: I don’t have to talk to anyone. I barely have to be awake! I just have to keep him awake. It’s pretty peaceful, actually.

Problem is this: when my mother in law visits, she pops out of her bedroom bright eyed and bushy tailed as soon as she hears movement in the kitchen. She’s told me before she struggles with sleep and often wakes up early, so I know I’m not waking her up, I take extra care to be very quiet. But like clockwork, I pour water in my beloved Mr Coffee drip machine &amp; she’s there. Asking me how I slept, what my childhood christmas traditions are, how work is going, explaining to me in great detail the latest novel she is reading.. it just makes my skin crawl. It is 4:45 in the morning, I want to be in zombie mode please I am begging you. 

I’d be more than happy to drink our respective coffee/tea in peace and silence, but to muster up the brain power to hold meaningful conversations HOURS before the sun rises is just. Excruciating. I would never want to intentionally be rude, but it’s hard to respond with genuine warmth and connection when all you want to do is reminisce on the days that you could sleep to your hearts content and strategize a game plan for when your torrential three year old wakes up.

We have been together for nearly 11 months. Sometime in August I had a hysterical fit (unfortunately a few hours before his grandmothers funeral) and since then, we have had some conflicts.

Wednesday, he told me, that it would be better if we went our seperate ways, but after deleting our pictures together, he said, that he would prefer a simple break (2 weeks). Today, he asked how far the break can go (as in sleepig with other people). We went on a phone call and talked about that and some other stuff. 
The way I took it, he wants this relationship, he wants me, but he needs time to sort things out.

We were supposed to spend the holidays with his parents, but he is there alone. Fortunately or unfortunately, after asking if I could come (askig that was probably a mistake of mine) he said, that he can see a possibility of that, but doesn't know when, as he needs time.

We also decided on texting less for the time being.

What my problem is: I can't stop checking if he read my messages, I can't stop anticipating his messages and I can't stop hoping that maybe next week he will say, that I can come.
How can I stop this? I don't know if I should kill all my hopes and go on with ""he wont do it anyways"" or not. I don't know how I can stop myself from checking my phone all the time.

"My husband and I got married a year and a half ago. Throughout the course of our relationship, I lived in city A and he lived in city B, which are about an hour drive apart. We would take turns visiting each other.  
  
My husband wanted to wait until we were married to move in together. Although it was not my preference, I agreed because I'd lived with partners before and those relationships didn't work out, so why not try it. We got married and I gave up my rent-controlled apartment in city A to move to city B with him. This made sense at the time because I work remotely and he needed to be in city B for work. He also had a much bigger house with lower rent.  
  
Well, it's been a year and I am not warming up to city B. Living here is a lot different than visiting every other weekend. It's a lot smaller than city A, and has a run-down vibe. I've made some friends and that part has been good, but ultimately I miss my home city and want to go back. I miss being closer to my friends and family in City A. I also just like the city 1000X better.  
  
My husband now works remotely (with offices in City A) and is no longer bound to City B. But he would prefer to stay in City B, which he has lived in for 15 years and really loves. He loves his community here, which I totally understand. Also, City A is more expensive. He wants to buy a house someday, and it will be harder to buy in City A, whereas you can get more for your buck in City B but I don't really want to plant roots here. Homeownership would be great, but I am happy to continue renting.  
  
I'm not sure what to do. I am unhappy here, but my husband would be unhappy in my city. He also thinks it's a waste to pay more for rent there. I gave city B a good try but it's just not for me. I really miss my old life. Apart from going back in time and refusing to move, I don't know how to approach this. Any advice is welcome.

At that point i turned around with my back toward him and gazed into my phone. About 1 song passed and he got up quietly put his clothes on and walked out my home without saying a word or giving and explanation. He texted me to lock my door and i didnt say anything after that. We havent spoke in 8 days and im not sure if he is testing me, or playing hot and cold. I have had the urge to ask him what was up that night but i dont want to be responsible for his actions or emotions. I feel i have the upper hand in this situation because im sure putting a bra back on didnt cause all of that so i will not allow myself to take the responsibility to find out. Do you think he will be back or he has ran his course. Im sure it was something else that was bothering him because that was not the energy when we were in the bedroom but when he returned it was tension in him which kind of made me uncomfortable thats why i put the bra back on. He’s is very sweet, and considerate and joyful around me but i see when he is angry he only thinks of himself. 

He has also been on tiktok liking my videos each time he gets on the app. He is fairly new at using it so he still learning im not sure if he knows i see him doing that.

"Some background info:
My gf has a few fetishes that I’m not really into such as golden showers, feet, and pegging (I said I might be willing to try it, but she only wants it if the other party is enthusiastic about it). She hasn’t done it before, but wants to try it out. This is also the first actual long-term relationship for the both of us (we’ve been together for about a year). Additionally, I’m a student and she is also starting a program soon, so it’s not like we’re swimming in money atm, to say the least.

The overall situation:
About a week ago, my girlfriend came across a fetish site and made a profile there without really asking me if was okay. She put a few photos of herself with her face blurred and put in her description that she is offering various things like golden showers, other people buying her expensive lingerie (either in person or online) which she would then present to them (either in person or online), ass eating (only hers), pegging, financial control, dominance behavior (texting or in person; I guess something like bullying/embarrassment), and maybe a few other things. She eventually told me about it, and she was quite excited. I’m a very calm, understanding, and open-minded person, so I thought I would be okay with it as long as there isn’t anything really intimate involved (sexually for her, e.g. anything with her p*ssy or kissing). She hasn’t done any of this before, and so she’s doing it mainly for money but also curiosity to see what it’s like.

Some specific occurrences:
Without my knowledge, she texted with this 47 y/o man with quite a few shared interests (like hobbies, being in nature, etc.) who was interesting in financial control (she controls his finances and can use his money for herself) and some of her fetishes (I think him being a sub in the bedroom and golden showers—maybe something else). The kicker is, she was willing to enter into a “secondary relationship” with this person. Basically, I would still be the main priority, but she would get to experience how it is to be in another relationship at the same time (with her fetishes and financial needs satisfied). We had a long conversation about it and were able to clear things up about her needs and what I mean to her. She’s very rational and so when I present my views and arguments and they’re valid, she agrees. So we agreed that she won’t do that. Despite that, I’m still a bit rattled and I’m not sure how to feel about the whole situation.
Also, there is another potential “client” who wants a golden shower and to eat her booty. She agreed to this for 100€, but she changed her mind on the booty eating and will only do the golden shower for 70. She is quite hesitant and is considering backing out of this, though she thinks it will be beneficial to push her out of her comfort zone.

How I feel:
The first situation did not sit right with me at all, as I’m not comfortable with it and since she had told him we were in an open relationship when we had not talked about that at all beforehand. We ended up having a conversation about this, so it’s cleared up at least. But again, I’m not sure what to make of this whole thing.
The second situation also makes me uneasy, though not to the same extent. I guess it’s fine as long as they don’t do anything romantically or sexually intimate (like kissing or sex or anything involving her getting an orgasm). I can’t provide her with the financial means she desires just yet, so that makes me lean towards being okay with it (though we also agreed that the financial aspect is not of relevance/importance for our relationship). But it still makes me a bit uncomfortable for my several reasons, including her safety and the idea of it all.
I’m also uncertain about what the future will hold since this is just the beginning here (seemingly).

My request:
Can anyone provide some perspective here? Should I be fine with this sort of thing? Is this going to jeopardize our relationship? Does this mean that our relationship is already compromised?

"Here’s the gist of the situation. I (M22) have been hooking up with this girl (F19) very consistently over the last 2 months and we’ve grown quite close. I have been very forthcoming and have told her repeatedly that I do not want a relationship. We have actually ended things 3 times now because of me not wanting a relationship vs her wanting one. She is very ambitious when it comes to a relationship and wants a lot from her partner. Last night, she told me that either we take this to a relationship or it’s done.

I am currently in my 4th year of college, will do a 5th year. I have an incredibly busy schedule with school, my finance internship, and my prep for a finance exam I will be taking. I don’t want a relationship and have enjoyed the fluidity of a single life for a while now. I also will be studying abroad and traveling Europe alone in Fall of 24 too, so I would be gone for around 5 months. I would love to have a relationship but I don’t think this girl is the person I want to get into a relationship with. Granted, there have been so many special moments that we have had and I wouldn’t trade those moments for anything. I have feelings for her but there are things that don’t work between us. Such as her ambitious-ness when it comes to relationships, her increasingly volatile home life, and incessant desire to be in constant contact with me. I like this girl but I want my partner to be somebody that really connects with my life goals and I don’t think this girl will be that. I feel like there is definitely an imbalance when it comes to our maturities and I personally want to date someone more in my age range.

I am very torn. I don’t necessarily want to lose this girl but I completely understand where she is coming from and why she has reached this ultimatum of continuing. I am trying to explore the idea of getting into a relationship with her and being 22 years old and never having had a really serious relationship, makes me want to get into one. She even texted me the other night saying “you are 22, it’s time to settle.” However, I feel that a lot of that pressure for me to get into a relationship comes from my desire for intimacy, most of my friends my age are in relationships, and just somebody to wake up to next to. I need to decide what to do, because I need to do right by her and right by myself.

What are your thoughts on my situation? Should I try a relationship with this girl? Is it bad that I am 22 years old and haven’t been in a real relationship yet?

"I'm a young adult, and caucasian from Finland. I thought about dating a thai woman for a long time and finally few days ago I decided to make a profile to an online site. I got many likes instantly, and of those many were clearly bots and scammers. 
Out of the real girls that liked me, I found two women who seem genuine and that they look for a serious relationship and want to commit. Both live in Sakon Nakhon, other is a marker worker in a rural area and other works in a seven eleven. They seem opposites of each other, 711 woman is a bit crazy and super confident and has had past relationships.
  
I have fallen in love with the rural woman. However I have questions still. She claims to be 29, single and have no children. Does this seem realistic to you? What are the chances all or some of the things she tell me are untrue?  
I have videocalled with her last 4 days before she goes to sleep and she has already told me that she loves me and wants a video call every day. She has not asked me money and she did not know anything about Finland. A lot of this seem genuine. She is communicating with me using a translator. She talks to me every morning and tells me good morning. She also sends lots of pictures from work and so on.
  
I want to know how much of this could be genuine? Is it possible she is 29 and single, and has no children? How do these Isan women generally see white men or foreigners? Also are there some warning signs to look out for? She has welcomed me to Thailand, and told me also that she wishes to visit Finland.

I know a lot of Thai girls from Bangkok and Pattaya can be real hardworking gold diggers, but what about these poor country girls? I would not want someone just for my wallet.

"I had a thing with a dude for like six / seven weeks but it didn't work out. I thought he was super hot and cool, and maybe quite out of my league, and I was really surprised that he was into me. Growing up I was a bit reserved and odd, got teased and bullied for it, and I only really sort of grew into myself and got ""hot"" when I hit my twenties, so I wasn't used to guys' attention growing up but I've definitely had some this year for like the first time ever. 

So when this guy was into me, I was really excited and it sort of felt too good to be true because, being conditioned to believe I was ugly and undesirable growing up, I really didn't feel worthy of his attention. I know that sounds stupid. But he must have been into me, we kept it going for a little while and slept together in this time, but at the end of October things started to feel a little off and he ended things. It was a bit sh\*tty, because he did it on the phone and was definitely making excuses in order to let himself off the hook, so I was left really confused. But the overarching fact is he just lost interest and wasn't into me. 

This has put me in a spin because I don't get why guys lose interest? Obviously I'm tearing myself apart, thinking I either did something specifically wrong that didn't match up with what he wanted, or I wasn't enough of something - funny, smart, sexy, good in bed, whatever, I've thought of them all. It's the first time I've had attention and interest from a guy I really wanted, and I lost him and managed to scare him away maybe. I didn't feel good enough when I had him, so now that he actually has gone it's sort of reconfirmed that belief that I don't deserve him or people like him, who are hot or cool or whatever. 

If he's lost interest in me, who's to say that the next guy won't? Why do they do it? And how do I avoid it, and be enough?

TLDR A guy I didn't feel good enough for lost interest in me, which has confirmed by belief/fear that I'm not good enough for him or guys like him - hot and interesting guys that I'm really into.

NSFW tried to keep clean 

Me and my gf have been together for a year and overall it’s been great.  She is thoughtful and I enjoy talking to her.  The only issue is I don’t think she cares about my pleasure in the bedroom.  When we started to get sexual it took her 2 months after I touched her genitalia to touch my penis.  I was very understanding that she may be shy and did not push it and waited for her to touch it on her own. 

As of now we have been having sex but it just feels like I’m there to pleasure her.  Like we will be making out and she’ll get on top and start dry humping me but she’ll stop and say she’s tired.  We will be getting intimate and I will finger her until she says it is too much and then she will just lay down.  There has been multiple nights where I will please her and she won’t even touch my penis.  Sometimes she will randomly rub it through my pants until I get hard and just stop to tease me but when she never escalates the teasing it kinda upsets me. For us to have sex i am the one that has to bring it up or it won’t happen.  I sometimes get blowjobs but they are just to finish handjobs that aren’t very enthusiastic.  I have let her know that I enjoy her blowjobs but the frequency has still lowered and they are never just random.  She has also never touched my penis before I have touched her genitalia.  

I am just the sole initiator and it’s starting to make me confused and really hurt my confidence that I may not be attractive to her.  She never really compliments my looks and now this I am just not feeling to good about myself.  I think I’m attractive but I would also like her to think that.  Overall I am just confused and sometimes feeing used and left blueballed.  I would like to have her be the one to initiate occasionally and make me feel wanted.

Me and my boyfriend (20f &amp; 23m) found out that the father of a friend is leading a double life. The friend group is very close knit, so they hang out quite often. This father also hangs out in this friend group as the ages are 30-40 for a majority of the people. Since their a big group, they have smaller hang outs with random individuals. He has two partners, and has been dating them both for 10 years. To avoid being found out, he even has two cars. Alongside these two partners, he has random flings.
I'm a very blunt, say-it-as-i-think-it person, and so I said at the time that I hope to never see this man, since I thought I'd end up telling his partner if I did. I just can't imagine wasting ten years of my life with someone who is actively cheating with another long term partner.
Now, though, my partner is angry at me. He thinks I would do better minding my own business, and leaving other people's affairs to themself. I understand where he's coming from, I completely do, but I just think how I'd feel if I hung out with a group of people I deemed as friends, or at least friends of my partners, if they all knew I was being cheated on.
I can't help but put things into my own perspective.
I've dated him for a year and a bit, but cannot imagine him cheating. But the idea of him cheating with a long term partner? Even for six months.
I feel so awful for the women involved. Driving back, we talked about it and he said how if I did tell, he wouldn't ever forgive me. I said that even though I'd be sad, I can't imagine those women going through that any longer.
This past year I feel like I've really changed my mindset, but this has stuck. I still feel an obligation to say something if I feel like someone is being mistreated, but maybe my boyfriend’s right?

"I get together with my friends from college sometimes, usually in the form of a weekend trip (we'll rent an airbnb or cabin somewhere out in the boonies and drink and hang out).

The last few times, one of our friends has brought his dad along on the trip. For reference, we are all in our upper 20s, and the dad is in his 60s. The dad is very very nice, but an absolutely raging alcoholic. Usually by the time we've arrived at the cabin, he is 15-20 beers in and totally incoherent. We're comfortable with drinking and getting drunk, but he is always dangerously drunk, completely incapable of participating in drinking games or conversation or any of the other things we like to do. Instead of catching up with each other, much of our conversation comes to revolve around how drunk the Dad is (half jokingly and half worriedly).

So my question is, **is there a good way to ask our friend to stop bringing him around?** The friend usually does usually ask permission to bring his Dad, but in a way that is very difficult to say no. For example, for our upcoming trip he dropped this question in the group chat after we'd already committed and booked a place:

&gt; ""Hey yo if there's still room for one, big Dan is free""

I feel bad because the Dad is nice and I'm sure it means a lot to him to hang out with us, but it makes me uncomfortable enough that I probably wouldn't have even committed to the trip had I known he was coming. It's weird to us and very much throws off the vibe. Or would it be better to just deal with it? Would love to hear some impartial opinions. Thank you!

when we started dating at 17, i was around 100 lbs and going through an eating disorder which led me to be hospitalized a few times. later that year, i started the road to recovery with tremendous help from my boyfriend and over the course of our relationship i developed thyroid problems (amazing to have when you struggle with recovery) and as a result gained 90 pounds, which MIL isn’t too happy about and makes it a long conversation every time i see her, even going as far to ask my boyfriend if it’d be offensive to buy me diet pills and workout clothes for christmas this year, she sends me tik toks and instagram reels of dieting videos and weight loss inspo, made me a diet to follow, recommended  me weight loss pills from her weight loss clinic, does weekly weight check ins with me over text, all which at first i didn’t mind but as it got more and more continuous i felt myself feeling uncomfortable around her knowing she was looking at me like that. she’s really big on weight loss and always complains to me when she gets over 120 pounds, recently said her boyfriend dumped her for a “skinny 21 year old” and just other off putting things about weight. i struggle a ton with my weight gain and have tried a lot to lose it, without going back into an eating disorder again. like, obviously i’m aware i gained a ton of weight, im not oblivious to that?

my friends and close relatives know it’s a touchy subject for me. my boyfriend tells me when i’m not around MIL, she talks to him about my weight gain and he always has to remind her that it’s not a subject i want to talk about (nor him) and he loves me for who i am. i guess it just makes me anxious and dreadful to have to see her over this weekend.

"So recently, and myself, and my girlfriend got into an argument, because I told her that I wanted some time to myself. For the past year of our relationship, we’ve been in constant contact, which isn’t really a part of my personality. COVID-19 actually changed me in a big way and taught me to learn how to enjoy my own company. And myself and her are in constant contact to the point where she calls me first thing in the morning and wants to talk every free opportunity that I got throughout the day. Whether that be when I’m not busy, and even during my lunch breaks at work, she wants to talk. If we are not talking on the phone, I am also physically with her as well. Recently, I told her that I wanted some space in order to talk to my friend sometimes, work on myself and other things. I am a person that really enjoys having alone time in time to treat myself doing things I enjoy doing. 

The other day we spent a large portion of the time on the phone together… and we usually fall sleep on the phone together. After the conversation of me saying that sometimes I would like some alone time to myself she got all mad. That same night when she wanted to go to bed I said that I wanted to go play video games with my friends and she got mad at me. Yesterday after spending 14 hours with her, I decided to go home and she asked me to call her when I get home which I replied that I want d to play video games with my friends. She is even more mad and we are not speaking. At this point I have no idea what to do. I have already tried explaining to her in the nicest way possible that my feelings have not changed, nor is anything going on, and I simply just want some time to enjoy with my friends, and doing other hobbies without having to be on the phone with her if I’m not physically with her. She basically told me she wants 100% of my time at any time where I have a free moment should be used to talk to her. I need advice. She is generally a really nice girl, but once I told her that I wanted some alone time, this has been going on and she’s been moody and mad every since.

When I first told him about my bipolar he told me about how his parents tried to get him institutionalized for bipolar when he didn’t have it and how he doesn’t believe mental illness is real (while he is also medicated for ADHD). I told him about how i was feeling depressed and undeserving of love and he told me about how his friends committed and that i should feel comfortable talking to him. I tried talking about how I felt like I was going through an episode and during an argument he threw that back at me and later said he didn’t mean it that way but still never tried to talk to me about how i was feeling. I was complaining about my home life and he’s gotten upset with me for talking about it so much and brings up the fact he wasn’t talking to his parents for 2 months and how he doesn’t really talk about that.

"I'm currently struggling with an internal conflict. In my family, there's no tradition of celebrating or exchanging gifts, but my girlfriend's primary love language is receiving gifts, and I'm aware of her fondness for them. To express my love, I occasionally gift her things, even going so far as to replace a gift with something different or more expensive if she desires. Recently, for my birthday, she created a heartfelt drawing depicting our relationship journey. While I acknowledge the effort and emotions invested in it, and another gift she gave me, after building up expectations for three months about fulfilling my desired items, was a relatively inexpensive musical device.  
I had expressed a specific desire for a different, more expensive musical device, and she initially gave me hope about fulfilling that wish. However, the gift I received was not in line with those expectations. I understand that my request might be considered demanding, but throughout our year-long relationship, throughout our year-long relationship, she had often discussed gifting me things I desired, only to never follow through with anything.  
Her financial situation is not strained; she works in the tech industry and earns as much as I do. I recognize that gifts are gestures of love, but I can't help the feeling of disrespected between the promises and the actual gifts. How can I cope with these emotions?","Me(25M) and my GF(23F), Expecting a gift from partner on birthday is bad?",18oljle,1703269713.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oljle/me25m_and_my_gf23f_expecting_a_gift_from_partner/,
"Let’s start by the fact that I already was cosplaying when I started dating my boyfriend, I have been cosplaying for over 5 years since it’s a hobby and I know most my friends from that community.

I had so taken a year break because of my studies but have been picking it up immensely lately, my boyfriend was supportive UNTIL I created a cosplay account to add other people to with the same interests so my personal account wouldn’t all be filled with me posing with swords for my family. 

He has become extremely insecure and clingy, and I don’t mind him being clingy at all,, he has gone with me to several conventions for cosplayers, I have always been open about it, but now he’s looking through my following and constantly demanding I unfollow the males that follow me, that he is uncomfortable with me cosplaying, wishes that I don’t post pictures of it (I have not even posted a picture since the account is recently new) I have wondered if I did something to make him uncomfortable, looked for a fix, he stays pissy and insecure about who I talk to, doesn’t like me getting attention on the cosplays I did, he rather has me not talking to any males.. is worried about who I cosplay, and I understand if my boobs were falling out BUT I COSPLAY MOSTLY MEN like cloud strife from final fantasy or ghost from COD.

We had a big fight about it because I want to pursue my hobby without constantly being accused of cheating because I like to dress as game characters and talk to people with the same interests.

It has been draining me completely, he doesn’t want me to hang out with anyone from the community even if it’s a lady, and if I do he will call me if I don’t respond within 10 minutes to his text.. don’t mind picking up but I’ve picked up annoyed because every time im out with girlfriends I have to pick up calls and make them wait awkwardly while I have to name my whereabouts.

"Just looking for opinions, advice, any words of wisdom. I have a great support system outside of the relationship so I am doing as okay as I can, but I would like to understand this mindfuck of a situation as much as possible so I figured some strangers could help.

My girlfriend(23F) and I(23M) just broke up the other day and it is safe to say, judging from the reactions of not only myself and my family but also my roommate and friends, is incredibly shocking and unexpected. I am very close to my family and discuss my feelings with them often. They not only saw a massive improvement in my moods but even heard adoration of me from her whenever we would visit their place for whatever reason(football games, working on our cars, etc). I genuinely thought she was the one from the first time we saw each other, and that's not even considering the incredibly picturesque history we had.


We had been crushes in the fifth grade!


After having kid crushes on each other back in elementary school, we reconnected again for the first time this last summer and messaged back a forth a few times a week from late July to early October 2023. From that point, we were romantically engaging, seeing each other in person for the first time, and then quickly falling in love with each other. It seems fast to anyone who doesn't have the context, but everyone from our families to our bosses at work thought we were set for marriage. And this was only two months ago!

I can recollect a positive, joyous memory from every day I spent with her from that point on. We did everything together, as she had just purchased a home and was in the process of furnishing the place with appliances and all of her decor and belongings. We opened up and became vulnerable with one another, explaining our trauma to one another and leaving with hopeful hearts that we had finally found the person who would respect each of our needs. She stayed in my house every night after about a week of us being together. I genuinely felt reciprocated for the first time, emotionally and physically, and according to the important people in our lives, we were meant for each other. I thought so too.

Let's talk about my (ex)girlfriend a little. She had an incredibly traumatic childhood, being not only a gifted athlete but also the daughter of an unrelentingly abusive father who controlled much of her life. On top of this behavior, he ended up committing suicide in October of last year. This left a major impact on her and her family, obviously, and I saw this first hand at their family gatherings how it changed the family. I even experienced her in a trigger moment, where a conversation between her and my roommate that she insisted on having reminded her in some way of engagements with her father. The conversation was somewhat heated, admittedly, but nothing out of the ordinary for a heated discussion about a miscommunication about her attitude toward him. She ran into my room crying, and I attempted genuinely to console her by calming her breathing, attending to anything she needed, and attempting to make her feel better through jokes and light conversation. She related to me that she has trouble with conveying and receiving anger, and it was something she needed to work on.

Fast forward to about a month ago. She had been pulled over and found out that, after moving back to our state when her father died last year, she forgot to get an actual driver's license and instead only had an ID card. This made her scared to drive her car,(that was financed for her by of one of her exes) and thus I elected to drive her to work on my way and help her get things done with her new house. 

Finals week was nearing in my final semester of college, needless to say I was incredibly stressed. I understand she was as well, with a construction project beginning soon at her new house and being forced to acquire her own car and pay the fines for her ticket. Since I had been driving her around fairly often considering her vehicle situation, she had seen my driving habits and noticed that they made her a bit anxious. She mentioned this to me, and I made a diligent effort to relax and drive a little more defensively, but I noted that both of my parents had road rage and were semi-aggressive drivers so it was going to be a habit I had to work back. I have been working on my road rage for a long time, but I notice it peaks when I'm overly stressed about other things.

One day, we got onto a discussion about why I was so stressed and frustrated. I mentioned that my friends had been fairly distant lately so that was an issue, and also the looming weight of graduation college and all of the intense factors that come with that were bothering me. She asked what she could do to help, and I always would tell her that the best way to help was distract me and tell me things were going to be okay. I always made sure to reassure her that I loved her and none of my stress was from her. 

A few days went by, and I was still stressed as the end of finals week had arrived and I had a ton of work on my plate as well as the intense emotion I was feeling about graduating. We got into a little argument as she mentioned she was going to move all of the stuff she had brought to my place in her stay over to her new place, and would either come back and stay with me or head to her mothers. I was really confused and upset, especially when we eventually got into it over how she had trouble with my roommate and how his behavior occasionally triggered feelings from her father. I was visibly frustrated about having what I characterized as ""a ton on my plate already, and now my two closest people are at odds with each other"", and definitely ranted a little bit of my stresses for a few minutes as we took her stuff to her car. I was definitely upset, and when I get upset I get a little negative, and I know she had a problem with that. I wasn't what I would characterize as anything near a level of frustration or anger to warrant a breakup, maybe a stern talking to or just a cold shoulder for a night, and I never directed it at her, I was just venting frustration outwardly about my future after college and my friendships. I understand wholly that I need to work on that behavior, and have since rescheduled appointments with a therapist that I had been neglecting to.

Over the next couple days, we were supposed to meet my sister and her boyfriend and head to my grandparents house, an event that had been planned since the first week of our relationship. She instead gradually declined from having me bring her remaining things to her house and explaining she wants a little time to set her house up and be away from me for a little bit to decompress and she wouldn't be coming to the events of the weekend, to only sending me two texts a day by the time I met her again at and gave her the final bit of things she left and talked about our future. 

When we met each other, we were able to hug and say we loved one another, and drove to a local park where we talked about our relationship. She explained that she felt that she couldn't trust me with her emotions, as she had asked me to stop driving in a way that made her anxious and I still did occasionally. Keep in mind, this isn't necessarily road rage, this is just riding someone a little close if they pull in front of you or if you need to let someone by. I got angry with traffic occasionally, but I was genuinely working on it and it's a hard habit for me to break and I was under the impression she felt better about it with my effort and would remind me if I needed to do better. She did not, and on top of me being stressed out with college and my friends, this must have lowered her trust in my consideration of her emotions in her eyes. I apologized profusely, of course, as I never intended to take those stresses out on her, and told her immediately I would work diligently to work on my frustration and focus more on my emotions. I've had a long journey over the past five years, going through multiple toxic and even sometimes abusive relationships, and had done a ton of work to better myself and be more aware of my behavior and reactions to things. There were just a few things I was still working on, as well all have, and I hoped that she would give me grace in those aspects and see me for me, the man she loved and spent the last two amazing months with.

After a long talk and discussing our emotions and feelings, a talk which found me terrified to lose her and with a deep hope she would understand where I was coming from, we came to what I thought was a great conclusion of a continuation of the relationship with the addition of a few boundaries she would determine after de-stressing for another few days. This was fine with me, as I was aware of her trauma and truly cared about her and her mental state.She even, at one point, questioned how we ever got into this fight. We hugged and told each other we loved each other again.

Two hours later, she deems that it seemed more innocent when we were ""friends"" and that she thought I would treat her better if that was the case. I gave her my all, and she treated me and acted like she knew that. I thought she knew I would've done anything for her, especially with how my friends and roommate saw our connection and how into each other we were. I was incredibly confused, and after stating my preference to remain in a relationship and to give her the time she needed to settle her emotions, because I would feel incredibly led on if she just left, she left. Even went as far as to block me on socials and even iMessage. She messaged my mother, saying things ""weren't working out"" and thanking them for their love and support of her. When my mother replied in shock, she said she ""didn't know what I was saying"" about her and that she was closing the door for communication. I am now left incredibly confused, hurt, and upset because it's truly unexpected.

From everyone I've engaged with who's met us, they're shocked. We got along so great, did everything together. Video games, cooking, shopping, walking my dog, sightseeing, visiting family and work, everything. In the course of a week, its all gone.

Now, I go to reddit. I felt the need to explain this much to get as good of an answer as possible, and I hope to ensure everyone reading that this is as genuine and honest as I can be. I have been doing an intense amount of introspection, writing my thoughts and feelings, and taking action like rebooking therapy and using habit-building techniques(many things she suggested me to do), I have worked really hard to ensure I am my best person. I now ask, what the fuck just happened?

I can't see any reason for her to have just used me. She loved me as vulnerably and delicately, she wrote things in my journal (she used for her mental health for a time) about me that were so sweet and unbelievable, I would almost cry when I saw them. My mother heard my praises from her, as well as my grandma. When I say it's shocking, if you had the context you'd get that gravity. I almost cannot believe in any way that she would just up and leave with all of these connections made and our history. All I provided was help and support and the first time we got into it at all, she decided to end things. I understand I'm not perfect, but I cannot gaslight myself into thinking I was anything better than my best, and she always showed me how much she loved and cared for me.

Considering my description of the truly shocking nature of this situation, is there a chance she's dealing with an intense trigger and is incapable of seeing me both emotionally and physically right now? or is she truly just crazy? I want to believe so bad that its the former and there's a shot of at least being able to amicably speak again, if not get back to the process of loving and caring for one another again. I've got mixed advice from my friends and family, so have at me. Don't be afraid to be harsh, I'll be alright.

"I (m43) and my wife (f44) are continplating divorce, I think I fucked up and put the last nail in the coffin

I'll try to keep this as short as I can. We both got together very young. We've been together for 26 years now. We have two wonderful adult children and have built quite the life together.

About six months ago she started going through a really rough time. She's had bad health issues for over a decade now that really limit her quality of life. She also started having a hard time with our looming empty nest. This was hard on her, realizing she didn't have an identity outside of being a mom or wife.

She's been playing pool for a long time now. When all these difficulties cropped up she threw herself into it and it became her identity. She started to wonder if she even wanted to be married anymore, she just wanted to be left alone and focus on pool which was the one thing she thought was going well for her.

I've tried my best to be there for her and support her through all of this. She just doesn't want to talk about any of the problems and can get angry if I try.

We tried things like having her spend a week at a hotel so she could get away and focus on herself . This didn't seem to help anything.

I tried just leaving her alone to think on things herself and not feel pressured. I even had a talk with her that if she really did want to leave that id be there for her and support her however I could.

She never committed to anything one way or another. Things felt like they were getting better with us. I asked her and she said she hadn't thought about us in months, that it's too painful to.

This didn't add up for me. We started talking about future plans for ourselves and each other. To say she didn't think of us just didn't make sense to me. 

I'm not proud of it, but I looked at her phone. I really only wanted validation that what she was telling me was the truth. If she talked to anyone about it, it would be her best friend. What I read crushed me. She was planning on leaving after the holidays.

I didn't react to this well and moved all of her things to her mother's while she was working. I was just in so much pain and felt betrayed. I just couldn't look at her or be around her.

She obviously didn't take the news well. She said that she was just venting to her friend and I violated her safe space . She's right I did. She said she never decided and kept going back and forth, that I didn't see those texts.

I think I fucked up and put the last nail in my marriage. I really can't imagine life without her and really hate myself right now.

Has anyone else been through this? Is there anything I can do to try and make this right?

Thank you for all the replies. They are all in line with what I've  thinking and feeling. We've just been together for so long and through so much that for it to end like this is just insane to me.

"Me and hubs have been married for almost 10 years. We have a 4yo together. 

I asked him to stop youtube- he was making videos about the stock market and I didn't approve (he has no formal educationon it and is by no means an expert). He was the single parent at the time- I was 6 hours ahead for about 8 months due to work (we are both military and I was on a mostly land based deployment)

I get that alot of people do stocks and day trading, and that's whatever to me. He's obsessive about it though- and not particularly good either. He doesn't listen to music, only podcasts about stocks. His only conversation topic is the stock market- splits and contracts that I don't know about and honestly don't care to learn about.

I think it's weird that a self proclaimed ""family man"" has his phone lock screens as American flag and AMC stuff- not us/kiddo.

We're caught in issues- see previous posts. But I think he's being extremely shady now.

- he opened a new Gmail account (the username says something about being a millionaire). We share the desktop computer, and internet showed the logout screen when I went to use the computer.
- he hasn't posted a video to youtube since August, but a month ago he posted an apology message for not posting (WHO CARES?? I seriously don't get this, especially with how much he hates me being on fb/insta)
- he's in a stock market discord group, as an admin (I'm also in the group lurking cuz I wanted to see how often he was posting- he has not in several weeks)
- we have an indoor camera, for security. He unplugs it because he thinks it's unnecessary- the only time I've ever used it to ""spy"" was when he didn't answer his phone after several calls. He was asleep on the couch, when he was supposed to be watching our daughter.
- he constantly complains about being tired, but has been waking up at 5 to- I assume- go play stocks for an hour and a half.

"So I have been seeing this girl for 6 months now and her ex (her only other boyfriend she’s ever had that she was seeing for 2 years) lives on the same street as me. My gf doesn’t live with me but is only about 15 min drive away.

My gf only met me 2 weeks after the break up (I didn’t know till a few weeks in that it was so recent) and after 2 months of us being together began finding things in her room of his and she’d go over to his to give him it back or he’d find something of hers and she’d go over. 

This has been happening about once a month and it’s usually while I’m busy and not around. The most recent time was last night. We agreed to meet up last night a few days prior and not on a specific time but just ‘when I get back from work’. Got a message from her while at work saying she was going over to her exs to give him back a pair of joggers and asked to  come over saying she assumed I was gonna be home shortly so it would all work out time wise. Which I usually would be if I wasn’t working overtime but thing is she knows that I’ve been doing overtime for the past few weeks and wouldn’t be home for hours to come and when I remind her I won’t be home for hours she just says “oh okay well there’s no point in me going home just to come back, I’m fine chilling her for a few more hours and so is he” and will end up hanging out at her exs for a few hours when it was supposed to be just a quick exchange.

 This sorta thing has happened  a good few times now and he still is into her (he occasionally tries to call her and texts her late nights at least a couple times a week) which makes me uncomfortable already but her willingness to hangout with him in his bedroom for hours just makes me feel uneasy about it all. Especially since when she does tell me when she’s going over before she goes she tells me she doesn’t wanna go to his since it was a bad breakup with him being abusive near the end of the relationship and just wants to stay outside his apartment door yet when she goes over she’s always fine with spending hours alone in his room. Have also noticed that while when she’s not at his and we message (mostly through snap) we usually just send photos and videos to chat but when she’s at his she only send texts or voicenotes.

Dk if I’m just paranoid and haven’t said much to her about it and I wanna trust her and don’t wanna seem crazy but I’m just worried she’s cheating. Any unbiased opinions or advice?

"Hi I don’t really know how to work this but i’m going to try my best because I honestly don’t know what else to do. I don’t really have many friends that I can ask for advice so I decided this was the next best thing. (I tagged Nsfw because i mention sex once or twice, I don’t really know how reddit works!)

Over the summer I (19f) decided to broaden my horizons, I am a pretty shy person and tend to keep to myself, I was going into my 3rd semester of college and I felt like I was falling behind. I have really bad self image issues but decided I should live a life too. So I got on Hinge and this app for hispanic people called Chispa. On both the apps I met two guys, we’ll call one Sam (20m) who is my now boyfriend, and the other Adam (25m). Sam and Adam are two very different people. I met Adam first, that night he had said we would only talk and get to know each other but we ended up sleeping together. He took my virginity, and that’s basically the only thing we did the couple of times we saw each other. And our conversations consisted of only sexual things or him leaving me on delivered for hours. Only to come back the next day saying “I was asleep.” He then had something come up and has been away since September. He kept in contact as much as he could but each time it was basically just to tell me he needed help ($$$, if you catch my drift). I was so sad that he had gone, and so sad that that’s all I seemed good for because in my mind, he was supposed to be “the one.”

All while this is happening Sam texts me again, we get closer and over the months we both begin to like each other for who we are. When I met him, he brought me the loveliest flowers and he actually listened to the things I was saying, without interrupting me with kissing. After that we started dating, and we actually do things besides have sex. Our conversations are sometimes so silly but can be serious. He tells me the sweetest things and holds me like he never wants to let me go. 

But now Adam called again and he said he’s returning soon, he called me “my love” as if months had not passed. I feel so bad but I don’t know how to tell him I have moved on.

I have never had to do anything like this before, I have only ever been ghosted and things like that so that was my first inclination, but I know how much that hurts and I don’t want to inflict that sort of pain on someone else. So all this to ask, does anyone have any advice on “breaking up” with someone you aren’t even dating, gently?

"I just wanna start this off by saying I'm a dumbass for even giving this a second shot. But yeah I'm really confused and need clarity about this situation.. so I guess all year I've been really on and off with this guy and he had blocked me and we decided to become friends again ... this time felt good because everything that I had an issue with the first time around he was starting to fix , like being more communicative and giving more of his free time.. sometimes we'd debate about religion because I'm a Christian and he's not  but we debated about a lot because that's kind of how we bonded... everything was going extremely well til a few days ago and I'm not really sure what could've set him off but now I'm blocked as fuck and he's not talking to me and I'm just really really confused ... so here's what happened, so me and him had end up having sex and that's kinda wait changed the dynamic of the friendship.. at the time he had finished in my mouth and a few days to a week later I had developed a sore throat,  so on Monday I went to the doctor and they tested for strep and it was negative so they started testing for everything.. they gave me a shot of steroids and some antibiotics and sent my swab off to a different lab (this is important to the plot)... so once I felt better me and him decided to hang out so I could give him his Christmas gift right ? So when he pulls up I give him the gift and he loved it and I confess my feelings for him like i literally tell him im falling in love with him ! and everything is going relatively good.. I tell him about how I went to the doctor and how they had to send my swab off and I asked him like was it your nut or was it like the fact I like to smoke outside without shoes... at this point he kinda became defensive and telling me I'm the only one he's been with and I'm like okay then if that's the case there's nothing to worry about right? So after that whole debacle we end up talking about other things and going to the bar to get a shot and some bud... so we start to head back to my house to smoke and he randomly says like he has to go cuz he had work in the morning and he just started to act extremely sketchy... I called him out , I was like ""broo why are you acting weird"" and shit like that because it was just like a switch had went off.. he asked me to go to the back to get the papers and I came back and he was gone but he had to come back cuz he had my wallet.. so of course I'm like ""what the fuck bro? Like why'd you just try to leave me here? You're the one who wanted to smoke? Like everything was going good and now you're doing this"" ... so I'm like leaning on the car cuz I'm talking to him through the window and he starts driving off while I'm on the window and he deadass pushed me off and kept driving... like he couldve hurt me or ran me over! My elbow has a scrape and i have a bruise on my arm... so I call him and I'm like ""bro what the fuck did u just try to hit me with your car"" and he was all like ""I don't want this anymore and don't call me"" and I was/am really confused on how we went from kissing and cuddled up at the start to me getting pushed off a moving car and blocked by the end ... and bro HE KEPT THE FUCKING GIFT!! Like nah bro at least give the gift back the fuck? But no he's never done anything like that before and I'm just wondering why and I have called sooo many times and made Hella fake accounts and idk I'm searching for answers... mostly I want the gift back but I'm confused how he could even be so cruel.. it's like he can be the sweetest human and make you feel like you're floating On a cloud so I was shocked he'd even do something like that to me..",24/F - 24/M he almost hit me with his car,18okrh5,1703267666.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18okrh5/24f_24m_he_almost_hit_me_with_his_car/,
"Unsure about new relationship

I’ve been talking to a guy every day for 2 months.  We’ve been exclusively “dating” for one of those months.  We went on a trip together over the weekend, and on the way home I asked if he had thought about a future with me.  He said “not really”. At first I was kind of upset by his answer, but I think it’s fine?  He’s a “fly by the seat of his pants” kinda guy, and I’m a planner. He pointed that out, and stated that he has no intention of hurting me.  

I’m super, SUPER new to dating.  I recently got out of a 15 year marriage (6 months ago)…I’ve literally not dated as an adult.  So idk what’s normal and what’s not. Opinions?  Am I crazy for asking?

"I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years. My girlfriend has very high semi-untold expectations for how I should behave. This has caused extreme strain on the relationship.

As an example, she's told me how she wants me to ""ask her deeper questions about discussion topics"". 

I thought she wanted me to ask her deeper questions, which is what I tried doing. But her needs kept snowballing. After a while, **she expected me to go in-depth with her** **on every topic she wants to talk about.** **If I ever miss a prompt for a conversation she wants to have like ""Oh I learned about X at work today"", she often tells me how she feels hurt I didn't dive into the conversation and she expects me to apologize.** 

Sometimes, I miss her prompts if I'm distracted with work-related stuff in the evenings or just exhaused. If I ever miss a prompt, she gets sad, starts to cry and then tells me she expects me to apologize for hurting her feelings.

I have told her that I want her to understand that I can't always be perfect or respond perfectly to everything, and I need to have some reasonable space for missing certain prompts. And she responds by telling me that these are her expectations.

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask your partner for deeper conversations. However, I think the frequency and way she's reacts afterwards if I miss a prompt is. 

I don't feel like I have any space to breathe and I feel like I'm constantly on alert about this in the relationship.

"May be long, but i truly am going to try to shorten it. 

Christmas is coming up, my boyfriend had made a comment about wishing he could marry me for Christmas. Marriage has been talked about a lot lately, and I’m pretty sure we are on the same page. I mentioned I’d like to perhaps propose to him yesterday, and he had the biggest blush, cutest smile on his face and seemed as if he wanted to cry. 

So fast forward to today. We will be going shopping today and I originally was going to buy him a ring. I wanted to let him mom know because it will be infront of his family when I do it on Christmas Day and I was hoping for her to record. Our relationship has been rocky. She’s an alcoholic but in denial about it, and is overly attached to her son being a single mother and woman for so long…needless to say she had caused many issues but I’ve been trying really hard lately to make shit work with her. 

While telling her my plan, she was finding everything in the book to try and deter me, including using the fact that I over think by saying do I really know if he even wants that or if he is just humoring me… I do believe he wants to as well, and at the moment it’s not like we’d be getting married right then and there, it will be a bit, but I want to solidify my feelings for him and atleast take the next leap. But now part of me is scared, and I feel once again his mother just doesn’t want him to be with me. 

He sees these things, it really bothers him as well. She’s a drunk though and talking to her about it fixes nothing. But I’m scared she’s going to try talking him out of it, or maybe I am delusional and he is just humoring me. 

Has anyone else been through this? I need advice on how to navigate. I really can’t see a future without this man, and I really want to propose to him. I just don’t want to cause issues with his mother, or her to cause issues.

"i’ll keep this short. last night before bed i was searching something on my boyfriend’s phone and accidentally clicked another one of his open tabs. the tab was open to a website that helps you find erotic massage parlors. it was specifically open to a spot in our city. i thought it was a pop up ad he accidentally clicked on while on another site, so i exited out and handed his phone back, but i remembered the site and pulled it up today myself and you have to enter your location to view any results. the place he was looking at has reviews online about it being known for happy endings and blowjobs. 

we’ve been together for 3 years and have a great sex life. it’s also not like i don’t give him bjs or handys, 60ish % of the time we have sex he’s getting one or both, plus there are times i do it for him and get nothing in return… so i can’t imagine why he would be looking for these services. the more i think about it the more i feel like i could vomit, i don’t think he’s actually done it but it just feels gross to think he’s considering paying for sexual favors when he’s never expressed dissatisfaction with our sex life.

"So, yeah, basically I (f25) have come to a realization that hurts a lot. I don't trust my boyfriend (m33) to help us get our lives back on track anymore. I also just don't feel very loved...I just feel empty and lonely. 

 FYI, our ages are off, listed as a year older here,  just because he watches for the posts in this sub with our actual ages to make sure I don't post about him. Idk, sometimes I just want to be private about this stuff, and there's no harm in it if no one knows who we are irl right?I guess if he's seeing this now... Hi...

So, I guess this starts a year ago when I blew up my life. I had everything. I was totally stable: I had a long term partner, was in grad school, had a lot in savings, etc. Then something happened to my brain... I just lost my mind and blew it all up. I got cold feet and broke up with my partner, I spent time in the psych ward (and as a result lost my contract with the university), and when I got out, I coped with the losses by using hard drugs, which blew all my savings and credit score. I was just out of my mind, and no one, not even the doctors, really had an explanation for me. I still don't know why it happened. I guess I'll never know. 

Then I met my now-bf, who is/was a lot of fun. We were quickly swept up in a romance, but we also partied -- hard -- and used drugs together. A few months later, I was back in the psych ward. Then, we were addicted and living together. A few more weeks, and, once again, psych ward for the 3rd time. And then he lost his job. Then, we got evicted. That's when we finally got enough basic common sense to be able to get sober. We were in financial ruin, and everything I once had was completely gone, including my relationship with my family. That's gone for good now, unfortunately.

Fast forward to the present, and my bf and I have narrowly escaped homelessness. His (amazingly understanding) parents happened to had an empty in-law apartment, and they offered us an indefinite stay until we're back on our feet, rent-free. After moving in, we both got new jobs (they suck, but whatever, it's income!). And I even got offered free tuition by my department to return to my PhD program next semester! I'm feeling like we're finally moving forward, even though I miss the life I used to have. 

Oh, and the best part is, during all that time since getting evicted, we really stuck to staying away from hard drugs. I was so scared that we'd fall into that trap again and never get better. But we did it. And we were hustling for legit 10 dollars a day to get by. Every day we'd get what we needed and then be back at zero. Now, finally, we had some actual money to our names.

But I guess I got too hopeful too quickly... Last week, my bf met a dealer and decided to try a new drug, and I was really against it. I didn't want to even think about the idea, but he tried it and loved it (too much). He urged me to try it because he said he wanted to use it for sex, and I was so stressed with the pain of missing my family for Christmas this year, and I also didn't want to feel like I was missing out or letting him down, so I just gave in. 

And, as my luck goes, I had the WORST comedown. It was brutal. One of the worst things I've been through, and I've been through a lot. I was so depressed that I thought it'd be the end of me for sure that time. But I came out of it. He did way way more than me and way more often, but he just didn't get affected like I did... So he has continued buying more and using. And wanting me to use too. I feel so pressured to give in, and of course I get some version of those horrible effects later, and it's breaking my brain. To add to it, I lost a ton of weight, my hair was matted for a week until I finally brushed it last night, and I've been neglecting eating, sleeping, trying at anything... 

I finally hit my breaking point when he suggested buying more drugs as soon as he got his paycheck yesterday. I was already miserable because I am coping with this being the first Christmas I won't have spent with my family back home, so I had been up just feeling so so sad. So I was gentle but made it clear:  I want us to NOT be broke and sick anymore. Why live a miserable life? I sold all my belongings, lost everything I ever had, just so we could get by before! At that point, I wasn't mad or sad. I felt nothing at all, so I just told him that I was ready to leave, even though I have no money anymore and (legit) no friends and no family. He begged for a second chance and said he'd fix it all, etc etc. I was so tired by the end of it that I gave in -- one chance -- but I didn't want to. 

But now I'm starting to feel a deep anger that I haven't felt in a while. I realized that he must know what this life did to me before... It almost killed me for real. And now we're on track to end up there again, with no money, no health, no gas, and no food?? Even now, we're living with his parents, which is better, and maybe he doesn't mind, but I don't think he understands that I'm just a stranger here. I feel alienated from everyone out there participating in society. I have no one at all. And he's worried about my mental health so he watches all my Google activity and social accounts, so I'm definitely making a bold move by posting here, even though I think I was subtle enough. But I need to at least communicate this to another living person. 

But here's my issue, and the point of this post: I don't want to leave him. I think I love him still, and my heart feels all twisted up now. After all, we were sober when we got together, and that was legitimate. It just got really bad as we made worse and worse choices. He was very kind to me last night, but I didn't feel anything still. I'm just empty, and my feelings toward the world as a whole are just empty now. 

I don't know whether to trust his promises that he'll quit and we'll get back on some kind of good path, or if I should just give him up too and go find a shelter or somewhere else to stay. I'm so tired and so lonely, and I'm wondering if this is a good move -- to leave and let him figure himself out -- or to move forward together and make it really last...

So that's my question I guess

TLDR: my boyfriend got back into drugs when we already got sober and salvaged part of our life. We were moving ahead. Now it seems that I have to leave, but he promised he'd fix it. I don't know either to trust that or not, and I can't afford any more losses.",I (f25) don't trust my boyfriend (m33) of 1 year anymore.

"So long story short, my wife and I got married young and the beginning of June, 22, left without explanation. Some contact about details about a separation and divorce were talked about before a situation happened where she was not allowed to contact me for a year. 

After about a month after that was up, we reconnected because of a small claim, and being the person I am, I still love and care for her and spent the whole time she was gone, wishing she hadn't left. I agreed to meet her to try and settle outside of court, and after we realized that are discussion on settling wasn't going anywhere she said she missed me. Of course it's the words I wanted to hear and was wishing I'd hear over the past year. When I said my vows, I meant them so if there's a chance to repair, then I want it. (Also I feel this goes without saying, but there is a lot of fine detail that I don't feel is necessary)

We've been back together for almost two months, the first month, was like when we had gotten together and we communicated, talked about our past years, what happened, our growth, our hurt. It was painful but felt like it was constructive. But the past few weeks. She took on another job, moved out to the job. (Only 20 minutes away from me, but my car's been in the shop for months). To my understanding she works close to 12 hours a day and more than that if it snows.

I send her good morning text usually every day because I feel like it's a kind thing to do and let's her know I'm thinking of her, but I've also come to learn I have an anxious attachment type and she has an avoidant one. Because she works so much, I get to see her maybe once a week so far. So texting, because she never really likes calls, is about the only way to communicate with her. It's a big change from the first month where I was seeing her everyday, we'd sleep in the same bed every night, and now I don't see her near at all and now she hardly texts me back. Which starts to make my fear of being abandoned get worse. I feel like she's about to abandon me again. I can't tell if this is the anxious attachment, or if this is reading signs of the relationship.

"This is a throwaway account. My (28m) girlfriend (28f) and I have been together for about 1.5 years. It's been a mostly positive relationship and we plan to marry late next year or early 2025. She did something today that made me deeply uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

My Gf and I live in separate condos that are only about 3 mins walk to each other. This week is the last week before the office closes for the Christmas holiday and its been extra busy. I've been working late into the evening and haven't been able to see her, but we talk on phone everyday. I called her yesterday evening after work, intending to go visit her and noticed she was being distant. She wouldn't speak until I spoke and didn't seem eager to continue talking at all. When I finally told her I was coming over, she responded that she was actually going out to visit her friend (let's call him Dave).

&amp;#x200B;

She has known Dave for a long time since childhood. He has been living in a different city for the past 5 years and recently moved to Toronto a couple of months ago. He actually went to the same high school as me, so I know him as well. She has already been to his place a couple of times and I have no problem with it at all. I told her on the phone to keep me updated. She texted me when she arrived at his place and that was the last I heard from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I called her again this morning and she still had the same distant demeanor. About 2 mins into the call, I asked her why she was being so quiet on the phone and she responded ""nothing"". Then a minute later, I hear a guy's voice. I asked who that was, she waits a couple of seconds and tells me it's Dave. I asked her why she slept over and she explained that it was late at night and she decided to spend the night but she slept on the floor in the bedroom. I told her it wasn't okay for her to that without informing me. She started apologizing, but I just told her I was going back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 26 and I have a much older half brother in his 40s. I know it’s related to the way that he was raised, but I have this feeling that he is constantly underestimating me or finding faults with what’s wrong. For example, I finished my MA and got a good job/career despite the obstacles in life (my dad passing away recently, etc, but he always manages to nitpick and talk about what I’m doing wrong.

He talks about how I’m too sensitive and need to learn how to be strong when he acts in ways that offend me, or when I’m grieving my father. I always send gifts to my nephew while he continues to financially support my sis in laws whole family. Sometimes he’s too embarrassed to say thank you, or thanks my mom first instead of me when I get them something. My mom tells him to give me the credit, but it’s honestly not really about that.  I wish all my efforts were appreciated or acknowledged. I always feel like I have to prove myself to earn his respect while he doesn’t treat his other family members like that. It’s mostly the thought that counts, but he always asks me what I’m going to get for mom or what he will get for her bday… while not planning something/getting anything for mine, which is just a few days after mom’s bday.

I have been dating the same woman 35F for about 10 years, we have had ups and downs, and have broken up a few times. 
The last time we broke up we spent around 8 months separated and in that time I opened a profile in a dating app (bumble) and met a new person 36F and started dating her but it didn’t work out. 
After a while I reconciled with my ex girlfriend and started dating again. One day she asked me where I met the girl that I was dating and told her that I met her in bumble and she made fun of me saying some hurtful things. 
I let that go and continued with the relationship.

One day, we were having dinner and she showed me a video on her phone and a bumble notification appeared in her phone, I don’t know if it was a “match”, a message, or the notifications that bumble sends to use the app, the point is that she had the app installed. 

Now I don’t know how to confront her.
Some advice here?

I went home and the next day we spoke but something was off, I asked him what was up but he wouldn't say till he later called me that night saying he was unhappy in our relationship and needed space.

"I don’t know if I should stay and try to make things work with my boyfriend anymore. Let me start from the beginning. Last year we started dating and about 3 months in, his parents found out that he was going out with me and to our surprise and dismay, they told him he wasn’t allowed to ever see or go out with me again because I wasn’t the same ethnicity as them, and that was the deal breaker for his parents. Of course being 17 year olds we stayed together, we still found ways to talk and he would lie to his parents to go out and see me. Well beginning of this year we broke up because it was getting exhausting and just hard to keep it up. 6 months after being broken up, we got back together and things were better than ever. But a few days ago his parents found out again because him and his brother have shared locations and his brother snitched. We’ve been discussing this for the past two days straight and his solution is to wait until he graduates and once he gets his own place we could finally be “free.” The reason why he can’t just stand up to his parents is because they would literally kick him out. They are also paying for his schooling so it’s just not a realistic option. I honestly don’t mind the waiting, it’s more I just feel like what if it’s a waste of time after everything and his parents just never allow it? Id never ask him to cut them off or anything like that either that’s just something I’d never do. But we genuinely want to be together long term and I love him it’s just so much to decide right now.

"i’m in school so we don’t get to see each other very often. it used to be once every 2 weeks but we both found that too little. i started coming back home every weekend so we could see each other at least once a week. he also works full time at a cafe and he’d usually have to work on weekends until the evening. that was fine for me, i’d go there and study until he was done, and then we’d do something together.

now i’m on winter break and i just assumed we’d see each other more often. he was scheduled for a lot of hours on the week i got back and he was complaining on call about how tired he was. the first day i got back i asked him if he wanted to go somewhere with me and he said he was too tired. this was the first time he ever declined seeing me and i know it sounds stupid but now i feel scared to ask to see him again?? i’m always the one asking him out - he said it was because i had school and studying, so i should tell him when i want to go out in advance and he would book the day off. it never made sense to me because he had work, which i feel like is a much bigger time priority than studying which i can do anytime, but i just went with it. but now i’m wondering if he was tired all those days i wanted to go out and he would have rather went home and relaxed by himself. 

coupled with the fact that he is almost never the one asking me to hang out (as of now we are only planning to see each other twice on my 3 week break), i feel like going out once a week is perfectly enough for him. i’ve already told him i’ve been bored and that i don’t have many plans for the next 2 weeks, so it’s not like he thinks i’m busy or tired. we are always on call when neither of us are out or at work - that used to be enough for me. but now i feel like it’s not? he always gamed but he used to sometimes take a break to talk to me and give me his full attention before i go to bed. lately he hasn’t been doing that - i’ve been falling asleep to the sound of his gaming every day and i hate it. we don’t see each other in person very often and now we barely have any meaningful conversations on call either. he said he’s happy just knowing i’m on the other side of the phone, even when we’re not talking. 

i don’t know how to bring up my dissatisfaction when he seems so content with how things are, and i especially don’t want to be a bother to him when he just wants to relax after a long day at work. i just don’t understand how he can love me and only want to see me once a week. at what point am i demanding too much from him and i need to compromise?",how do i (19f) ask my boyfriend (21m) for more time together?,18ojrd5,1703264967.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ojrd5/how_do_i_19f_ask_my_boyfriend_21m_for_more_time/,
"My gf and I have had a difficult time lately, she got diagnosed with BPD, we have been in a long distance for 2 years now, recently she went on a rampage, cut me out of her life, spending multiple nights at clubs doing drugs, every time she was out she would ignore my calls, leave me on seen and it got heightened to an extent where she dumped me because she thought I was being too disrespectful of her space by trying to know where she was or who she was with. She'd always get defensive, for those few days all she did was reply to me once every 24 hours saying 'Sorry I messed up' to any questions I asked about her whereabouts. While I wasn't getting any replies her snapchat scores were going up by 100s, after every night at the club I saw new dudes added to her account, she even told me she was letting dudes buy her drinks so she can slip them to her friends, I checked in with my therapist and he told me to let it be she's just been diagnosed and she doesn't know what she wants, after all that happened she sobered down a little started texting me a bit more regularly again, I apologised to her sincerely for not recognising the problems she's going through and blamed myself for not getting her attention. But now again, every day I see her adding new dudes to her instagram (while I am blocked everywhere and I believe she's also hiding the existence of this relationship from her friends), last night she told me she wants to go start swimming and do rock climbing and make some friends there, today I found a dude with barely any people but her added, who has rock climbing in his bio but she hasn't even gone yet?

She also has told me her self esteem is low so she never sends m any pictures but she posts herself daily on her instagram all readied up with make up and everything, I asked her about that and she told me she cares about what I think about her looks more than other people that's why she doesn't show me pictures she takes of herself. But with everything going on I'm starting to wonder if she's just having the time of her life and exploring while knowing that at the end of it all she has me who's going to settle down with her since we've already spoken about getting married.

"On mobile so I'm sorry for any formatting issues. 

For context: Im a stay at home mom and he works 60+ hours a week. We have two kids (3f and 10 months m). I do all of the housework and childcare. We also have 3 cats, who I do all of the care for.

About 6ish months ago, my fiance's coworker was trying to re-home his pitbull. She's a 3 year old named Stella. He'd heard from another coworker that Stella was being abused and after some consideration, we decided to take her in. We were under the impression that she was a service dog. Spoiler: she was, in fact, not a service dog. Stella is also incontinent when she sleeps. 


My fiance agreed when we got Stella that he would take care of her when he was home. He'd feed and water her before and after work, he'd take her out, and schedule the vet visits. I would just take care of her while he works. Im already taking care of the house and the kids and the cats, as well as working on my degree, I don't have the mental capacity for anything else. Well, that didn't happen. He forgets to take her out, to feed and water her, he doesn't clean up after her. 

Of course, I do all the house work, so when she pees on the floor because he doesn't take her out or when she pees on the rug or a bed when she sleeps, I'm the one cleaning up and doing the laundry. I can't take her for walks with a baby and toddler because I don't have enough hands, and I can't take her outside for long periods because we live on a busy road with no back yard. 

The issue is, every time I bring up the fact that I don't think she's a good fit for our family and Stella would be happier somewhere else with a big yard and with someone who has more time for her, my fiance loses his mind and it turns into a big argument.

I agree that a dog is a lifelong commitment and getting rid of a dog just because you don't wanna deal with it isn't okay, but he won't even consider the idea that she's not getting the attention and love she needs and that I already have too much on my plate to deal with her.

"G'day folks. Wondering what the collective Reddit wisdom has to offer on my current situation.

TLDR: As title, partner doesn't know if she wants kids, despite having three years to figure it out. Should I leave an otherwise wonderful relationship?

Details: You know the story. Boy meets Girl, Boy asks Girl on date, on date Girl tells Boy she's not sexually attracted to Boy, Boy is hurt but appreciates honesty, friends for years, hookup, start dating, move in together, laugh about our first date, and life is good.

Inevitably the question of kids comes up. Easy ""hell yes"" from me - love my nephew, my mates daughter is the most delightful terror, always wanted to be a dad.

She wasn't as enthusiastic about the idea. I believe her when she says her concern isn't me in any regard - just the PTSD inducing physical labour and permanent lifestyle change. She wasn't against the idea either though, mostly hadn't thought about it (at the time).

Her answer was ambiguous, and we were young(er), so I figured why not? Let her have some time to figure it out. Otherwise, we were absolutely awesome.

That was a couple years ago. The discussion has come up every few months, and I've reiterated that it's important to me, but the best I've gotten has been a ""I'm sorry, I just don't know"".

I'm feeling stagnant and frustrated. It would suck, but I would respect a ""no"". Her response has kept my optimism/niavity alive, but it has slowly descended into a more pragmatic, ""not wanting no kids is not the same as wanting kids, and ideally my life partner should also want kids"". And it's put a cloud over everything.

I'm scared to admit it, but I think I'm looking for validation. Would it be the right/smart thing to do to leave the woman I love for potential kids?

Currently, I'm in the process of dating a 25F with a vision for a long-term relationship. However, a recurring challenge has surfaced over the past few years – the difficulty of having anyone, be it close friends, best friends, or even my ex-girlfriend during our live-in period, **stay with me for more than two days in the same house**. 

Despite their admirable qualities, I find their presence suffocating, leading me to a point where I'm hesitant to commit to a relationship. Strangely, it's not about their behavior; they are genuinely humble and beautiful individuals. 

This has prompted me to question :
1. If this is a normal experience?
2. I'm eager to learn how others navigate and cope with it. 
3. Should I be concerned or worried about ?

"to preface, in no way is this truly bothering me or making me uncomfortable, I’m just confused and struggle with social cues. 


I (18F) have a coworker (18?M) who I am having a hard time figuring out. he and I don’t talk much, but we work in a grocery store and have worked in aisles together. we get along fine, he’s a funny guy and always fucking around with me. however, every time I’m even in his field of vision, he just… stares. during lunch break and I’m chatting with my friends, he’s looking at me. this is more apparent if he is sitting alone at lunch when his work friends have the day off. if he walks past me, he physically moves his head to look at me. 

it makes me feel very anxious, and I have to wonder if it’s because he dislikes me or if I’m being too loud, or if he’s doing it to fuck with me. I don’t think he has much of a reason to dislike me other than us being polar opposites. I’m very grunge, dyed hair and tattoos, and he’s essentially a small town poster boy. so going purely off stereotypes, it makes the most sense for him to dislike me. however, I have no idea what I’ve done beyond this. every time we work in an aisle together we are laughing, he’s always making comments and making me smile, and sometimes he comes up to me to show me something or tell me something. 


we’ve never had an actual conversation outside of these instances that lasted less than three minutes of us talking total. I’ve worked here for around three months now. so there’s no way I could have said something so weird he hates me or something, but there’s no other explanation I can reasonably come up with. it’s a strange dichotomy, I always get excited to see that his car is in the parking lot but then I get nervous when he’s nearby. 

I tend to just avoid eye contact when he stares. I don’t mind it necessarily, but we are both definitely on the neurodivergent spectrum and we are both very socially awkward. im unsure if he’s trying to get me to say something. should I ask why he’s always looking at me? would that be weird? is this just normal teenage boy behavior?

I also know that it isn’t a crush he has on me or anything. I’m definitely not his type. I am very bad at masking my neurodivergent traits and I often blurt out random thoughts I have, making me look like a ditz. I can’t help but think that he may just be looking at me and listening to my conversations with coworkers because he finds me to be dumb and it’s funny to him. should I just leave this be, or should I ask him what the deal is? would that only make him dislike me more? it’s also worth noting that before this, I was in an all girls school, so I have no experience with males whatsoever. is this just a thing boys do😭",I (18F) have no idea why my coworker (18M) seems to watch my every move.,18ojgiy,1703264195.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ojgiy/i_18f_have_no_idea_why_my_coworker_18m_seems_to/,

In all of this, he also had female friends but he never mentioned me, and if he did, he referred to me ""the girl I have been seeing for a while) even after a year together. I don't have a problem with friends of the opposite sex, and I actually think it's healthy to be able to have platonic friendships, but yeah... my ex definitely took advantage of this.

The girl in the first paragraph was the only one who actually knew about me and she still chose to pursue my ex. In all of this, my ex was pledging his love to me, telling me he wanted to move in, that he couldn't see himself with another woman, that I was the ideal wife.

Anyway... Once I found out, I broke up with him. This was the last straw, I already forgave him for his infidelity twice before. But now I just don't even feel angry or sad, just tired.

I reached out to his friends (they're a couple), to tell them that I wasn't going with them to the New Year's Eve party anymore.

So they kept asking questions, it wasn't the first time they offered a shoulder to cry on whenever my ex messed up, and they were always neutral, never took sides, just listened to me and supported me when I needed. I never told MY friends about our relationship issues simply because my boyfriend didn't get to know my friends that much (He saw my best friend just twice), and I didn't want my friends to have such a negative opinion of my ex through my point of view only. (And probably because, knowing my friends, they would have convinced me to leave my ex way sooner, perhaps I wasn't ready to hear those words yet).

Therefore, I told them what happened. Let's call one of his friends Earl. Earl is friends with the host of the New Year's party, Carl. Carl doesn't like my ex, he just tolerates him because he's Earl's friend.

I met Carl a couple of times, and even according to my ex, we vibed and laughed a lot.

So now Earl calls me and tells me he talked to Carl, who said he wants to ditch my ex, even take all the blame if needed, as long as I would still come to his party. We talked on the phone, and Carl, Earl and his gf all agreed they'd be offended if I didn't come anymore, and that they don't like how I have been treated by my ex so they don't really appreciate his company anymore.

I feel like shit because not only did I break up with my ex before Christmas, but now he is losing his friends, too. I know it's not really my fault, but it still feels wrong, and I, more than anything, feel deeply sad for my ex, because he is lonely, he doesn't know how to cherish his loved ones, therefore people leave him behind eventually.

Earl and his gf have been friends with him since they were in Middle school, so it's gonna be painful for my ex. One of my friends told me it's messed up and I should decline, and spend New Year's Eve with my friends or family instead.

Ps: yes, I feel bad for my ex because I think he suffers, possibly, from ADHD and probably something else. He texts other girls trying to get a ""high"" from it, because he's extremely insecure. I don't think he is a bad person, not even after all he's done. I think he is lonely and lost and I tried to be there for him. He now insists he wants to go to therapy and even pay for couple's therapy, but I think I gave him too many chances before and begged him for months to sort it out, now he suddenly changed his mind when he knows he lost me.","I (26F) broke up with my now ex (28M).

"Hi guys...first time posting. Okay this is gonna be a long one. My first boyfriend and I dated for around 9 months I know that does not sound like a long time but when we met (months prior) we had this instant connection. I just knew he was going to be in my life for a long time, I just felt his purpose. Later when we were dating, he told me that he went home that night we might and told his sister that he fell in love. We both felt this palpable connection.

Anyway, we dated and ran into communication problems and slight other things down the line that let him to break up with me with heavy intentions of getting back together. We went to a concert the day after we broke up after buying tickets that day. Very irregular stuff, not your typical breakup... 

This breakup was a year and a half ago and I still think about him everyday. I am really struggling with this and just started therapy because I am not healed like I thought I was. We would on and off hook up after the breakup and talk and have these life talks but he just turned into a completely different person. Heavy drinking, partying, hooking up with a different girl every night, getting into fights. It seems he used these as vices, at least that is my perspective.

 Anyway he texted my best friend on my birthday in August asking if she could wish me a happy birthday if she didn't think it would interfere with my day. At this point he was blocked on all platforms because he knew how much I loved him still and wanted to get back together but he didn't seem to care and he would just not answer my texts for days or ghost me. I end up seeing him the day after my birthday in August and he told me that he was still in love with me and how sorry he was and how we can continue on however I see best. We leave after talking for hours and have a long hug and say how great it was to see each other. We didn't hook up or anything which honestly make everything come across as more genuine since it did not seem like there was any motive of any sorts.

 We texted after (I unblocked him) and I said lets just figure it out I will probably have questions pop up because im still figuring everything out mentally and we agreed to hang out in a couple days. I texted him that day and he didn't answer until hours later and said he was busy and he didn't know when he would be home. I was crushed since our ""relationship"" was going around in circles for a long time and I was hopeful that things were going to be different that time and they obviously weren't. We sort of texted after that but I ended up leaving for school and asked if I was going to see him beforehand. He never answered that text and it has been months and we have not talked or seen each other. 

We are both home for our winter break right now and I am so inexplicitly sad and I really want to reach out. I know that I will probably end up getting hurt and Im not even sure that I love him anymore but I am driving myself mad trying to piece everything together.

"**TLDR:** Woman brings up other plans the day before our scheduled first date. Doesn't seem apologetic and asked to push it back but never proposes a new date and time.

I met this woman at a speed dating event a while back and we both indicated we were interested in setting up a first date. We exchange numbers and I set up a date (which was going to be tomorrow) and she says she's looking forward to it.

Today, I text her looking to confirm the specifics for our date tomorrow, and she says she has other plans (appointments, seeing family). She then asks if we can meet after the holidays but doesn't propose a new calendar date. I'm confused she only brought these plans up right after I texted her for confirmation and just a day before. She also didn't seem sorry that she had to cancel.

I haven't responded to her yet but it seems these are my options.

1. Don't respond at all and cut her off
2. Propose a new time after the holidays
3. Ask her to propose a new time after the holidays
4. Ask her if she's really interested or just wants to let me down easy.

Here are some other facts to consider.

1. I always initiate the small talk over text. She has never texted me first.

"Is there a word or term for this type of parent?

My parents got married and had kids at 18. I am the oldest child. They fought constantly and divorced when I was 12. I have blocked out most of the memories of my childhood. They weren’t horrible parents, but they were and are still emotionally immature; never super affectionate or loving. We did not have the kind of relationship where we were “friends” or had meaningful or deep conversations; I spent most of my time with my friends in adolescence and almost all my memories are from those times. 

Fast forward to today and there is an ongoing issue of my mom being a jealous, negative, selfish person for about the last 10 years. I can’t even have lunch with my sister without her getting upset and jealous we didn’t invite her. I could go on and on but basically she wants us to do dinners and concerts and trips etc. together like we’re friends- I don’t know the psychological term for how I feel but basically I feel extremely uncomfortable around her and am happier when she’s not in my life hardly at all. I cringe when she hugs me. I don’t know why and I can’t control it it’s just how I feel, and I’m fine with feeling that way. The more she tries forcing a close relationship the more I pull away.

Two days ago she and my sister had a huge falling out over this. She was giving us one word texts about Christmas because she was pouting we had dinner together without her. So my sister called her and called her out and it led to a major fight with my mom going down a rabbit hole of things that make her upset that we do. Basically just her saying she’s feeling lonelier with age (she is remarried and has friends) and feels like time is slipping away and she wants to spend all her time with us. 😑 My sister put up a boundary and said she doesn’t want to talk about this anymore and my mom keeps insisting we need to “hear her out.” We disagree of course.

"Last post was flagged?

For some context we have known each other for 6 years and have been friends for about 3. We have been together since June of this year after hanging out more and really falling for each other. Everything has been really really good, we honestly mesh really great together and have made the perfect team throughout this time, like literally. My last relationship was extremely toxic and so was hers. Mine was 2 years ago and hers was 4. The timing was perfect with us and everything has fallen into place since.

 Anyways today she went through my phone and saw a few females replies to my Snapchat stories when I’ve posted them. I’ve never responded to any of them even if they weren’t explicit or flirtatious outside of a friend of mine from high school who is actually a lesbian (never had any intimate relationship with her, strictly friends). I playfully responded with “ily” just bc that’s how our relationship has always been. She replied “ily boo”. So that’s that’s one. One of the girls back in September had said “I would love to feel your cock inside me” (also never had sexual contact with this girl, she is also someone I’ve known throughout school) which I didn’t reply to and I should’ve blocked instantly which I understand that was wrong of me not to. Another girl consistently replies random things to my stories such as “cutie” “hottie” “daddy” etc but nothing vulgar in which I also never reply to. A girl a few months ago replied “cum over”. Again, I understand I probably should just block these people right away rather than just ignoring and keeping the door open for further opportunities. That’s my fault and I realize I should’ve done just that. These were really the only two who have said anything recently that was vulgar or slick. Other people have replied but nothing like that, to which I’ve also never replied back to them. Not many people I snap anymore either so any other girls I would’ve been talking to are far down the list which was before my girlfriend. 

I also think she went through my old messages with another girl and is holding that against me because she didn’t like what she saw. I get it would be upsetting but all of the messages and replies were from before June of this year. I legitimately have not cheated on this woman ever and have never even thought about it. She is such a great partner and I appreciate her to the max so I’d never jeopardize that. She’s been such a huge blessing to me after everything I have been through and me to her as well. I have grown a lot as a person to be able to be in a relationship like this one and to really be good enough for someone like her, granted I’m still growing and learning. Continuing to be better which I want to be. I don’t wanna fuck this up with her and I really truly want to be an honest faithful man, someone to be proud of who others can be proud of. 

She came over this morning for her things, I was asleep on the couch and woke up upon her arriving but I didn’t say anything because she told me it would be best for me to not see her while she is here. So I just let her be. After she left she texted me telling me if I cared I would’ve been up and ready to talk to her when she got here which is confusing because I respected her wishes. She said she’ll block me now and to take care but has continued to text me. I haven’t responded in a few hours. 

I understand how she may be hurt and disappointed. I feel this is extreme as well as an over reaction and our relationship is worth pursuing as we can overcome something like this. Maybe im wrong for thinking that? We have not even had a conversation face to face since the incident. Texting only. Just want others opinions on her reaction and what I can do next if anything. 

TL;DR girlfriend found sexual/flirtatious replies from other women on my Snapchat stories, no other messages or snaps were exchanged. Not sure if it’s justified and if I really am deserving of this. I’ve never cheated and never had any other instances with other girls. Not sure where to go from here if I want to save this.","Girlfriend (F29) went through my (M29) phone today and found replies from people to my social media, is now calling me a cheater and leaving me.

"Im not really sure where else, or who, to go to with this but me and my gf have been dating for 7 months. For the most part it’s been very good however at the beginning I could tell something was always on her mind and I felt like I was being compared to her ex, while she never outright said it, there would be things she would say about me that always seemed like I was being compared. On our first date I remember her asking me about my past and when we got to her she just said she has an ex but she’s over him. I remember specifically asking if she really is and that I’m not some sort of rebound and she told me I wasn’t. However there would be times early on where we went somewhere or if her ex got brought up she would get really quiet and borderline sad. I never said anything because that was early on.

      Today, however, I was waiting with her at the airport and we needed to kill time so I decided to go on her phone and scroll through some apps. I got to the notes app and she began getting defensive saying “some people would think what you’re doing is toxic”. I got to one note and she immediately snatched the phone away. After some convincing she let me read it but warned that, “you’re playing with fire”. It ended up being a diary she wrote around the time we met about how there’s this boy in her life that is doing things right but that at night she feels nothing for me and doesn’t want to hurt me, stating she’s been hurt in the past. She went on some rants about how she doesn’t believe anyone cares about her and the only one who did was “that boy from 2 years ago, but did he really care?” Her words about her ex.  Then she stated she doesn’t know whether or not she likes me or is just lonely that she’ll attach to anything. After I read it she got really upset and started crying and telling me she does love me. But at the beginning of the relationship I always expressed to her that it felt like she’s in love with the idea of me, and not for who I really am. She always said that’s dumb and not the case, I’m afraid I’ve been proven right. It just feels like I was just someone who’s been used to forget about a past bf and used as a 1-up on them.

"I resented my mom my whole life but i'm only encountring my anger in these recent years. I was simply cold to her and did not talk about it. In recent weeks, every time she called, there was some thing to make me mad about her calls. I called her tonight. She was having a headache. I asked her to call me when she can and i have a serious thing to tell her. She insisted and i started to talk. Opening up, my voice started to rise and i started to point at several incidents and somethings that made me angry about her calls and gave a clumsy compilation of some of my problems with her. Of course, she cried twice and said that i'm the only one she has and she loves me and i'm the best in her eyes. To which i answered by saying that it doesnt matter now, after so many years of abuse. What really strike me is that i mentioned that she kept verbally abusing me by using a very very awefull expression that was pretty much creative and only hers. I did not mention this expression to this day to my therapist, bc of the great deal of shame that being abused in this way gives me. When i mentioned it, she was shocked and could not believe it. I plainly remember her using in under many many ocassion and it was not a ""one time happened"" sort of abuse. Amd only one of the many ways that i was traumatized.

Now the problem is that she had several surguries these recent years, and during the span of my childhood she was severly depressed and it is to some extent believeable that she might not remember it.

Overall, i'm feeling guilty for screeming and i'm even feeling guilty for mentioning a past that i know was not much sweet for her either. But i cant help with the fact that i'm filled with traumas from those years. Pretty much conflicted between my need to encounter her and break this idea that ""she was a self-sacrificing perfect mother and i'm a cold and ungrateful daughter"". I hate it everytime i hear her and i hate the fact that i hate it; i feel like i'm failing as a human being and i should have empathy and just get over it bc she had a bad condition. I feel guilty for being emotional and holding a grudge from someone with a bad situation. I dont even know if i'm being paranoid about her kind words or are they just her feeling at this moment and do not count till she accepts that she did harm me.
I'm just devided overall. I have no idea when should i ever call her again or how should i talk to her.
My question: how can i balance my resentment of her and my empathy for her situation and what she did for me to be able to resolve these traumas rather than hurting us both further more?

I can't seem to get my husband to take charge when it comes to chores. I cant describe the number of times I've sat him down and told him it upsets me he takes no charge around the house. This will typically be after he watches me clean the whole house by myself while playing video games. After these talks, he promises to take more charge around the house and that he is usually tired and that's why he doesn't think to do any chores.

"I always make an effort to get along with my husbands (31M) family and they meet me half way, except for the SIL. She's been with my husbands brother for about 10 years and I married my husband 6 months ago so I'm newer in the family. 

When my husband introduced me to everyone during a get together, I saw SIL chatting with one of his cousins in a distance and they were laughing and looking and pointing at me. It felt like I was back in high school. It was a bit nerve wrecking but I think I was able to keep my cool so no one noticed. I never did anything to her, it seems it was hatred at first sight.

She says things like ""you probably dont know what Im talking about because you weren't part of the family at the time"". Or ""forgetting"" to include me on special occasions, like only inviting my husbands to their daughter baptism or sending a christmas card with only my husbands name on it. Or messaging me (which she never does) on my birthday to ask a silly question, completing ignoring the fact that it was my birthday.

She does it in a way that no one else notices so its hard to react without me looking crazy. For example, during get togethers, if there's a circle of people chatting, she comes into the circle and turns her back to me, basically blocking me from the conversation. Or around the table, she never looks at me when she's speaking (but funnily I caught her staring at me several times from afar). 

I told my husband about it and he asked me if I wanted him to talk to his brother. I said no because if he does, chances are BIL will probably tell her about it and then she'll know she got under my skin. So he said I should just ignore it. I know he's right and I shouldn't let it bother me so much but it does. It feels so child shish and ridiculous, I hate to be part of this.

"so i’ve been noticing some odd behaviors lately from my boyfriend (M20). it’s kinda been like this the whole relationship and we’ve been on and off for about a year. anyway, i (F19) have noticed that he talks a lot about himself and i don’t really tell him about my days and stuff anymore cause i just feel like he doesn’t listen. but today for example, we see each other everyday and hang out everyday. he comes and picks me up after work and we go home or we go out but that’s pretty rare. but today i kinda just wanted some space to myself so i went with my friend and helped her wrap christmas presents for her family at her house. he texted and asked if i was home and he was having a tough day at work and i told him that it was gonna be okay and to not let anyone get to him and just focus on doing what he needs to do so he can get out of there. i told him i was going with my friend to wrap presents and then he kept asking when id be done and when id get home. i told him i don’t know because it will depend on how many gifts we are wrapping and if we just wanna hang out with each other after and he kept repeatedly saying “oh well i hope you’re done before 3” or “i hope you aren’t gone til 11 at night” and it shouldn’t matter how long im gone i deserve to be able to hang out with my friends for how ever long i want. he’s very clingy and doesn’t want to stay at home without me but we see each other every. single. day. 

another issue is sex. my past relationship i lost my virginity and it didn’t go the way i wanted it to so since then i just haven’t been interested in sex and i figured that’s okay and it’s my preference. but i’ve been trying because i would like to have a good experience one day but right now it’s just not working for me. but everytime we fool around he gets worked up and im not really in the mood and he scoffs or is offended everytime i brush him off and say im not in the mood. i told him about my past and he said (during the beginning of the relationship) that he’s okay with waiting. but it doesn’t seem like it now. i’m not comfortable with my body and he knows that but i just feel like im falling out of love with him because it just seems like it’s always about sex.

"I 25M met this girl 24F at a work conference, asked her out at the end of the night and got her number.

The past 2 months or so, we have been seeing each other on a weekly basis, usually once a week on a weekend night

So far, it's been great. We don't really text much except I am reaching out to her to set up dates. I am usually the one who initiates the dates and she is always receptive. We have good chemistry and fun during our dates.

Lately, I have been getting some signs that she is pulling back and being cold. About 2 weeks ago, there was a time when she did not respond to my texts for a few days. Turns out she was going through some work related stuff (whether that is true or not, I am not sure).

Last weekend, I invited her to my place so I can cook her something. She seemed excited and agreed. Unfortunately, I ended up catching a bad cold so had to cancel last minute. I said we should reschedule it for the next weekend (which is this weekend). She said she will have to check her schedule and get back to me. This was last Saturday, so about a week ago, and I have not heard anything from her since then.

"Ugh I hate using the internet for advice. My (40F) bf (36M) has told me a couple things of different things about his lack of sex drive and I don't know what to actually believe. 

He says he doesn't have a high sex drive/rarely wants sex but says he is ok to please me (I'm fine with this but sometimes I want the physical connection with him by having intercourse too.)

He also said briefly something about having a porn addiction but hasn't expanded on it. I've tried asking but I also tried to let it go and let it sit but now I can't stop thinking about how or why he'd want porn more than a woman who would do literally anything for him or with him in bed. I’ve tried asking him his kinks or fetishes and he says he “doesn’t know”—I think he knows but doesn’t want to share.

He doesn't want to go to therapy, I suggested it a few times. FWIW, I have an average sex drive and can compromise on frequency and intensity but I know | can't compete with porn. 

Are these two things (porn addiction and low libido) even related or does one have to do with the other? Or am I being fed some BS? I'm confused and I just feel like I can't compete with a porn addiction but I CAN work with low sex drive and a low libido.

"Some context. My girlfriend is a person who keeps to herself as much as she can. Whenever something bothers her she prefers not to speak up about it, but it also becomes pretty obvious when something does bother her. So, during these times I try to ask her if she’s ok and she usually replies that she is and that she’s just thinking about things. I try not to push it further if she says so, but she won’t be her usual self after that—stays quiet and only gives one-word responses. Being her boyfriend I don’t want to see her like this, so I try to cheer her up even though I’m not the best at it and normally it works after a while she starts opening up to me about what she felt and we talk it out.

Recently, however, me and my girlfriend were meeting for one last time before I go to my home city for the holidays. We were watching a movie when she got a call from her brother saying he was gonna pick her up soon, so she said we should stop watching. I, assuming it’s because she was almost ready to leave, agreed since I was also getting ready to leave as well that day. Now at this point I still didn’t have all my stuff packed, so I did some last minute packing while she sat beside me. I was also watching something on youtube while doing this too since it kinda gets monotonous and I kinda treated it as some kind of alone time since that’s what I usually do in my spare time. She left soon after but I noticed she was bothered by something again. Same thing happens, she says she’s fine and I don’t push further, but I couldn’t comfort her after cuz she was already leaving.

I didn’t know this at the time but it turns out the reason she stopped the movie and sat beside me while packing was because she wanted to have a chat with me before we go our separate ways for the holidays. However, she noticed I was watching something and decided not to speak with me. Least to say that this bothered her. We ended up messaging each other about what happened. After a few back and forths, I blurted out something along the lines of “Since that was our last face to face meet up I was expecting we wouldn’t have an argument, yet here we are.” I admit it was accusatory and I said it without thinking because it sounded to her that I was blaming her for the way she feels, which wasn’t my intention. I may have subconsciously blamed her knowing that it could’ve been avoided if she just said she wanted to chat. But she already realized that, I didn’t needd to lecture her on something she already knew. We agreed to take some time before resuming the topic. 

The next day, we brought it up again and I apologized for what I said. She then said that if I ever wanted to take some alone time I should just outright say so, which got me offended. I was offended not so much about me needing to say I need alone time because I would do that and have done it before, but because I had to be the one to adjust to the situation when she could have avoided it by her own actions in the first place. I already try to adjust to her sudden mood swings when she’s bothered, and now I have to be the one to adjust to her when I don’t even know what she wants in that situation.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year. Im a international student I still have to study full time , but I manage to have a small business so that I can pay for school , and I also bought my own house and a really nice car.Her parents were really nice to me at first. Still, I proposed to her last week with a 1.2-carat natural diamond, D color, IF ring. She's really happy with it, but her parents said it was too small. They expressed this not only to her but also directly to my face and my mother's face. According to them, the ring is insufficient, and they even suggested buying her a diamond band to complement their taste. 
When it comes to the wedding, they brought up money matters and insisted on a wedding with 200+ guests. However, my family has only around 20 people as we are not from here. They were not pleased when my mom suggested sharing the costs evenly between both families. The next morning, my mom even offered to handle all the wedding expenses, but they were still unhappy. They want my family to prove that I can take care of their daughter, and their reaction has completely changed. From being super nice, they now blame everything on me and constantly say negative things about me. They even fabricate stories to tarnish my reputation and my family's image to my girlfriend..

It’s coming on Christmas time and while I live in a big city, my family is from a more rural area in the mountains. I’m now very reluctant to meet my family since I saw a picture of myself from yesterday and I can’t imagine myself meeting them.

For context - I was always a chubby child but from 14 to 26ish I had been average sized and, while being at a healthy weight and not feeling especially ugly, I was always reminded of how I could lose a bit of weight. My family leans on the thin size and most of them are good looking, so it always hurt me that there were some comments that implied comparisons or competition - your cousin has lost a lot of weight, your sister is looking very fit, I wore much smaller sizes when I was your age etc.

While it hurt me I also know they care for me and while not being perfect, they have demonstrated support and love, specially my grandma.

In my late 20s I had some bad depression episodes and some burnouts (I was focused in trying to get to a more ok income, so I worked and studied a lot and at places that were quite toxic) and I gained a lot of weight. At the beginning of this year I was at around 109kg (240 pounds?) and have since lost 15kg (33 pounds?) but I am still clearly obese, and both the weight gain and loss leave scars and flaccidity…

 Yesterday I met my sisters and my mother at restaurant and my mother insisted we took a photo (I’m very uncomfortable with photos and usually try to refuse but she will throw a fit saying that _she_ wants a memory, as we were on a restaurant I felt uncomfortable discussing it further and let the photo be taken). 

After seeing the photo, where I can see the sagging and huge cheeks and double chin, I feel quite down and can’t imagine myself being seen by the extended family, I’m dreading the comments or possible comparisons. 

I know most of these won’t be said out loud, except the demands for photos, but the feeling of being judged and having to graciously ask for photos makes me tired in advance. Still, people like my grandma, who has supported me in my career and studies, will be there and with old age I kinda fear that I might regret not meeting her. 

Not sure if this is a “suck it up and get over yourself” thing or if there are alternatives. Right now I’m debating either just saying I’m too ill to go or going and pretending things are fine…

"Okay so it's a long story. In the beginning of me and my man's relationship, I was immature asf, childish, and I had a lot of bad influences around me. Like really bad influences. It was also my first relationship. I'm 18(F) he's 19(M). I kept alot of stuff hidden and I lied to him about many things. Things that were big. Never cheating tho.
And when I cut off my then best friend because she was one of the bad influences in my life. She contacted my man and told him everything. Basically karma bit me in the ass. I don't mind it tho because everything finally came out and I could relax. I find what I did so shameful and disgusting and I've been reflecting for a couple weeks now. I've improved in so many ways. My relationship with my family, religion, everything. He wants to give our relationship another try because we truly do love each other and plan to get married. In order to do that and gain his trust back I wanna sacrifice something. As in show him in a way that I won't lie again and I want nothing to do with what I did. Any advice? Like something I could do that he could respond back with word for word, ""This proves that you won't lie again"" and he already has things like n*des and my families contacts and I've told my family about him and vice versa. So those won't work even though I'm so confident that I wanna take this relationship seriously.
What can I sacrifice that similar to, telling my Arab family about him, changing my socials, changing my number, giving him my v, him having ndes that he could threaten me with since he has my families contacts. What can I sacrifice that he'll respond with, ""this proves you won't lie again""?

Edit: 
A lot of people are responding with trust and transparency and effort is the only way to go about it. I 100% agree. And I’ve been showing it and I plan to show it forever. Because it’s genuine Yk. But what I’m asking advice about and examples is basically a “tool” to start the trust up again. Like in the dumbest possible way to put it in like a “threat” hey lie again and blah blah.

"My gf said I’ll never make her finish

Hey guys, I need advice and help. I’ll have my questions at the end, we’ve been together for over a month now but I’ve know her for two. I’m going to marry this woman and she wants me to be the father to her kids when we have them but a bit of a story time story time:

I will admit I probably should’nt have asked so many questions but she told me that before me (being in a relationship with me) and before I knew her she had a boyfriend, they never had sex but she finished one time with just using his fingers (he was a wait till marriage type of guy) and the other night we were done having sex, I walked her out to her car and we sat for a min. 

She told me that she has once or twice before and it was this past year, in august to be specific, but she’s only really had sex with two other people. She says her body is weird and it’s hard for her to produce chemicals to make her finish but also feel serotonin and all that medical stuff, which I believe is true and when she did finish it felt like she had her period and it was like a waterfall. She was doing something before hand and it felt like she was in a fever dream cuz she threw this party and okie thing led to another her ex bf (which is who she left for me) made her finish with his hands. 

I heard all that and I was kinda sick to my stomach, I do have retroactive jealousy and I’m really working on it, but the fact that we’ve had full on sex and ive tried making her finish but to no avail and but her saying I’m not going to make her finish anytime soon if at all makes me really upset and sad and TANKS my self esteem. So please I need advice on dealing with all this

Side note: I’ve only been with one other person. And my gf does have really bad anxiety and a lot goes thru her head and hormones are all over the place when we do, and she also doesn’t know how she finished or what she likes and/or he did.  

Is it normal for women when finishing it feels like they’re having their period?

"I’ve posted here in the past and deleted it.  There was a lot of good advice and some bad.  Some people that I can tell have been hurt but I’m just having a really low week about this.

Long story short.  My wife of 18 years was in contact with her ex from before we were married.  I thought it was all fine and friendly.  Found messages between them about how they love each other and they are each others soulmates and all that.  He is very far away and I know they haven’t had physical contact.  This broke me completely.  I had so much trust in her and she ruined that.  

She apologized we took a timeout for a few weeks and she said she doesn’t want to lose our family.  We’ve got kids as well.  She said it was nothing and it was just like a fantasy like thing for her and it didn’t mean anything just all these old emotions because of their past.  I’ve pushed hard and she sticks to this.  I find it hard to believe though. 

Fast forward to this point now I know they don’t talk anymore.  The reason I know is because the end of last month he committed suicide.  So I guess that’s a win for me no longer worrying.  And yes I’ve verified he is in fact gone obituary and dad family and everything.

But I’m still so hurt by this whole thing and I don’t know if I shouldn’t be anymore or not. It’s almost been a year since it happened now.  And I just don’t know.  The whole thing changed me and my outlook on things and I can’t even talk to her about this anymore because I just say the same things and she says it didn’t mean anything.

"Hey everyone, I’ll just cut to the chase, I was sleeping in my bed with my husband and personally I’m a light sleeper. I felt him wake up and then start groping me, which is the normal to initiate sex between us, I was tired and not in the mood so I pretended to be asleep. I heard him eventually turn onto his other side and then get up to use the bathroom. Shortly after he came back into the bed and started groping me again, fondling my breasts, hands rubbing down my body, and then he started dry humping. He then rubbed my downstairs and went through the back to try and insert his finger.
       Like I said, I wasn’t turned on, he kept rubbing me hoping to get me wet, but I just didn’t want to, so I stayed pretending to be asleep. After trying to insert his finger again and realizing I wasn’t turned on, he rolled out of bed again and has stayed out since. 
       I feel a bit weirded out, shut down a bit, and it doesn’t help he was actively trying to wake me up, not by regular ways, but sexual advances that I could’ve slept through and not remembered.

 I have been talking to her for maybe about 1 week and me, basically being desperate feeling like I’m missing out or thinking there’s something wrong with me for never being with someone yet.

okay so me and him have been in a long distance relationship for 9 months now. He keeps on telling me how he doesnt even look up at any other girl other than me and that Im the only girl he loves and will always love. He gets pissed at me really often, he doesnt like it when I go to pubs or party or when I compliment an other guy so I understand and I even stopped doing it. He yells at me and cusses at me whenever I do something of such sort.

"I started to feel this way ever since I came back from a week-long overseas vacation with my parents. I still communicated with her consistently throughout the day, but her replies would take an hour or two, and during our night conversations, she'd often fall asleep without warning, leaving me hanging on read. It didn't matter, though. She'd doze off in the middle of our conversations, and I eventually got used to it.  
  
Before our trip, we had an argument that left me feeling hurt. Every time I asked her if something was wrong, she'd brush it off, insisting everything was fine when it clearly wasn't. I understand this is a common issue in relationships, but I felt resentful because I'd made a real effort to establish better communication, especially given the long-distance nature of our relationship. However, she told me my actions made her feel like I didn't love her.  
  
Early in our relationship, she once mentioned a fear that we might get too comfortable and lose the excitement. At the time, it felt like a heads-up, especially because this was my first relationship. But it hurt that she, of all people, was the first to feel that way. We reconciled, and she explained she didn't actually mean that. She was content with things as they were, even if she didn't have strong feelings about the relationship. The problem is, what she said still bothers me.  
I am not sure about what I am feeling right now, but its not like getting used to hearing I love you everyday and getting used to it, but more leaning towards feeling dull to any emotion that I should feel towards her.  
I do not know if this feeling will last, I am unsure if this is only a temporary feeling, or if this is a sign that I am not ready for a relationship, I feel like I'm trying my best to make sure this will last, but sometimes she make me feel like what I do is not enough, I dont really know. Im lost.

I told my bf that this is unfair to me because she has violated my privacy. Idk what to do because me and him fit really well and he respects me and everything,but I don’t think I can handle baby mama. I am still young and don’t want to be involved in drama. She is obsessed with him and it’s crazy. Should I leave him because of his baby mama? A part of me wants to because I have to now change my number and everything.

"Hello Reddit,

It's my first time posting a thread here, so I hope I'll follow all the rules, I apologize if I missed one.

I've been in relationship with my girlfriend for about 9 months. We've been mostly in a distant relationship, and I've suffered from anxious disorders, I think it is relevant.

At the beginning, things were great very fast and by far the most promising relationship I had, but it started to fall apart during the last couple weeks.

We're mostly fighting due to misunderstanding or miscommunication between us. Most of the time about ""mundane"" things, like if the dishwasher is full enough to start it. It's usually the initial trigger for our disputes and it gets extrapolated to way more serious matters.

Sometimes, I make an approximation or don't think about it enough before replying, and I give her the wrong information. Instead of apologizing and moving on, sometimes the apologies come first with explaining her about why I did that mistake. I try to rationalize, even though it is not requested. I'm not doing it purposely, but I feel too bad and vulnerable if I don't explain it.

That triggers her a lot, she gets very nervous and start repeating me over and over agressively about my mistake. I feel scared when she does that. Even though when I acknowledged it, she starts over explaining her point of view whenever I start explaining my own about what happened - because I didn't agree with her.

She tells me I don't understand, and I feel the same for her. Sometimes she tells me she perfectly understood what I say to her, sometimes she says she didn't understand anything. It makes me feel confused. In all cases, I feel she fails to listen to me. But more importantly to me, I feel she fails to be a little bit compassionate with my feelings, even though I try hard to do it for her. Maybe we both fail for that.

I sometimes empathize with her not understanding anything, as things can get a bit blurry in my head so I fail to explain everything to her clearly enough, but I try to do my best.

So we are usually stuck in that kind of discussion, and as I'm trying to move on and explaining her I didn't have any bad intent and ask her to do our best next time to understand each other, she systemically transforms the conversation in a power relationship. She doesn't feel satisfied until I admit I was entirely wrong and she was entirely right.

After trying again and again to share our opinions, most of the time she makes me feel ridiculous (""you want to make me crazy"", ""stop your little whim"" or ""you're a liar and you don't want to admit it""). I basically have to insult myself to make her feel like I've understood.

Eventually, I apologize without saying anything more. Sometimes sincerely because I'm so sad to be unable to tell her I genuinely want her to feel comfortable talking about our issues, but I failed. And sometimes unheartly, because I don't see anything else I could do to make the situation a little bit better. But in all case, I feel like crap and stupid.

For context, I suffered from serious anxiety issues in the past, and I think I am anxiously attached to her. I'm very available for her, and pretty much try to accept everything she wants. I try to avoid upsetting her at all costs, and even though I know it's a bad thing, I'm having troubles to do otherwise. When she gets mad at me, I'm having troubles thinking as I get scared, and it makes her even more mad.

On her side, she gives me signals about being avoidant and allergic to anything that could harm her ego. I'm not welcomed to say anything about that in front of her. She doesn't ask for much intimacy - taking my hand is already good enough for me, but it feels too much most of the time, in private or in public. She doesn't hide herself cleaning her mouth immediately after I kiss her, as she says I'm sweaty - which may be true but that makes me feel so dirty and unattractive. 
I'm not allowed to come to see her more than few hours in a day (and few times in a month).

I feel like I'm not welcomed at all. I dared to say no to her invitation once because I didn't feel welcomed at all, now she uses that to tell me it's not her fault but mine if we don't see each other as much as I would like. She tries to avoid inviting me in her house as much as possible, which I respect by paying a AirBnb, but she doesn't seem to look for any solution to that situation. Talking about her issues is absolutely out of question - the issue comes from me, and only from me. She get reassured whenever I validate her point of view and trash mine, and that makes me so sad.

Reddit, I recognize my issues. I've been following a serious therapy for the last 3 years for my anxiety disorders, so I think I have a good grasping about how my nervous system works and its shortcomings. It's fucked up sometimes, but I got a good understanding about why it happens. I tend to try to explain that to others but for her, she feels like it's an excuse or bad faith for not acknowledging my mistakes. Everything I lay out isn't rational as I share my deepest feelings, and oftentimes my perspective seems obnoxious for her because everything isn't logically ordered and perfectly aligned.

I'm often talking about psychological stuff whenever I see an issue in a behavior, and that doesn't seem to interest her at all - she's scared of being analyzed herself, which I try to respect, but sometimes I must confess it is hard for me.

Yesterday, I confessed her I needed her help. I asked her to join me to a psychologist and talk about our issues. I had to insist it was for me - and only for me and she wouldn't have to answer to any embarrassing question - otherwise she felt horribly trapped. I agreed with that, so at least she could maybe understand how I feel from the mouth of a specialist. I thanked her a lot for doing that, as I feel like it is a good start.

When I hide my feelings, everything is going well, as we share a lot of common interests and we both feel happy and in love at that moment. However, when I tend to worry about our interactions - for my own sake, for our couple and potentially for our children - I'm deeply worried for the future of our relationship and I'm now asking for your opinion, I guess in preparation for that therapy. 

Do you think that therapy is a good idea? Is there an alternative I'm missing? (Other than breaking up before it's too late?)

I'm looking for any help I can find. I'm deeply attached to her and even though I shared a lot of bad things about our relationship, there are good ones too. Please let me know your own opinion, I'm open to all point of view.

"Hello, I'm 24M. In the past 6 months to 1 year, I've been hanging out with this twin, 23F.

We used to hang out every once a week until one of them had to return to her country. 

Our ""hangout"" is super fun; there is no awkward or boring stuff. always laugh and happy, a little bit touchy-touchy (arm hug, piggyback, petting head, etc.). Whenever I post a picture/ video with them, people ask, ""Are you dating her?"" That is how ""fun"" and ""close"" we are. 

 However, I don't know how to handle the texting part.

Sometimes... they don't reply to my text for a week, and sometimes, we text/call for the whole week. I always try to think positively: ""Perhaps they are busy"" or need me-time. but... now it makes me really confused... is it normal? Texting/ calling for the whole weeks, and suddenly, the following weeks, they/ one of them disappeared? Not even read my text

I used to like one of them, but now I'm unsure how to handle this ""friendship.""

"I (20F) just recently broke up with my college boyfriend (20M) of 3 months. It wasn’t a very long relationship but during that time, we practically lived together while our emotional, physical, and mental connection grew pretty fast and immensely. During that relationship, a lot of pretty bad stuff happened pertaining emotionally abuse. My ex is a very straight forward and blunt kind of guy who can be described as a pretty big hothead. He’s been through quite a bit of horrible relationships as well as many instances of betrayal either with partners, friends, or family. During that relationship, I felt crazy, unheard, misunderstood, controlled, and anxious all of the time. He would call me dumb or “Such a kind girl with a sweet heart but doesn’t know how to use her brain.” Things of this nature. He would give me ultimatums of say he’s going to break up with me but never actually do it (There was one instance where he actually did break up with me). I always felt like I was fighting to keep him around as he had a tendency to bail whenever he felt like he was being played. He would say I’m too friendly (and I know a lot of people may think I was flirting with others or being too touchy with anyone other than my partner but that’s not the kind of friendly that relates to me. If I smiled at a random stranger who was a male or if I made too much conversation with another male while we were together or at all is what he said made me “friendly”). After I broke up with him, he was really angry and upset thus reacted that way. He would call me dumb and childish as well as a “bitch as hoe”. He took a video and would say that he shared it which pushed me to put in a statement with the police in case he actually ever shared the video. We essentially went no contact but he recently unblocked me on everything and apologized for how he acted after we broke up as well as admitting that he messed up during our relationship. We had a nice but short conversation and that was that. I didn’t think we would talk again because the topic of us getting back together wasn’t in the conversation. Again, even more recently, he texted me again basically asking for a second chance. We talked on the phone for hours just going over what went wrong in our relationship. We both made some mistakes and he actually heard me out and I felt like he understood the effect his actions had on me as well as how I reacted to different instances in our relationship. He took accountability for what he did wrong and explained how he was working on those issues. He also maturely explained his feelings and thoughts on different instances and it was nice because he wasn’t as harsh with his words as he was during our relationship. I can see the change in how he is now compared to when we were together. I can say we genuinely love each other and breaking up with him was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I still love him and I miss him so much. We had so much potential and this recent breakthrough just provides more momentum to a future for both of us together. Now, the issue here is while we were no contact, another man (18M) who I had a minor interaction with started contacting me through Instagram. I posted something and he asked if I was ok. I gave him a brief explanation with very little details that were pretty vague. From there, we just started talking. I did make it apparent that I had just gotten out of a pretty tough relationship and that I wasn’t looking to get into another one because of the trauma I was working through from the last one. I don’t trust people anymore, especially males, and I wanted to heal myself before thinking of going into another relationship, especially so fast and soon. From there, things just moved forward and I started to feel something for this other person. He was sweet, pretty wise for his age, understanding, considerate, and genuinely so caring. He was soft and thoughtful with the words he used and of my feelings. Whenever he sensed I felt upset after talking about our past experiences with partners or if he felt like I was falling into a state of distress thinking about my ex, he would stop the conversation to steer it in a different direction as a way to protect me from re-experiencing traumatic instances with my ex. I’ve made advances towards him as he has made some towards me. I did recently emphasis that I wanted to be friends but I also said that I still have strong feelings for him and that I do wish to pursue a relationship with him in the future. Although, with the conversation my ex and I just recently had and this other guy and I having this somewhat friendship (with the occasional flirting), I have no idea what to do. My problem here is I can see a future with both but I don’t know who is the right one to choose. I can see my ex is changing and communicating better with different issues. He loves me and I love him but with this new guy, I’m thinking I can have a good future with him too. I want someone who will be a good father figure to my children, do well with my family, show his love for me, and essentially just be happy together. My family already strongly dislikes my ex regardless of my choice to forgive him for what he’s done. He is the love of my life but this new guy could be the one I marry and spend the rest of my life with. The only downside to both is that they both live in different states than me but I met them both in the same state for college. I can’t and don’t want to be far from family but I don’t know how long distance will work nor how things will play out when we try to figure out where move to together as regardless one of us will be moving away from family to be with our partner.

"My gf and I (both bisexual and polyamorous) have been together now for a year and a half. We'd like to (and we are trying to) have kids together. We've been talking about it since about 3 months into our relationship.

Of course we discussed marriage and my take on it has always been that I think it's antiquated and too rooted in old churchy mindsets (and that getting married at the clerk of courts may be a better option). Later in the relationship I mentioned that I would be willing to do an old fashioned wedding if that's what she really wanted, but enthusiasm about that idea has since wained.

(Side story) she went on a cruise with her girlfriends a few months ago and while she was abroad, she texted me that she thought she might be pregnant because her nipples were swollen. 

So I encouraged her to get a pregnancy test onboard at the ships convenience store but she said they don't sell them. So I said maybe grab one at port but she said she doubted she'd be able to find one. At any rate, the next day she called me while she was drunk to chat and I was thinking ""why are you drinking heavily if you think you might be pregnant?” 

THEN when she gets home a few days later, she hands me a note that was moving and beautiful and the end of the note it said ""would you let me be Mrs T*******?"" I was crying and I nodded yes, and I hugged her. I don't know WHAT I was thinking because I didn't really realize that it was a full on proposal, and while I was hugging her she slipped a ring on my finger. It really took me by surprise.

At this point you're probably thinking that I'm daft. And yes, sometimes I am really slow to process or understand what is happening in the moment. But I just thought it was just a sweet note when I said yes. Especially since we had talked about marriage in the past!
So for a few months I kept the ring on my finger until it slipped off while we were camping. All the while feeling 1/2 engaged and 1/2 not engaged. 🤦‍♂️ 

So now, I'm taking her to New York for a Christmas trip (two days from now) because I wanted to treat her to a nice getaway during the holidays with a little romance. And one of her friends came up to me and asked if I planned on proposing while we are there. She said that my gf mentioned that she thinks I might. I kind of wonder if my gf asked the friend to put some pressure on me about it. Just a suspicion....

Now I feel like if I DONT propose on this trip that she will go back home feeling sad and hopeless about our relationship. But the honest truth is IM NOT READY TO PROPOSE!

There is ZERO thoughts in my mind about leaving her or changing the relationship. We really have a beautiful thing going and we both love each other very much. I'm just really conflicted and kinda feel like if I don't make a move, then she might assume I'm not that interested in her. Idk.... This sucks.

Please help me ask the right questions or say the right things.

Also please ask me any more questions so l can respond and give you a better insight into our dynamic.

I went to visit him and he got upset that I told him I felt sick too. He sent a text saying hes still feeling super bad and thought I should hold off from coming up for Christmas when I was already half way up there. I called him once i finally saw it and told him I was only 20 minutes away and he got angry that I never told him I was leaving my place (2hrs away.) He knew from the previous night that I was going to drive up anyways bc he asked for specific items for me to bring. I didn’t think I NEEDED to remind him I was leaving the next day.  So now Im at his front door with him mad at me saying Im going to get him sick with whatever i have (he got me sick actually but bc my symptoms are slightly different than his he thinks I have something else) then said I lied about seeing his text on my way up and I just waited till I was 20 minutes away to call him on purpose. The extra things I bought him like pajamas and cold medicine just pissed him off even more telling me I’m making him feel bad for spending unnecessary money on him. Hes being incredibly grouchy and mean all bc hes sick. I am torn with the psychology of his behavior. Would i be a bad girlfriend if I left him to his own misery over Christmas?

"I moved to the big city to study. In my second year at college, I met a girl from my family town. We got along well, smoked cigarettes between every lecture, and spent a lot of time together. In the beginning, we were the only friends because I knew she has a boyfriend in her family town.  
  
Despite this, I found her so attractive. One day we were at the party and broken the first boundary. I kissed her. We explained this to each other.  
  
At the next party in my condo, we lost our minds again. She said she had no transport to her flat and stayed with me. This night we had our first sex. After this, we were closer. We had regular sex and lived like pair. She still had a boyfriend, and I must confess it was a turn-on for me. It was a huge ego trip for me while she wasn't answering her boyfriend's call because we play together.

"My boyfriend (33) and myself (f-29) have been dating for about 6 months or so. We have a deeply loving and caring relationship. We've both been married and divorced and know that what we have is very deep love for one another that grows deeper every day. 

One slight problem - I mistakingly told him when we first started dating that I was bi/bi curious and had very mediocre and nothing to get excited about lesbian experiences in my teenage years. Over 10 years ago. I learned that I like some sexual aspects of women but I am primarily attracted to men. I dont know the term for that or what that would be classified as. 

Fast forward a few months and he taught me something new in our sex life- fantasy land. Fantasy land, as he explained, is just where we dirty talk and as he put it, has nothing to do with me or how much he loves me and just wants to act out fantasies dirty talking in the bedroom. He further explained that it doesn't necessarily mean that it needs to happen in real life- just essentially a ""build your own porno"". 

I was so down! I thought that concept was really kinky and I wanted to do that for him and I thought it would be sexy for me, as well. We tried it a couple times and we had a really fun time each time! It was very sexually satisfying. 

After a few times of doing it- he started to go against what he said and has let it bleed into our real lives, I feel like. I had a very honest conversation with him and essentially said ""I could not and do not want to do this in real life because I would have to disconnect myself from you to be okay with being with another person- and I can't guarantee I would be able to turn that back on with you. I may look at you differently afterwards."" He seemingly understood and was like ""well I don't want that so we're never going to do that- it's not worth the risk."" 

""Fantasy land"" is now turning into us dirty talking about threesomew- but him sneaking in things like ""but you would never give me a threesome"" or ""but you wouldn't really do this."" He even starts to ask who I'm thinking of- and just really wants the details. Details make me uncomfortable because I feel like it's a way to make it more real and who do I even say- someone we know? Absolutely not. This part confuses me because I'm a very literal person and I'm always afraid I'm saying the wrong thing. But the truth is- I really do it for him. I will say that in fantasy land, the details he shares are never selfish. It's always usually him watching me go down on a woman, us taking turns on him, me being in the middle, etc. He has never said he would penetrate and when it comes to him and the other woman, it's really usually him and I teamed up and she is essentially a tool in our play. He is acting out a fantasy with me. He seems to talk more about watching me with her and he always asks permission to do something with her and does check in on how I'm feeling sometimes.

I have told him that I get uncomfortable when I feel like he guilt trips me about not giving it to him in real life. He says that isn't what hes doing. The comments he makes makes me feel guilty because I know I wont ever give this to him and I deeply wish he would have gotten this out of his system before we met and fell in love. I feel so bad because I won't even entertain the idea of doing it in real life. I know myself and I have a very unhealthy habit of going from 0-100 and will cut someone out of my life very fast and impulsively. Mind you our relationship is serious - were talking future, family, kids, etc. so this isn't a casual fling for either of us. This could be my perspective and I'm open to the idea that my thinking is incorrect. ""Fantasy Land"" is a new concept for me. I am basically rewiring my brain to think about others in the bedroom, or try to, when I have learned that that's disrespectful and not appropriate. I've learned that I should feel ashamed for thinking of anyone else other than the love of my life- but he is encouraging me to think of others. It's a very confusing concept for me to wrap my brain around, to be quite honest. I will also admit freely that my jealousy and insecurities are in the way. I could never watch him give his love away to another woman in front of me. He doesn't see it that way- he says men can have sex with no feelings. I, however, have never been in that position so again- feel confused. 

Apologies for going on and on- to sum it up - is this a major incompatibility? I feel like if I really, really knew he didn't want anyone else then I would be more comfortable with it. I know he loves me very deeply- we really have a beautiful relationship. Am I taking this too personally? Am I letting my insecurities, jealousy, and fears get in the way of a fun and kinky time with him? The angel on my shoulder says this is healthy and kinky and just a fun way to explore sexuality, but the devil on my shoulder (created in the image of a singular horrific past relationship) says that he is using my sexuality as a way to grant him my permission to have sex with someone else. That idea alone hurts deeply. 

This man and I have something so beautiful- I can't even begin to describe. Is this something silly that I should just let go, loosen up, and ride the fantasy kink train with him- or should I be concerned? I will admit I have been very abused and I'm afraid I'm mistaking his intentions because bad intentions are what I'm used to. I don't want to ruin or let go of something good because I simply don't fully understand something- but am very down to continue to practice, learn, and explore those areas with him.

"Apologies for any mistakes made in this post as English isn't my first langauge.

When I was in high school 6 years ago, me and one of my classmates had sex in the bathroom of a waterpark while on a school fieldtrip, but since then, we have become friends and still maintain a close bond until now. Two weeks ago, I found out that he was dating my best friend who I've known ever since I was a child, and I was very surprised because they didn't seem like they'd be a good match, but aside from that, I felt really guilty but didn't say anything because I know that what happened during that fieldtrip is in the past, and we've moved on from it. But my mind changed when I visited my best friend's house today and was chatting with her mom about them dating (yes, we're close like that), and she told me that they've been dating for 7 seven years now, so that means that this guy f*cked me knowing full well that he's dating my closest friend who I treat like family. 

I've been thinking about this all day now and can't get anything done, and I don't if I should confront him about it or tell my best friend about it or just keep my mouth. I really wanna open up to someone about this situation because it feels wrong, but I also don't want anyone else to know about what happened during that fieldtrip or ruin their relationship, so here I am asking for advice on Reddit.

not even a month after meeting her i had guys dming me about her previous life letting me know she “got around” but that kind of thing is irrelevant to me she had a life before me why should i care 

then she started to get possessive, I’m very artistically inclined and need a presence on social media to gain support and get paid any girl (no matter how ugly) became a full on problem

which blew my mind because she’s introducing me to all of her guy friends which i was cool with but i can’t interact with a mail lady because I’m “too fine”

since then I’ve caught her:
1.) texting guys behind my back
2.) responding to exes and sending nudes to them 
3.) meeting with her old guy friends behind me back and lying to me about it 
4.) she knew who i was before she met me and knew people in the same field and lied to me

there’s so much more but over all 10-15 encounters I’ve forgotten some maybe i pushed them away to feel better 

and here i am… after all this feeling stupid because she cheated on me and you know what i did ? Asked her to marry me.

i blamed myself completely thought maybe i wasn’t committed enough maybe i didn’t show her how serious i was and now i lay next to her questioning if she even wanted this 

she always screams and cries when she’s in the wrong she’s broken 3 doors in our house destroyed so much things all because i stood up for myself since I’ve asked her to marry me she’s taken the ring off during simple arguments saying things like “i hate you”, “you don’t care about me” “fuck you”, “just go away i don’t want to see you” 

i am a very attractive man and would have no problem finding somebody else, i work hard, i work out 5x a week, i don’t go out unless I’m making money, no clubbing no girl friends, i barely get to see me homeboys i compromise and i feel the best making my partner happy.

(Reposting it here)

Ok I know it might be inappropriate, and I found myself wondering how I could end up having a crush on someone significantly older than me. He’s been my lecturer for the first semester this year, and classes are almost over after christmas break. I’m not sure what to do at this point and if it’s worth going after despite the age gap. I also really don’t want to put him in an uncomfortable position. I guess I have nothing to lose though after classes are over in januari I guess?

I didn’t see him in that way when we just met, but I found myself in a really unfortunate situation later on. I started to develop feelings for my lecturer. I thought it was just a short crush, but the feelings lasted for months. He has qualities that I like and look for in a relationship. My ex, who goes to the same school as me, was rather childish for his age eventhough he was 5 years older than me (I was 18 when we met, he was 23). You can check out my oldest post on here to see why I broke up with him and why it didn’t work out. His true colors started to show, long story short he didn’t have his shit together. The thing with me is that I’m attracted to people who are more mature - someone with goals, a drive, motivation and someone who isn’t scared to go against me and has his own opinion. I wouldn’t say in a narcissistic way, but just a dominant person, since I’m rather dominant and fierce myself.

I’m rather bad with guessing ages, and I thought that he wasn’t that old. I guessed he would be around 34/35-ish max. Turns out he is older than that, though I don’t know his age still. This week my class and the lecturer went to a bar nearby our school to celebrate the end of the semester. The school paid for our drinks. We all got pretty damn drunk, and before I knew it I was so drunk that I was reset to factory settings xD. I’m a lightweight, but I thought I could hold my alcohol  pretty well, god was I wrong about that. My ex was there and he kept hitting on me which was quite annoying, as soon as he went to the bathroom I was talking to a classmate about my irritations. My lecturer heard it and basically came running to hear the rumors lol. Anyway, we ended up talking for like a good half hour. He left a bit earlier than our class did. The thing is, when we all went home later on I was pretty fucked (and so were my classmates lol). I ended up drunk texting my lecturer on instagram (I’m cringing so hard reading it again… al the typo’s….) and ended up having a conversation with him. I wasn’t that obvious at all hinting that I like him, since I don’t want to make him uncomfortable, yet I still think he might’ve noticed. The topics were just school/work related things mostly. Anyway, he said something and ended the sentence with ‘darling’. I just couldn’t help but wonder if it had more intentions or if it’s just the way he talks. Today we had class and things didn’t seem awkward or anything at all, which I honestly kindy feared after that drunk texting mistake.

I was wondering if it would be inappropriate of me to ask him to like go get a coffee sometime, after class ends (and he is no longer my lecturer.) The worse that could happen is a no right? I need some advice lol.

I’m being rather specific but what are the odds that he sees this and has reddit… If you do happen to find this, you probably know who I am 😂 Sorry, I don’t want to make things uncomfortable for either of us.","I (F21) have a crush on my college lecturer (M36-40?), what do I do?",18ogxsu,1703257455.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ogxsu/i_f21_have_a_crush_on_my_college_lecturer_m3640/,
"my fiance and i have had a rocky ride this year... we met one year after i left my ex of 8 years... i was done because i cheated and things were never the same and that was fucked up he wanted me still but that wasnt going to happen because we had other issues... anyway a year later i started dating again and met this guy from instagram and turns out we went to the same primary school im multilingual so we only speak his mother tounge - people often think im weird for this. So we moved in together afer 3 months? and of course things were always peachy but then i went on to find out he follows this teenage girl that lived in his area and his half sister and he goes through their social media whilst on the pooper -4am'ish before work regigesly so the confronted him and he lied and i showed him the histrory and the. he was sorry but we never really got down to the age detail... so we were both starting new jobs and moved to the city from the country side. He stated doing this again the stalking and its always the same 4 or 5 girls and his defense is he just wants to see what happening in their lives? im like well then why at that hour? also since they are friends and not foe why not greet and have a conversation you know? i just feel like they are girls who he has either slept with or always fantasised about... anyway the one time we fought physically because he said im lucky and implied i dont work hard for what i have... and we were also fighting about the girls issue... i really love this dude by the way and he is absolutly amazing, kind, funny, strong, tall and protective. but that fight was bad and we opted to go for therapy while the therapy made me realise he really does care about me i also had some person issues at the time - i ressigned abrubtly, i was scared, we were moving house again! i had a bursary so had to study which was also stressful while moving, taking on a new job, studying and having s depressed bf at the time... it was later amended by him finding the best job! but i ruined it by having a breakdown... where his family was trying to help but i had already gone into a phycosis and my family had to come from another city to help me and this is how our families meet in this light!?!?!? anyway i was the pig in the situation as i costed him that job. and while recovering i had to pull myself together and start a new job this was all in the span of 3 months. so we moved again and this time not as much studying preassure... i picked myself up new job, hectic pace... and so did he but they were short paying him so he left, but now he finally started with a new job and since then the girls thing has come up multiple time he deleted the socials for a while but then downloded it when i was hospitalised. He later created a fake profile and then deleted it again.... i forgave him and we moved on one year and 3 months into the relationship now... i one day felt like nothing was going right for us and asked him if we can end it because he had no job and i was being stressed out at work and having to double check his phone every other day was draining... so he went to a different city we were over dor few hours then he downloaded the socials and started liking pics and stalking... he was gone for a few days and i missed him and he was gone on work as he works for his dad part time so knowing he was earning money made tings abit lighter for us both look i have no problem supporting us both but when i was unemployed a while back i stopped some crucial debit orders so we could have food... e.g my medical aid thats why his family was so dissapoonted too because we had a horrible govt hospital that said things like my blood had drugs in it? until this day i dont know how true all of that is since i was in a phaycosis for 5 days... so im a tramatised girl okay?anyway and i didnt know about this new account and he came home and said he needs to tell me he created socials to look for work. he also proseded to prepose he preposed and i said yes. He has since done it again only this time I thought let me screenshot it and ask him about it when he comes home - nicely because if we’re going to work through this then let’s try. Anyway he deleted the search history on the way home - I confronted him and he said ah I fucked up im sorry… I honestly can’t stand the hurt I feel right now but I keep on doing it to myself?

"Obviously no two people have the exact same perspective and things like gender and upbringing (big one for us) are huge factors but I hope you know what I mean. 

For context, we’ve been together for a little over three years. I’m chronically online, a worrier, and I care about what people think about me. She’s very much a one foot in front of the other, optimistic, not online, and trusting person. Although not a weekly churchgoer, she does care about her faith and I would say I’m a hopeful agnostic. I greatly aspire to her point of view because all that stuff sounds awesome! I genuinely would love to see the world through her eyes, and she’s by far the most earnest person I’ve ever met. We disagree on stuff because of our differences but I wouldn’t say they cause legit tension nor have we ever gotten into a fight about over any of them. 

I’ve maintained the opposites attract POV (although to say we’re opposites is a big overstatement) and that those differing qualities balance us out well but I’m interested to hear where other long-term couples stand on this. This is the only serious relationship I’ve been in so I don’t have another point of reference. Going back to my worrying, I think a lot about the future and how these things will develop but maybe I should take a page out of her book and live in the moment a little more. I know I shouldn’t burden myself with trying to predict where we’ll be in 2028 or whatever.

"I’ll keep this short and sweet, but in essence I discovered 8 months into our 2 year relationship that my boyfriend was addicted to porn. At first I thought it was limited to having private tabs of specific porn he liked- not that big of a deal, kinda weird but meh.

It wasn’t until I realized that it was a full on addiction and extended into basically every part of his life- his Twitter, IG, Reddit, tiktok, telegram, twitch, YouTube, discord, onlyfans, fansly, the list liiiiiiterally goes on and on. But it doesn’t stop there. Not only was it just basic IG and OF models, but I later found out that he would save his friends (and ex’s) pictures on Instagram when it’s a noticeable thirst trap pic. I found old sex tapes on his phone + he has a friend who does OF full time and used to get paid to run her DM’s and I found him consistently dming her after the fact asking for her content. 

Basically it wasn’t pretty and in the midst of it he had to undergo a serious surgery that required me to help out a lot and be in the supportive role, but it’s been almost a year since the surgery and overall it’s gotten a lot better- he basically deleted all of social media, I have access to anything I want whenever I ask (he doesn’t make me ask I just feel uncomfortable “taking”) and had literally downloaded an addiction app on his own accord, so for the most part I’d say it’s been better. 

That being said, now it feels awkward. It was definitely one of those situations where it was like “oh, I thought you were obsessed with me” and then it turned out he was just obsessed with women. He’s worked hard to turn that around for me, but in all honesty I’m just finding it hard to believe after everything. I wasn’t particularly self conscious prior, but now I can’t really look at myself. If I find motivation to eat healthy or go to the gym it’s quickly diminished because I feel like my efforts will be for nothing because I know what his friends look like. If we have sex, I end up crying later because all I can envision is the videos of him with other people on his phone. The biggest thing was for a while I was literally unable to go to work without having a full on meltdown out of fear of seeing one of his “friends” since I work at a popular dispo in our area. I hate feeling this way, and I hate even more that I’m not able to feel good enough to go back to normal especially after all his effort, so I’m wondering if anyone has advice for what to do in my situation? Say what you want about his situation, I’ve more or less accepted it as it is I’m just looking for ways to move forward for myself. :)

"Whenever we disagree on things he will become so stressed and angry that if I try and resolve the argument in any way he says things like ‘if you don’t stop speaking I will pack up and leave you right now.’ Or he will lock me out of our room and refuse to speak to me for hours. 

Often times it’s him starting these arguments as he has a temper and I don’t. Whenever I try and discuss things calmly the next day to try and make sure this doesn’t happen again, he repeatedly yells that he shouldn’t have to repeat himself and I need to accept his first answer and leave him alone. 

I feel like we aren’t fixing any of our problems because he won’t discuss any reparations after an argument, he just buries it down and changes nothing.

He’s very attentive to make sure I cum several times in other ways, but he honestly has the most perfect penis I’ve ever experienced and when he does get hard it feels mind blowing. He lasts maybe 3 or 4 pumps and he’s done, then can’t go any more rounds. 

Both of us went a very long time without sex before meeting each other, so in the beginning I understood it might go this way. But we’ve had sex a handful of times now and it doesn’t seem to be getting better.

I need some advice. Sorry this is so long and jumbled. I am completely distraught. 
For some background: I (22F) met this boy (22M) a few months ago. We immediately hit it off and started talking. Talking let to dating and we are around 3 months in. He has a previous relationship that was on and off for around 4 years and has kids with this ex. His family doesn’t like her and from what I heard (not just from him but others as well) she’s crazy and the relationship was pretty toxic, so he broke up with her. 

Everything was going great. I love his kids and they love me. I would help him watch them on the days he had them and he always complimented me on how well I take care of his kids. I was basically living with him at this point. We were intimate often and nothing ever seemed out of place. He told me he loved me first and that he wanted to be with me. 

Fast forward to the last month or so. He’s been distant and things between us have been a little rocky. We always would talk things out and be back right the next day but I could tell something was different him. Lately I have noticed I was a little more emotional than normal, so I took a pregnancy test and I am now 5 weeks along. I told him and it was like a switch flipped. He seemed more in his head than usual. I could tell he was stressed. I didn’t chalk it up to the fact that I was now pregnant because he told me he wanted to have kids with me. 

Last night, his ex sent me screenshots of their messages. He has been blowing her phone up begging to get back with her, telling her he doesn’t want me anymore. He told her he was going to have me get rid of the baby. He told her he’s never been so depressed because he can’t get over her. Told me himself he was in love with her. I am devastated.

I went to pick up my things from his house last night after finding this out and we had a brief conversation. He told me he’s confused and he needs a day to think about things. He told me he doesn’t want to hurt me and wants to make things right for everyone. He hugged me and cried on my shoulder. Told me this wasn’t goodbye and that he isn’t saying he doesn’t want to be with me. He just can’t get over her…

I just don’t know what to do. I thought we were perfect for each other. He talked about getting married and how I was his soulmate. I honestly feel like he was just using me to get over her. I can’t help but think everything was a lie and I am the laughing stock of the situation. I still love him and I don’t hate him for this. I asked him why he wasn’t just honest in beginning, he says I wouldn’t have understood. I feel like if he told me sooner I wouldn’t feel this way. I just want to curl up in a ball and forget the world. It makes it worse now that I am pregnant. The worst part of it all, is that if he decided he wanted me after all, I would give him another chance. My question is, has anyone been through this? What did you do if so? Should I take him back if he decides he wants me after all?

"bf and i had our first fight and we gave each other space and told each other everything we felt. one of the things he brought up to me about was exactly the title. 

“i don’t find it fair for you to put restrictions on our relationship from your past relationships”

my context is i walked into one of my exes watching porn in my bathtub after i told him i wasn’t ok with sex (at that time). i also have a history of being cheated on. i let him explain himself further and one that honestly took me by surprise was his therapist trying to support it. i have been in therapy specializing in trauma (twice to be exact: 1 year one on one and 3 months of group therapy) before so he knows everything that has happened before. his therapist tried to say it’s “unharmful” for couples because the idea is to pleasure yourself when your partner is around. literally wtf? i know he told his therapist everything (in terms of my trauma as we were fighting from communication) so i honestly have no idea on why she would describe it as unharmful. 

i was so shocked for him to bring up porn because when i first talked to him about it (before the fight) he seemed to be understanding where i was coming from (my history with it initially). apparently not because he didn’t like “feeling not allowed.” to try and understand him i said “ok even without the trauma you’re ok getting off to naked, random women online?” he went silent and didn’t see it from that side.. he explained that he watches it to find new ideas to implement into our sex life. i wasn’t going against him or agreeing with him, just letting him explain where he’s coming from.  i still kept explaining that i wasn’t ok with it and how i wasnt going to be ok if he still chose to watch porn if he had the choice. we came to terms of him agreeing to not watch porn and i was happy that he agreed not to watch it. 

after i talked to my best friend about it and she’s honestly creeped out. we both find porn to be emotional cheating, but i’m more baffled by his therapist saying it’s “unharmful” 

im not sure if this is normal? wondering if other couples have gone through this before and if they have developed some change to let their partner watch porn? although we both found a solution to this, i’m not sure if it’s worth bringing up anything else that’s related to how i feel about porn?

I (25F) have been dating a 25M for about five months. We moved pretty quickly and we dated very nicely. He would always buy me flowers and we did sweet things together and really got to know each other. However more recently he started really freaking me out. When I moved into a short sublet in a new flat, the landlord (who lives there) started hitting on me and making me feel uncomfortable. I told him to stop and told my boyfriend, who told me to get out immediately and offered to pay for a hotel. I refused the request and told him to not worry as it isn’t his problem. He kept insisting and eventually I broke down and took the offer. We had an amazing time together staying closer to where he lived and when I moved into the new place, things just completely broke down. I felt sexually harassed by my landlord and couldn’t cope with the trouble and I fell physically ill a lot during that month. My boyfriend visited me frequently and I noticed that he started distancing himself and becoming quite mean and condescending to me. He also let me know that his dad had been diagnosed with colon cancer and I really emotionally supported him during this difficult time despite being so unwell. But I also kept lashing out because I felt that he started to take his anger out on me. Long story short I felt really neglected and I felt really upset with everything that was happening and it was really affecting me. I felt worried about him and his father. One day he came round and I felt more comfortable with my clothes off next to him as my skin was so sensitive. We engaged in sexual intercourse but halfway through I just didn’t feel comfortable and actually started to feel too unwell to speak up and started tightening up. I felt uncomfortable with him choking me and it felt forced and vindictive. I also felt super suicidal whilst he was doing it and told him to be gentle. I broke down after and started crying and kicked him out and just completely mentally broke down due to stress. He then got angry and left and broke up with me via text and told me that I owe him money for the hotel he got me. How do I make of this situation? He also owes me money and I don’t want to fight.

"I’ll try not to make this too long, but I while back I was in an incredibly toxic relationship, I was always being taken advantage of, made to feel like I was worthless, and was only useful when I was around for sex or so I could pay for/buy something. My ex stayed with me for a while until she eventually left and we went our separate ways. After I was single for a few months, I went back to dating apps (Tinder/Hinge), to try and find someone who actually gave a shit about me and likes the same stuff I like, and to my surprise I ended up matching with a girl that is not at all my type and we just hit it off so well, and within a month we met and within two we had sex and everything was great. Her family is really nice, her mom and dad both treat me like their own and she has two little brothers, one who is 13 and another who’s 8, and they both look up to me. I can tell that this girl cares for me so much and would do just about anything for me, but it makes me sad because while I do care about her and we’ve had each other’s backs, I’m not as in love with her as she is with me. 

I’m a faithful partner, and we have been exclusive the entire time, but there’s been multiple times at work where I’ll see a really attractive girl and want to compliment her but I don’t really want to with my gf. Just two days ago a girl walked in that was literally perfect, everything about her outward appearance, and what I got of her personality seemed like my type; I didn’t do anything or ask for her number because that’s wrong of me to do, but man did I want to, and I honestly really regret not asking for it. Just the more I think about it, the more I kinda want something else, I feel just bad because she genuinely cares for me and has done more for me than any of my exes ever have, and I love her family and she likes mine. 

She’s going back to college in a few weeks and is planning on staying here and commuting to and from campus, and I really want to say something before she finalizes everything and I just spring this on her out of nowhere.

so my (21F) boyfriend (20M) got invited to spend christmas with my family this year. we’ve been together for a little over 2 years and we normally spend Thanksgiving together but this is the first time we’ll be spending christmas together. this is mainly because my parents have a big idea that christmas is meant to be spent with family. this year, my older sibling invited him over. 

i feel bad taking him away from his family for christmas and i know my family would be sad as well. i’ve told him multiple times that if he or his family doesn’t feel comfortable spending the holidays with my family, i’d completely understand. he’s reassured me that it’s okay, but i still can’t help but feel bad and i don’t want his family to think im pulling him away from them.

"It's exactly how the title says. Here's some additional background information. No throwaway, she doesn't even know what reddit is.

This girl (J) and I became friends through work and became pretty close, although now I know it was mostly due to mutual hatred of our job. I have an HR background. This detail will be important later. We would hang out outside of work, but it was always bitching about work, people at work, her ""abusive"" husband, and her actual abusive mother she refused to cut contact with. She's been to my house, I've been to hers etc. Well her nasty attitude and perpetual depression she made everyone's problem eventually got her fired. Although, I admit the company did kind of screw her over before she got fired. 

After she got fired all communication became how much she hated the company, the world is ending, everyone at the company can die etc. We stopped hanging out and communication became less frequent, not due to my part. I would try to initiate conversation about anything other than the company (getting her opinions for the wedding, how her job search was going, how she or her kid was doing, etc) but she would always round it back to that. I asked her if we could put that behind us and focus on other things, encourage her to go to therapy, but ""no one can help"" her, and eventually she stopped responding at all. I got pregnant (she knew we were trying and having trouble, we both went through fertility treatments) and she got excited about throwing a shower. I asked her if we could do a dinner or something instead of a shower because I don't have a lot of friends, don't want to invite a bunch of work people, find showers really really awkward and embarrassing (the games and stuff) and I have bad social anxiety only made worse by me not being able take my normal meds, and she said ""whatever you want"". Now it will be months in between any kind of message at all, it's usually me who says the first thing because I didn't want to lose a friend, and she'll say maybe one or two things then not respond again. I've tried to send her updates about the baby and when she'll be here, nothing. I've tried to engage with her for the holidays, nothing. I made a joke about becoming iron man during an infusion and she just sent ""???"" and I tried to talk to her about anything and she never responded. If she does say anything it's usually ""are you mad at me?"" And I've always told her no, I'm worried about her, want to make sure she's okay etc.

At this point it's emotionally draining to try to continue this, thing, and I don't want her in my bridal party anymore. I feel so bad about wanting to replace her (the wedding isn't until Oct 2024) but it's clear there is no friendship here anymore.

"Hi everyone

Basic details for the bot because this kept getting deleted for formating (Sorry):

* Me - M29
* Best friend George - F27
* Length of relationship - 10+ years

  
I'm crying and trying to compose myself. So please excuse me if this sounds like an emotional mess. But I'm entirely lost and I don't know what to do. And this sub is my last resort right now.  
  
So for context - I (M29) have been friends with Georgie (F27 and names changed) since we were teenagers. It all started on Facebook, but over time, she became my best friend - my literal sister. She's the one person I trust the most in this world besides my dad. And after dad died, she became the pillar of my world.  
  
But things have changed. For the past 6 months, we've hardly spoken at all. Any time I try to initiate a conversation, she just responds with one word answers. Even in a group chat with another mutual close friend of ours, she hardly responds now.  
  
I tried asking her today if we could have a call and her response broke me. She told me she was, ""Too packed, maybe we can try the group call? Toss it in the group and lets see."" That's it. After that nothing.  
  
It wasn't like this before. Even though we're oceans apart across timezones in different countries, we always kept our bond strong and in touch.  
  
We'd spend days messaging each other. Some times calling each other at random times, just to check in and have conversations with each other about our day. We'd exchange funny memes. Honestly, it was hard to go by even a day without saying something to each other. This was my constant happiness that's kept my world from crumbling.  
  
But now I don't know - I feel like I'm losing her, nay that I've actually lost her. And I don't fucking know why.  
  
I don't know if it's because of her new boyfriend -I know that with relationships, you lose close friends. If so am I just a casualty of this? For the record I have no resentment against her boyfriend. She's had her heart broken numerous times by terrible men. And this guy is someone who's a perfect 10 that treats her well. But idk if it's the consequence of the theory.  
  
I don't know if it's because I'm just too immature and annoying - This is what scares me the most of it all. We grew up together, but it's always been that I've made silly stupid mistakes in socializing. I grew up with PTSD and didn't know about it till I was 26. Largely the result of a traumatic childhood filled with bullying at school and a mother that saw me as a disappointment that was better off dead.  
  
It reached it's peak after my dad died and Georgie pushed me into therapy to finally get it treated. After which she told me I was less drianing. But over the years, I've leaned on her for emotional support just as I tried to give her my shoulder when she needed. I know I've drained a few times than I'd like to shamefully admit. Yet, each time she always was upfront. And after we worked through things, our bond was stronger.  
  
God this sounds so fucked writing this. I didn't drain her that badly? Or did I? I swear she only told me maybe twice in a year? And in all the other days we had happy moments. We laughed. We joked. We had fun. We opened up. We bonded.  
  
Reddit have I fucked up? Am I just a fucking mess destined to ruin relationships?  
  
Is it a combination of things? Am I just such a draining presence in her life more than I even realized - that she's better off without me now that she has a boyfriend who makes her happy?  
  
Did I do something else entirely wrong? I don't know.  
  
I don't know. I wish I knew. I wish I had closure. If at the very least then I could grieve. I could grieve knowing the only two people I knew as family are dead.  
  
For anyone suggest professional help - That would've been my first thought. But I've had to fire my therapist - her husband stole millions from my brother's business. And they both slandered my family after - not using stuff we spoke in therapy - but obvs confidentiality damaged there.

"Do you think my bf is cheating on me


Tell me if this makes sense. 
I (27f) think my (29m) is cheating on me (again) 

Put yourself in my(27f) shoes :

So your bf was acting weird with his phone. You asked to see it, as he’s had a history of cheating int he past. You pressure him and he wins  he his phone. Finally after enough pressuring, he does. But, he did the kind of tilting thing where it’s hard for you to see, then when showing you what’s on his phone he scrolls way too fast through everything for you to be able to read any of it. He won’t let you hold the phone either. You ask him to send a link to someone so that you can see who he’s recently been messaging. Someone named sky pops up. You try to send the link to the convo, but the convo is gone. He then proceeds to lock himself in the bedroom to clear things off of his phone. He deleted the contact “Sky” entirely. You start to get heated at this point, as who the fuck wouldn’t find that suspicious? He then claims it’s because he was talking shit about you with his friends, and he deleted that conversation too. When asked about this sky character - he comes up with some lie about it being a friend from work (he works in construction) and leaves the apartment. When he comes back 30 mins later (after you’ve finished crying). You ask him again about this person. He then tells you it was some guy asking him if he wanted to join the porn industry (like a porn management guy) and that he was offering him work filming with other girls and that’s why he hid it (mind you him and you do only fans - this kind of thing is offered to you and him lots through that). He claims he deleted it because he thought you would be angry about it. To you at this point, it sounds like a load of BS. When you ask to see the stuff again, you notice that he’s changed his password - you have an open phone agreement because he’s cheated in the past.

"I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for a year. We decided to visit his parents interstate. Mind you, this is a very big deal for me as I have traditionally strict parents and I haven’t even been allowed to have sleepovers prior to this but they allowed me to go on this trip with my boyfriend because they believed it would make me happy. My father gave a few rules before he okayed the trip, though. He said that we cannot sleep together during the trip as this will affect my boyfriend’s family’s first impressions of me. I agreed and told my boyfriend of these rules. He wasn’t pleased but eventually agreed. However, during the trip, on the way there, he was talking as if we would be sleeping together throughout the trip. I thought that he had forgotten about what my parents had said so I reminded him but he said that he remembered but he thinks that my parents are being unreasonable and babying me although I’m an “adult”. He said that there is no point in us going on this trip together if we have to sleep separately. I was afraid to argue with him as we are going to a place that is foreign to me so it’s not like I can just go home if needed. I eventually give in as I thought that was the safest option for me. We slept together at his parents’ house throughout the trip. We have now returned home and I just can’t shake off the feeling of guilt. I haven’t even been able to talk to my parents about the trip as I keep feeling like I’ve betrayed them. I have raised this issue with my boyfriend but he dismisses my concerns and says that I’m overreacting. He also often complains about my parents’ “overprotectiveness” but I know that they are just looking out for me.

"Hi everyone, 
This year my lovely dad got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour. He doesn’t have much time left and is a shell of who he was - he can’t communicate, can’t always remember who I am, can barely walk. 
I plan to spend a lot of Christmas with him but I find it incredibly challenging sometimes and so feel I’ll need some time away too. 

I have lost contact with my mum, so that time will be spent alone. I’ve been with my boyfriend 5 months now, and we are getting along extremely well and he’s incredibly supportive. 
He wanted to spend Christmas Eve evening with me and Christmas Day morning, the rest of the time he’ll spend with his family. However they are upset with him for changing their routine and upset that he won’t spend the whole time with them. My boyfriend genuinely wanted to spend that time with me and support me. I know it’s early in a relationship, but the circumstances are unique and we are already very close. 

I’ve told him not to see me because I don’t want his family to resent me for it, and frankly my emotions are too high to manage the stress of upsetting them too. 
I dread spending this time alone and I’m feeling so angry at them for not being more sympathetic towards my situation, I feel maybe I’m irrationally angry and don’t know how I can forgive them. But frankly they have a large family and will all be together whilst I’m alone, navigating my first Christmas after my dad became so ill. My emotions feel so complex and difficult to navigate. 

Any advice on how to move on from this? Thank you

EDIT - my boyfriend said his family would be fine with me joining (they didn’t actually invite me), however I’m struggling with the loss of my dad and don’t feel ready to spend Xmas with somebody else’s family. Also, they are approx an 20 miles away, there are no trains and i don’t drive so logistically challenging - I’d need a lift there and a lift back a short time later ",I (31F) angry at boyfriends (29M) family,18oeo1x,1703250909.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oeo1x/i_31f_angry_at_boyfriends_29m_family/,
"I have been struggling with this for the past 3 months and something happened which is undoing all the work towards making things better.

As a summation as this may get quite long, I had been feeling empty in our relationship, it came to a head a week ago where I said I felt like I wanted to break up. We agreed to work on it, as I do have some feelings for her and I never wanted to break her heart. She is a good person. However my property, some of which is very sentimental to me (and irreplacable) has been destroyed due to negligence on her and her mum's part. I am now finding it very hard to continue trying.

How it started:

I have been with my girl for around 6 years. She was there to support me when I was homeless, when I disowned my family and is the only other soul who witnessed the abuse I suffered under said family. She has loved me unconditionally for those 6 years and I couldn't ask for a better relationship when it comes to love and support. It had been near perfect until around 3 months ago where all of a sudden I began to lose feelings of affection towards her.She did nothing wrong, it wasn't like she started pulling back or acting different. We have our disagreements but never did I feel like she was being abusive, controlling or manipulative. It was just one day, that feeling of warmth I had towards her had completely disappeared. I initially just thought that it wasn't her, it was our living situation or my own shaky social life. I began hanging out with friends, seeing one of my non-estranged family members, going to events and socialising at work more. None of it helped.

So come December and we have been having some back and forth about how much time I spent outside. Nothing serious, she was just worried and I told her I was just trying to reconnect with people. This was a mistake on my part - I should have sat her down to avoid what was coming. You see around the beginning of these feelings I had seen a friend for the first time in 5 years. He had formally invited me and my GF to his wedding in his home country; she initially said no as we have had our fair share of nightmares getting to weddings, the tickets would be expensive and she finds their culture... problematic. That was to change, as suddenly, as a surprise to me, she had booked hotel tickets in that country and said ""we can work things out later"".

The problem was that I was still feeling this feeling, the tickets were months in advance and I had begun to panic about a month ago. Maybe the problem isn't me, maybe my feelings have just died and something is wrong with our relationship. I told her to unbook those tickets (they are 6 months in advance) as I couldn't rightfully let her plan that far ahead when I didn't know what was going on with myself. She asked why, I said I need time to think and went away for around 2 hours. I spoke to the samaritans as I don't really have anyone else besides her - what they thought about this and for someone to just listen without judgement.

We eventually spoke, I said I wanted to break up because of this lack of feeling. I hated every second of it, she asked why that was the first option I thought of and I was honest. I. Didn't. Know. I hated saying it, it was awful. Luckily, she made some good points about where it might be stemming from and that she would open to working it out. She saw the rest of her life with me and I wanted to see the rest of my life with her.

That was around 2 weeks ago. My birthday was yesterday, we had a great day staring at the skyline of our city from the place where I grew up. Her mum told me she loved me and baked me cake. I couldn't ask for a better day. We had an argument at night over something stupid, so in the morning as she was leaving (meeting a friend) I was still processing how I felt but it was nothing that could make me renege on trying. If anything it has gotten easier until right now.

To preface this bit, we live in a flatshare that is covered in blackmold. For those that don't know, it is incredibly difficult to get rid of as it grows within the concrete of the building. we were served what is known in the UK as a section 21 notice, which is also known as a no-fault eviction. Basically, it allows the landlord to evict you even if you have not broken any terms of your lease with them, they have not done this out of malice but to address the blackmold. It is bullshit but to be honest it is for the best.

We have packed our stuff away in bags. Today I wanted to back up some files to a hard drive, it is not the place where I left it, annoying but not a big deal. Started to dig through the bags until I reached a bag place within a bathtub. This bag has damn near everything that was important to me over the past 4 years. An £120 math course which I was using to teach myself, a diary I kept at my first big job (it also has notes from some of the top people in the UK and signatures from each of them wishing me happy birthday from 3 years ago), a jacket my very ill dad (non-estranged) gave me to keep me warm when I needed it... the list goes on. To my horror, nearly everything in that bag was covered in water and mold. All those acheivements after being made homeless, the only proof I had worked in a place that was important to me has now been destroyed.

I showed my GF via whatsapp and she said she will replace everything but I feel like this has set me back. I feel anger at her and her family as they were the ones to place the bag there. I still cannot find my hard drive, which tells me one of them moved it. I think the disrespect for my stuff, the destruction of my past acheivement which cannot be replaced and the general fuckery of last night are combining to make me feel like I want to leave and never look back.

How  should I go about broaching this topic with her? I am going to talk to her when she is back but I wouldn't really know what to say.

Should I even consider this a big  deal?

"Bf and I have been together for 3.5 years, there’s an age gap between us but it’s never been an issue - I wanted a more mature man and was the one that initiated things with him, he had never been with someone younger but we connected almost instantly.

He has not had an easy life - divorced with a daughter, who he hasn’t been able to see for 2 years now due to a messy separation and family court issues. He hasn’t found stability yet in his career and has gone through periods of unemployment. All of this has given him a great deal of shame and he struggles with anxiety and depression, and low self confidence. Despite all this, I’ve believed in him that he can turn things around - because he really wants to improve his life - and I’ve wanted to try and help him as much as possible to start living the life he deserves.

We’re long distance, but spend ~2 weeks with each other every 2-3 months. We always have a great time when we’re together, but his depression and lack of confidence means that he can have trouble enjoying himself, and enjoying our relationship. Sometimes this makes me feel as though I’m not fully appreciated - not all the time, as there are so many times when I do feel very appreciated by him, but it can feel inconsistent, and like the focus in the relationship tends to be on him and his issues and it’s not relevant how I feel. 

He recently confessed that he feels like he shouldn’t be with me - not because of the age gap, but because he feels like he is burdening me with his issues. On the other hand he always says how I’ve been his reason to live and how badly he wants to be with me. His lack of confidence in himself and our relationship really affects our time together sometimes and the way we communicate, because he’s constantly afraid I’m going to leave him. This is the opposite of how I’d like him to feel - I want our relationship to be a safe and happy space for him where he can forget about his issues for a while, and trust I’m here to help him turn his life around. I trust him with my life and feel our bond is so special - but I don’t know how to help him through his issues because nothing has seemed to work. How can I give him that sense of trust and confidence and improve our relationship?

"Pretty much the title. My girlfriend (23F) and I (25M) have been together for almost 1.5 years in a long distance relationship and both study medicine.

She had an exam two days ago and she claims I didn't support her enough the week before it. That is true to some extent, unfortunately I have developed quite a big anxiety problem regarding exams and university and sometimes I can't bring myself to study at all, so I wasn't able to study with her on videocalls as much as she would have wanted me to. I didn't do that on purpose, I tried to tell her what the problem is and also told her that I need to study too, obviously, and if I don't that in that specific moment, it is because I physically can't, not because I don't want to or because I couldn't care less to support her. Anyways, the day before her exam I still studied on videocall with her for about three hours, but what pissed her the most was when in the evening she asked me if I could study with her a bit more and I called her on 23 PM when she was already studying at 22 PM.

Honestly I didn't think she would have studied after dinner, since she was already relaxing herself on Netlfix before it and I thought she had called it a day. Therefore, I planned to do some things for my family and my side job after dinner and when she asked me to study with her, I couldn't interrupt in the middle of it. Nonetheless, I tried my best to speed up and get to her, but at that point she told she was already studying with a friend of hers and stopped answering to my messages till the following morning, after she successfully completed her exam. I sent her quite a lot of messages the whole night, praying her to please answer me and that I was worried. I set up a clock early in the morning to make sure I could message her first thing, but she kept ignoring me.

At that point she went on saying I don't support her enough and that she does a much better job at it, but that she will stop to do so since she thinks I don't reciprocate. She concluded that she wants some space and won't text me for a few days.

Now to the central point of the matter. The day after her exam (yesterday) I had a medical appointment for some quite serious problems in my elbows and right shoulder joints that could have required surgery. I had already had one appointment with the doctor (when he mentioned the possibility of surgery) and a full set of 6 medical examinations that revealed a bunch of problems. She was fully aware of the situation, of the date of the appointment and of the importance of it, especially because I practice quite a bit of sport and obviously I had to stop it because of such injuries. This has caused quite a severe deterioration in my mental health, since I can't take care of my body as I would like to and therefore I have struggled more than usual lately with my self esteem, plus sport has always been a way of releasing stress for me. Surgery would have meant to stop everything for at least one more year, plus shoulder and elbow surgery are no jokes. I was sincerely worried.

She has obviously forgot of everything. To be fair, I'm not angry because she didn't remember the exact time or date, since I had told them her the week before and she had to focus on her exam. What I can't tolerate is how she always thinks she's better than me in the relationship, in every aspect of it. If you say you're perfect and better than me at supporting, you can't f\*\*\*\*\*\* forget I could have needed surgery and that I have discovered that yesterday and then complain I don't support you enough. I don't understand how people criticize the behaviour of others and then do even worse. I have always believed that you have to first correct your mistakes and then talk about the mistakes of others

I haven't told her anything about this yet. I want to see if the thought casually crosses her mind and when we will speak again, I will ask her if she has forgot something and If she still thinks she supports me better than I do with ther, then see her reaction.

I would like advice on what I should do now and I you think I'm right at being pissed off about the situation.

i (19F turning 20 next month) have been in a talking stage with the sweetest guy ever (18M) for the past 2 months. we met in school and click super well - he makes me laugh genuinely and i’m 100% myself around him. he’s a good person and told me he genuinely loves me. at times i thought i felt the same, so i said it back, however when i’m in a less “lovey dovey” mood i reflect and realise time and time again that i have never properly understood romantic love and my perception of it has never been crystal clear, even with him now.

i don’t know if my past plays a part in my haziness, but as a child, my parents’ relationship was rocky especially because my mum was suicidal. they’re alright now but my teenage years (up until this current guy) saw a pattern of me chasing after toxic men and repeatedly getting myself hurt. i’ve also done regrettable things for the sake of male validation, which i now wholly regret. this has been the first guy that has ever truly liked me for who i am, so obviously at the start the validation made me feel warm and appreciated which makes me confused about my genuine feelings for him - how much of it comes from what he gives me, and how much of it is actually from my own heart? i am sure that a good part of it is from my own heart, i just don’t know if it’s enough.

sometimes i also find myself super caught up over small “icks”, especially the fact that he’s younger by a year and 1.5 months. and then i ask myself - if i loved him, wouldn’t i be able to look past a mere preference? why am i so hyperfixated on something so shallow? it makes me question my ability to comprehend what even solidifies a romantic interest.

he knows that i sometimes feel this hazy about feelings and love and is willing to take it slow. but am i lying when i say i love him? what ‘strong feeling’ is that when i feel like kissing and cuddling with him all night, and missing him the moment he leaves, if not love? i doubt its infatuation because the thrill has died down, yet i’m unsure if it’s love because i simply don’t understand what’s love. im about to enter my 20s in slightly less than a month, should i be this clueless? am i just nitpicking at my own feelings and not letting myself go with the flow? i don’t know how to navigate my own emotions.",i (19F) don’t understand my feelings for him (18M),18oe54t,1703249214.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18oe54t/i_19f_dont_understand_my_feelings_for_him_18m/,
"I realised this week my mother and my grandmother and exactly the same.

 I was raised by my grandmother until I was 18 years old and then moved in with my parents because my grandmother developed advanced dementia and wasn't able to take care of herself ir ro rememer what we talked 5 minutes ago. 

What they have in common is being angry all the time about the most basic things in the world. They would start to scream and curse me for a t-shirt I just got or for how I prepare an omlete or just anything.

Going out to a restaurant was a circus show every time. My mother would complaim she doesn't like anything from the menu, scream at me for what I want to order and we would move to a different restaurant to do the same. After 2-3 restaurants we just go back home where my mother would complain she just wanted to have a nice meal and we ruined her day for refusing to go to restaurant number 4 after she cursed me at the first 3 restaurant. Everything ends with me starting to cry.

Every time I buy her a present, she would scream and call me stupid, idiot, useless or whatever she wants because she dosen't like the present...or the cake...or the fact I don't want to stay and listen for her complaing as long as she want. My grandmother was the same... nothing was good enough, no matter how expensive. Last time I got her a new smart TV and she made me return it after saying I ruined her day with the worst TV in the world. On the other hand, she gave me 50$ for my birthday and I say thank you :)

The worst is I can't tell her anything about my life because she will use it against me ?

- Not having a master degree ? --&gt; You're a failure. Other people can do it, but you're just dumb and lazy.
- Got accepted to a master degree ? --&gt; You don't need it, you're wasting time and money.

- Renting an apartment ? --&gt; You're wasting money and you should live at home with us until you got married and have a child. You should buy you own house.
- Buying an apartment ? --&gt; You're a horrible person. Why don't you just live with us ?

The list goes on and on and on. Nothing I do is good enough and she will try to convince me to give up. Diet, exercise, a new job... nothing is ok unless it's what she wants for me.

And then she would act hurt because I don't wsnt to talk with her about important things in my life. I told her a lot of times I don't feel like saying her something if she will just complain, scream and make me feel guilty for it... especially if it's a good thing.

She never said she's proud of me for anything. Finishing university, getting a job, buying an apartment, traveling... everything is just an opportunity for her to scream and start a fight.

I'm tired and frustrated. Other people have cool, understand, supportive parents and my mom will have a screaming competition if I buy a pair of gloves she dosen't like.

"Hi there i am from spain so excuse me for my english.

So my girlfriend and I have been in this relationship for a year aprox. At the beginning i was very happy and i was very surprised to meet at last an educated,good, and not very much extroverted woman.

But after our last trip to south america, i realized that we have very few things in common. 
To start i am very passionate about sports, and i love the nature, these two things (and videogames too) are the things that make me happy and above all they give me peace.

Also, i am very interested in mindfulness, and in knowing myself through the path of meditation psychedelics etc, because of this seek of internal peace i don't drink alcohol nor coffee, never

So my girlfriend is the exact opposite of all of this things, she hates sport, she doesn't give a fuck about nature, she base her free time in drink sangria (kind of weird, we spanish people don't drink sangria, but that is another topic) with her friends.

I don't want to say that these are bad things or a bad lifestyle, each his own. But i think i don't have the same love in my heart for her that i had half year ago.

I am like this for several months now, waiting for these feeling of unlove to disappear but it doesn't.

So you all may be wonder ""why i don't break up with  her?""

And i think the answer is because she has a great heart, she is very humble, she is very funny, and damn  she have already met my family and I.met hers.

The idea of breaking up with her saddens me extremely, and i couldn't stand breaking her heart, she is a fragile girl and very sentimental, this would be devastating for her.

I love her but i don't think i love her in the way i shoul, more like a younger sister or my best friend.

Also i didn't mention, like in summer i stopped to feel attracted sexually to her. Although the sex is great, i don't feel that attraction .

My boyfriend and I works at the same company. He's practically my boss. We have been dating for less than a year. I love our dynamic. I felt loved, well taken care of and as a woman, it is the kind of relationship you want to settle in. Unfortunately, I'm getting paranoid and thinks that he's cheating on me. My boyfriend flew last week to his home country.

I was his third relationship and he's my first boyfriend.. he's basically my first of everything. I can't help it but to feel remorse and jealous towards those previous girlfriends he had. Sometimes I would stalk him on facebook and saw his old facebook post about his ex girlfriends and relationship but one girl really stands out. He still had their pictures together on his profile and most of his facebook post around 2016-2019 it was basically all about her. I asked him who's this girl and he was shocked that it was still on his facebook and I've seen it. He told me it was his highschool girlfriend. I found out that she migrated that's why they broke up. Since then I caught this weird and crazy habit of stalking her. 

I just recently found out that she's currently back to her country too where my boyfriend is. He haven't been texting me that much. It's been like 12 hours since I heard him I've been calling him and texting him continuously till he answered my text or call. I went to that girl's profile nothing new was posted but even stories nothing. She usually put some intagram story. I don't know what's going on I might be losing my mind. I can't help it I don't want to ruin my boyfriend's vacation but I wanna fight him cause I think he's cheating on me. I think he still talks to hi ex girlfriend despite being afar and being in relationship with me.

I couldn't sleep properly cause he's not picking up my call or text. I'm scared he's ghosting me and decided to leave me for that girl. It's been only 8 days since he left but apparently I'm losing my sanity he will be there till end of January. I'm so scared that he will cheat on me or find someone else or will not call or text me back.

"So, about slightly more than a week ago, she had went to a party with her uni friends, and as alcohol was involved, some guy, who was also attached but had relationship problems ended up touching her waist inappropriately. I was told about this and when I realised that wasn't just about him being touchy as a person but that he had intentions of cheating (idk if she was the target he chose or because she was there at the time), I was really upset and at around 1am I was qutie persistant about asking my ex-gf if I could go over and sleepover at her place because I was really upset and sad and I wanted to be with her to get comforted. I knew she was busy with some competition prep + some packing she had to do for some overseas thing, but I didn't plan to really disturb her and just be there for comfort. So i was extra persistant even when she suggested no at first.

However, apparently beyond just the waist touching, she was also kissed on the cheek by the guy and the guy also attempted to hold her hands and face and sniffed her weirdly, and when I went over, she decided to tell me which got me extra upset and I was crying. So she ended up having to comfort me when I was over there.

I have always been a really chill guy, who never gets mad/upset at others that easily, and this was the first time someone enraged me to this extent for this long. So I ended up being quite immature, wanting to ask for his details so I can tell him off persistantly through the week and wanted to make a post on a local subreddit in hopes he reads it because she wasn't willing to give me his contact details. Above all, I underestimated how busy she was when I asked to go over, as apparently she had cried while I was on my way over as she was already overwhelmed by the work she had + having to deal with the situation with that guy, and me being upset and wanting to be over made it worse.

She said she had told me about the situation with that guy, even though she thought I might get very mad, in hopes that I'll be able to provide her comfort when she was in need of it, but yet I ended up just being immature about the whole thing and making her have to pretend everything is fine just so she could comfort me instead.

She then told me one day after some thinking that she doesn't think we should be together anymore, as she was really upset at how I handled the thing (and apparently I didn't check how shes feeling at all though i thought i remebered her telling me she was ""ok, i think"" so i thought i asked and I always have checked on her in the past because I really do care and love her but maybe in my rage and upsetness i had forgot to or something zzz or just assumed she was ok because she seemed very chill when she was comforting me though now i realise she was just trying to get her shit tgt to comfort me). She said I made the situation more about myself when it was about her, and she was really upset about it. She believed that I always put myself before her (which I really dont think is true because besides 1 other scenario where I remember I messed up, I have always tried to priorotise her first and I quite often go out of my way to do things for her) and she said she sometimes didnt feel trusted (because i am quite insecure and fear she will be taken by other guys all the time and asks if she likes me still quite often even when she constantly reassures me so she finds it tiring sometimes and sad that it feels like I dont trust her)

She says that she thought alot about it and although she does still love me she feels that it wont work out and want to break up, no matter how much I tried to convince her that this is a one time thing and that I can change. Since then she has asked for some alone time and says that for now we can take it that we arent even friends anymore as she felt that its a bit hard to be friends again immediately after a breakup.

Its been about a week since then, and while I had thoughts about ""maybe its for the best"", I still really do feel that she is quite perfect for me. Yes I realise we are both young, but to keep a long story short, we had both fallen for each other 2 separate times ( the first time didnt work out because she was having family issues so she turned down my confession), and we hadn't really had any arguments about anything at all before this, and we agreed on everything that was important in a relationship, so I really felt that she was perfect for me. 

Yes I realise I handled this situation badly, but i really believe this was a one time thing. The timing of when she was super overwhelmed even though I didnt plan to bother her when I was there (because I didnt know there was more to the story about the guy at first), and the fact that because I was already upset when I went over and was further upset and saddened by the full story(plus the fact that I was never this mad before and usually never get mad so I didnt know how to control my emotions), I failed to consider her feelings and horribly handled the situation when I know I definitely couldve done better/wouldve done better given different conditions. I realise these are excuses, but I really do believe this was a one time thing and not something that is a consistent problem of mine. Yes, the insecurity part is something I know I have, but it is something I know I can change and put more effort into changing so it wont happen again. I realise that my mistake was really bad, but I don't think it has to end in a breakup.

She wants some alone time right now, so I was planning to talk to her again about a month after the breakup as we are both travelling soon and the next time we can meet irl will be about a month after the breakup. However, now I'm also scared that in a month, she would lose feelings and my chances will be dashed and so I was thinking about trying through text earlier, but also scared that its too soon since she said she wanted alone time and any time period in between either of us would be overseas and it wont be a good time. I really think she is an amazing fit for me and I really dont want to let this relationship go, but I really dont know how to deal with it right now. Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.","I [M18] messed up handling a situation and now Ex-gf [F18] believes that these indicate problems that can't really be fixed and thinks our relationship won't work out anymore, despite the fact that she likes me.

"(apologies for the wall of scruffy text, I'm just letting my brain do it's thing here and had to add this afterwards)

&amp;#x200B;

So to give context, things haven't been great between us for a while, we have 3 dogs together including a new 8 week old pup our girl gave birth to, Over the last few months in particular i noticed she was spacing even moreso, doing less around the house, being at home less. This got to the point where i have essentially worked full time, raised a newborn pup, and maintained the household solo. I have been feeling exhausted and unsure what i should do.

&amp;#x200B;

then what instigated the whole break up, around 3 weeks ago she went to visit a friend saying she would be home for 4pm saying her mother has made us a chicken dinner, which she will collect and bring back. By 7pm I'm a little worried (and hungry lol) so i text, the messages i get back are short, none detailed and dismissive. she later turns up with said Chicken dinner at 11pm on a school night. so i speak to her a few days later after letting things simmer down, i explained that i was worried (and again hungry lol) and that i found her nonchalant attitude concerning. I explained that it was quite selfish to eat the whole day up without fair warning, given that someone has to be home with the new puppy, she wasn't being considerate but also not seeming to care.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later I have work, I work 6am-6am but sometimes get to leave early, the usual arrangement is that i will give her fair warning, and then she picks me up from work (which since feeling distanced i haven't been relying on or assuming from her for the last 6 weeks). It was a weekend so she was off work, at around 2pm i message to say i can be finished for 5pm. She didn't see the message, so i tried a few calls just to confirm so i could make other arrangements otherwise. She doesn't answer the phone and this ends up with me wlaking 45 mins out of an hour long walk home. She then spams me with messages about not being home and not having enough battery to answer the phone, eventually calling me to say she was outside my work, she drove to meet me and we came home together, I just kept to myself for the evening.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day in work we've messaged a bit, last talking at 2pm with her letting me know she was going to her friends house, 2 hours later i get a message on whatsapp to the effect of ""GF has activated message auto-deletion, any new message will be removed after 24 hours unless otherwise kept"". Immediately i found this just too suspicious and called her out on it, she explained that she was just messing about on her phone and doesn't know how how she has done it, i explained that i believe she was testing the feature for other purposes not realising i would get a notification about it. when we meet later that evening i didn't bring it up at all, In my mind someone with something to hide would avoid the subject at all costs, whereas an innocent person would be angry and offended by an accusation of suspicious behaviour. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following day i went to work, on the way home i couldn't help myself but ask about it, she claims she has no idea how it happened. She explained that i over anaylse things and easily get myself convinced of things, sayng I am paranoid. I brought up the battery thing and she said her phone isn't charging well. I asked her to open her battery settings so i could check if theres any obvious reason she is having issues (I'd like to make the point that i have NEVER despite always knowing her password, i have never checked her phone, or even asked her to). On unlocking her phone i noticed the usual pattern lock was gone and now had a passcode screen instead, she brought up her battery settings for me, i went on 7 day history and saw that when she claimed to have ""too little battery to answer the phone"" she was actually at \~50%. she said her phone was lying and went to her mothers (We buy and cook as 3 living around the corner from eachother). she said we will speak when she gets back, on returning she immediately diverted the issues i had and went to ""i've spoke with my mother and I'm not happy"". I felt it was very convenient timing to have have this epiphany now that she had been caught lying.

&amp;#x200B;

I explained here that regardless of what she tells me now, i don't trust what she would tell me, so either somethings is definitely going on and i need to end the relationship, or it was going to be a lie leading to the same outcome as far as i was concerned. so now we have been split for 4 days, but given the time of Year, our joint tenancy, and duty of care to our dogs we weren't going to rush our way out. my usual rule on this stuff is that a relationship ending is best with complete seperation and no contact, but this time it isn't really a valid option.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really worried about this next month or two, during the breakup she went from ""I'm not happy"" to telling me the real reason she didn't answer the phone ""didn't want to"" and slowly it became about how we may just need a break and lets see how things go. she has had panic attacks in the night and been crying alot, which again i feel like i can't really be dealing with for my own well being. what i really need is a bit of back up that this is the right outcome and I'm not crazy, i feela burden of guilt over the whole situation despite feeling like i've been wronged and need to do this for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone offer a word of advice? It's a 7 year relationship, co-habitated for 5 years, it's going to be hard to walk away from but right now my head space is kinda fucked, we're supposed to be having a talk later as she is currently shopping with her mum upset about us, i know what angle she wants, She's gonna come at me with the we can make it work etc. Any honest opinions on this would be greatly appreciated?

&amp;#x200B;

Incase it's relevant, I'm a very introverted 31 year old man, i believe in mutual repect and honesty above all else, I'm quite traditionally minded, have never cheated on anyone on my whole life, and until i learn otherwise i have never been cheated on either

"I (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) went out clubbing with our friends the other day. He hates the club we often go to and get’s annoyed but tags along because everyone else goes. We were having a fun night when he suddenly disappeared to go drink alone at a bar close by. After he came back we were both pretty drunk, but I was close to blackout and can only remember bits of the night. Apparently at one point he chocked me out of anger. I was being annoying to him all night, disappearing/not answering texts/drinking too much, and when he finally found me and wanted us to leave I said no and tried to go dance with my friend. I think this is when he chocked me. Problem is I don’t remember it happening, I only remember dissociating and staring back at the security guard eyeing us from behind him. Then I remember my bf crying and telling me he chocked me and I was just confused and tried to tell him it was ok. I agreed to leave and we moved on. 

Now I’m feeling incredibly anxious. I just texted him to tell me what happened that led to that because I think the unknowing is fuelling the anxiety. I’m very confused on why he would do this since he is a very calm and sweet person. A pacifist who I’ve never seen get angry at anyone.

In case you couldn’t tell by the title, my mom was a teen mom. This might have to do with her behavior. Or she might just be a shitty person, I honestly don’t know. 

Long story short, she is terrible. Especially lately, I can’t find redeemable qualities anymore. She doesn’t respect boundaries, she only has negative commentary, she is a hypocrite. What’s worse is my sisters, and one in particular, are turning into her. I literally cannot stand being around them anymore. 

Just this week alone:
- my daughter is about to start kindergarten next year. We’re looking into schools, including the one my sisters went to. We were waitlisted. She offered to call to try to bump us up, it’s a religious school and at the bottom of my husband’s list. HE told her no, HE told her we were still looking. She agreed. Then we got a text message the next day that she called the school principal and needed to know ASAP if we were sending our daughter there, then SHE got mad  that we didn’t immediately make a decision when we told her, and she agreed, she wouldn’t make any calls.

- it was my daughter’s Christmas recital at school. They came over the day before we told them it was cookies AND carols. The day of we send videos. She asks why we didn’t tell her my daughter had a show and how she was probably sad her family wasn’t there to see her. My husband told her we did tell her and my stepdad even acknowledged he couldn’t go because of work meetings

- it’s my stepdad’s birthday so we went over. In relation to the point above, the first thing she does is ask my 4 year old why SHE didn’t invite them to her show. Why are you guilt tripping my 4 year old. Leave her the alone.

- for Christmas, my stepdad’s family comes over and stays a few days. She flips out because there’s a snow storm supposedly on Tuesday and she wants them out by Tuesday. She freaks on him, ruining his birthday, telling him to call them all and tell them they need to leave Tuesday or before the storm. Some of them of coming from multiple states away and he hardly sees them. This was also done yesterday on his birthday.

- in relation to his family, she has made my sisters despise his family. They hate their cousins and likewise their cousins now don’t like them. It’s now weirdly tense as all the families don’t like my mom. My mom literally feels this is because they are “jealous of us”. My sisters are absorbing this “better than other people” attitude. 

- my daughter asked to sleepover. She was playing on the switch. Pokemon. She doesn’t know what she’s doing, but she likes catching them and giving them names. She had been playing maybe half an hour supervised and I told her she could stay, but had to give us the switch to take home. My mom said good, she hates those video games and rolled her eyes. This is the same person that literally left me on the computer UNSUPERVISED for HOURS. The same person who when I need to go to the office and watches my daughter lets her play MY TALKING ANGELA for HOURS on her phone. But that’s okay only when she does it. 

These examples were all this week alone. Other examples include my whole life of having my appearance berated, most recently commenting on my weight gain after having my second child and how my husband is so kind to stay with me because hers would’ve left her. Asking how I feel confident hanging out with my skinny friends and if I ever wonder if my husband is thinking about them. She is doing the same thing to my other sister who struggles with her weight and absolutely crushing her self esteem. It’s painful to watch. I can’t remember the last time she actually said something kind to me. It’s always passive aggressive negative comments. 

TLDR: I cannot stand my mom anymore. She is getting worse with age and I feel like I need to cut her off, but I don’t know what to do or say. I don’t know if it’s appropriate or an overreaction on my part. My one sister in particular is turning into her clone and I’m starting to dislike being around her too.

"There's this boy in my uni classes who's gentle and sweet, really smart, and we have a lot in common. I'm talking similar interests, hobbies and humour. Sometimes we'd accidentally match outfits too (crazy!). I love when he talks about anything. He's kind to others and helps me put things away and offers to fill people's waterbottles and talks to people who sit by themselves and answers the lecturer's questions when others don't. I notice these seemingly micro actions because I like to do these too - it's so nice to see because it feels like I cloned generosity and there's more to share now.

But when I'm near him, I'd get flustered, sweaty, talk super fast and I'd forget what to say and what to think when he's around. I don't think he knows I've felt this way because he waits so calmly for my social blunders to be over then proceeds as normal. It's like my consciousness fades away and my body runs on muscle memory just so I can talk to him. It sounds romantic but it's frustrating because I just want to talk to him normally.

If he's not in the room, he'll occupy my mind. I'd be giggling because he's in everything I think about - from morning to night. It's like being poisoned with honey.

I want to like him, but I don't feel like I deserve to. Here's why:

!! I'm working on it, but I don't think I'm as effortlessly good looking like he is, and we have the same interests but our gap in skill is insanely, insanely wide - it makes me feel terribly insecure and I want to hide away to improve myself. I feel so naive and stupid thinking that I have a chance with him. When I feel the physical symptoms of falling in love, it makes me feel frustrated because nothing gets done - as in, I want to continue writing my essay already but this guy is stuck in my head like a song. So annoying! 

I might regret this but it feels right to let go of someone who's brilliance is quite out of reach. I've chosen to actively avoid him so I don't fall any more, and I'm limiting our conversation topics so he won't fall for me either - I've deducted that: he cannot love me, if he doesn't know what there is to love.

"I (M19) was with my ex boyfriend (M18) for 2 years. We met in college and the first year of our relationship was perfect. Things slowly started getting complicated due to him never wanting me to see other people or have a life outside of him, causing me to feel rather isolated from my friends. We spent every second of available time together and I don’t think I spent a weekend alone in all the time I dated him. Whenever I would hang out with my friends and he wasn’t there, I’d receive messages from him saying “it looks like you’re having so much fun without me, should I even bother coming over?” and long paragraphs detailing how lonely he was. For context, he had one friend from his old school but ended up adopting my own friends because of how little he had himself. 

Long story short, we both went to the same uni but he dropped out after a week because he didn’t like it. We called every few days and he came down to visit me a few times but whenever I’d go out with my new friends and have a good time, I’d start getting the angry and upset messages again. I opened up about this to my new friends and they made me realise how abnormal and intense the relationship actually was and how uncomfortable I was in it. On the 8th October, I broke up with my ex via a phone call. I didn’t have the money to make the train journey to where he lived and it felt unfair to make him come all the way to me just for me to break up with him. It was a very long phone call where I expressed all my thoughts and feelings. He initially kept saying “please don’t break up with me, this has come out of nowhere” but then moved onto saying “I can change, tell me what you need me to do”. 

Two weeks later, we met up in person and he told me he wanted us to get back together. I told him this would never happen but I would love to stay friends and meet up over the Christmas break. 

Roughly a month after breaking up with my ex, I met my boyfriend (M20). I did not tell my ex about him but I assume he knows because my uni friends often post photos which include me and him.

i feel so guilty but also so much heartache. i’ve been dating my boyfriend for over 4 years but we’ve had so many ups and downs. we’re at a point of our relationship where it is healthy and it’s clear how much we love each other. we were in high school when we first started talking and now we’ve grown together in college. it’s not that i don’t love him, i just don’t think i’m IN love with him right now. i cant tell if i need to focus on myself or if i’m just having these doubts but i know he doesn’t deserve this. he doesn’t really understand these feelings and i really don’t know what to do. this is my first love and maybe i’m thinking i’m not experienced enough yet. i don’t know if this is the right choice. will it be stupid for me to end things? or do i be selfish and do it for myself?",i f19 probably needs to but can’t leave my boyfriend m19,18odgnu,1703246842.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18odgnu/i_f19_probably_needs_to_but_cant_leave_my/,
"Let’s call him S. S and I have been obsessed with each other since almost last 5 years,I don’t know what has suddenly changed but one day all of a sudden he doesn’t call for 12 hours so I get a bit hurt and tell him that you could have given a call and checked on me right (earlier when I used to get mad I din share why I was hence I have learnt to be more direct) and he’s like,I don’t know I don’t get that feeling,that drive to call and ask. 
I was hurt because I was having a really bad ear pain and he did not even check on me :/

So I tell S do you even love me to which he says I love you but I don’t know i don’t have that drive or desire to talk,I don’t feel that when we’re together but I do so when we’re not close. 
So I asked S what he wants and he’s like I need some time. I was like understandable,I felt bad but I understood that we’ve been together since a long time and it’s humane to feel monotonous.

But as I’m trying to get used to the process,he tells me on the first day he’s taking it as character development situation,then on the second or third day he’s calling me baby while we were taking general updates about each other so and then he again told me I don’t feel “attracted” to talk to you. 
 I din call him at all the next day,din reply to his texts because I felt he thinks he’s doing a favour by talking to me and same night he texts to me when he’s generally playing games(doesn’t happen)

"Hi again! My original post about this matter was about a month ago. It honestly didn't receive so much attention, but I thought to update anyways, as there aren't really many posts here about the same or similar thing. I also needed to create a new throwaway account, as per the rules, so I have done that. If you haven't seen the original post, search the title.



So, I told my mother. As I thought was possible, she wasn't absolutely surprised. I asked her if we could sit in the living room and talk for a few minutes. I started the conversation as ""So, I think you know that Amy and I frequently communicate and see each other outside of interactions with you two and such."" She immediately asked ""Do you like Amy or something? I can tell when somebody makes you feel that way."" It was quite easy after that. I told her that ""Yes..a lot. In fact, I really, really like her. And she likes me too. We're in a relationship. There's no reason for me to beat around the bush here, I suppose."" She looked only slightly stunned before she said like ""I'll probably need to sit on this for a bit, to be honest, but I'm happy for you two if you two are happy and if the relationship is a healthy one."" A comment from the previous post inspired me to say to her ""I thought that you probably needed to know that I'm more than kissing Amy and she likes it a lot."" My mom just laughed and said she didn't need to hear the details. I told her that I hope her and Amy are still just as good friends as before. She assured me that nothing is held against her and that we're simply two adults who really like each other. In the time since this post, things haven't changed too much. Amy still sees my mom in friendly settings without me and they still joke around the same way and all. We have even gone out a few times as three of us or with my older sister too and things have gone very well. At one point, they did gang up to us for a second (jokingly) and asked us how it all started, but they know that I have audacity.
I really like how things have gone. It has been about four months now and I am very happy. I take it day by day, of course, but I'm very happy with my life right now, especially now that everybody are aware. I'm staying at Amy's place more often except when her daughter is there. I have a good job, I make a good salary, I have great friends, and obviously, I have an amazing girlfriend. That woman works hard and I admire it to much. I dare to say that I've never found somebody so sexy in the way that I see Amy and I smile so much thinking about that I somehow convinced her to be with me. She makes me happy.
Hopefully these posts can help somebody who may be in the same situation as me, as I didn't see anything quite matching my situation here in Reddit.

"Lately me and my boyfriend have been arguing every single day. We’ve been dating for almost a year and a half. Before we’d just yell then he’d ignore me for a couple hours in the same room until we calmed down. This past weekend we were sharing food and he ate half the salsa container then I felt like because he ate half I could have the rest. He told me I was fat and greedy for not letting him know I was finishing it. I felt like it was common sense since he ate his half. He kept calling me more names so I tossed the receipt at him. He then grabbed the bag of chips and the receipt and threw it in my face, causing the other sauces to explode on the bed and headboard. He then tells me “clean it up.” I told him not because I didn’t throw it. He doesn’t say anything and just starts taking my clothes out my bag and wiping up the very strong Buffalo sauce with my expensive jackets. I proceed to pack my stuff because I was officially done and he grabs my stuff out my hand and throws it. He takes the bag that I’m stuffing my clothes in and flips it ups side down almost everytime I get it almost full. I decide to call my uber (it’s 3am) and it takes 30 minutes to get matched with someone. 5 minutes before the driver comes my phone is about to die and he won’t let me use his charger. He blocks me into his living room and won’t let me leave to use the bathroom or get a drink saying “we broke up so you can’t use my stuff.” I kept budging him to let me get some water and he ended up pushing me out the way multiple times and trying to put my shirt over my head literally like how the bullies did in school so you can’t see. I didn’t understand if this was enough to be weirded out by his aggression or if he was just trying to prove a point and didn’t know how to. I had no choice but to stay as I literally had no means of getting home at 3am. He made me lay on the dining room chairs while he sat on his phone. Since he blocked me into a corner where I was sitting I tried to go around the table to go to the bathroom and ended up stepping on his moms curtains and pulling the entire rod down out the dry wall, causing a hole. He got extremely upset and told me to fix it, saying I needed to keep holding up the one side that fell until I figured out how to fix it. Maybe 1.5 hours later he gives up and says “you don’t want to fix all of this and us? Ok I quit too then.” I was so exhausted and uncomfortable in the living room chairs I just slept in his room. Next day I woke up and it felt like nothing happened. We went right back to being completely happy in each others company and I never really addressed how the aggression made me feel. I can’t understand if this is drastic enough to really sit down and talk about 2 days later when we’re already good again or if I should just be hyper aware that he can get upset sometimes. Also me and his mom have a very basal relationship and I’m so nervous about breaking the curtain and he obviously said he has to tell her I broke it.

"I met my friend (F24) in university, 5 years ago. We’ve been super close since day 1, we talk to each other about everything, and we always laugh together. She’s always nice and honest with me. When I don’t see her for a while because she goes back home to see her family she always says she missed me, and she loves me. I never had attraction towards her as more than a friend, however, due to personal circumstances with my mother, I started to lean on her for emotional support. We went out drinking a few weeks back and I got jealous when she made out with another guy, and I started tearing up a bit. A week after that we went drinking with her ex-bf who is also one of my close friends, and I started withdrawing and ignoring her when they started making out. She then became very distant a few days after, which I assumed is because she saw her ex, for additional context, when they broke up because he cheated, she was distraught and we ended up sleeping together. We’ve always been a bit touchy with each other, especially when we drink to the point that when she was making out with the guy at the club, other people came up to me and asked if that was my girlfriend.

I explained to her that I didn’t like her as more than a friend, and she said her vibe is different now because of what I did,. I’ve tried to give her space, but I relapse and message her every 4 days or so to just apologize, however, she’s also telling me that she needs space because she’s overwhelmed with everything and it’s not my fault, and its not just me she’s ignoring, but her snap-score keeps going up. I was planning on messaging her today just to see how she was, but I’m not sure. I know the obvious is to give her space regardless of the reason but I really miss her, I’m just starting to realize how much time we spent together now that we don’t really talk.

"I (32M) have been friends with the same core group of five or six guys (31-32M) since high school. We live in different cities and we don’t see each other as often as we used to. We all stay in touch, both as a group and individually, and we hang out whenever we can. Several of us are in committed relationships, and several of us are single. I’ve been with my fiancée (34F) for five years, engaged for 18 months. 

When I have chances to see my friends, I usually suggest some activity that easily includes anyone who wants to come, including significant others. But when my friends suggest activities, they tend to want to do a guys night, or they pick things that imply it’s guys only, or they aren’t clear at all and then seem annoyed if I don’t pick up on little hints that I was invited but my fiancée wasn’t. 

Now, I recognize this may be an unpopular opinion, but I don’t get anything special out of guys night. I totally get that it’s important to have separate time for the boys, and I do make time for that every once in a while. But excluding people based on gender just never really made sense to me. I’m perfectly capable of doing things without my fiancée, I just often fail to see the point in excluding her if she’s available and interested in the plans we’re making. This has caused tension in a couple recent occasions where I felt pressure to decide between excluding my fiancée or missing out entirely.

This might not be an issue if it wasn’t the norm. I do accommodate occasional guys only events (we all just took a guys trip together), but my friends don’t seem to be making a similar effort to be more inclusive. And that just makes me feel like they don’t want my fiancée around. I don’t want to leave it entirely up to my friends to decide if she gets to be invited, but at the same time I always feel like I have to ask. 

How can I express this to my friends and take some of the pressure off of myself without them just writing it off as me being codependent? You’d think we’d be able to talk about this openly having grown up together, but it’s just this awkward passive aggressive thing that nobody talks about. 

TLDR: I feel too much pressure from my friends to exclude my fiancée from social gatherings and my reaction isn’t helping.

"My boyfriend (45M) and I (37F) have been seeing each other for 2.5 years. During couples therapy, he confronted me and said that I’ve lied to him several times and he no longer trusts me. As an important note, he is autistic. 

When I asked for details about what he felt I’d lied about, some of the instances were times when I said something figurative that he took literally - a frequent issue due to his autism. For example, I made a statement something like “My ex played video games all day and never spent time with the kids,” and he feels that I’m lying because there was one time that my ex went on a family vacation with the kids and I, so clearly I’m lying about him never spending time with the kids. Instead of understanding the concept that I’m trying to share, he apparently dismisses it all as a lie over semantics. (He also came to this conclusion without knowing that during that vacation, my ex had a tantrum and stormed off, leaving me alone with the kids for almost the entire time - so…)

Another time I was figuring out the logistics for picking up dinner and I said that my daughter didn’t have dance class that evening so I could be flexible with dinner timing. He took that to mean that class was not being held, and accused me of lying when he found out that we’d actually chosen to skip the class. I don’t feel that my wording was specific either way - but the subject of the conversation was dinner timing, not the class, so I didn’t feel that I needed to be super specific and detailed. He took that as a lie of omission - I felt I was just being succinct about the part of the conversation that was not the main focus. 

One of the other things was a misunderstanding where he thought I’d contradicted myself about something but then realized that I was referring to two different situations. I attempted to explain myself about all of the above things, but I was extremely emotional and I don’t know how much I was able to clarify - he at least seemed to accept that he was mistaken about this last misunderstanding. 

Since the conversation yesterday, I’ve barely been able to stop crying. We were friends for years and our relationship was built on me feeling like I could tell him things I couldn’t tell anyone else. Now I’m looking back at every vulnerable thing I ever shared with him and wondering what else he thinks I’m lying about, or how I’m supposed to find verification so he’ll believe me. I told him about my past trauma not being believed by the police about an abusive ex - now I wonder if he doesn’t believe me about that either. 

He claims to love me. I can’t comprehend how he was unable to extend me the benefit of the doubt that I’m not lying by default. I don’t understand why he would jump to the conclusion that I’m lying instead of assuming there’s a misunderstanding or asking for clarification. Where am I supposed to go from here?

OG post got removed bc of incorrect formatting oops

Hiii, posting this from a throwaway because I will physically DIE of cringe if somebody I know finds this. Which is also the reason I'm changing all names, genders, pronounce and all identifying information. Was debating whether to post this on r/aroace (you'll see why in a bit), but I didn't know if it would get much attention so I'm hoping this sub is better. 

Okay so I (19F) have had a little bit of a crush on one of my close friends (also 19F) pretty much for half the time I've known her, we'll call her Z. We met just a little over a year ago through mutual friends and she's always been super magnetic to me. Incredibly funny, witty, artistic, intelligent, beautiful human being and I love being around her. 

Problem is, she's very delicate as well, doesn't like being touched (even when she hugs somebody hello and goodbye it barely counts as a hug), affection is reduced to a minimum even with her closest people etc. Also she's expressed multiple times that she's probably never going to have a partner, be it romantic or sexual, and she quote on quote ""hates it"" when people within a friend group develop crushes on each other, which, of course, crushed me (pun intended). 

I however am a very affectionate and loving person, I love hugs, I love physical contact, affectionate words and giving compliments. I just love my friends. 

The horrors started when we all (our friend group I mean) went on a trip to a cute little village last summer. Everything was going alright, board games, walks in the forest, stealing grapes from the vines of neighbors, yk how it is. So one night we decided to go on a walk and explore a forest path Z said she likes taking sometimes. It was pitch black so the lucky people whose phone batteries hadn't died during the day turned on their flashlights and off we went into the unknown. Me and Z weren't part of the lucky bunch. At some point it was me and her behind everyone else and because we couldn't see shit she decided to play a #funnyprank™ on me by sneaking up behind me and touching my arm as if some wild animal or something. By that point my eyes had gotten used to the darkness and my vision was a little bit more clear so I could make out her silhouette when I turned in her direction, so naturally I went over and touched her arm as well to let her know she wasn't that smart and that I'd never fall for such an underbaked attempt at scaring me. And then she did THE UNTHINKABLE. She pulled me in for a hug. A HUG. Like an actual tight hug, you know, the kind I said Z doesn't like giving anyone? Anyway I took advantage of the golden moment and hugged her back. We stayed like this for about 5 seconds before she bit my shoulder?????? WHAT 😭😭😭😭?! The rest of the night is a bit of a blur but when we got towards going home for the night Z asked me if I would like to sleep with her in her room as she was having frequent nightmares and would feel safer if she had someone next to her. Keep in mind that before all this bullfuck went down we barely knew each other, tbh I was even surprised she wanted me to come on this trip with the rest in the first place. 

When we got home I had fallen asleep on the floor (what whisky and vodka do to a mf) while the rest were playing board games. I woke up around 2am and heard Z say ""OP? Are you awake"". She was lying on the couch waiting for me to wake up. Now when I said she asked me if I would sleep in the same room as her she said I'd be sleeping on the floor, because yeah I already explained, and being tipsy I took it literally (besides I was already sleeping on the floor in the living room so like) but then she asked me, absolutely flabbergasted, what I was doing and told me to sleep with her on the bed like a normal person. 

That morning I woke up more confused than I'd ever been. 

The last few days of the trip I thought I was going insane because Z constantly sat really close to me, touched my arms and my shoulders when talking, gave me frequent compliments, all of these she never did with our other friends, and believe me I was observing every single interaction like my life depended on it. Once I was sure that I had absolutely lost my mind I confided in my best friends (the ones who introduced me to Z) and they absolutely blew me off saying things like: ""She's aroace this isn't possible"", ""Maybe she means it in a platonic way"" and so on. 

Another thing Z hates is eye contact. Says it makes her feel uncomfortable. She has absolutely no problem looking me in the eyes however, when I mentioned that to my best friend who knows her a little bit better she was amazed because they've know each other for years and apparently Z never makes eye contact with her. 

Z doesn't remember my birthday but she remembers small details about my life, the words in the foreign language I speak that I've taught her, and my bff snitched that she had been trying to convince the rest of the group to chip in for a gift for me, she doesn't give gifts to anyone else and there's no special event coming up or anything. Just saw something that reminded her of me and wanted to get it but it's apparently expensive. 

So eventually I accepted that my life is fucked and tried to distance myself from Z, because at that point I was genuinely tweaking, but any time we hung out all of the above would happen, and I'm so confused and I need to see a psychiatrist at this point. 

Is anybody here aroace or on the spectrum or something, could you share similar experiences if you've had them? I feel like maybe she likes me but doesn't realize it because she avoids thinking about romance at all cuz it ""grosses her out"" :DD 

BITCH THEN WHAT THE FUCK

"My boyfriend and I frequently get into fights over me talking to my close friends over Discord or hanging out with them or even texting them. We are both long distance (he’s across the country) and he wants me to be on call with him all the time and unmuted. He also calls me when he’s on break during work (which I don’t mind, but he gets upset when I miss a call from him).

I often talk about my friends in high regard because they are my closest and dearest friends. However, the issue that he has with this is that none of my close friends are girls. I understand he might think its a red flag but they are my closest friends because I play video games with them and have known most of them for 6+ years.

I have also explained to him many times that although all my best friends are guys, I have no trouble having friends who are girls too. I have told him multiple times that they happen to be my best friends because I talk to them almost everyday. I still hang out with my other girl friends, but I wouldn’t consider them to be close enough to be called a close friend!! I just think that personally, for me to consider anyone as a close friend, I would have to interact with them almost everyday.

He thinks that because I am feminine, I can’t be “part of the boys”, which I think is kind of a weird concept. Just because I am feminine does not mean I can’t have a genuine platonic friendship with guys.

I also have never had any romantic feelings for any of my close friends, and neither have they towards me. If they ever were to make these feelings clear, quite honestly, I would distance myself from the group because it would be disrespectful to my partner to keep interacting with said person.

Recently, during winter break for this semester, I have been hanging out with my friends IRL because they’re all back in our town (we all go to different universities). Every time I mention them to my boyfriend, he would make passive aggressive comments like, “Oh have fun with your date” or whenever I send him a picture with one of my friends in the background he says, “I spot your crush.” These comments make me uncomfortable and I always try to reassure him that it’s not like that.

I feel like no matter how much I assure him that I only like him, and that my friends are purely friends, he just makes these comments and they really just eat at me. I just wish he wouldn’t see me that way. I literally don’t even party, go out, or anything with my friends. I just work, study, and (very rarely anymore) play games with my friends. I barely get to see my close friends during the semester (we’re all busy) and so it really sucks that he gets mad that I spend time with my friends over the holidays.


I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried explaining myself but he just keeps insisting that I have had feelings for at least one of them before (I never have). I like him and I wish I could reassure him more but I have limited options because we’re long distance. I also just believe that it’s not healthy for me to constantly have to prove myself when I trust him wholeheartedly with his close friends. When I brought that point up to him, all he said back was “Yeah, because you have no reason to doubt me.” I also believe he has no reason to doubt me either, though.

I’m stuck in that I say anything I’m a nag and that causes tension, say nothing and I just have to tolerate it. His family are no assistance they think it’s quite hilarious and are like he’s always enjoyed a drink it’s just how some people are.

I used to drink a bit in my early twenties but grew out of it- I hardly drink at all now even at functions that would normally be considered my turn (work, friends parties etc) but someone has to be the responsible one and it’s always me.

The last few months I’ve been hardly sleeping, my thoughts flicker from depressed to determined to self loathing.

"TLDR; we haven't had sex in months, probably a handful of times in the last year or so, aren't spending the holidays together, have rarely seen each other for the last month &amp; only see each other if I travel to her.

I want to start this off with I love her to death, despite our issues our relationship is the most healthy &amp; non toxic one I have ever been in. We've been dating for a bit over 2 &amp; a half years and some of these issues have been present for a long time. We've talked about why we don't have sex &amp; the answers have ranged from a low self image, to my inability to hold her feelings, to her low sex drive, to being ""physically attracted to me, but not emotionally"", to just being busy and stressed, to it being something that she just doesn't think about. We've had this issue of great distance between us to the point where we'll just see each other has something like ""roommates"". About a year and a half ago she went on antidepressants/anti anxiety medication to help with the stress of Grad School, which naturally will kill any sex drive you have, which I can also understand, I was on them as a teenager so I know their affects, so the lack of anything physical was something I wasn't mad at or anything and that was a conversation many of times.

Now onto the next: We aren't spending holidays together. I had a lot of family issues over the last 2 years that led me to spending Christmas with her family last year. She's had a rocky relationship with my family that they have not helped with at all. However they've reached out and tried to mend the relationship, but she feels uncomfortable being around them for Christmas as they have not had a chance to sit down &amp; talk things out before this. I figured it would be a good time to hang out as the holiday would create the ""buffer"" to have a positive experience without the pressure to get anything fully resolved all at once. But since she didn't want to do that, today is the 22nd &amp; I will not see her until at least the 26th. 

&amp; last but certainly not least. We do not see each other often &amp; it's only when I travel to her. She recently moved into her first apartment with her friend after getting a job post grad school &amp; only see each other if I travel to her. She blames it on the stress of moving &amp; working. I work for the USPS, so December has been 6AM to anytime between Noon &amp; 4PM 6 days a week. I live about 45 minutes away and she's an in person &amp; online therapist. She hasn't been to my apartment in about 2 months, her reasoning is she doesn't want to drive 45 minutes (+ traffic) to basically just sleep at my apartment &amp; leave. When I tell her she's welcome to stay while I'm at work &amp; have clients there, she says she doesn't want to change the setting for her online clients &amp; that she doesn't feel comfortable being there when I'm not. So we only see each other if I pack a bag before I leave for work at 4AM, and go to her apartment after work. The other part of bot seeing each other is that her siblings and friends that live in other states are home for the holidays, so basically seeing me has fell to the wayside while I see her maybe 2 days a week. 

I don't want to resent her, it's not like I hate her at all. I want to either not have these things get to me as much as they do, or find a way to bring these issues up in a way where a productive conversation can be had. Any advice is welcome.

Me (f,22) and my bf (23,m), have been together for almost 5 years. 

He isn't really interested in sex anymore and we have spoken about it multiple times. I feel like he doesn't want to touch me intimately and it's really taking a toll on how I approach him. I don't want to kiss him or be close to him because it hurts that he doesn't want it. 
I feel really distant from him and something feel quite resentful that he won't initiate having sex, touching me, or just generally do things friends won't do. I want to be close again but I feel like I've brought the topic up so much, trying to figure out whats influencing this, that there is nothing more I can do.

We live together and have sex maybe twice every 8-9 weeks. It hurts and I just want to push him away. But pushing him away hurts even more. 

I can't change him and so I want to change my perspective, as otherwise I act distant and awkward.

"Hi! My family has some pretty unhealthy dynamics, and my aunt Tahlia was always the one who bore the clearest consequences. My aunt Tahlia has very little going on in her life. She left home to study when she was 18-21/22 and then came back and lived at home her whole life. She became my grandmother's caregiver and got extremely depressed when my grandma passed away in April 2022 at 95 years old (which would be normal but she's still not doing well, to the point of barely eating and doing anything at all). She never really got over her depression, it keeps getting worse. She lives with my dad (59m). I always thought she had a really unfair batch because she did all the housework and cleaning, and was never helped. Now I realize she doesn't want help, whenever I come back to my dad's for the holidays (I live abroad), she won't let anyone else cook or clean or even help her when she is doing those things. My aunt Aria, who is not related to me by blood but by marriage to my uncle's (not sure her age) got very sick this year around January. My aunt Aria refused to get checked up by doctors for year's on end because she feared getting infections/viruses through contact in hospitals/clinics. She ended up developing a deadly infection due to this that advanced far before anyone could do anything. My aunt Tahlia was never close with my aunt Aria, they used to see each other on my grandma's birthday and one day in December per year. My aunt Aria passed away about a month and half ago and my aunt Tahlia is, again, very depressed and sad, she says she feels very depressed for my cousins (44f &amp; 39m) and my uncle (75m). My dad and my uncle do not talk due to how my aunt Aria, uncle and cousins used his house and help in an abusive way back in March-May. My aunt Tahlia has no children, her only support is my dad, and, I suppose, me to some extent, but I live my own life and as I said before abroad so I am not around for the majority of the year. I think she went to one therapy session back in October but not more. She does not work, hasn't worked for years because of her depression and being a caregiver to my grandma. She saves a lot of money and is always concerned about saving, she never spoils herself, for example, my dad bought some more expensive coffee capsules which are nice (about 0.56€ per capsule), my aunt Tahlia refuses to have them and drinks instead the cheaper version of those which are actually not as good (0.4€ per capsule) when the price difference is almost ridiculously low for someone who is rather well-off financially. I think she never got to prioritize herself throughout her entire life and doesn't know how to do it, so she's lonely and depressed. Obviously I could be wrong and if other people, have better guesses, let me know. Any advice on how I can help her?

TLDR: my aunt is depressed because she has only been thinking of others her entire life and doesn't know how to put herself first and how to not focus on others' wellbeing.

"I (29M) proposed to my long time back ex (27F). We had broken up long back but there were no grudges between us. It has been some 2-3 years since we last chatted. She is a decent girl so after a lot of deliberation I asked her for marriage.
Now, she was definitely in a dilemma but she said she would have definitely said if it weren’t for her present situation (career, which is real and not an excuse). But then she added that if I were to marry her I would have to take her to every country in the world, and if not then I should tell her so, so that she will marry a rich man instead.
My take is: I am trying my best to make money and my goal is also to travel, see some nice places and all. But to outrightly demand such a thing without considering my financials is what I found mean and inconsiderate. I guess at this age we all are in the growing phase.

Not the entire time has been bad but I’ve noticed feelings of confusion, not being so sure he’s the one for me.

"Changing names for privacy,

My best friend John (21M) has been in a relationship with Nancy (21F) since we graduated high school. We have been friends since elementary school and he is pretty much my brother. John has had a rather rough upbringing plagued with substance abuse, so he carries a lot of trauma. I have spent a lot of time around him and Nancy throughout the past few years and so I feel like I have a decent understanding of their dynamic. In 2021 Nancy got pregnant and now they have a 1 year old soon to be 2.

When we were 18-19, when John was first dating Nancy, I was never a huge fan of her. John has a temper and tends to act impulsively, (getting into fights, drugs, etc.) I did not like Nancy because I felt like she fed into the worst side of him. She was also into drugs and would instigate him to fight people she was beefing with, and she had a temper herself. They got into intense arguments that would sometimes turn physical, almost always over stupid shit. I have always been honest with him about how I felt about her, but at the end of the day I didn't want to act like a stern parent and tell him what to do. I would just be a friend, offer a shoulder to cry on when he needed it, and give advice when he asked for it. There was several times where they came very close to breaking up but they would end up back together. They both had cheated on each other several times too. It was frustrating for me because me and John would talk about how she isn't good for him and he would turn around and get back with her.

Fast-forward to the baby. After she arrived, a lot of things changed. At first, Nancy seemed to mature a lot very quickly. A lot less combative and had a more tame demeanor. My opinion of her shifted somewhat, I thought maybe the baby had given her a wake up call. Their relationship seemed to be more stable. Turned out to not be the case. The same sort of issues from before the baby was born would bubble up. They both still struggle with substance abuse. This was often the point of contention in their relationship. They still got into fights often. She would also do this weird thing where she would call him out in front of me. For example one day I was visiting them and she randomly brought up how he cheated on her like a week before and guilt tripped him in front of me, neglecting to mention that the impetus for him doing that was them getting in a fight because she was out at bars doing coke and drunk driving. Then another time they had come to my place to visit and she randomly outed him telling me he was bisexual in the rudest way possible right in front of him. She said something along the lines of ""You didn't know? He's gay as fuck, he likes it in the ass."" That is something very personal that he should've been able to tell me when he was ready, it made me so mad that she would do something like that.

*Sidenote: I'm not trying to justify his wrongdoings, and I obviously have a bias towards John because he is my best friend. I don't think that he is good for Nancy either, he probably feeds into her vices just as much as she does his, it is just harder for me to recognize that because I don't have a relationship with her on the same level as I do John.*

Whenever I talk with him about his relationship he is quick to admit his faults and is self aware of things he does. When I mention Nancy's faults he will interject and say that what he did is worse. He has done this on many occasions. Sometimes what he does is worse than what she did, but often he is driven to do the things he does to cope with the things she does. To me it seems like she justifies her actions by making him the bad guy. So then he will go on a path of reflection and try to change and be better, and she will make no effort to change her behavior. Then eventually he cracks and starts self-sabotaging. I have advised him to try couples counseling and he asked her to go with him and she refuses. John sees a counselor regularly, and she refuses to even do counseling on her own. 

A few months ago they broke up and they no longer live together. It was bitter at first but they maintained a good enough relationship for the baby. So in my head it seemed like a win for all parties. I had been super busy with finals at school that I hadn't had a lot of time to talk to John or see him, (we both suck at communication.) So I have been largely in the dark about what has been going on with them. Before they broke up it was easy for me to see John because they lived in my hometown so I would stop there when I was home on weekends from university.  But since they broke up he lives an hour south from my hometown and two hours south from where I live, making it harder to visit him.

Today I had a lengthy phone call with John. Me and another friend of mine, (and John's,) have been making plans to rent a place near my school. While talking to John on the phone he said he had lost his job that he has had for the past 2 years. I brought up the idea of him coming to live with me and our other friend. My school is near a major city with lots of job opportunities, and Nancy had moved to a town about 40 minutes west from my school. So in my head this seemed like the perfect storm, 3 best friends get to live together, and he is a lot closer to his baby mama, making the co-parenting logistics more manageable. But after I mention this he tells me that he is probably going to get back with her, and goes on to tell me about how he has never had a connection with anyone like this before and that he is connected to her on a spiritual level, (I've heard this before.) He said he had stayed at her place a few different times since they broke up; later in the conversation he brought up how he doesn't want his daughter to grow up in a broken home like he did. In my opinion it would be worse for a child to be in a household with parents that can't get along then to have two households.

Needless to say I do not think it will all just work out this time. What can I do to help John? I am going to visit him tomorrow, what can I say to convince him not to get back with her? I struggle with confrontation so ""telling him how it is"" is hard for me. Is it even my place to do so? I think about that often, but I worry about him and care for him like family. I want him to be better for himself and his daughter.  I just can't envision a scenario where getting back with her does him any good. In fact I think it will just hold him back from his potential. I have tried the supportive friend angle, but I feel like I am not getting through to him.

"Eight years ago, when I was in a vulnerable place in my life, I met someone who I wish I knew would be the worst person I've ever encountered in my entire life. 

At this time, I was in my early 20s with zero support system-the perfect combo for an abuser seeking out his victim. Two weeks into us dating, he was immediately abusive. He made more money than me and I was in a city with zero support so I was very easy to manipulate and control at the time. He paid for everything I needed and offered me better once he got us a place and furnished it. The worst decision of my life. He financially, physically, emotionally and mentally abused me. Anything that was a secret for me or what others would find embarrassing or if we were in a fight, he'd post it on Facebook to humiliate me with an audience. His abuse has no bounds. I felt trapped.

A couple years later we had our child. His abuse still had no bounds. While I was pregnant I felt at my lowest and he made sure I felt it. He would record me and tell me how ugly and worthless I am and laugh. He questioned me constantly towards the end of the pregnancy if the baby was his knowing that I never left the house and wherever I went he knew. During labor, instead of being supportive, he downtalked me.

Fast forward a year later, he ended up going to federal prison for 2 years for conspiracy to sell narcotics. I felt hopeless and betrayed. He controlled all the assets in the home, how would I be able to support and find a place for myself and my 2 boys? I was depressed for weeks. Around my birthday, my friends finally talked me into going to a yearly cookout that everyone went to. I was nervous, but I still went anyways. Those few hours spending outside of the house felt amazing. I wish I knew that night would be one of the most traumatic nights of my life. Someone told him they saw me there. Instead of being happy that I took a few hours to myself, he sent his family to my home to ""get his things"" and they ended up physically assaulting me and taking things out our home which left my face bleeding scratched with a concussion.


The 2 years he was gone, after everything, I still answered the phone and tried to put things aside to support him. A few weeks before his release, he said he wasn't coming home to me and instead, moving in with the family who put my life in danger in my own home. I felt betrayed and confused and angry but I respected his decision. He came home for months and had his nose up at me and wouldn't speak to me but celebrated his release and enjoyed his freedom with everyone but the person who made sure he was ok.

I took the time to heal and found myself. It felt good being so independent. That no one could take what I built alone from me. A few months later, something happened to him and he called me. I was there for him and supported him. Once he knew he could still have access to me, he discarded me.

This became a constant cycle once he was home. Still wrote statuses on social media humiliating me, disrespected me, etc. I thought jail would teach him a lesson but it didn't. Anytime he helped me he would throw it in my face to make me dependent on him again and start the process all over again. He goes through psychosis rages if his feelings are hurt that he will go to any length to hurt, humiliate and humble me and anyone around me who loves and cares for me. He has harassed my friends, shown up at my home, tried to make me lose my job, etc. anything for me to break. I recently called police before and they didn't take my situation seriously. I've had him blocked for days and the more he feels ignored the worse he escalates. 

We have the boys 1 week at a time. This week was his week. He helped me with my car fix and of course as usual got upset because I didn't show enough ""gratitude"" and blocked me. At this point, 8 years of abuse I am tired of trying to make him see me as a human so I blocked him back. He came into my house while I wasn't there today and destroyed my home and took pictures of my home saying he's going to get full custody of my kids because I'm ""unfit"" and if I don't talk to him he's going to post the photos on social media.

"**TLDR**

A 21-year-old guy (M21) reflects on a 4-month relationship with a 19-year-old girl (F19) who suggested a break, suspecting she used it to cheat. Despite this, she insisted on using him as her prom date. He's considering entering another LTR and seeks advice on the situation. The relationship involved a lack of interest, a break with subsequent hookups, and a breakup followed by casual encounters. Now contemplating a long-term relationship based on mentor advice. He emphasizes the importance of choosing friends wisely.

**Questions**

1. Apparently this is what some people do? I would never think of doing this, so it's interesting to know someone could go on a break to try out new partners. I assumed it's because maybe they wanted space or to breathe or something.
2. So after hooking up with someone during the break she initiated, and then even after after eventually cheating, why had she been so insistent of using me as her date to prom (she was the one who asked me), is it because I went to a good school and was a recruited prep school athlete and it would look good as opposed to her ex or whoever she could have asked? I go to a good college now, and have a pretty good career, so I just want to know if this is something people do. Or insisting on posting me on social media.
3. Why did she admit to cheating upon being asked instead of lying, why didn't she mention it earlier?
4. Thoughts on sending 100 messages in a row and determining how to deal with this, and stuff.
5. Other concerning/unacceptable things I've described?

**Context**

So my friend and I were talking and eventually, he introduced me to this girl. My senior year of high school, she gets my Snapchat, and I try to unfriend her, but she messaged me literally over 100 times in a row to meet up and have a date (for the longest time I thought this was normal until I began to learn more about harassment). She asks to be boyfriend/girlfriend, and I say sure. I'm busy with school, sports recruiting, and extracurricular stuff and probably see her twice a month. And honestly, I just didn't think she was really attractive or liked her a lot, but I didn't say this. Because of not meeting up with her, her being insistent of meeting up and not wanting to make out with her on other dates, she suggests a one-week break. Also before the break, the first time I met her is the furthest I'd one with her, after that, I didn't initiate anything, and I think she mentioned this.

My best friend at the time, is a total fuck buy, and always had girls and parties to go to, we go to college parties and as I walk in, almost immediately less than a minute of walking into this small college apartment, after a few exchanged words, I began hooking up with a sophomore at a school in my city. She wouldn't sleep with me so she gave me her number which I did not save. Then we go somewhere else and do the same thing with different girls. Anyway, my ""girlfriend"" and I get back together, I think we have dinner once. We speak about it on Snapchat and I tell her I made out with two people, she asks if they were white (they were, and my then girlfriend wanted to date me because I was big and black) and immediately after she tells me that she made out with someone during the break. One of my friends said she was lying because she felt embarrassed after I said the thing about the two girls. Then I just realized, what if she used the break she initiated as an opportunity to cheat?

She wanted to go to prom with me because I think she thought that it looked really good or something and I think prom is the only reason she wanted to be boyfriend/girlfriend. Many months after this, she would drop hints that she was with her ex-boyfriend, and I kind of pressed her and she admitted this. She eventually goes to prom alone which I felt bad about. We ""broke up"", then I used Tinder and hooked up with three girls in one week. I haven't had or attempted to have an LTR since. However, I am considering having an LTR now since a lot of my advisors are suggesting this and are willing to mentor me. I also think it's good to have LTR experience.

So I always think about things like this because it's a matter of luck that I understand that I do not have to befriend people with bad character. Until I began to spend more time on my career and befriended people who are honest, better morally, and have a good character, and until I completely stopped caring about making friends for the sake of people like other people/appearing normal, I would constantly run into and had no choice but to befriend really horrible people that I regret speaking to at all or becoming friends with.",Do you believe that my (M21) former girlfriend (F19) suggested a break with the intention of seizing the chance to be involved with someone else?,18obn89,1703239755.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18obn89/do_you_believe_that_my_m21_former_girlfriend_f19/,

My family knows about my relationship so they informed my bf about my situation. He came there in no time &amp; was in my side the entire day.The Doctor told me that It will take almost 2 months for full recovery.
Next day, I got discharged from hospital &amp; my boyfriend tooked me to my parents house. Since then I'm lying down bed all the time &amp; my boyfriend is taking care of all of my needs. He gives me Medicine in time, clean my body in time, Cuddle me by lying my side. I was emotionally so happy watching him doing that &amp; I was thankful to god for this person in my life.
Last night, I woke up suddenly in midnight. I saw my boyfriend was lying on my side. He was wearing his earphone &amp; he was masturbating watching porn ( For the the kind info, Both us used to have a very high sex drive between us. We liked to get intimate each other regularly &amp; our sex life satisfaction was overwhelming. None of us doing masturbation for that in long time). Watching him jerking himself off, I felt a pain in my chest. A sudden thought came in my mind that maybe because of me, he's suffering right now. I felt hurted &amp; my eyes were getting wet but eventually I didn't say anything to him cause he didn't notice my sneak peak. So I went silent for sleep.

The next day I asked him to sit down beside me.
I kissed his forehead, cuddled him. I said to him that I'm sorry for everything I'm putting him through. If i was careful, then the accident may not happened. I was tearing that moment by saying those. My boyfriend grabbed me to his chest &amp; assured me that none of this is my fault. He told me to be ralexed. I also talked him about our sexual life after my accident. He assured me that my safety is the most important thing to him. That morning i felt like all my pain vanished away. I felt like I getting heavenly feelings.
 
In the following day, I asked him his phone cause my phone was dead &amp; i needed to call my brother to bring something from groceries. He was going to take a shower so he gave me his phone &amp; went for bathroom. After I made the call, There was something was telling inside me to check his phone. I never checked his phone cause I trust him more then anything. But at that moment, i felt vulnerable &amp; was getting some insecurities after previous nights so I went through his messages. His inbox was clean as I expected. There are 2-3 girls in his inbox but I know them so that's not a concern for me at all but scrolling dowm, I saw chat box where he &amp; his friend was chatting. It was 6 days ago, when my parents was here taking care of me, while his friends took to a bar some relaxing time. He wasn't interested but I told him to go &amp; have a relax session cause I thought he also needed some time for himself. In that night in the bar, they were drinking a lot. My bf doesn't drink that much, but that night his friends forced him to drink more than usually. I also came to know from their chat that, there was a girl in bar who was continuously hitting on him but he was avoiding her. But because of too much drinking, he was starting to talk with her casually. The girl was showing interest on him &amp; asking him to go in her apartment with her. His friends were incouraging him to go with the flow &amp; release all his stress in one night. By reading more of their chat, I came to know that He didn't listen to them &amp; went away from the bar immediately. After that when he became sober, He shouted at them for all their actions &amp; cutted contact with them after that but this guy was close to him so he stayed in touch with him. He confronted to him that for one moment he thought about going with her cause he was not getting any physical attention from me because of my situation, he was craving for sex &amp; wanted to feel the pleasure. But suddenly he stopped himself cause he loved me &amp; he will not cheat on my at any circumstances. That's why he rushed out from the bar immediately.

Seeing their text, I felt relaxed but suddenly i got the feeling of fear.  I was getting the feeling that maybe because of my situation, I may lead him for cheating in future. I got terrified suddenly. Immediately, I was having bad thoughts all over my head. I was happy learning that he doesn't want to cheat on me but also got terrified that because of our high sex drive &amp; the lack of intimacy, It may drive him to cheat on me.

He came out from shower &amp; kissed my forehead. I returned his phone &amp; kissed his lips. He said he's going to outside to bring some meal for me although my brother is coming. That entire day i felt paranoid, scared &amp; terrible. Thought there is nothing to scare about, but still my insecurities werre driving me crazy.

I love him more than myself &amp; Don't want lose him at any cost. I want to be mother of his babies &amp; want to grow older together. So that night, I thought to share my insecurities with one of my bestie. I told her everything I saw today &amp; his perception after that bar night. She listened everything &amp; eventually came out with advice to give him a guilt free pass. I literally became shocked hearing her advise. She said it myb sounds awkward but he's a young guy &amp; he has his physical needs. A guilt free pass maybe help him to release his all patience &amp; help him to be more careful towards me. [ Note :- My bestie was single. She had a breakup with her boyfriend around three months ago]. She also assured me to help with advice If i give him the pass. 

I talked with her a little bit more &amp; hung up.
The hall pass idea of her was literally shaking my head. I can't ever imagine sharing him any other females. I can't imagine him inside in someone else. But the current situation of me also putting pressure on me. One side of mine is saying to give him hall pass. I can feel the lack of intimacy on him but he never express that Infront of me. 
I feel bad for making him go through this. That's why I'm considering to offer a Hallpass to him.

 I don't want to lose him &amp; if this is the only way, then maybe I'm okay with this if he really wants this. I talked with my Bestie once again &amp; she encouraged me for my decision &amp; she said she can help me to make the relationship of me &amp; my bf more strong.

I'm in messy situation &amp;  can't think straight.

"I live in a foreign country since almost five years and I finally found a city I like there, I found friends and feel like I finally have a good social circle and people I can rely on. The city has 1 million inhabitants and many foreigners like me, so finding friends is easy and life is great, a lot of nice activities and cafes and things to do. I have a book club and friends I meet to draw together.

I met my bf two years ago, I love him and I love spending time with him. He lives in a city close by with only 100k inhabitants, there is not much going on there. When I first moved to this country I lived in this city he lives in, and I hated it. It's not beautiful, it's hard to meet people, everyone has their circle of friends so nobody wants to make friends. Worse, my ex lives there, and his ex lives there too. Small city, so you always run into people you know.

I am there quite often to hang out with him but I just don't like being in that city and I only go there for him.  
Recrently we talked about moving in together, we hate taking the train (takes an hour minimum door to door), and we don't have cars so we want to spend more time together easily. He wants to stay in this city he lives in because he has to go to the office everyday and he thinks it makes sense that I move there since I do home office and can work anywhere. However I have my negative feelings towards this city and I don't have friends there and as I mentioned, it's hard to make friends. I am really afraid of being socially isolated. I love the circle of friends that I made, also foreign women my age, we spontanteously ask each other for meeting at cinema or cafe and I'll miss this badly if I move to his city.

In the beginning he seemed to be open to the idea of moving to my city but now that he thought about it he doesn't want to take the train everyday for work, which I do understand. But I don't want to leave my city, while also really want to moving in with him.

"We're currently on a trip to a European country, and although we're usually pretty good friends, this is getting rough. 

My friend's usually a nice dude; he does try to be edgy and cool at times, but I'm usually fine with it because it doesn't happen too often. On this trip, everything has been cranked up. He repeatedly tries to insult me out of the blue and maintain repeatedly that things associated with me, like shoes, sense of direction, ability to discern color, etc. are ""shit."" Usually, I'd laugh along and get him back, but the rate at which he does this makes it annoying at this point. 

He has gotten on my nerves in other ways as well:
- He went to sleep, leaving me with no choice but do laundry late at night. After I struggled for hours into the dead of night with malfunctioning washing machines, uncooperative hotel guests who refused to take their stuff out of the communal coin laundry, and a dryer that did everything but dry, he didn't even have the courtesy to watch videos with earbuds on in the morning and even thank me after I got our laundry done. 
- After egging me on to sing at karaoke, knowing I had throat problems, he told me that my throats ""fucked now"" and that it wasn't a good idea for me to try singing. He then proceeded to tell me about the ""optimal way to drink liquids"" with a sore throat and told me that I was someone who'd ignore doctors when I brushed it off. 
- He kept intentionally ramming his suitcase into my shoes, and when asked to not do that, told me to walk straight and asked me ""what the fuck I was saying""

What do I even do about this?

"Hello, every time I face a major emotional breakdown with my girlfriend, I find solace in seeking advice from experienced individuals here.

To start, I'm a 23 yo guy, and I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (also 23) since June 2020. Up until now, there hadn't been anything she did that truly bothered me, like snooping through my phone.

However, let's rewind to 2019. I was getting to know her and also talking to other women while I was single. Engaging with people of different genders was something I enjoyed. She also did the same, which I considered normal. But the moment I committed to her, I stopped talking to other women out of respect. However, a woman I hadn't spoken to in years reached out, apologizing because she once had feelings for me (a separate story). I clarified that I was in a committed relationship and content with my current girlfriend; her feelings were inconsequential to me now.

Yet, SHE SAW THE MESSAGES. I have no idea when, how, or why, but she read everything from my chat history with this woman, although those messages had been deleted since I began dating my girlfriend because I did not want her to see how I talked with other women before starting a realtionship. This panicked her, leading her to start snooping through my phone—not sure how many times, but she admitted to it twice (everything happened this summer so unti now maybe it was way more times). Once was the incident I just mentioned, and the other was yesterday evening when I woke up to find her hastily placing my phone on the desk where I had left it earlier.

We discussed it, and she confessed that after being together for four years, she's always paranoid, thinking something is wrong, that she doesn't deserve me, and she's actively seeking proof that I've done something wrong to validate her doubts. I expressed my weariness, sharing my fears about our relationship. It's been a lengthy commitment and seems to be heading towards the future, but I tackle my fears by being with her, not by searching for faults she may have had at the beginning of our relationship to prove she isn't perfect.

So here goes the question: How can I address the lack of trust in my relationship caused by my girlfriend's repeated invasion of privacy by snooping through my phone, especially when she's driven by fears and doubts, impacting our trust and leaving me feeling hurt and uncertain about our future together?

I'm at a loss. Trust is pivotal in a relationship, and she doesn't trust me (though she hasn't admitted it; her actions speak). I've made mistakes that unintentionally hurt her, but relationships evolve, and so does how we treat each other. However, her intentional invasion of my privacy erodes the trust. It truly breaks my heart. Now, I'm headed to northern Spain for Christmas with my family, and I won't see her for two weeks. I'm scared and insecure about being alone with my thoughts for too long.

End of last year my partner went through some money troubles which went on for around 6 months till the beginning of this year. Fast forward to May 2023, my partner decided to go back to her home in the Philippines for a month - travelling to different islands to go on a holiday in the country (she had borrowed money from me with the premise of going back due to her mother being unwell). Between me paying for all of our bills for over 6 months as well as the money she had borrowed from me, she owes me well over £15k which she had promised that she would pay back in instalments when she starts her new job. In October she has started her Job which makes her approximately £5k every month minimum. She suggested on £300 per week as a payment as she is paid weekly which I questioned if that was doable for her of which she adamantly said was perfectly affordable for her. Ever since then she has on multiple occasions missed payments due to “other priority expenses” which she says she has. But all I seem to see is that she is spending her money without any thought. She sends her family money (which she’s only done recently) for days out or for them to get gifts etc. I don’t like confrontation but I feel like she’s dragging it on instead of just focusing on paying me off first.

For Context: I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 years. I could’ve sworn I asked a question to do with this very subject when I was getting to know him before we became official. 
He’s ex military.

 👀So for the holidays my cousins and I decided to all get together with our Significant Others and play games. They bring our Never Have I Ever and I’ve never played that game. So while we had shots we would take a shot if we were guilty of what the card prompts read. Well we play for about 2 hours then my cousin reads “Never Have I Ever paid for sex” and we all looked around and nobody was drinking then I hear everyone scream and laugh and I look and my boyfriend is taking his shot🤦🏻‍♀️. I turn to him and my cousins continue playing and I asked him when where and why😲??? He said well when I was in the service I would pay for it when I was in foreign land. I was young and horny and I just didn’t want to go through the trouble of getting to know someone and taking them on a date so buying it was just easier. As I’m reeling from this new info I decided to ask Where??? He said Oh ummmm Japan Thailand Philippines. I was shocked 😳 as I’m saying THIS WAS MORE THAN ONCE?! Now, I’m a chubby Latina and I’ve noticed his porn preferences are thin Asian women. So the fact that I hear all this it immediately makes me feel insecure and just gross. I keep trying to forget it but every movie I’ve seen with him now has an Asian woman or we talked about going to get a couples massage and he mentioned an Asian place and I can’t help but get triggered every single time. Is this normal?? What would you do?? How would you feel??

"My (39F) off and on boyfriend (28M) of 2 years has invited me to a holiday party tomorrow where his parents will be in attendance and I’m not sure what to say to them. 

The reason is that my boyfriend has smeared my reputation to them on numerous occasions, lying to them to make himself the victim and make me look terrible. He has Bipolar disorder and we have been on and off throughout our relationship. We began our relationship 2 months after he was diagnosed and he smoked weed, used cocaine and drank up until a couple weeks ago. He would be very irritable and mean and break up with me out of the blue with no real explanation, block me and go on benders, go out and sleep with other women, and then come groveling back to me with apologies a few weeks later. He is on medication. 

While we were broken up, he would smear my reputation with his friends and family and they all dislike me now. He lied about a lot of things, took my behavior out of context, played the victim, and manipulated his parents in this way so that they strongly dislike me now and think I am trying to control and isolate him, often he would take what he was doing to me and make it sound like I did it to him. On top of that, he has kept me isolated from them and I have only ever met them twice in two years, and have not seen them in 9 months. When I did meet them, they were cordial but cold to me because of this same issue. 

He has come back into my life again and I am not officially back together with him, but he has for the first time taken accountability and ownership and is working through a DBT workbook (he says he can’t afford therapy right now), has stopped using drugs, and is allowing me to have space. He’s gone to all his friends and family as well as my family and come clean and told them that he has been lying and manipulative and apologized. He has told me that his parents’ reaction was skeptical, they find it hard to believe he was lying and they still think I may be controlling, but at the same time admitted they are disappointed in him if he has indeed been lying and want to get to know me because they don’t even know me.

I am attending a Christmas party tomorrow with several people in attendance (100), including his parents. It’s not the right forum to have a proper serious discussion but I don’t want to put on a fake smile and act like things are great when everything is at such an awkward point in a hopefully improving situation. 

What can I say to them when I see them? Should I just be cordial and superficial? I am thinking of saying something like “it’s been a challenging year but I’m looking forward to getting to know you better in 2024 and would love to have an open and honest conversation in a more intimate setting about everything that’s happened so that we can begin to get to know one another and start fresh.”  I just feel so unfairly demonized, as I should, and don’t know how to approach this. I want to have something mentally prepared so I don’t start rambling. How can I convey my own skepticism, hurt, and hopefulness for a healthy relationship with them and let them know I have no desire to isolate or control their son and never did?","How do I (39F) approach my bf’s (28M) parents (53F, 60M) who dislike me and I haven’t seen in 9 months at a large holiday party?",18ob75p,1703237993.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ob75p/how_do_i_39f_approach_my_bfs_28m_parents_53f_60m/,
"i've dated my boyfriend for a year and a half. I met him in the midst of a depressive/manic episode. I literally 5150'd myself the day after our first date (with no fault/ relation to him). 

I escaped from a very abusive cult-like close-minded family. Literally running away to the Bay Area when I was 20 (where i live now). I'm proud of a lot of what I have done, especially because leaving under such brainwashed conditions was extremely hard. however, i am so beyond financially trapped i'm afraid i'll never be able to leave him. 

i have 3 more years until i finish my design degree. i work part time and he works full time paying for our rent... i pay for our food. he offered to pay rent so i could not have to go into debt to pay my tuition which is very kind but this came after breaking up and trying to leave him multiple times.

i just don't love him anymore and he doesn't treat me well (not abusive, just disrespectful). i don't feel safe. i don't trust him. i don't feel the love i did when we first started dating at all. 

i've tried to leave so many times but i have no family to return to and his family has been so supportive and helpful during some of the darkest moments of my life. 

he's buying a house that i do not want to move into. i guess its fine but it just really made me reflect on how limited my choices are financially and how much more stable he is than me.

i don't think i could graduate if i moved out and worked full-time to cover rent with room-mates. i've done similar before and i get so overwhelmed and depressed. it effects my school work and mental health so badly.

as awful as it sounds i feel like the only pragmatic solution is to stay until i graduate and am able to leave which feels icky.

" I started dating my boyfriend, (call him Trey) a little over a year ago and we hit it off pretty well. He was there for one of my most traumatic times of my life and I’ll always be thankful for that.
 A couple months into knowing each other he told me he had a baby, and I was stoked. I’ve always wanted to help care for a  baby (kind of hard to have one when you’re in a same sex relationship). Unfortunately, the baby passed away a couple months after learning about their existence. It wasn’t easy on Trey, of course. Then we get kicked out of our apartment, the landlord was not fair- discriminatory to say the least. So we were forced to live with my mom’s bf. Things go downhill from there. 
 Trey is not a bad guy, but he just isn’t what I’m looking for anymore. It’s harder for me to leave him since his dad just passed away a week ago and his mom has dementia. Not to mention she’s in another country. He doesn’t even have a car or license to go to work so he depends on mine. I’ve tried to be his support system and told him that we can still be friends and that I don’t want to leave him on his own but he’s threatened me on OD and even jumping on a highway. 
  I can feel myself wasting away with him. My alcoholism and depression has increased drastically these past three months and he’s not much of a pusher to help me get out of it. Matter of fact, he’s not much of a pusher at all, we are drowning by staying with each other.  I’m beginning to hate him, it sounds awful but it’s true. I haven’t been happy for months now and truly believe I’m better off on my own. How can I leave someone who lost their child, baby mama, pet and parents all in one year? I leave and I’ll feel guilty forever, I stay and I’ll be drained to the point of hating him.

"I don’t try to shame anyone but there are things you just cannot share with your partner out of respect. I’m by no means insecure in myself, I just find it extremely offensive and disrespectful towards another person to share things like this when you claim to be invested in a relationship. 

So my girlfriend seems unhappy with the way I am as a person, even though I’m doing my best. One time when she was explaining to me that she is used to 24/7 attention, vacation whenever she feels like it etc. I told her that I’m on my limit and I would understand if she decides to move on because I cannot afford this time or finances at the moment. She decided to stay with me. 

Long story short she started making remarks out of context every now and again which I find extremely disrespectful towards your partner. 

She would tell stories like: you know I had a boyfriend I cheated on with another guy because I really wanted to sleep with him.

"
I (20m) started 2023 in my first serious relationship. I have had a good amount of experience with women although I have was never as emotionally invested I was in as that one. My relationship with women was broken afterwards. I was always loyal but during this time, I did not think I would find love again. I began to talk to multiple women throughout the summer but nothing serious at all as I was more focued on myself. Later in the year, I met my current gf(19) while I already had a steep roster. Even still, she and I connected quickly and started dating around 2 weeks after we started talking. I asked her. 

I don’t have an exact reason for why I asked her so quick other than it felt right and I knew she felt the same. During the first month of our relationship I didn’t cut any of the other women off although I didnt maintain consistent contact with any of them nor did I see any. Until one day… I went to one girls house, to smoke in my car. I had full intentions of only smoking, but the girl started to seduce me and I eventually folded. We had sex. I felt horrible after. 

It was not a smart decision, and I take full responsibility. I did not take the relationship serious enough, even though my feelings were serious, I felt as if they scared me and caused me to be insecure and entertain other women. Maybe I am delusional to believe I my feelings for her were progressing while I still was entertaining women. By entertaining women, I mean occasional conversation (although I am a horrible texter and I do not spend much time on my phone). 

My gf caught deep feelings a lot quicker than me. I started to realize my feelings were intensifying and I stopped contacting or responding to any other women. The problem was it was a month into the relationship. About a week after, we fell asleep in my car. She went through my phone and saw multiple conversations. She initially told me the relationship was over but we were able to talk and try to make it work. At that point she had only known about conversations. 

I promised her that I would get my act together and I genuinely did. From that point until now (about another month) I was the best and most loyal bf I could be. I have never been a cheater. About 2 weeks after she found out, she went through my phone again. This time, she found an old picture of me and another girl. On iphone, locations can be tagged to photos and she linked the photo back to the day I cheated and confronted me. I told her nothing had happened other than us smoking and I haven’t spoken to her or anything. 

She became upset after I told her and almost left again. I know I shouldn’t have lied as it was selfish and weak. It was the easiest thing to do in the moment. At this point though, I felt as if I was still working at gaining her trust, and it was going well. I felt like confessing would erase all the progress I had made. We made up and continued to strengthen our bond together. 

Today, my gf asked if I still followed the girl on instagram . I did, so I went and blocked her. Her number was already blocked and we never spoke anywhere else so I honestly forgot I followed her. I told my gf and she asked me for the girls username. I did not give it to her as I asked why and she said “bc i want it”. I felt as though she would start to compare herself and go down a path of negative thoughts and/or try to contact the girl to find out more. At this point, my gf was able to find the woman’s instagram. 

She texted me hours later to ask if I had sex with the other girl. This question came after about a month of happy relationship between us. This question somehow turned into an argument where I eventually told her “she might not be able to get over this and being with me was a constant remninder and recently the distance between us changed so I could not be there to reassure her when she began to overthink and we shouldn’t be together” I do not have a good explaination for this other than my twisted brain thought it would be better to cut the bleeding. I want her to be happy. She has mentioned to me multiple times how much it hurt her and I really care about her and I hate that I hurt her. I am not a cheater, I regret cheating and I wish I never did. (but thats how cheaters feel too)

At this point I dont know what to do. She blocked me before we were able to have a conversation. She mentioned she was tired of being hurt and sad but wanted to make it work because she loves me. Although, she is now scared to love me and does not want to be in a relationship with me again until she is emotionally ready. Toward the end of the conversation she started to gain her personality back and was more comfortable with me again. I told her that I would be fully commited to earning her trust and demonstrating my love for her the way she wants to be loved. As I write this, she is texting me asking for book recommendations. 

I have added a lot of value, wisdom, love and fun to her life. This is not a flex or exaggeration, she would completely agree. But my past mistakes at the beginning of our relationship n continue to plague me. Along with me continuously covering/sugar coating it. She still is unaware that I had sex and I don’t know what to do as I have a multi layer issue. On the surface level, I need advice on how I could do my best to mend the relationship or if it is still salvageable. We both have intense emotion toward each other and want to make it works which is one of the few things that isnt doubted in our relationship. On the other hand, she already nearly left me twice and I feel like if she finds out about the sex from contacting the girl it will be over. On top of that , it will really hurt her. 

I understand that much of my post may have been contradictory as maybe it is not possible to love some one and put the relationship in jeapordy the way I did. It seems as if most of this community is older than me. Is it still early enough to save our relationship? Am I wrong if I do not tell her? Will telling kill our chances? Am I wrong to still consider our relationship after I cheated? I haven’t felt so guilty about something like this but I feel like telling her will only hurt her more. I know she can handle her emotions but I just would really hate to hurt her with that information. She already has to heal from what I told her. 

Even after contiously thinking about what to do with that, I also have to find a way to basically rebuild the relationship from the ground up. While being longer distance (I can see her on weekends). She brought up the idea of and we agreed to start over. I don’t have any idea what to do at all but I am sincerely apologetic and regretful of the actions I made, do I confess more while our relationship is hanging by a thread? I am really willing to do anything to make it work but have I done too much to mess it up? How can I save the relationship? What do I do? Right now, she still calls me “bae”, says affectionate things, and she is falling asleep on the phone with me now. I am grateful I have another chance to earn her trust and I genuinely want to give her the world but I dont want to mess that up before I get the chance.

However, we’ve only had sex a handful of times throughout our relationship. We don’t even kiss each other. He told me three years ago that he was bisexual. He says that while he’s not attracted to a man physically (except in one specific area), he wants to have sex with one.

"My (21m) boyfriend gets annoyed at a lot of the things I (20f) do and i’m not sure what to do. There is a lot of backstory, so i will try to keep it short. We have known each other for two years. Our relationship is long distance and we only get to see each other give or take 2 times a year. With us being long distance, we have to make up for a lot of things normal couples do since we can’t kiss, hug, make love, go on real dates, etc. The problem is, is that we both have two seperate love languages and ideas of how we like to spend our time together. I like virtual dates, lots of romance, love letters, gifts (not expensive), talking, getting to known each other, and time off our devices. He expresses that i feel more like home, and he doesn’t need romantic things to be happy. As long as we can play games together and fall asleep on ft at the end of the day, he’s happy. He likes to watch tiktoks while i’m there or read in my presense , without much talking. Lately these have started to clash. Tension between us is getting high, and when i try talking to him and he isn’t listening or asking if he wants to spend 1 on 1 time, im met with a sigh, and melicious compliance. I’ll admit that i make comments like, “did you hear what i said” (which happens all the time bc he never hears me when on tiktok) or “hm we haven’t had a date in a long time” or “i’d like to talk without socials and stuff” , but i’m always met with irritatation like eye rolls, sighs, and his face falling flat. when i point it out he’ll ignore me and say he’s fine , or he’ll tell me he didn’t like the comment , and i’ll apologize, and we’ll go back to what we were doing and drop what i wanted. It’s starting to get to me a lot because now even with very small things like “hey how long do you think you’re gonna game for” or “did you wanna talk tonight” has him frustrated. it never usually escalates to more unless i poke at why he does that. But is this a reasonable thing for me to be hurt by? It makes me feel small and annoying and a bother to be around. We’ve had MANY talks about it and he apologizes but it’s just a natural reaction. I’ve asked what i can do better, if we should breakup (he insists he loves me and would HATE that), everything. we’ve even had many conversations about our love languages that don’t go much of anywhere. he tells me he is trying and puts effort into romance (i don’t feel it a lot but i believe he is trying) and then the conversation dies, or we argue until we’re tired and get nowhere. I love him but i can’t tell if that kind of constant eye roll and irritation with no responce or “hey i didn’t love that” just visual punishment, is something normal people deal with and i need to be better , or if that’s something i shouldn’t put up with? i yell at him for it constantly and say it hurts me but it seems like a learned habit he can’t stop. he’s not abusive or mean nor does he yell, so i’m not sure what to do. what would you guys do?

"TLDR: My ex broke up with me in October and I’m still distraught

My ex for 3 years 25m (me 22f) told me that I wasn’t feminine and wasn’t wearing dresses and that prompted him to mention he’d been unhappy for 6 months and needed to take a vacation to clear his head( birthday trip I had planned and became excluded from) 

He took a new girl and led me on for about a month saying he wanted to work things out and wanted to go to couples counseling before eventually having his mom break up with me. He is now seeing the same girl he took on the trip and mentioned that she doesn’t have a job cooks and cleans for him while he works and it’s weird as in she’s 23f and who gains joy out of just sleeping with someone and doing things of the sort. 

I don’t get why I’m distraught or why their relationship has lasted at least 3 months and I am not sure how to entirely get over it because he told me I was mean, and that he’d internalized all of our arguments that we had and apologized and the other girl doesn’t argue with him.

"For background context, my boyfriend and I are semi long distance as he lives seven hours from me. 

We barely started talking in the end of September and “officially” became boyfriend and girlfriend in November. He had already considered himself exclusive with me by early November before he came to my hometown and made it official. During this time there was an instance where we were on FaceTime and I forgot why but he was screen sharing with me and stumbled upon a female coworkers instagram. Now apparently he completely despises this woman and usually talks about how she annoys him quite a bit, even now. He wasn’t hesitant to unfollow her without me even asking him to, and when I asked him why he did so he claimed it was for respect for me. I wasn’t gonna question this too much but I did find it quite odd since he was still actively following girls he used to have some type of past romantic interest in during this time, so it didn’t make too much sense. Not too long ago I asked him just out of curiosity since she was brought in a conversation if that was the only woman from work that he followed. He swore it was and when I jokingly accused him of lying he got quite defensive claiming I didn’t trust him. Fast forward like a few weeks later I get a couple of mutuals of my followings on my suggestions one being a girl from his hometown. Not to my surprise just from one post she does indeed work with him. Now I wouldn’t really care since he does follow a handful of females but she does post quite suggestive material that he still actively likes. 

Is this anything shady that should be of my concern? Typically I’d remain nonchalant of such but my friend advised me of this being a potential red flag.

"My boyfriend and I are currently in a long distance relationship that he must keep a secret from his father because he's not allowed to talk to me. Even though we are both young adults, his father is unreasonably controlling with him. Since we can only have phone calls at night, he's usually very sleepy by then and he apparently can't keep himself awake for me the same way I do for him. I suffer from quite severe anxiety at times, and our endangered relationship status has caused me a few anxiety attacks. For the past 2 nights, I had them. The first night, he was helping me through text. He tried to be comforting and grounding, and his presence was helpful so I asked him to please not stop talking to me because I needed him. A few minutes later, he stopped responding and I knew he'd fallen asleep. I had to get myself through the rest of it, and in the morning, he apologized profusely and claimed to understand why I was upset at him. Tonight, I had another attack and we were on a phone call. He comforted me again, but I could hear it in his voice that he was sleepy and laying down. I asked him if he could stay awake for me, and his words were ""I don't know what you want me to do. I need my sleep; I can't stop myself from falling asleep. If you can, bravo. I'm not like you in that way."" I didn't say anything else, just hung up. His tone and the sarcastic ""bravo"" comment really hurt. My timezone is an hour later than his, and I am always tired, but I stay awake because I only have limited time with him every day. I already felt like it was unfair that he won't do the same for me, but continuously abandoning me during anxiety attacks / breakdowns (especially ones that I had because of our relationship issue) - that's a new low. But I love him so much, he's so sweet and otherwise, we have an extremely healthy relationship. He already has a flight booked to come see me. So, I'm not sure who's in the wrong and how we should proceed. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Long story short, I was reading an article the other day on this 10/10 escort in my city from a bunch of reputable news sources. 

I don’t have a problem dating women, and have had several relationships since I started dating. But I am very curious about going out with an escort. She’s expensive, charges $1k/hour. But worth it. 

But I’m really nervous. Would be great to get the community’s thoughts. 

1. Is this even legal? Can I get in trouble if I do it?
2. It feels too good to be true. Am I getting scammed somewhere? I’ve done my research and this person seems legit, has done multiple video interviews with reputable news websites about sex work, and so on. 
3. Can any of this get back to me in the future negatively?

I’m excited to try hiring an escort for the first time. Especially one I find so attractive. But the risks above worry me.

"I \[m18\] am in a relationship with \[f18\]. We have been dating for about 7 months now.

We are both very in love and are still very happy together, we have great communication and rarely get into disagreements and have a lot of respect for each others needs and things like that.

I am not a very emotional person, I am pretty stoic when it comes to most things and rarely let myself get upset over little things, I try and not rely heavily on others for emotional support and when I do I usually talk with my close male friends about these things because I feel like they understand better. I don't completely avoid talking about my own problems with my partner I just prefer not adding any distress to her.

On the other hand, she is very emotional. She has a lot of problems in her family, she is pretty anxious and is really quick to break down. She has a very big heart but she is just a little bit emotionally unstable.

Lately it seems like every time we talk on the phone she starts crying due to whatever current situation is affecting her and I always do my best to console her and help her calm down. I'm want to be the best man I can be and always help her through things but I can't help but feel a little drained always talking her through these things pretty much every day. And it affects my mood a lot especially right after, I don't even feel like talking anymore, just feels like I used all my energy consoling her. I can't help but feel selfish that I feel like this.

I'm not going to say anything obviously, it would be horrible to say ""you are emotional and that is hard on me"" or some thing like that. I don't ever want to make her feel like a burden, but is there a way that I can reframe this type of situation in my mind so I don't find myself feeling so burnt out and sort of feeling like a crutch?

edit: In no way do I resent her or think that she is wrong/bad in any way shape or form for how she is. I love her and mainly just want advice for how I can better control my internal response to these situations.

I had been seeing this guy for close to a year. He was one of my closest friends and we talked constantly every day on text. 

He was getting increasingly affectionate over time and asking to hang out more frequently for longer periods. It felt like a relationship in everything but a label. Everytime I brought up the talk he’d shrug it off and not want to admit to anything. I was intoxicated by him and I had no one else so I kept going. Lesson learned. 

I know he comes from a place of trauma as He was cheated on in his last relationship. 

We spent a lot of time together. Over the last 5-6 months, we spent 1-3 days/nights together every week. some days there is no sex. 

we would go over to each others places - doing our remote jobs side by side on our computers, cuddling, watching shows,cooking together and of course having sex. We have also done other activities like going out to eat, sports, puppy yoga, gym together. I have met some of his friends for sports and hanging out doing group activities. Also did some staycations in nearby cities together. 

Even When we don’t have sex he is very affectionate, cuddling me from behind and giving me kisses on the cheek and lips. Sometimes holding my hand or placing his hand on my thigh while driving. 

When sleeping together at night, he gives me random pecks on the lips/cheeks during the middle of the night and in the morning and intertwines his feet with mine. 

A while back, he was getting jealous of my other guy friends, asking questions and stuff about who I hung out with, until I told him to back off, which he has since then. 

I finally put my foot down and cut it off because he did not want to commit or put a label on it. 

I’ll never understand because we had amazing connection and chemistry. We both have good jobs and rarely fought (until near the end).

It was clear he wanted it both ways - he was getting upset with me for texting friends when we were together and was upset when I didn’t respond to him for a couple of hours. 

When I cut it off he was very upset, accused me of having someone else lined up, said I was tossing him aside and that he meant nothing to me. 

I’m very hurt but I couldn’t continue in that situationship any longer.

I don’t think I can ever trust a guy with my heart and feelings ever again. How do I cope with this and learn to trust others? I also don’t understand how guys can do all of that without feelings?

it’s not a hygiene issue- he actively compliments my bits and bobs and says i’m always clean etc.

"so, i became good friends with this person(Z) because she was best friends with my bf(23m) (now ex).

 she became a best friend to me over time. we would talk &amp; chat all the time despite living in different cities, we’d see each other whenever she was in my city too. she stayed with my ex &amp; i in a hotel room for ex’s bday. she left really early, before his birthday party even, i thought it was really weird but she said she had a family event to attend to. 

soooo here’s where it gets messed up: my ex became physically abusive towards me, she was the first person i called &amp; all she had to say to me was that my ex cheats on me all the time &amp; laughs about it with his best friend. she didn’t give me any more context but i really trusted her. i confronted him and he laughed at me for it, saying i have no evidence of that. we broke up for a few months &amp; Z calls me one day to tell me she’s had a crush on me for a while, i was shocked &amp; confused and i didn’t wanna hurt her feelings so we didn’t really speak after that.

 a few weeks later my ex &amp; i got back together. then i saw notifications from dating apps popping up on his devices, so i looked at his phone one night to see exactly what he was up to, because he told me that he’s an open book. i saw his dating profiles, chats with girls, etc. i see the chat with Z and my heart drops. 

they were seeing each other every time my ex would go to Z’s city (every month or so) and it was obvious they weren’t just hanging out. there were texts talking about how much they loved sexual stuff that happened between them, plans for sleepovers, etc. i was absolutely crushed. 

i confronted my ex, and he beat me and bit me and threw me around because he was embarrassed or shocked that i discovered this deep dark secret. it was sooo traumatising to discover that she had been doing this to me the whole time she was friends with me, and then for ME to get physically assaulted over it was next level. i didn’t speak to Z again until she texted me for something unimportant one day. i didn’t confront her about the texts i had found because she had stopped speaking to both my ex &amp; i at that point. sooo it’s been 2 years &amp; she doesn’t know that i know about their affair. 

the past 2 years, i developed such a severe hatred towards her. she doesn’t even know. she’s about to get married to the man whose apartment she was using to hook up with my ex. he doesn’t even know. 

i obviously should’ve confronted her as soon as i found out, but after being assaulted by my ex i just hated her so much that i didn’t even want to ever hear from her ever again. now it sends a bolt of anger/anxiety through me every so often when i think of it. i am not over it, even 2 years after i found out. 

i would really like to just send her fiancé the screenshots of her having sex in his house when he wasn’t home, but i don’t wanna have that on my conscience if they break up. but how do i forgive with no accountability? no apology? 

so i think the best thing to do is for me to just confront her and let it all out &amp; get some form of closure so i can move on from it. i have struggled for 2 years with letting it go.

"I wanted to say this before getting into the nitty gritty details of what’s going on that I am most likely going to leave. But as this is a very serious situation and I am quite afraid of what to do I feel like maybe some advice from strangers who aren’t part of my inner circle might help. 

I (25f) married my boyfriend (now 32m) of 8 years, and yes I said that right if you do the math. 

First off, my husband has a drinking problem. He gets belligerent and even sometimes racist towards me. Which makes me very uncomfortable and I’ve told him to stop. All his friends and even family recognize he has a problem without saying he has a problem. 

His friends and even brother doesn’t spend as much time with him anymore and even the wives of said friends and brother doesn’t like to be around him. My own friends won’t hangout with me if I bring him along and has even made my sisters husband and my best friends boyfriend extremely uncomfortable with what he says and does. He’s even told my brother in law in a private conversation that basically the way I act around my sisters is different than I do at home and that is something he needs to “change”. 

He expects to be taken care of sexually and almost always has a huge fit whenever I say no and even treats me coldly. I concede sometimes and it makes me feel empty.

I feel like my emotional distress is downplayed by him when he drinks and maybe it’s from my childhood trauma but he doesn’t show that he cares. He shows no self control when alcohol is in the house. Even tonight he drank all the alcohol readily available to him and was just hammered for no reason. 

I’ve told him that I will leave him if he doesn’t change and he’s promised he will but I have not seen any change. He still drinks which has made me not drink anymore because I feel like I can’t be inebriated around him out of worry for myself. I can’t stand his touch tbh and after a very heated night a while ago he wished me and my sisters death.  

When he’s sober it’s not terrible but he does have a temper that sours the nice moments we do have when he’s not drinking. 

When I married him , I believed that things will change for the better but it hasn’t. That is my fault.  I feel like I have no romantic love for him and I have lost hope in our marriage. My family is catholic and I was raised that marriage is sacred but I feel like our marriage is broken. I could try harder but he’s been like this for years without changing. And I don’t think even if he did change, I could love him the same. 

I guess what i am searching for is that I am not crazy for wanting to leave right?

But I'm concerned about the long term affects of our relationship.  We get along pretty well. But when we do bicker, shes quick to say "" we just roommates"".  While she hasn't made that comment since sleeping in different rooms became a norm, I cant feel like it's not fueling that argument.  I don't want us to drift apart.

Otherwise I ""think"" out relationship is healthy. She tries, I try. But I feel this situation could develop into the beginning of the end. Has anyone else experienced an insomnia partner?

"Sorry in advance for any grammar or spelling mistake I make, English is not my mother tongue. Also, sorry for possibly long post.

I've been seeing this guy for 4 months and a half now. Everything's great between us, I love him and he loves me. We have a similar sense of humor, goals and background, and we have slowly progressed towards being boyfriends (we became monogamous early on, we talk everyday and see each other as much as we can, we've gone on vacation together, we've talked about each other to our respective groups of friends...), although we haven't defined the relationship. The only thing we don't agree on is politics: he leans more to the center-right, I to the left. And, while I don't think that's necessarily a deal-breaker, it's been putting a strain on our relationship.

Last week we were chatting and he started complaining about the left and what they are doing with our country. We didn't make it into a fight, but I pushed back a little on some issues and, at the end, he told me that 'the only thing that saves you \[me\] is that you're clever and I hope you will eventually see things my way'. At first I didn't give it much of a thought, but after a couple of hours I found myself still ruminating about it: I don't mind debating with someone I disagree with, but I hate being talked down to, and it's happened a few times now. I thought the mature thing to do was set a boundary, so I wrote him a long-ass text explaining that I don't think I've ever belittled him for his positions and I didn't appreciate him doing it to me. He answered with short sentences, declaring that he wouldn't talk about politics with me again; I told him that's not what I meant, I want us to be able to talk about anything without offending each other, but it was late and we left it there.

The next day I felt him a little cold, so I decided to go straight to the point and ask him if something was wrong. He explained to me that the moment and way I chose to confront him didn't feel right. It wasn't the right way because, while what I meant was a light hearted 'hey, I didn't like this thing you did, could you try to not do it in the future?', I obviously wasn't clear and he felt I was basically accusing him of being abusive. And it wasn't the right time because, at that moment, he was at an office party (I knew that), and also he's been going through a rough patch: he recently broke up with his boyfriend of 10+ years and has moved in with his parents, but doesn't feel comfortable back home; he's also been looking for an apartment and is stressed about the sale, the mortgage, etc.; and, on top of that, he has a very demanding job. So he can't deal with anything else at the moment, he doesn't want our relationship to be something to worry about.

Okay, I get it. It's fair. I told him I understood his point of view, explained where I was coming from and apologized for my choice of words and time. We both agreed to prolong the honeymoon phase. We know it's not sustainable on the long term, it's just something temporary: in a few months, when the rest of his life is less of a chaos, we'll talk about where we're going, set boundaries and see if we can make it work. Meanwhile, he decided we wouldn't talk about politics and I decided to try and let things slide.

After that, things have been good again. Last night, however, we were talking about one of his friends and he told me that 'she's filthy rich but likes to pretend that she's woke'. I said both things aren't mutually exclusive, and told him Karl Marx was married to a very rich woman. It was a light-hearted comment, spiced up with a fun history fact. He answered that woke people are usually like that, aloof and talking about things without ever having worked a day in their lives. I said that usually people don't have the time to theorise about the economical structure of the world after working 12 hours a day in a factory... After a few more texts it was obviously escalating into a debate, so I tried to call it off and leave it for later in the relationship. He again said that he doesn't want to ever discuss politics with me. I told him that in the future, if we end up together, I want us to be able to talk about anything, but I agreed on not discussing it for now. And he said 'well, then don't pick up a fight with me over the stupidest thing'. I apologized and we left it there, it was late, and we both went to bed.

The thing is, I don't think I picked up a fight. We were just talking, and as soon as I saw it was devolving into a debate I tried to stop it. Now I feel like have to walk on eggshells around him, unsure if anything I say will become a discussion I will be blamed for. Because everything can be about politics. Any discussion can easily lead down that road. I love him, and I know he loves me too. And I want to make things easier for him because he's having a hard time. I just... don't know how. I need advice. How do I avoid 'picking up fights' with him?

"My 5-year relationship ended 2 weeks ago when I took the step to break up. However, she was showing signs that there was nothing left between us. We distanced ourselves by her decision for close to a week. During this time, she kept asking me how I was doing and if I had decided something. (I don't know what she meant by it, perhaps she wanted to put the responsibility of the breakup on me. I think this because there seemed to be no other option between us, given her uncertainty about anything.) We broke up 2 years ago when she ended things due to uncertainty in her feelings, expressing that she was feeling empty. The same thing happened this year, with her repeatedly saying that she doesn't know what she wants, and so on.

When I suggested she visit a therapist, she was initially angry but later decided to go. Throughout our distance, she checked on me daily, asking how I was doing and if I had come to any decisions. In our last conversation, she mentioned that the bridge between us had fallen due to my fears of losing her. She felt I made too many compromises and allowed her to do her own things, resulting in losing her. I acknowledge that this might be true, but I also believe that when someone receives such caring, they should respect it and respond in kind. Unfortunately, that didn't happen in our case, and she blamed herself for not doing so.

Then I asked her if she had any hope or willingness to readjust everything or start anew, and she said she didn't know. I then suggested that we should break up, which came as quite a shock to her. I don't think she expected it because I had never taken such a step before. Previously, she was the one who initiated breakup. She thought she would complete therapy course and then decide our next steps. However, I felt that it would be a waste of time for me as I'd likely prolong the process, only for her to eventually decide it's better to break up, so I made the decision.

Now, I'm stressed and trying to move on, but I don't want to. I still hold onto a kind of hope that she might come back and realize that we're right for each other. She has expressed that she wants to be with someone like me and loves me. In the last few days, she deleted my pictures from Instagram, posted moving on quotes, mentioned that 2023 was the worst year, and said that she wants to cry, etc.

"Me(27F) and my fiancee(27M) are engaged for 2 years, together for 4 and planning to get married next year. Overall pretty stable relationship with no children in the picture. Both of us have been working a lot in the recent months due to upcoming promotion cycles. I gained quite a bit weight during that time and I became conscious of it.  

  
Last weekend my fiancee told me he wanted to discuss something with me after the dinner. It is very normal for us. We encourage each other saying what we are not happy about in the relationship. He started his talk by mentioning how hard this topic is for him to discuss and hoped I do not understand him wrong. He mentioned he was losing sexual attraction due to my increased weight. He also suggested if I would be open to spice things up in bed to make things more exciting. Our intimacy frequency has decreased a lot due to ongoing promotion cycles so I understand that point. At that moment I was mostly focused on the weight part and felt hurt to be frank. I did something childish and tried to get back to him by saying if he had a better member down there, everything would be more exciting for me and I would be open to spice things up. I remember the shock in his face and at that moment I realized the mistake I did. I started apologizing seconds after what I said but he just said ""sorry, wish it was something i could change"" with a shaking voice and left. I am satisfied with him in bed and said it just to get back at him in a moment of anger back then.  

  
Since then he refuses even being naked around me. He said he is not comfortable with being intimate. He started locking the door when he is taking shower. I have been apologizing, saying I did not mean it and it was just said to get back at him. I wish I could just go to past and punch myself.

"Need advice- I got the inside scoop on my best friends divorce

So my wife came home tonight in tears after having a night out with her friends and my best friend’s wife who broke the news that she no longer loves him is done with their marriage and is planning for divorce in early January. Supposedly my best friends wife described a side of my friend that I’ve never seen or thought existed, which is a scary thought because I don’t say best friend lightly, I’ve know this guy for 25+ years like blood brothers and, if true, it kills me to hear what he’s become. I’ve known his wife maybe 8 years and they’ve been married 5-6. They have three girls all under 6 that are best friends with my kids and it just breaks me. 

Part of me thinks I need to prep my boy about what’s coming for him and support him in the fight for his marriage, but another part of me doesn’t want to be a gossic girl who intrudes into his personal relationship with judgment and possibly unwelcome advice. I don’t want to miss an opportunity where I could be a catalyst to help them reconcile. Part of me wonders if I should try and talk with his wife about things, maybe talk her off the ledge get her side of the story and see if I can help her mend my friends heart, but I’d hate to stand idly by when I could potentially have an impact on my friends heart and their marriage in a few weeks time. Part of me thinks if I say something maybe it’ll kick his ass into high gear and he’ll fight harder which could potentially save their marriage or at least get it off the cliff and a better track.

This might not be allowed, so I’ll try to find another subreddit, but especially for women, how can you be confident while your significant other is using porn?

Porn is so unrealistic, especially the standard pornhub kind. And “porn” can range from pornhub to OF to twitter to livestreams to tiktok thirst traps to insta bikini pics etc. etc.

A lot of people say porn use is normal and that they aren’t hurt by it, so how?

When my partner uses porn it hurts my feelings. I wish it didn’t. But it makes me feel like he’s saying he likes these people more than me, he wants their bodies and appearance more than mine, i’m not good enough, and if he ever had the change he’d cheat in real life with them and choose them over me. 

So how do you view porn as okay, as not competition or something that could eventually risk your relationship if they’re acting on these urges of getting off to other people they find attractive?

Please don’t be mean. I’m genuinely curious. And i want to feel better about my partners porn use. All i can think is how i have normal boobs and all he looks up is “busty” and other races. I can literally never achieve that. My boobs aren’t even small. Just not pornstar fake or lucky. I can’t change it unless I get gain a ton of weight which would go to other places in my body as well or get a surgery. Also I’m white. i can never change my race to latina or black which he watches. I can literally never be what he looked for. How do i not feel inadequate?

How do i feel secure, like he wouldn’t choose his fave porn category if he got the chance? Or like if his fave “category” was next to us while we were out somewhere, How am i supposed to feel confident while i know that he was in a relationship w me where he could’ve asked for nudes or sex, but instead looked up another woman who has similar qualities to the women we’re around?

For guys, how do you not feel self-concious when your partner watches or fantasizes over guys who have way bigger dicks and/or are taller and/or are of a different race and or/are hotter or more muscular?

Setting boundaries really isn’t what i’m talking about, I could explain in a diff post but i definitely set my boundaries before our relationship and he did it anyway. The porn use already happened so i’m just trying to see if there’s a way to feel confident about myself and the relationship after knowing what he wanted",How do I 19f stop feeling so terrible about my boyfriends 19m’s porn use,18o9ilv,1703230819.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o9ilv/how_do_i_19f_stop_feeling_so_terrible_about_my/,
"I was seeing a therapist for about a year as part of post-ADHD diagnosis. She was pretty awesome - I really got a lot out of the sessions. 

They've technically finished up now, but she offered to check in on me via the message function on the provider's portal. She checked in on how I was doing, I responded, and she wrote back just now. 

I hate to say it, but I use chatgpt a lot and there's no doubt in my mind this is cut and pasted directly from chatGPT3.5. I can tell just by the way it's structured and written, but I also pasted my original message to her into chatgpt with the prompt ""respond to this like a therapist"" and it spat out an almost-identical message to what she sent. There's no question. 

\- I feel a bit let down. a certain therapeutic illusion of care has been pretty shattered. 

\- I really liked her sessions and do NOT want to get her in trouble with her workplace. 

\- She's pretty young, probably really busy, its christmas - it's pretty understandable to lean on AI I guess. 

\- I think she must not realise that cut and pasted ChatGPT responses will be blindingly obvious to many people and it's a pretty terrible idea to keep using it - not just because it seems unethical but also because someone less nice than me could complain and get her fired, surely. 

I believe her colleagues/bosses will have access to the message thread between us. That's my only way to contact her.

I want to write a message to let her know that it's more obvious than she realises and that I'm not mad but do find it a little bit harmful to the therapeutic progress we made, potentially scare her a little into not doing it with other people - but write this all in a way that her bosses won't read it and fire her...

"Hey all, the title is pretty much the summary so I’ll add some context here. 

I am 29 and weigh 238 lbs (108kg) and I’m 5’11 (1.80m). I’ve been pretty much the same since we met. I’m definitely a bit chunky and I know that and want to lose weight for myself on my terms and not for anyone. 

This was pretty much an arranged marriage as we had 1 full conversation prior to getting married. Her father is stricter on the religious end so he didn’t want us talking that much (though based on what I know it’s fine to talk to get to know someone for marriage, there just needs to be someone there; also please don’t talk smack about the man for people that get triggered when very religious people come up, he’s one of the kindest and big hearted people I know and I respect the heck out of him). We got married in feb of this year but due to culture from her family’s side we didn’t move in together until august. Prior to the marriage, I asked several times if she was okay with the marriage and if this was something she wanted because I was looking for someone who wanted to get married. She said she was good. She had other suitors and she said no and her parents accepted that. Additionally, her father, though he’s religious, he cares deeply about his daughters and wouldn’t force them to do anything. I had more conversations with him than her before the marriage. 

In the time from Feb to august, the first week we talked a lot and got to know each other somewhat. But after that she barely kept up a conversation. She blames me for a lack of conversation because I’m “boring” but I don’t know how to keep a conversation with one word answers for whatever questions I ask. Even asking how her day was, I just get “good.” I’ve communicated that I want to hear more about her day but this hasn’t changed.  

In august we stayed with my parents for a couple of months before my final year of school started back up. We hardly had any conversation in that time. There was some turmoil before because I was getting really annoyed by the lack of conversation and lack of building of a relationship. I talked to a friend about this and the friend told me this wasn’t normal. Him and his wife had something similar but they talked everyday and looked forward to talking to each other. Anyway I got my parents involved as a result and this really irritated her and we almost divorced before moving in together. 

She thought sex would fix the issues, I told her it wouldn’t. 

We moved out in the beginning of November for my classes. Since then I’ve made the effort to go to the gym with her everyday since she has that habit. But it’s not just the gym (about 1.5 hours), she walks an hour every morning, some at lunch and then after dinner she walks for another two hours. I talked to a friend about this and he said she seems to be avoiding me.  But she exercised similarly when we were with my parents. That’s why I know about how much she exercises despite me being classes all day—and it’s the same on the weekends. 

I’ve asked if she had any issues with people making fun of her weight when she did schooling in her home country. She said no, nothing other than typical callouts that are common over there.  

Since we moved in together I’ve noticed how closed off her body language is and it’s been more so recently. Not to mention the looks of disgust I’d get for eating a big dinner. Other than that she rarely looks at me when we do talk, whatever little that is. 

We talked recently (we don’t talk often other than how was your day? Good. How was your workout? Good.) and she mentioned that when we first moved up here I snacked a lot (if I was still hungry after dinner I ate a microwave cup of Mac and cheese, 1-2 oranges and at the time we had our own packs of Ferrera rochers and I ate like 1-2 of those as well). She said that my snacking was out of control and disgusted her. After this she asked to make a rule where we just got 1 sweet/savory thing per week each and without the context of the above snacking, I agreed just because I figured it’d be better for my health anyway.

This talk happened last week and normally I think I’m warm and create a relaxed environment and I’ve been giving her time and space for the past 10 months. Since that talk, I know I’ve been cold towards her and I’ve been treating her the way she’s been treating me - one word answers and I don’t look at her. It feels bad because it feels mean, but I’m sick of being treated like this. If weight was such a big issue, she shouldn’t have agreed to further the talks. 

We both know if there had been like 1-2 more decent conversations prior to the marriage, we both would’ve said no. 

I’m looking for a couples counselor with the same religious background, but I don’t even know if it’s worth it, since even on the religious stuff (which was supposed to be our common ground) we disagree a lot. 

My current plan is to find a counselor. She’s going home for the holiday, so I want to tell her to extend that trip because I honestly need the space. I also think she should tell her parents what’s going on because if this ends in divorce, I don’t want them to be surprised or caught off guard. They’re nice people and I have a lot of respect for them.

She looked uneasy, and then told me she had no idea what to get me, hadn't gotten me anything, and that christmas is dumb and we shouldn't be forced to buy people gifts. I told her it was ok, and ultimately, yeah, it is ok in the grand scheme of things it wont matter if I get a gift or not, I still love her deeply.

for me, it's more about the thought or the act of the gift giving itself. I am not so materialistic, and I don't expect some lavish gift; something thoughtful or home made is more than enough. We are both very crafty, and she makes stuff all the time. Even if she made me like a card or something simple it would be enough. The more I think about it, the more it kind of makes me sad. I know she loves me just as much as I love her, our relationship is great. I understand people have different love languages, and gifts are not hers, but I'm wondering if letting this bother me/make me sad is just dumb or materialistic etc...

We also do a lot of shared experiences, dates, and trips together. Maybe I should just focus on those more going forward, and forget gifts? 

TL;DR: I like to make gifts, or get thoughtful gifts for people that I care about, girlfriend has a lot of anxiety around getting gifts for people and told me she might not get me anything for xmas when I told her how excited I was to give her her gift.",Is it bad that I (31m) want some kind of gift for xmas from my partner (27f) of 1 year?,18o9dyu,1703230278.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o9dyu/is_it_bad_that_i_31m_want_some_kind_of_gift_for/,
"I honestly don't know what is considered cheating anymore. My boyfriend of 5 years, first and only guy I've ever actually been with has been following a girl on his insta and is friends with on facebook who's got an onlyfans account and instagram full of naked pictures. My boyfriend told me that SHE added him first and followed him FIRST. I asked him if he could unfollow because it makes me feel comfortable.
He cheated on me before by going on Tinder when I was out of the country for a whole month. He created a Tinder account and was talking to different girls and there was this girl who messaged me and showed me screenshots of him flirting with her asking to hang out. To me, that is CHEATING. Fast forward, I forgave him and I havent really moved on with the fact that it made me feel less of a woman. I've talked to him maybe 3 times about the same issue because I've caught him following and liking girls who lives in our town and literally almost naked on their social medias. I don't know if I'm just overreacting or are my feelings valid? I feel like this is the last straw for me as he wouldnt do anything about it and he's okay with the fact that I am really hurt by this and I dont even know why I'm really hurt but it triggers something in me. We live together and he walks around acts like we are okay but deep down I am crushed. He told me I do the same thing and follow guys and I do follow GUYS I KNOW and arent naked or whatever his reasoning is, I've also told him I dont mind him following women he knows or friends with but this one isnt and I feel like my boyfriend is just making that as an excuse to put the blame on me.

"I (26F) reconnected with my ex (24M) of 8 years ago in November. We were in contact over the years but it was the first time we hung out. Things got good pretty fast. However, he has made it clear since day 1 that he has learned over the years that he is a red flag and is emotionally unavailable, it's just hardwired into his system.

Problem 1. The duality

He says he doesn't know what love means anymore and will never fall in love again, but also tells me that he's terrified that he is, in fact, falling in love with me. His actions point to that too. I now see him comfortably sharing aspects of his life with me that he never confided in people before, and he is very vulnerable with me. Our chemistry is great, we don't cause drama for each other, and we communicate well when we do. He says he doesn't want our dates to end and often holds my face in bed just staring at me and saying he can't believe I'm real. 
However, he disappears for prolonged hours in the day and genuinely forgets things. From the smallest to the biggest. He has ADHD and can't keep track. I struggle with this because I don't stir drama and I keep it in me that I need him to be here more and not just text for 4 hours at the end of the day when he's free. It's not like he ever hid it from me that he gets busy and forgets, it's just that I feel like he doesn't care when that happens. 

Problem 2: He and I have fallen into the role trap where I always ask for hang outs and he always initiates phone calls.  I've hinted at him that he should initiate hangouts but he never does, even though he comes when I initiate it. I don't want him to feel pressured into doing it. How can I tackle this? I feel afraid to express myself and appear pushy. What do I do? I don't want to CHANGE or manipulate him.

Problem 3: I am in love with him again and I think he is sabotaging this on purpose because he thinks he's not good enough for me. 
He always says im the best of the best and he wont ever find anyone remotely close to me. Bjt that realisation pressures him and he self sabotages to avoid the feeling of pending doom. Idk why that is, because he was the one who abandoned me the last time. I won't be able to explain the societal context but he and I will have to face a lot of backlash from the society if we want to be with each other in marriage or a public relationship. It is complicated. Not financially, but morally and culturally. He doesn't have it in him to fight for anyone and I feel like I would fight the world for him. He has always been afraid of taking risks, been afraid of his family's reactions, and I've known him half of his life. And if he turns his back on me this time, I might die from that pain because I haven't moved on from the last break up 8 years ago (age gap caused that break up, he ran away like a coward after 2 years of dating because it is a big deal in our culture, women being older than men is a big deal). 
How do I handle myself and when do I know it's time for me to distance myself from him? I am hopelessly in love but I respect myself.",I (26/F) need help on dealing with my emotionally unavailable partner (24/M) with ADHD.,18o9c71,1703230078.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o9c71/i_26f_need_help_on_dealing_with_my_emotionally/,
"So I (18M) am in an increasingly weird situation with a friend/talking stage(?) of mine (18F). What do I do? 

—- this is a very long post, but I think pretty much all of it is needed since it’s a very weird situation.—- 

Some basic backstory, we “dated” a couple years ago, but nothing really ever came of it, we broke up a couple months later and didn’t talk at all until a couple of months ago. I didn’t talk to her because I heard that she didn’t want me to, which was apparently wrong.

 Anyways, she unblocks me on stuff and all that and started trying to have small conversations with me. This was mostly on Snapchat so just like commenting on things like what I was doing or whatever. 

We hung out a lot in some classes we have because of some mutual friends in there. Then about 2 months ago at a Halloween party she was really flirty with me (probably because I wasn’t in my right mind if you get what I mean) and my friends all told me about how she was into me and blah blah blah. 

I ignored them until a friend of mine (who’s a good friend of hers) told me that I should ask her to hangout. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to, but did it anyways and we hung out about a month ago. It was chill, we got dinner, went to her house and cuddled. That’s it. 

A week later (2 weeks ago) I was at a party with some friends and she texted me asking about “us” and “what are we”. I didn’t really respond, and she came and long story short she kissed me and we madeout. However, before she did that, I was again not in the greatest mindset at that party (she was) and when I tried to make a move on her she backed up, so I felt bad and left it. She then started saying stuff like “cmon (my name)” and “I know you can do it (referring to me kissing her)”. However, I didn’t want to mess up as I already assumed she didn’t want me to since I tried before and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Which I think was the right thing to do, but I don’t think she liked that. I also wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss her anyways, but she kissed me so whatever, it is what it is. 

The day after that she went to some mutual friends and called me a “coward” (she called me something else that starts with a p, but I apparently couldn’t write that on here) for not making a move on her, even though I did. Pretty sure she did this to get my attention since she told 2 of my best friends.

Over the next couple weeks we tried to make plans but we both were genuinely busy so they fell through. 

A couple days ago I had a friend of mine over and we were just chilling playing video games when a friend of the girl this is about texted him to have us both go over there. When he asked about it she said ”(girl’s name) says definitely come if you bring (my name)”. And a mutual friend of ours (the one from above who told me to ask her to hangout) texted me saying to “make sure not to be late”. 

So we went and there was a decent amount of people there. Maybe like 10. But we didn’t even talk to them pretty much the whole time. They were playing a tournament style sport that we couldn’t get into since we were late, so we just threw a football around with her and her brother. It was just an awkward group and I don’t think my friend or I were expecting a large get together like this, rather than like just 4 or 5 people.  

—-Some important info for this next part is she has a friend that she’s gotten really close with recently (and honestly he’s really good looking), however he has a girlfriend. He’s actually a really friendly and nice guy from when I’ve interacted with him, but one of my really close friends actually told me about a week ago that he saw her talking to him a lot at a party in a “supposedly” flirty way, but I brushed it off since he has a girlfriend, and my friend isn’t the most reliable source of information especially since he probably was bouncing off the ceiling at that point. And he ended up saying he wasn’t sure what he saw and that he left to early. This guy also doesn’t seem like the kind of person to do that, but I could be wrong. Although I’ve been a bit suspicious of that guy for a while. —-

Anyways, about an hour later some people left, leaving just a few of us including that other guy. We went to like a forest area and just messed around. Eventually my friend and this other girl went off to do whatever they were gonna do leaving 4 of us. The girl I am sort of in a thing with was hanging with the other guy (not in a romantic way at all, but like it was sorta strange) it went on for the whole time. So I was stuck with just her brother who likes me a lot. At this point I thought this whole thing was weird, considering she wanted me there but was hardly talking to me. I was also getting really suspicious of the other guy, despite him having a girlfriend. Her brother even thought it was weird and asked me what was going on/happening between us. 

Anyways I basically just hung out with her brother and my friend who I ended up finding for a bit before we left. He was equally bored and we left as quick as we could. He even said “it would’ve been more fun to stay at my house and play COD”.

The whole thing seemed weird. This girl wanted me there, and then didn’t talk to me. She even got her friends to text me. But then, she just talked to this other guy to the point that I thought it’d be awkward for me to join in. 

My friends are split between thinking she’s intimidated by me or that she’s trying to make me jealous in a really stupid way. I kinda feel frustrated by her antics and don’t know if I even want to continue whatever this is. It seems super stupid and overly confusing, because I know the next time I see her at a party or 1 on 1 (probably New Years) she will be all over me and will probably want to kiss me at midnight knowing her. 

What do I do? I haven’t snapped her or contacted her at all since this happened. I just think it’s weird that she’d want me there and have her friends tell me to come all for her to just not talk to me. My friends think she’s really into me but immature or afraid of something. 

I’m going to have classes/be interacting with her for the next year so I want to be chill about whatever I do, and I am genuinely friends with her at school, that’s where this all started. 

My question is- what do I do ? What does she want/what is she doing? She almost definitely  is into me, but then does dumb stuff like this. And what’s my best course of action?

"This might be a long one, so I appreciate anyone who gives it a read. Also throw away account as my main includes my name. My partner and I have been together for over 2 years and I am currently 34 weeks pregnant. 

In the first year of our relationship I found out that he did cheat (online only, nothing physical) his reasoning was because he wanted to explore his sexuality and I, although it pained me, understood and stayed with him. Over this past year I have found it hard to move past it, although each month it gets easier and my trust builds back up. But the initial betrayal seems to stay in the back of my mind.

Last night I had a nightmare which woke me up in tears over him being unfaithful (pregnancy dreams are no joke), I told him about it and we ended up arguing over the situation as he is over hearing about my insecurities. During the argument he mentioned how he has a MFF threesome kink which he wants to explore with me if I don’t let my insecurities get in the way. He also mentioned how he doesn’t want a ball and chain relationship. I told him that not only did my insecurities exist but I’m also not interested in women. Don’t get me wrong, women are stunning and I’ve tried sexual relationships with women in the past but they are just not my cup of tea. 

He exclaimed how it’s not fair that I allowed my ex partner the experience (which was not consensual and therefore ruined my view on threesomes) without giving him the opportunity to show me how good it could be. 

After I told him repeatedly how I am pretty sure I know I’m straight, I said that I would consider perhaps getting to know a woman sexually by myself to see if that door is completely shut before having a threesome as the last time truely fucked my head for years. 

The thing is, I’m about to have a child with this man and a part of me wants to leave over this. Another part also wants to give it a go so I can make him happy, though I just feel like it’s not fair on me. How can I work through this with my partner without sacrificing our relationship?

" Throw away account due to embarassment. Here is the back story. My boyfriend Lucas (fake name) (24M) and I (25F) have been dating for the past 4 years. I'm gonna be honest things were rough from the beginning. We moved in together 3 months into our relationship, I was diagnosed with BPD, and he went no contact with his family. We have suffered so much turmoil together, so I just feel so ridiculous for feeling this way. The biggest contention we have had (mostly me) across all 4 years, is just him not feeling like an equal partner in this relationship. It was awful in the first couple years of the relationship. It felt like I was raising a child. He didn't know how to complete basic adult tasks. I would have to chauffer him everywhere. He absolutely refused to meet my parents. He went through several jobs (even ones that I got for him) and would quit over stupid things. He decided to go part-time for a period since he was ""stressed"" and I had to take over more financial responsibilities . I've tried talking to him several times. I have tried breaking up with him several times. But, I just can't. At this point he only has me. Lucas doesn't talk to his family and doesn't really have friends. I am the only person he can rely on. I am just always worried what would happen if I leave?  
I won't say that he is the only problem. I have been struggling with my BPD for the past 2 years. I have had some really low moments in my life, and tend to make rash decisions when overwhelmed. I can't provide the same level of affection and intimacy that he provides. Lucas is really affectionate, almost to the point of clinginess. All of the loves and touches would be great in a normal relationship, but I am the complete opposite. I don't particularly like touching, especially spontaneous touching. I'm not really into being ""intimate"". I try my best to be affectionate, but I know it just comes of as fake.  
So on to the issue at hand. Last year after a lot of turmoil, I finally broke it off. I went to go live with my parents temporarily until my current lease expired. For 3 months straight, Lucas blew up my phone. Messages went from blaming me to begging me to come back. I just couldn't take it anymore and just cracked. I just started new medication and blamed all of my problems on BPD. So, I thought maybe now that I am on new medication things will change. Hindsight, it didn't. It was the same arguments, the same feeling, the same situation. I feel so weak and useless. I can't believe, that I allowed myself to be in the same situation again. I tried to explain how I feel, but most of the time I just ""freeze up"". What am I supposed to tell him?? ""I'm only with you because I feel guilty"" or "" I hate your personality"". It just sounds so heartbreaking in my head, I just end up not saying anything. Once day after a heavy argument, Lucas says that he wants to move out. Long story short we were gonna try ""again"", but I was still under the impression that he was still going to move out. We barely talked for over a month. I took a last minute vacation for 2 weeks. He didn't call me for most of the trip. (Only called for an apartment issue) He completely forgot my birthday.(4th year in a row) I thought that the relationship was reaching the end. But, when I return from vacation; Lucas did a complete 180. He seemed more in love with me than ever. Now I am just lost.  
I started to make plans once Lucas told me he wanted to move out. I have been looking at starting school again, downsizing to a smaller apartment to save money etc... One day Lucas asked me ""So, have you decided where we are moving?"" WE? I didn't say anything and have been avoiding the question whenever it's brought up. A couple of weeks later we were bickering about stupid stuff through text and it led to a big argument. I told him that we need to talk. He blew up at me. Looks like he put 2 and 2 together and realized I was trying to break up with him. I tried to tell him that I'm not happy. I don't feel happy in this relationship, in this home, living the way I am. But, again I just froze. We ended up "" resolving things"" and now I have to change all of my plans. I am so disappointed in myself. Lucas always asks if I love him. I do! But, just not in the way he feels. I would take a bullet for him. I want him to be safe and happy, but the romance that he wants just isn't there. I am so stressed. I am to the point of just wanting to puke thinking about the situation. I don't know what to do. At this point I am willing to change my name and run away.

"So lately iv been feeling a little suspicious of my girlfriend. My gf has been going out alot with her friends. Which doesn't bother me at all. I know she has a life and friends and I'm totally fine with that, however iv caught her in the past lying about her where abouts. She will tell me she is just going to hang out at her Friends house, then end up going to a club without my knowledge. She has also done the same thing and lied to me about being at her friends house when she goes out to house parties instead. I do know for a fact that she is with her friends and she isn't just at some random guys house. And tbh I really dont care if she wants to have a girls night out at the club or if she wants to go to a party. She is a grown adult and i want her to have fun. But what's bothering me is she doesn't let me know, she keeps me in the dark and does these things behind my back and keeps it a secret. For example last time she told me she was just going to hang with her friends she came home and acted like that's all she did, little did I know she was dancing on other guys at the club, which only reason i found out was by seeing a video of her at the club that her friend posted on Instagram. Her friends are the party type, that like to drink and go party every weekend and hook up with guys. Also her friends aren't to fond of me. I don't get why she has to lie to me about her where abouts when she wants to party or go clubbing. Maybe she feels like she'll hurt my feelings or something? I dont really drink or party im a introvert so i enjoy my time at home. I'm also not a controlling type of bf so like I said I don't care if she wants to have fun, but why lie about it. So this has been a problem in the past more than a couple times already. Fast forward to this week, I see her texting her same party friends about going clubbing, with her friends urging her to go despite how I might feel. So today she tells me she is going out with a friend, told me that she wasn't doing anything just going get some food. She told me she'll be gone an hour tops, fast forward a few hours later it's almost midnight and she still hasn't returned home. She text me and told me she doesn't know when she'll be back. She isn't really responding to me, so it's hard to know what she is even doing. I want to know is there a way I can figure out if she is lying about where she went? I dont want to just assume she's cheating or lying. But this has been a problem in the past. Are there certain things I can look out for when she returns home?

"My boyfriend (of 2years) and I were friends for 3 years before dating. He is a very empathetic person and extremely sharp. I fell in love with his gentle and genuine personality, his wit and with how well he teaches! He and I both work in software. I’m an extrovert, he’s an introvert, we make a good team in most things, and I know I can always count on him when I need him.

He’s also kind of lazy haha
I can deal. Sometimes I feel like I have to mom him a little, mostly in establishing of better habits  (like forcing him to go to the optometrist, cut his hair, or brush his teeth if we’ve been up super late and we’re both dead tired and tempted to just sleep). I don’t mind the house stuff as he is always willing to step in if I ask.

Recently however, he had two or three moments where he kind of lost his temper (think like very fleeting moments like if he snaps at me, “I CAN’T” in frustration if I tell him “cmon you got this, just a little more!” -whatever that kind of thing is.

He’s never hit me or threatened me, never yelled at me or called me names. I’ve told him his temper does scare me and I want him to work on it (with me). But he just has this air about him like he doesn’t know how to improve, isn’t convinced he can, and doesn’t seem me as being in it with him. He actually said tonight, “honestly it just feels like it’s going to be me doing all the work. And now I have to work just as hard at home as I do in everything else.”

I smiled and just nicely explained that, well, yes; we should both be working at ourselves and our relationship. And that it will rarely ever be 50:50 if we’re being honest…. But that I’m here for him.

I’m just kind of at a loss here. His almost pre-defeatist attitude makes me wonder if things can get better or if I’m just an idiot. I hate when men are told to man up, but in a way, I feel that. I want him to see the good in and thus desire to be a better man… just as I want to be a better woman. But I kind of feel alone in this. And it has me worried for the long term.

"I broke up with my fiance for the first time almost two years ago, we were together for three years and knew each other for several years before that. my heart still aches for him and I feel like my soul has been absolutely destroyed and just can't be put back together. 

I broke up with him in an effort to do better things for myself. when I did it, we were at a point in our relationship where I was being emotionally and mentally abused. to the point where my friends and family were concerned about me. he would keep me up all night screaming at me and calling me names. and despite how much I loved him, I could not endure the countless fights, blatant gaslighting, and abusive behavior.

after I broke up with him, he spent about six months ""trying to fix things and be a better person"". but yet, patterns resurfaced. i so so badly wanted him to change, to be the amazing person I truly thought him to be, but I knew deep in my heart that things were not going to change. and seeing him would just hurt me more and more. so I basically had to break things off with him a second time, and I haven't spoken to him in a year.

I know I deserved better than that. and yet, my entire being misses him. it's been so long, but i feel like I'm grieving someone who died. I am grieving the loss of him and the person I was before I lost him. I had never been with someone before that I love so much who purposefully tried to make me feel like I was worth nothing, and this confuses me so much, because I truly believed he loved me too. it is so hard for me to accept that this person that I dedicated my heart to and loved so much and thought loved me too could hurt me this badly. 

we had dreams to get married, have children, live in different places and persue our passions together. I built my whole life in my head around him, and since losing him I feel like I have completely lost touch with myself and life in general. like I said, I feel like my soul has been shattered and destroyed.

I’ve been seeing a guy for over a year and a half now. We’re not in a relationship but we’re getting closer to it. He had been telling me he gotta talk to me for like two weeks &amp;he was acting super weird. We kept missing each other bc of our schedules. But now I know he was just avoiding me. So on 12/3 he tells me his son has been getting in trouble a lot &amp; blah blah. We talk about it &amp; leave it at that. Fast forward the next day he text me that he was finally on the way to me so we could talk. Then  he asked if I wanted to go to the studio with him. So we go to the studio bc videographers supposed to be there to record a documentary for his homeboys life. Everything goes well &amp; the car ride was all sad ass songs about love &amp; other bs. So we finally pull up to my house &amp; he says he need to talk to me real quick. Here I was thinking he was about to ask me to be his girl or idk something else. He said he got a different bday gift &amp; was acting scared. Then he wouldn’t say what the gift was.  Once I picked up on his energy I just knew. I was like I already know just say it. He found out on his bday he has a 5 month old son. I been wondering why he was acting so different since his bday weekend but I just thought it was the shit he was already dealing with mentally.  I just knew something else was going on but this was the last thing I thought it would be. And he had the nerve to say they’re not going to be together like I was supposed to be like ok we have a baby to raise.  I was so in shock I couldn’t even process it. I was too busy doing calculations in my head. They did a test &amp; The results come back that it was his baby. She didn’t give the baby his last name or anything. It was so crazy bc right before he picked me up I was talking to my homegirl about it and she was sayin he must got a baby on the way. Which made sense bc why wouldn’t you just call and say whatever you gotta say. He said he’s been trying to tell me but he was trying to wait on the results so he kept prolonging it. He already told his son &amp; he said he’s confused. Like why would you have me go to the studio with you knowing that.I handled it so well bc in my mind how do you not know you have a whole new baby out here. I didn’t get mad or anything.  I just kept trying to find the words or strength. I ended up saying congrats and kept it light. The following day I get on fb to see he posted the baby on his story. The pierced a hole in my heart. I text him thanking him for letting me know to my face. He kept apologizing. Then he told me she was supposed to get an abortion &amp; that it was a drunk one time thing. We went back &amp; forth for awhile but I sent my farewell text. He kept trying to assure me that he’s already talked to her &amp; it’s nothing to be worried about. I couldn’t even ask when he was born to get more accurate dates but it had to be around September October of last year. We had been talking for at least 6 months. Like who is that careless. His mom called me Thursday checking on me &amp; telling me how scared he was to tell me. She tried to apologize &amp; say she didn’t raise him that way. He ended up telling her what I text him. I’m really close with his mom. She was on my side &amp; wants us to work it out but she understands if we can.  He text me Saturday inviting me to his son I’m close with bday party. I agreed to go bc his son doesn’t deserve any of this. Just him being confused that a baby didn’t come from me is weird enough.  I have no one to talk to this about &amp; im private. This is extremely ghetto. I’m so embarrassed. I’m in love with this man but this is honestly a lot for me. Idk what my question even is.

"First I wanna say, this is my first Reddit post and it's a long one so I appreciate anyone who reads it. 

I (19m) was in a relationship for 3 years with who i think was the love of my life (also 19m) we met in 7th grade and were best friends, then we started dating in freshman year of high school.

 We broke up the day before senior year started because we were both going through stuff im our personal lives and it was affecting the relationship so we broke up. A part of that was i was going out of state for college the next year and they were staying in state. 

Since I was with them, I havent been as happy or been able to trust anyone else as much as i trusted them, and i got over them but my mind constantly goes back to them. We started talking again a few months after the break up and decided to be friends but it was more of an Aquantanceship. 

Then about 2 weeks ago (weve been broken up for about a year and 3 months) i was thinking about how maybe if we made a mistake in breaking up and if it was a case of right person, wrong time. Not even thinking, as i was thinking that, they texted me asking if i wanted to be actual friends rather then just Aquantinces. We started talking and catching up pretty regularly. I asked them why they suddenly messaged me asking about being friends and they told me that they just havent been able to trust anyone as much as they trusted me and missed having me in their life and even talked about them coming to visit me in the state i live in now. I started thinking and honestly feel like the stars are aligning that maybe we could get back together now that we're in better places it could work out. It would be long distance but i think we could make it work, afterall we did start dating when I was on the other side of the world on a vacation.

 I started typing out a draft of what i wanted to say to them explaining my feelings and basically pouring my heart out. But i didnt want to just say that. So i asked how they felt about me at this point in time. They said that there is no negative feelings and that they really have again missed having me in their life especially because they havent been able to trust anyone the same or been able to open up to anyone, but then said they didnt want to get back together because of how much we've changed. It kind if put a dent in what i wanted to say so i told them that i also havent been able to trust or open up to anyone the same or been as happy as i was with them since we broke up. I said i didnt know about getting back together because of the distance. They replied that the distance is what they were talking about when they said change. It seemed that we honestly were on the same page and there had to be some feelings, but i was at a loss for what to say. I asked if they had dated anyone else since we broke up and thats when they said that theyre roommate wasnt just their roommate.

That was like a stab in the heart ngl. We had been talking for 2 weeks pretty much every day and they havent once mentioned that their roommate was anything more then just a roommate. I asked how they got together and they said that basically this guy and them both went through a break up around the same time and confided in each other, and became good friends. They decided to be roommates in an appartment together and picked one out and everything as friends. Then 2 weeks before they moved in realized they had feelings for each other and got together. Which to put in a time line was about 2 months after we broke up i believe. I just said i was happy for them and we haven't talked since. That was 4 days ago. To me this sounds like a rebound that bonded by the fact that they were the first person there for each other when they were going through a hard time.

 I honestly dont know what to do anymore. I dont want to pour out my feelings because they are now in a relationship. I thought we were on the same page about missing each other and they told me they werent as happy so I'm kind of just in shock and at a loss. I don't know how to continue or even if I should. 

How do I communicate with them from this point?

"For a few months, I (27M) have been constantly flipping back and forth between ""I love this person unconditionally"" and ""I really want to breakup"". My girlfriend (24F) and I have been together 3 years, living together for a little over 1.

I feel like everything should be great with us. We have overlapping hobbies but also our own interests, we spend a lot of quality time together, we go out, we communicate well, we are on the same page about big life decisions like children, etc. We are on the route to marriage too. We had set a soft timeline around the end of 2024 to start thinking about proposals.

Despite this, something still feels like it's missing. Like any relationship, there are downsides. She doesn't always show interest in what I'm saying, she's on her phone a lot, she can be careless and forgetful, she is pretty clumsy. There are also some health components that prevent her from doing things like hiking or really any traveling in less accessible countries/cities. I typically go with friends for hiking and she needs a wheelchair for trips which can be... frustrating as the designated pusher. But I also know she hates it and would never choose this if she didn't have to.

What I'm really worried about is that I'm attributing personal mental health issues to this decision. I suffer from a lot of anxiety around health and finances. Last week I had a pretty bad breakdown about stagnation in my life and almost made some extreme, rash decisions but calmed down and talked to some friends. Since then I can't sleep without melatonin which I've never had to take before. Part of this was also what I think was guilt about my thoughts of breaking up with her. Long story short on that, I have a plan of action regarding my anxiety that is really helping me put priorities in order. The one thing I'm stuck on is whether I continue this relationship.

I deeply cherish our quality time in the moment, but am so relieved whenever I can be alone. I feel terrible thinking about what she would do if I broke up with her. She makes jokes about dying, and she also makes very little money compared to me and we are in a HCOL area.

I'm completely flummoxed. Every day my mind flipflops on what to do. I know I shouldn't make rash decisions but I also don't know how long I'm supposed to wait. I feel very lost and afraid but I don't want to string her along while I'm just sitting here thinking about a life without her.

"So I (24F) have this friend (28M) that I game with on Xbox for about a year now. At first we just spoke only in parties while we were gaming but our conversations as a group would get pretty deep/intense from time to time so we all are a little closer than most gamers in parties. I ended up asking him for some advice one on one over the phone about a guy I was dating at the time (who ended up being super toxic &amp; emotionally abusive so we broke up) &amp; we just started talking a little more frequently after that conversation like sending each other funny posts on TikTok &amp; IG, sharing deep stories &amp; just developing a genuine friendship. These past few weeks we have talked daily some days for hours &amp; we  both have began kinda crushing on one another, subliminally flirting &amp; implying how we feel. Now mind you, he is in a relationship, not officially technically (no titles) but they have known each other for a few years &amp; he has expressed to me this is a girl he once dated in his past that stayed with him when he was being a jerk back then so he feels like he tweaked on her &amp; he’s doubled back on her a couple months back to date her now that he’s in a better place. &amp; again we were always friends first so he has told me about her &amp; sought out advice just as I did when I was dating the guy I was with. He’s been feeling unsure about her lately so he’s not sure if he wants to make things official but either way I’m just conflicted &amp; confused a bit on how to maneuver this situation. I feel like lines have sorta been crossed now that we are developing feelings for each other &amp; our conversations are a little more flirty but also still genuine like we have a pretty good friendship. I’ve even spoken to the girl he’s dating over the phone sometimes when I’d call &amp; they were together &amp; she also games with us sometimes now. So it’s like now we are slightly becoming friends too… is it possible to still remain friends with him since that is all this originally was?

"Dear reddit community,

**TLDR:** I found out that my boyfriend (29M) has a 5 digit debt that he was hiding from me (30F)\*. For context, this was the second time it has happened. We have a house needing to be down paid soon and I am not sure if I should give him another chance (and proceed with the house) or thoroughly break up with him and forfeit the house.  
My ex-boyfriend has lied repeatedly over his debts and misled me to think he had ""fixed"" his previous debts (of which I helped pay off first, he repaid me gradually). In between, he had ""texting friendships"" with 2 different girls (never culminated to meeting but still...) and I forgave him. The last straw was my latest discovery of his new debt (both times about $16K). To add on, he also squandered a $25K bonus that he had promised he would reserve for his further studies (only has a diploma and no degree) on RPG games' Mystery Boxes(?

*\*Age slightly altered to maintain anonymity as he frequents Reddit. Sorry in advance for the wall of text and for my language. Am not native English speaker.*

&amp;#x200B;

\-

We were dating for marriage and I have discussed finances pretty early on in our relationship - emphasizing savings and being committed to a future. He assures me he saves, just not much but he will improve. About 7 months in, I accidentally discovered his first debt.

I make about x2 of him so I had been paying for 95% of our expenses to help him get back on his feet. We were about to pay down payment on a new house (ready to move in only in a couple of years). He drives a car I pay for and all I asked for was for him to pitch in on the parking fees ($100/month).

I had thought he was making progress and I know it was hard as he had finally went back to school part time and in between repaying me monthly, he had to pay for his school ($8000/year). His reason was that he had to repay me so he had no money for school fees (but after repaying me, he has about $1.4k a month of ""fun"" money if nothing is saved). I just couldn't understand what he was spending on because he lived in my home, drove a car I paid for and I paid for 95% of our expenses (groceries, dates, activities, overseas travel - which wouldn't have happened if I knew he was deepshit in debt a-AGAIN).

Now that I have decided to leave him, he is saying that I have ditched him at his lowest and my love was  ""just this much"" and how much he feels betrayed, that he lied to protect my feelings because he knew I would be upset if he told me the truth about his new debt.

We have been broken up for awhile and he has been telling me that he wants to get back together. The imminent housing situation is also a great consideration (should I forgo it?) because in my city, housing allocation is on a ballot basis and has a lead time of about 3-6 years. I would be so old buying a first apartment if I do not proceed with this current house (and it NEEDS a second male owner for us to qualify).

I have been pondering his words and wondering if I should have given him another chance to make things right (he has $200 in his bank during my discovery of his debt). **Can men change? Should I stay with him to walk him through the darkest time of his life?**

"My fiance  is the sweetest and most darling man I've ever known, he's the light of my life. He'd do anything to make me happy and I know that. We've been together a little over a year, although it feels like much longer. He took me on a romantic date tonight and spoiled me all evening, and ended the night by proposing. It really surprised me and I couldn't be happier to be marrying the love of my life. The only problem...is the ring. 

I feel so superficial for even thinking about it, but it's just off. He gave me an heirloom ring, from his favorite but now deceased grandmother, and it means a lot to his mom (whom I have a good relationship with) that I have it. I think it's so sweet that his family loves me enough to pass it down to me, and I do appreciate the beauty of the ring, but it's not at all me. It's very much something I can picture my own grandmother wearing, and our tastes are VERY different. It really caught me off guard too, because he had asked for sample pictures of rings several months ago when we first started talking about our future, and they all looked pretty similar. 

I know the important thing is that we're engaged and going to be married...should I even bring this up to him? He's such a sweetheart and he's been planning this proposal for months, I hate to break his heart over something if I'm just being superficial. Even if I do need to tell him, I'm not sure how I'd go about telling him gently that I don't find his family heirloom aesthetically pleasing. I can talk to him about anything, I just hate to ruin this.

"Over the past decade, my friend and I have shared a close bond, navigating through various life experiences together. She has had different relationships, and I've had my share of experiences that made me question the dynamics of relationships and how people react in different situations.For about two to three years, my friend was in a seemingly promising relationship. Everything was going well – they were friends before leaping into a romantic relationship. She desired a partner who embodied both responsibility and playfulness. As an outgoing person who loved sports, gaming, and anime, she had a unique blend of extroverted and introverted qualities.

During their dating phase, we were a close-knit trio, and I often played the role of a therapist, helping them navigate through significant arguments and resolving issues. Things seemed to be working out, and they were together for almost three years.

However, as their relationship progressed, my friend and I grew apart, largely due to the challenges of their long-distance relationship. I didn't want to make her boyfriend uncomfortable by hanging out alone with her, so our friendship suffered. Despite occasional hangouts to keep our connection alive, it wasn't the same.She had a childhood best friend and they thought she and I would make a perfect couple. And boy they were right, it was like love at first sight for me and, honestly, I made some mistakes that maybe led me to where I am today. We were like the same person and got along pretty fast and we were talking nonstop for a month. And then I decided to man up and go talk to her about my feelings. At first, she shocked a little and told me she was just out of a big relationship and needed some time to figure stuff out - which I already knew but I tried to show myself as a candidate.- Since I was expecting this outcome I tried to earn her trust and made some stupid decisions. I became overly clingy, attempting to help with her personal issues and being overly involved. In the end, she texted me about some guy she knew from before asked her out and she just went for it and broke my heart. Well, I was angry at her and my friend but what could we do in the end, life is like that sometimes. I heard after ten days they broke up and the stupid I am, went for the second time only to get rejected again.

Listen I don't think I am that ugly, okay maybe I have some weight problems but as I heard from my friends it isn't that bad. My self-esteem was crushed and I didn't want anyone in my life so just worked on myself. Started to go to a gym, focused on my career, started reading books playing games all that.Just when everything got normal, her boyfriend started to get jealous of everyone in her life and limited her life by getting into arguments and tiring each other out. My ""outgoing"" friend couldn't even go out to meet with me and was forced to become an introverted person. About ten to eleven months ago she got in a job and started to get a little bit social again. As you can guess he was too insecure and started to attack the people in her life, including me. Even though I did my best to be there for them when they needed me and saved their relationship a couple of times. She quit her job since it was only for summer but couldn't live with the same limitations anymore. Since there was no one around to fix their relationship stuff, they started to break apart and in the end, she decided to work again and didn't care what he thought. Well, he wasn't that happy with this situation, and one day she and a co-worker (M) stayed late chatting. That was the final blow for him and he left her. Even though he accepted that he was a little insecure about his feelings the damage already has been done. Before they broke up they were thinking about getting back together maybe after a year or so but they decided it wouldn't be possible to live like that and they broke up.

After they broke up, we started to become close again. But I was also close to him and I thought even though she was my best friend I should be supporting both of them since it was a big relationship and they were special. As expected he was in the mix of emotions and started throwing different emotions at me all day. At first, I did my best to help him but I was kinda angry at him because as I learned later they had an argument about me and her being closer than him and she defended our friendship. He and I argued about some stupid thing and I was done with his nonsense. We finished our friendship and, I fully focused on my best friend to make her feel loved and all.

It was 6 months ago since they broke up and everything is so good. We hang out as much as we can, she has her own co-workers and friends, she can go wherever she pleases, we cuddle, we watch anime and TV shows together, and I can do whatever I want in my life it is awesome.

Well, almost a month ago I started to get feelings. I wanted to see more of her, was missing her all day, and wanted to talk about her day. One day she came to my house and fell asleep while we were watching a show and it was the cutest thing ever. And now I don't know what I am going to do with these feelings. At first, there were no feelings and I told her being in a casual relationship with her would be logical and we should do that since both of us can't trust another person. She thought she could get emotional and didn't get interested. But now I have feelings and don't know if I should act on them or not. I love her as a friend so much but also like her a lot.

"So I'm m18 and I was dating a girl f19. We knew eachother years ago and reconnected while I was in the ER and we had like something really special going, at least in terms of my life. She said she wanted to take it slow in the beginning and so I tried but pretty quickly that went out the window kinda unintentionally. I really liked her and I wasn't very attentive to like the speed things were progressing, and occasionally I like had to take a step back but for the most part it was smooth sailing forward. So I left for Florida for 4 days right after she had told me to get a toothbrush for her apt so I cld stay more regularly, and when I did she started talking to her best friend (who is in a ragingly toxic relationship and has a problem with me because I do things like pay on dates and get my gf flowers regularly) and her f***king therapist who put in her head that she needs a break from relationships and in order to love herself we can't be together. So now we're friends and I'm playing it chill and we've had some really good convos about the breakup and potentially getting back together in the future. But like how do I play this, because I'm so p*ssed off about her therapist and her friend ruining everything with their bs opinions and now they've made the idea of her loving herself and her being single inseparable in her mind, and like I could just play it chill and wait if that is the best chance I have of getting her back all together, because I think there is a good chance eventually she will come back, but is there also any way to expedite this process, nothing like bad, but how I can play this whole friendship/break thing the coolest. Also, on the off chance anyone has a way to get her friend out I'm all ears, but like she's pretty deeply entrenched in her life.

"We have been together for a year and everything has been really good. The only thing is that she’s relatively not a sexual person. My understanding was that her sex drive was just low, but she’s recently been considering if she’s asexual. I told her that I didn’t care about sex and could be fine without it. She claims that’s the reason why she asked me if we could ever “just be friends”. However I’m appalled at how she came to ask that question. Does she not realize how devastating that is to me? I kept asking her and was completley patient and understanding her and her reasoning was that she assumed that it was a big deal that she might be asexual and that she doesn’t want me to commit to that. I kept asking if there was some other reason but that’s the only one she gave. She also mentioned not really knowing herself and that scaring her. I just am still in shock about her asking me this. I can’t believe she made the jump from “hey can we maybe not have sex going forward “ to “should we just be friends”. She says she feels awful about making me so insecure about our relationship with that comment, but I feel like there’s no way for me to not take that devastatingly. We were quite a honeymoon couple even 1 year in. Now one complication makes her suggest that we shouldn’t even be together.

"I’ve finally landed a pretty behind closed doors job. I’m set for life, it required many years of training, and it feels like a dream come true, but it also requires being in pretty close proximity with a single team mate. It’s a position that requires being able to anticipate each other’s actions and working in near perfect synergy is crucial for our performance as everything we touch is extremely time sensitive, in some intense situations, ultimately impacting countless people. If we miss even a single detail, it would be quite the hassle. 

Basically, I know the color of the woman’s tooth brush, and no we’ve never had sex. This is normal in our line of work.

From my understanding she hasn’t been able to keep a partner for more than a few months at a time. She has a bit of a reputation. A “curse”, she jokes about. But we’ve been working together for over 3 months and we’ve gotten along great! She calls me her favorite partner thus far, we always have each others backs, and there hasn’t been even the smallest hiccup. Yet, even though it doesn’t look like it on the surface, I can tell people go out of their way not to step on her toes. 

She’s a really private person, though. Not many people on the team have ever even seen her face, and from my understanding only our boss has her phone number.

One of the other guys is recently engaged and he’s also never met her, and the other works in a remote location, so at the very least anything in that realm of thought is unlikely as well.) I see her constantly, as our duty requires we be constantly on the same wavelength, even outside regular business hours. I’m grateful she claims she’s been more open and comfortable with me than anyone she’s ever teamed up with, and I believe her. She’s even told our boss who’s shocked.

Per protocol she also gave me her number, and a couple weeks later (today) I was recommended her sexual content on various platforms. I would never judge her for this, and I don’t want to seem prudish or disrespectful in any way. But should I mention it for consideration? Should I just follow and act unbothered? I know she must see me in her recommended. What if she follows me? It looks like she uses it like a normal account. Nothing special or hidden. I also noticed while I follow my boss and my boss follows me on a few things, there’s no sign of a normal, non-sexual account from my team mate following my boss, so I doubt she’s being “protected”. 

All that in mind, I again mention our openness has to be a bit more in depth than most work relationships, yet I can’t imagine such a thing impacting her performance. I can also tell she greatly respects me, and I would never want to lose that respect over something so silly.

I think I know the right answer. Don’t say anything and, if she ever opens up on her own, support and respect her. I guess I just feel gross keeping a secret from someone who’s only been nothing but kind and patient since I took on this position. I also almost feel almost like I’m letting down the objective by not acknowledging it.

"My 5-year relationship ended 2 weeks ago when I took the step to break up. However, she was showing signs that there was nothing left between us. We distanced ourselves by her decision for close to a week. During this time, she kept asking me how I was doing and if I had decided something. (I don't know what she meant by it, perhaps she wanted to put the responsibility of the breakup on me. I think this because there seemed to be no other option between us, given her uncertainty about anything.) We broke up 2 years ago when she ended things due to uncertainty in her feelings, expressing that she was feeling empty. The same thing happened this year, with her repeatedly saying that she doesn't know what she wants, and so on.

When I suggested she visit a therapist, she was initially angry but later decided to go. Throughout our distance, she checked on me daily, asking how I was doing and if I had come to any decisions. In our last conversation, she mentioned that the bridge between us had fallen due to my fears of losing her. She felt I made too many compromises and allowed her to do her own things, resulting in losing her. I acknowledge that this might be true, but I also believe that when someone receives such caring, they should respect it and respond in kind. Unfortunately, that didn't happen in our case, and she blamed herself for not doing so.

Then I asked her if she had any hope or willingness to readjust everything or start anew, and she said she didn't know. I then suggested that we should break up, which came as quite a shock to her. I don't think she expected it because I had never taken such a step before. Previously, she was the one who initiated breakup. She thought she would complete therapy course and then decide our next steps. However, I felt that it would be a waste of time for me as I'd likely prolong the process, only for her to eventually decide it's better to break up, so I made the decision.

Now, I'm stressed and trying to move on, but I don't want to. I still hold onto a kind of hope that she might come back and realize that we're right for each other. She has expressed that she wants to be with someone like me and loves me. In the last few days, she deleted my pictures from Instagram, posted moving on quotes, mentioned that 2023 was the worst year, and said that she wants to cry, etc.

"Posting this from a throwaway  
  
Over the last few years me (31m) and a friend (27f) have gotten close. Over the last few years we have both dated other people and been generally open about our personal lives. We have been flirty on occasion but never kissed or crossed the line. I was aware she was ""dating"" someone BUT she told me that ""she's just having fun"" and had told me some serious issues with potentially dating this person due to cultural and religious concerns.  
  
Flashforward to last Friday. We were out having some drinks when our flirting took the next step. Before I took her home with me, I asked her if she was dating someone and if she really wanted to do. She said no and yes very clearly. After it was over but before we went to bed she said I love you.  
  
The next morning as I was driving her home she told me that she didn't regret we hooked up but felt ""guilty."" I asked why and she said ""well I am still dating that guy and I don't want this to change things between me and you."" I didn't really say much in response, I was kind of shocked. I do have serious feelings for her. We have been texting the last few days but I won't see her in person until next week. What do I do? First, I kind of feel used, but like I said I do have feelings for her. Second, I feel like a piece of shit because I have been cheated on before. Any advice appreciated.

"Okay so this is gonna be a bit long.
So a couple of months ago I  F30 met a guy M40 online, with older kids, I have 3 smaller kids. We got along and decided to be friends with benefits and made rules, 1] be honest if you start having feelings, 2] we were going to date others but if we had sex with others we'd be honest about it.
When we had this chat he was honest about the fact that he hardly catches feelings or falls in love because he has never experienced how it feels to catch feelings or butterflies etc..
2 months in, Im realizing that I start liking him, I tell him this and that Im scared I'll catch feelings for him. He tells me that he also likes me but at this point he doesnt have feelings or whatever. We decided to see where things were headed. We message everyday, not 24/7 and meet up atleast twice a week. 

Now 2 weeks ago its my birthday and I was going to leave our city for a night and stayover at a B&amp;B elsewhere, asked if he'd join me and he did. He took me to a fancy restaurant and paid for it as a birthday gift which I thought was very nice. Back at the B&amp;B I tell him how I have started having feelings for him and that Im even starting to fall for him. He tells me how he likes me alot, likes being with me and spending time together but that he still doesnt know if he has feelings or whatever. He also stated that coz I have small kids we need to be careful with whatever we decide with which I totally agree and also, I wasnt planning on introducing him to them anytime soon. At this point we both agreed that we're no longer FWBs but not what we are then, its also not even about the sex anymore.. 

Coming monday Im going away for a few weeks, he messaged me randomly saying 'I'll miss you 😝' which I thought was just a joke. When I asked in person if he's really going to miss me he tells me yes, I really like you and its way too long apart. The idiot that I am forgets to ask why and what he likes that he's going to miss.
End of jan is his birthday and he has invited me over, at first I said no coz I dont know anybody but now Ive decided to go and I told him that as well. At the same time Im wondering if he has invited me to be polite coz he has been saying that he's going to celebrate his birthday a couple of times. We've also decided to just tell his friends that we're friends and met on FB.

Anyways, last Tuesday Ive seen him for the last time this year but seeing I wont be leaving the country til Monday, I feel like in between we could just see one another real quick but he has kind of made it clear that he doesnt want that. Which I find weird coz you tell me your going to miss me and will be spamming me with messages ? At the same time, my kids are with me which makes meeting up a bit difficult but he could pop over to my house when they're asleep or whatever. I feel like asking him if he'd like to come over for a quick hug but his mixed signals are holding me back and it also feels like Im the one who needs to initiate things all the time. 

He's always the one to message in the morning saying goodmorning but a goodnight message is very rare. Sometimes we'd be messaging non stop and then he'd stop messaging or just answer with an emoji. Everything is making me so insecure and makes me wonder wether he is using me for the sex or the fact that he is alone and wants some kind of companionship.. I want clear answers from him but at the same time I dont want to keep pushing things and asking him way too much.. 

He knows what happened with my ex and told me how he'll never want to treat me like he did and that he likes taking care of a women. He cooks for me when Im at his house, does all these tiny things which makes me feel like he does care but at the same time I cant let go of that nudging feeling that he just likes me and thats it..

"TL;DR: I’ve noticed over the course of our relationship my partner will sometimes express how she’s feeling by almost word for word repeating the exact thing I had expressed days/weeks before. Has anyone else experienced this or know why this might be?



So we’ve been together a year and half and this happened in the beginning a few times but I didn’t really think too much of it. However lately it’s happened a few times in a pretty short period, and today it was so exactly my words that I had to bring it up to her immediately.

We’ve had a rough 3 months due to life stressors/work/cross country move/career changes but we had a particularly rough week last week. Towards the end of it, I expressed to her that I was feeling insignificant and disrespected because she had been losing her patience with me really easily and was being so short and snippy. I told her that when I would ask questions to clarify something she’d said, she’d respond in a tone that conveyed annoyance and agitation. She didn’t receive this information well and the conversation transitioned without resolve.

Cue tonight. We were out to dinner and the vibes were off. After an uncomfortable conversation, she proceeds to tell me that I’ve been losing my patience with her and have been short and snippy and when she asks clarifying questions my tone conveys agitation. Literally almost word for word how I had expressed it last weekend.

I stopped her and said, no wait…I just said this exact same thing to you last weekend. She seemed confused, and I reminded her that I had told her that this was how I was feeling/my experience of her behavior towards me throughout the week. She looked at me incredulous and said is it so impossible that I would be feeling the same way? I told her it’s not impossible (although, I  know that it was not I who was snippy all week…which is why I told her how hurt I was feeling by it) but that it’s weird that she’s repeating what I had said almost word for word, and yet also didn’t respond well when I expressed I was feeling this way. I told her it was strange that she’s apparently been feeling this way, but couldn’t understand where I was coming from and definitely didn’t bring up her similar feelings then. She told me she was upset that I interrupted her expressing her feelings and the conversation sort of drifted away to addressing that.

I won’t detail the past situations because it’s the same thing just different topics and I hadn’t questioned her about it before. But has anyone had a similar experience with a partner before or have any ideas why someone might do this? To me it feels manipulative (I don’t know for what) but I oddly enough had an ex who would copy my stories and share them with new people we met (before I could) as if they were her own life, so I may be a little sensitive to things that feel disingenuous.",Partner (34F) copies my (30F) emotions??,18ox9jw,1703304556.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18ox9jw/partner_34f_copies_my_30f_emotions/,
"Hey all, I'm finally deciding to let this off my chest because I don't think I can deal with it by myself anymore. I would appreciate any suggestion or advice from y'all. Thanks in advance. 

TL; DR:  Had a dramatic relationship(lasting over 1year) in which my ex boyfriend went back and forth between me and his ex girlfriend, and she used/betrayed me as well. Still feeling traumatized after almost 1 year and having PTSD-like symptoms about the girl. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years before this. Tried everything including therapy. Would appreciate any advice on how to move on and stop being impacted by what she did. 

(If you decide to read the full thing, thanks for your time and sorry for the long read)

So,  I was in a relationship. Everything was normal at first, until March this year I found out he was still seeing his ex girlfriend . Now, this girl and I kinda knew each other from a party (I didn't know they were dating in the first place, before or during my relationship with my ex, and when my ex approached me he appeared to be single).

This girl... She had a very bad reputation. I didn't know why until she happened to me. When she first knew the guy was cheating, she decided to take the blame out on me. She started harassing me everywhere.. Text, social media..you name it. The ""drama"" among us three didn't end until late August this year, after the guy moved.  During this time period, a lot of extremely negative things(at least for me) happened. One time, the girl told me she knew it was the guy all along and wanted to befriend me. I agreed. So we started talking like actual friends. One day, she texted me and was like ""if you want to be with him I'll exit"". She sounded really sincere So I believed her.  The same night, when I was with the guy, she literally called him and was like ""I miss you, come see me""(she didn't know I was with him). Anyway, things like this happened multiple times. Betrayal. Lying. Harassment. I already have bipolar disorder before everything, and during the time I was almost always crying and not sleeping /eating.  Everything got worse. I don't understand why she would use/betray me, when she can also be seen as a ""victim"". Every time I found out that the guy was cheating (e.g.  If I catch him texting her while with me), I would warn her.  I think I've done enough for her. Stupidly enough, right? Yes, my ex was a complete a**hole. But honestly, right now, when everything is in the past, I realized I was more hurt by what the girl did. 

Now, the guy moved and we don't talk anymore. Life is supposed to go back to normal, no? No. I find myself constantly having nightmares about them, especially the girl. I would be on about my day and randomly think of events that took place during this absurd ""relationship"", I would feel tense and unable to breathe. Recently, I can't even go on social media because I will see something completely irrelevant (e.g.,saw a girl with the same bracelet as her on Instagram), get reminded of her, and have the same or even worse physical symptoms. 

I've tried everything. Journaling, meditation, therapy, everything. Nothing worked. I'm still completely fixated on this girl. I'm just... So angry and hurt every time I think of her. I thought of every possibility. Am I hurt because she ""won"" (the guy would always choose her)? Or because she broke my trust again after the guy did so? I don't know. So please, I would appreciate any advice y'all can offer me. I'm desperately wanting to get rid of this haunting past.

"My gf and i have spoken about her going out with friends or her sister and getting wasted.  I live in Canada, and she's in Asia, so she's going out with her friends and sister getting really drunk. She's also tiny, so it doesn't take much for her.

- super slurring with her sentences
- typing all over the place
- not remembering most of the night the next day

We've had a talk before, and our compromise was for her to TRY not getting wasted. (I was unhappy she couldn't commit to not getting wasted).

She's gone out since and just been a lil drunk. But from our talk, until now, she's gotten REALLY wasted 3 times...

And each time we have a talk about it, on how people in relationships shouldn't go out and get WASTED.

She's allowed to go out, have fun, drink.
But in my personal opinion, i dont think you should be getting drunk to the point that you're getting home at 4am, slurring words, not remembering the night.

It has given me anxiety, makes me upset and angry, but i never yell at her. I express how i feel, but she doesnt seem to get why i feel this way when she gets blackout.

Yes, she gets home safe. Yes, she messages me when she's home. But it just makes me uncomfortable. And we had a talk tonight discussing it, and she finally promised to NOT get wasted.

All i want for her is to know her limit (she told me tn that she doesn't know when she's drunk). To say no when someone offers her a free drink when she's already drunk.

Ive told her to plz, go out. Have fun. Get drunk. Be safe. But DONT get obliterated.

She's now upset with me, and i feel like she still doesnt see my view. I get that i made it seem like she has a choice, ""it makes me upset when you get really drunk"", ""but it's your choice to say yes or no to the other drinks that come your way"".

She says there is a clear choice, but im indirectly telling her. I get that point, but i tried before, and she said ""ill try"". Only tn has she finally promised.

I asked her for her password so I could delete the pics and there I find her still talking to him from time to time , I didn't understand much cause I don't speak same language as them, but she was checking on him constantly and was liking his pics, I confronted her about it and the only excuse she have is that she didn't want other friends to notice that they had something, and now that she's with me he don't matter anymore that's why she kept him.

long story

i have a boyfriend of 6 years
i’ve had a crush on one of his friends for most of that time
just a harmless one, nothing too serious, but definitely there and sorta nervous around this friend everytime 
i’ve wanted him to think i’m cool etc
but never really felt that reciprocated from the friendcrush

my boyfriend and i are somewhat open .. we kiss other people at times and it’s fluid based on the moment

the crush on the friend had kind of subsided bc i barely ever see him . BUT a year ago, we were drinking with this friend and he told me “you are more beautiful now than i’ve ever seen you “ 
….. 🙀

heart flop butterflies holy shit moment 

crush reinvigorated lol

i was thinking about this moment all summer and then we were going to see him again this fall
i was really excited bc flirting is fun and it finally felt like he was reciprocating these fun flirty feelings

when we saw each other a few weeks ago, we got fucking drunk and me and friendcrush ended up dancing like all night long
my boyfriend was a lil like “da hail?” but we talked it thru and it’s all good there on that front

but this friend crush has a girlfriend turns out so i texted him with my hangover anxiety regrets and told him sorry if i overstepped a boundary cuz i was dancing up on him. lol. 

he was like oh no it’s all good we were having fun

BUT now it feels so strange between us. we live in different states so we normally interact a lot on social media.  but now he will watch my first instagram story and then not watch the rest. 

 i’m like ugh i just want it to go back to feeling harmlessly flirty but dominantly friendly but i think he must feel bad bc of my boyfriend is my guess. or his gf ?? lol. i just feel like my drunk ass blew it :-/
but i have the opportunity to try to hang with him over christmas 
and i want to know if it will seem desperate or what if i hit him up and try to make amends and jus get back to friendly vibes ?? 
like is it too much to reach out? should i just let it rest? or try to face him and make it better?

"(F 19 M 21), LDR is not easy, and I guess i'm still learning about myself while in a relationship so insecurities are sometimes inevitable for me (F 19).

The thing is, I always see girls posting online about how if you're dating someone you should ""trust your gut and intuition"" if you think your bf is cheating. Then I'll see other girls posting about how their of was so sweet to them their whole relationship and then they find out their partner cheated out of the blue.

This scares me so much. Like, what do you mean ""trust your gut""?! Sometimes I worry my bf is cheating on me even though he's never shown me any red flags in our 11 month relationship. He's the perfect guy, and part of me worries it's too good to be true. He's always kind, reassuring, and has never projected onto me or accused me of cheating, so then why am i so worried?

So I'll have times where I'm constantly worrying that he's cheating, and then I'll be stressed that it's my gut telling me that.

I could use some advice from women who have been in my position before and where my mindset should be at.

Whenever I think about my boyfriend going behind my back and being with another girl I want to throw up.

"Hello Reddit community, 
To give you a quick summary, my now ex-boyfriend and I were together for 3 years and 10 months up until November 2. I broke up with him after dwelling on it for a few month because he is a very emotionally unavailable person. I constantly found myself wondering whether or not he truly loved or cared for me or if he was just comfortable and liked the idea of having me. We started having issues fall of 2022, where I would try to get him to understand how some of his actions caused certain emotions in me but he would get defensive and invalidate my feelings. For some background we both go to separate colleges so we are long distance for most of the semester. He does make the effort to visit every once in while and drives 3 hours. Anywho, last semester, I took the initiative to start a one month break where we had no contact with each other. I explained how the lack of reassurance on his part plus him invalidating my feelings and not making me a priority in his life affected me. He was the type of person who would just wanna play games with me (specifically league of legends) but I would want to have conversations. And whenever he did begrudgingly sit down for these, there was very little input from his part. It just felt like I was talking to a wall. After the break he said he realized how much he cared about me and wanted to try again. He promised to change his habits and be a better boyfriend. He did for a little while but when this semester took place, he reverted back. My needs (emotional and mental) were rarely met and I reached a breaking point and broke up with him. It was hell but he didn’t fight for me and just let me leave and said “I understand and respect your decision.” (Am I weird for wanting and thinking the right thing was for him to fight and prove me wrong). Anywho, to give you an idea of what I said.I wrote the following verbatim: “Yesterday, I decided to read through our messages of the past year. I read every single paragraph that I ever sent you explaining when there was an issue that we were having and here's what I noticed. My feelings sometimes got addressed.  When they didn’t I would pretend and forget the problem until it came up again. And the times we did try to talk about my feelings the problem would never get solved and then we would  go back to the same issue(which is that you were emotionally unavailable). You can see how this can get tiring especially after a year right? The messages went back up till November of 2022. All I wanted was to feel like a priority, have constructive conversations, reassurance and most importantly your words (that you love and cared about me). I don't think that it is a lot to ask for. But clearly, my tears, the many and long paragraphs, not even a break could change any of that. During the break I made myself a promise: that is, I would never allow myself to feel like this again especially because of a relationship. So after thinking of all this, I think that the best move for my emotional and mental health is to end things with you. One year of emotional ups and downs and breakdowns is enough to drive me to this point. I have lost all hope or happiness that this relationship could bring me at this very moment. Maybe it's the situation? Distance? Maybe it's just me? I just know how I am, what I need, and that I'm not getting what I need from you emotionally. And this is bringing me constant sadness, disappointment, and breakdowns. The longer I stay experiencing these feelings, the more resentful I become. Of course, this will never change the fact that I care and love you. I can't be your girlfriend and treat you right. And as for dealing with my dad and driving down to see me, that is something I will always appreciate. And that is something I won’t forget. But that doesn’t change nor help the fact that we are growing apart. My dad was an obstacle we overcame together but we just couldn't seem to overcome the last one. Hopefully I was able to make you happy and allow you to grow while we were together. Also I don’t want you holding onto to hope that I am being rash because I’ve been thinking about this for some quite some time now and I’ve only been able to do it now because it was a decision I had to make for myself and my own happiness.”
I did my best to not be petty or mean about this because all I wanted was hope. I had given up. Fast forward to LITERALLY, today, he texts me “I’m home and it feels so empty.” We then started a conversation where I was once again explaining that the reason I broke up with him wasn’t because our conflicting time schedules, but because of his lack of response and reassurance to my feelings. I would have a breakdown and cry in front of this man and he wouldn’t do anything about it. I’ve never gotten flowers in our almost four years. Now you may thinking, girl why are you even entertaining this. He’s my first everything and I hold on string. I love him regardless of his flaws and shortcomings. We have had so many good memories and spent our formative years together. He’s is intrinsically a good person and has good intentions at heart, he just hasn’t matured and didn’t know how to love properly. I know it’s not my job to teach him but I don’t want to have any regrets knowing that he could possibly change.

"My situation and a coworker

So I had a crush on a HR(Female) who interviewed me. We are working at the same place but different departments. We texted and got to know each other a little bit. I then asked her out,  she didn’t directly rejected me but instead change topics. 

After some days, I saw her and gave her some snacks. And she texted me to thanks me about the snacks. And I stopped texting with her, she then sent me her pet cat at night. And we continued to chat. After a few days, a guy who drove to the company and picked her up. So I thought cool, maybe she had a boyfriend. So I moved on and stopped talking with her. 

Then she in the next few days texted me to give me some snacks again. And she hinted me: “ everyone is just coworkers, if you really like someone, stay in a professional  relationship possible.“

"So my friend (24M) and I (23F) have been friends for about 10 years. We’ve had feelings for each other on and off throughout the friendship but never acted on anything other than kissing because the timing was never right. He moved away from our hometown 6 years ago and we only saw each other a few times throughout the years but we always stayed in touch and have helped each other through a lot of hard times. 

When he got a gf 2 years ago, it was shortly after we’d both said we had feelings for each other and wanted to make things work but once again the timing just wasn’t going to make it easy - he was still in the Coast Guard and I was still in college in different states. So then he started dating this girl for 2 years and a few months ago (September) he texted me after barely communicating with me while me he dated her telling me he was moving back to our hometown and they had broken up. 

We hung out a few times and he told me how he doesn’t regret his relationship with her but often wondered why he hadn’t tried to make things work with me since we have always had a connection. I thought that the timing was finally right for us - both single and living in the same state. But then, as we started talking and hanging out more, he eventually kissed me and after about another 2 weeks, he got really distant and said he was really sorry but he was still mourning his last relationship and needed to figure out who he was without her and living back in his hometown alone. 

I was really hurt by this and felt like an emotional rebound but I told him I understood and that I would be there for him as his friend since we’ve always been there for each other. Well, now fast forward 2 months, and we’ve continued to stay in touch but have not hung out again. He asked for me to be patient with him and says things like “I want to want to hang out with you and talk to you more and be the guy you remember but I just can’t right now and I can’t give you an answer why because I don’t even know why I feel this way, I just do.” To me, he seems depressed but he also won’t open up to me right now even though he says he wants to and just needs time and patience. He’s also said to me that he wants me to be in his life forever no matter what way that may be. To me, he is the person I want to spend my life with but I’m scared to become too invested if he never feels the same. 

I care about him so much but I’m scared of getting hurt if I wait for him and he decides to move on with someone else instead. Does it seem like he is being truthful or just trying to let me down easy? I just can’t stop thinking about why he would reach out to me then get scared to be vulnerable with me when we’ve always been open with each other.","My long time friend (24M) reached out to me (23F) after him and his ex broke up, now I’m confused and don’t know what his intentions are.",18o7khf,1703223198.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o7khf/my_long_time_friend_24m_reached_out_to_me_23f/,
"this might seem like a dumb question, but im genuinely having a hard time saying the words to my boyfriend because i don’t want to say it too soon.

for context, my (25f) boyfriend (23m) and i have been in a relationship for 3 months now. we’ve been dating and going out together for about 5 months. i already get the feeling that he might be the one for me. there are many small contributing factors that have led me to this point, but i don’t want to get into too much detail and make this super long. 

i guess what is making me hesitant is that he hasn’t been in a super long or serious relationship before me. the longest was 4 months but that was when he was in high school and that gf unfortunately cheated on him. me on the other hand, was previously in a relationship for 5 years and i lived with my ex for 2-3 years. 

i’m afraid that he might not be ready to say it back, but there’s also a part of me that thinks he might. we’ve already talked about going on a trip together to japan after he graduates university. he also recently told me we were meant to be. maybe this doesn’t mean much, but i have a hard time believing someone who isn’t serious about me and loves me would say things like that.

"I am (27M) an empath and a people pleaser by nature. I have low self-esteem, seek validation from others and I am rarely setting any boundaries.

My gf (29F) and I have been together for 6 months. In the first few months she love bombed me as hard as no one ever did it. It felt like in a dream. Everything was great, however sometimes she got a little weird when we did not spent a few days together. It felt like she lost her trust in me, because she usually starts to create super bad theories in her head about whats happening, when she is not in control.

Jumping to the present. In just 6 months, she slowly started to insist that we spend less and less time together. First she decided that on weekdays we will only sleep together (and do not meet during the day), later on she insisted that we should treat saturdays like one of the weekdays because we spend too much time together. She has no job and basically does nothing, but she felt that she can not move forward with her life, because she spends too much time with me (a guy with a 40hr/week job + producer&amp;dj)

I have a huge fear of abadonment, but I accepted her decision in this, but felt horrible and still twists my stomach to see all this happening. From only wanting to spend time with me, to pulling away this hard in just 6 months. Now if we spend a few full days together, she starts to get mean and talks to me in a passive aggressive way. She says this is because she likes to be alone and did not have an alone time in the past few days. On days she love bombs me with small things like attention and small gifts and on other days she just doesnt care at all about me.

Every time we try to talk about something, she feels attacked and in the end of the conversation of course, I become the bad guy. For example, we went to our first party together where she was acting super weird (not caring about me, not speaking to me, not dancing with me). So I started to ignore her comletely and she just turned 180 really qucikly, I became important and she became touchy and loving, however I was not caring about her at this point, just wanted to enjoy the party. At the end, I became the bad guy in the story for treating her that poorly the whole night.


Based on the events of the past few months, my soul and heart is just broken. We had a few conversations about how shitty I feel abour her pulling away and that I am constantly in tears… she said it is not her mistake because I did not said that it feels bad to me that she needs to spend time alone (which is true I guess, because I was not communicating my needs?)
This is my 4th night barely sleeping… I am not sure what to do… I was already thinking about breaking up with her, however I somehow want to twist things a bit and I was thinking maybe I should be with her a bit longer and try to develop a healthy self-love and boundary setting in this realtionship, so in the next, I will not make the same mistakes.",Is my (27M) gf (29F) of 6 months a narcissist?,18o7hox,1703222932.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o7hox/is_my_27m_gf_29f_of_6_months_a_narcissist/,

We’ve been together for 14+ months Usually I don’t believe in “breaks” but trying to make things work in one way or another. But she suggested we go on a break in the relationship a month ago and we’ve been talking every day nearly. And she’s been sounding so uninterested in spending nye with me. Me personally I want to spend the holidays with her and get new years kiss or whatever, yk, usually I feel alone around that time too without anyone. She’s agreed on trying to make Christmas work and spending it with my family in the afternoon. We’ve got her gifts. Her parents think we broke up. 
I’m a hopeless romantic in a way lmao. I want to enjoy holding her and such and I’m sure she wants to enjoy holding me but I think nye should be a day to spend with a lover and the romance of spending nye together or even hitting the bars together.
 She thinks it’s not a big deal if we don’t  spend that day together. And I’m just like urghhh. Idk how this could ever work if we both don’t see the romance in spending nye together or whatever. Like ima hate myself for spending that day and night alone. And why would she not want to. Why would we even do Christmas if we aren’t doing new years. Idek man, what should I do?

"        My boyfriend (20) and I (21) have been dating for a year, and we were casually seeing each other for roughly 8 months before then. I am very much in love with him and he treats me with the utmost respect… except for when it comes to my time. Regardless of what time it is when we make plans, he is always at least 10-30 minutes late. This used to be even worse, where I would be waiting upward of an hour or two for him to come over. He is very busy and has ADHD, which makes it hard for him to manage him time. But I am tired of constantly waiting on him to arrive on time to events, get ready in a timely manner, and to show up at the time he says he will.
        It is a big priority to me that he shows up on time when we make plans, but I find it hard to be upset at him immediately after he shows up because he is always bringing me little gifts right as he walks in the door. Food, trinkets, crafts, almost every time he shows up he gives me something sentimental. I love and appreciate these things that he does for me, and they always put a smile on my face.

"

This is my first post ever but I’ll try to explain my situation the best possible. Also English isn’t my first language.

Me(24M) and my “partner”(23NB) were together for 5 years, we have a great relationship, helped each other grow and have lots of fun together. We were always there for each other no matter the challenges, we supported each other on our most difficult days and we always managed to bounce back together, people called us a “power couple”. But currently the relationship is in a tricky situation. 

As of 2022 I went abroad to study, meaning that the relationship turned into a long distance, we knew it would be difficult, and we did our best to keep contact, communicate our feelings, and have online dates. The year went by well, and they even visited me in early 2023! We kept talking and planning for them to eventually move in with me and try to start our lives in this different country. We were certain of it and we’re looking up the best ways to do that. 

That’s when the problems started.
The process for them to move in with me is fairly simple, just do some documents to prove we’re in a relationship (or marry) and it’s smooth sailing. Their family was willing to financially support us for the first year, and with my own family and money from jobs, we’d be able to live comfortably for 1-2 years before having to be fully independent. And that prospect really ramped how early they wanted us both to move forward with our plans, but the issue was that I wanted to complete my studies first before taking them in, as I am still in my school residence, and my parents also didn’t support this choice of my “partner” to move in earlier, they also take marriage and things related to it very seriously, while their family have a much lighter view of marriages. So we got into a stalemate.

By the middle of October something happened, this distance and time apart affected them really badly, they were having breakdowns and suffering a lot, I tried to cheer them up but it was too much for them, so they called me and they told me they wanted to take a break from the relationship and try focusing on themselves, since the expectations and having me in their head so much was stopping them from progressing professionally and was damaging them mentally too much, that’s also why I refer to them as “partner”, though we didn’t officially break-up, we’re not in a active relationship. Well, I guess this is a breakup lol. 

I took it fairly well at first, I could understand their reasonings and I could tell how much they thought about this decision, so I respected and gave them the space they needed. 

A month and a half later, things kept happening, I got a new job and my grades went up, while they took tattooing classes and started to move out from their mothers house. Part of me started to feel that our relationship was indeed the issue, and that they were better off without me in their life. But we talked so much about our life’s together, that experience of having them visit me really allowed me to see a great future with them, and I didn’t want to lose that. I broke down, had many panic attacks, took drugs for the first time of my life, got drunk, all this to try to escape myself, this person was stuck in my head and I kept creating the worse scenarios. After a couple days I called them and told my feelings, they were really concerned, understanding and assured that they still had feelings for me but was uncertain what they wanted for the future, they also said that they didn’t wanted to do long distance anymore and that we could do more calls to talk about the relationship and plans, but only after I calmed down and thought about my personal goals.

Since we both have lots of things to do for this end of the year, I decided to wait to make this call after the holidays, I’ve been talking to a therapist and she’s really helping me organize my feelings and focus my goals and dreams with or without my “partner”, I also expressed myself to my family about how I feel regarding my “partner” and got their full support if we decide to get together even as I’m still studying, since I’m heading to my last semester.

So things got clearer on my end, asking for help and communicating cleared up a lot of doubts and fears I had for a long time, I know what kind of life I want now. I was too afraid to be open and honest, also the long distance damaged our relationship and the feelings they had of me, but I don’t believe it’s completely over. I knew that the feelings I had were real, I just failed to act and communicate my fears to them, and my silence made them feel like I wasn’t as serious as they were, I don’t want to lose this person, I know I need to at least try.

I’ll message them after new years to arrange the call, I’m confident on what I want to do and say, but part of me is really scared of what can happen. I want to spend my life with this person, I want to marry them, I love them so much that the prospects that I’ll never be able to love them again hurts too much. I know that the choice is up to them and I’ll respect whatever they say, but every day we’re on this break I just feel like they’re fading away. 

We still message each other sometimes, just for casual conversations, and we’re still in the same friend group and chats, part of me knows that doing this isn’t the most healthy way to do things, but I’m not ready to go fully zero contact yet… every time we message each other, my thoughts and words swell up in my mouth and I want to just vomit them out, it both nice and painful to message them.

After some therapy sessions, taking with friends and families and thinking on myself, I know what are my goals, the reasons I went abroad, and what I want to do in this next stage of my life. These goals are mine only and I won’t stop or give up on them for anything, but I know that if I could do all these things with this person, it would be a much happier life. I’d love to chase after my dreams, help and support them chase theirs, and grow our own dreams and goals together. We matured a lot since 2022, we got both life and work experience that we didn’t have back then, we faced challenges and hardships and are more focused, I know that we’ll never be fully ready for this, they felt ready earlier than me, but now I know I am too. I trust in them, in the relationship we built and what we planned for our future.

I wasn’t ready then, but I’m ready now.

Now my questions is, should I keep the contact we have until this call I have planned? Am I doing the right things? I want them to really see that I’m confident, also, should I try to show them that I’m still interested or that I’m feeling more confident on myself before the call? I feel that just dumping everything at once might be too much… I’m not sure if I’m ready for this call, even if I know what to say.",I(24M) want to prove to my partner(23NB) that I’m ready for the next step.,18o7eir,1703222610.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o7eir/i24m_want_to_prove_to_my_partner23nb_that_im/,
"My wife and I agreed to go on a two week trip to another country with another couple. We’ve been good friends who’ve known each other for years, though I wouldn’t classify us as besties.  This will be our first trip together and now that we booked tickets my anxiety is through the roof. My wife and I have done couple’s trips before, and most of those trips sucked balls and led to our friendships drifting apart afterwards. 

We noticed this happens for one of the following reasons: 
A) We find that there is zero chemistry between us.
B) There is chemistry but because we’re spending so much time together we get sick of each other. 

I’m primarily concerned about reason B and this is where I’d love to hear your advice. I know that a good way to avoid having this happen is to allot some alone time for just my wife and me during the trip, but we don’t know HOW.  

We’re both the type of ppl who cannot be the first one to end a conversation even though we’re not vested in the convo and we so badly want to escape it. With that comes the inability to be the one to suggest that we spend some time apart during a trip or to give others some space so they don’t feel like they’re being suffocated by our constant presence.

I’m sure there are some underlying anxious attachment issues at play that make us hypersensitive to the moods of others. We have to make a conscious effort to stop catering to everything that others want and not lose our own independence but sometimes we end up going too far and come off cold or as assholes.

TLDR;  I’m a married man anxious about an upcoming trip with another couple bc I don’t want to encounter the possibility of this friendship drifting away.

"phone post so sorry in advance for weird formatting.

so i (24f) have been in a relationship with my bf (24m) for 3 years. around a year and a half ago he had to move for work to a different state across the country, which we were obviously gutted about, but decided to try long distance. so far it’s been going well. 

he has a friend (26f) he’s known for like 5 years who’s recently moved to a state next to his. they are close friends and he’s said before he sees her as a sister. 

i trust my bf, i honestly do. and the friend isn’t like other girl friends of bf’s that you see on here, i’ve spoken with her before, even met her twice and she seems like a genuinely nice person. 

the problem lies in the fact that they’re just really close? she calls him a lot, usually at any time of the day. whenever she goes to stay around they sleep in the same bed, but because it’s a big bed, it’s okay. they’ve posed suggestively in photos together as a joke. she posts him a lot in her social media and so does he. there are 3 photos of me and my bf on his instagram but at least 6/7 of them. 

i feel like im being stupid and delusional. i don’t want to think about worse case scenario. i feel like maybe it’s just my insecurities about being long distance, especially because my love language is physical touch and of course, that’s difficult in an ldr.

but that the same time i really don’t like how it makes me feel. but i don’t know how to bring this up or even how to start the conversation because im scared it’ll seem like im accusing him of something or being the jealous partner. im not. i trust him completely but i just dont know what to do. i also struggle to articulate how i feel, its hard for me to make sense of what im feeling let alone convey that in a way the other people can understand. 

i did try to lightly brush the topic last week but i was given the ‘she’s literally like my sister, it’s not weird’ response. 

in some way i feel like im scared of bringing the topic up properly. we’ve talked about our future together and how we’re gonna move in together once he moves back. i’ve met his parents and vice-versa. what if he thinks im overreacting or something? im just getting worse case scenarios in my head and i dont know which is worse, that he could be cheating or he might feel like im being too insecure/jealous and that im making him choose between me and her.

I came out later in life at the age of 27. Never had a serious relationship growing up. Nothing more than a couple of high school things nothing ever more serious than that. I was an athlete growing up so all my spare time was spent training and playing. I never had any time for social gatherings ect so sex and relationships were never really on my radar even in my early 20s. 

So after coming out I was shit scared of the sex side of things being a “baby gay” and having zero sexual experience at all! I stayed off dating sights for about 8months after coming out just to ease into everything and gain my confidence. Coming out was a surprisingly easy experience, which I am very privileged to have experienced. And I was extremely lucky, that I found my absolutely amazing now fiancé 12months after coming out. 

So here lies the problem, my fiancé is amazing in terms of accomodating my nervousness I have recently developed around sex. At the beginning of our relationship I was nervous during sex but was able to overcome it with my finance’s help but recently I am finding it really hard to overcome the nervousness. 

I know I probably need some psychological help but you know, that costs a lot of money which I just don’t have 🥺. 

So reddit, help me please xx",HELP!! Why am I so nervous during sexual experiences???? 31NB &amp; 27F,18o79d9,1703222100.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o79d9/help_why_am_i_so_nervous_during_sexual/,
"        My boyfriend (20) and I (21) have been dating for a year, and we were casually seeing each other for roughly 8 months before then. I am very much in love with him and he treats me with the utmost respect… except for when it comes to my time. Regardless of what time it is when we make plans, he is always at least 10-30 minutes late. This used to be even worse, where I would be waiting upward of an hour or two for him to come over. He is very busy and has ADHD, which makes it hard for him to manage him time. But I am tired of constantly waiting on him to arrive on time to events, get ready in a timely manner, and to show up at the time he says he will.
        It is a big priority to me that he shows up on time when we make plans, but I find it hard to be upset at him immediately after he shows up because he is always bringing me little gifts right as he walks in the door. Food, trinkets, crafts, almost every time he shows up he gives me something sentimental. I love and appreciate these things that he does for me, and they always put a smile on my face. 
        I know that we are young and there is “room for improvement,” but his lack of urgency and his tardiness is honestly becoming a turnoff. I have talked to him about this more than I can count on my fingers and toes.

"Am I bored or have I fallen out of love?

I met this girl in university which I have been living together with for 8 years now. We started off really good, it was fun and we were both intrested in each other, but she was more into me as I was in her, there were some things I was letting slide hoping that it would change in future as we get older and grow up. Some things changed, some not. After sometime - 1,2years , after honeymoon phase, we often argued about each other flaws to work on ourselves, to grow and learn from but of course it damages somewhat the feeling along the way I have about her. 

She is really supportive, helpful, caring, loving, really into kids and would be great mother but I have noticed that she lacks logical thinking which I hoped that would grow along with me, as we get older. That illogical thinking with her actions triggers me and makes me feel bad about her, that she is not the one I could trust with some tasks/things to do, as I would make sure thay it has been done correctly. Also it makes me feel bad because then my anger  comes out, which I always try to control and I sometimes make dumb comments about her decisions/illogical thinking which I after feel really bad about saying as I know she is trying her best, but it just doesn’t work for her. 
Sometimes when we argue I feel that I spend energy where it shouldn’t be spent as it gets repatetive and happens again. In the end our mood is down and I feel bad about that. 

We don’t have much to talk about, we have few seasonal hobbys we enjoy together, but also we sometimes get into arguing over that as well. We both are to blame there.

Lately I have noticed that I have been feeling wrong about myself - lost my motiviation, concentration, my spark about some things and myself, getting back into shape, feeling mild depression from time to time, questioning my self what am I doing with my life, wondering about my purpose, lost connections with friends and being more antisocial (but because it is more peaceful at home not because she is to blame), as I am feeling lazy and comfortable around her. As our time ticks I don’t want to spend my rest of life being unproductive working 9-5 getting somewhat good money and being boring, not having friends and not having fun with the other one that I chose to spend my life with. I have always dreamed about having more in life than just 9-5 and being a loser that have no friends, do some things that are just for killing time. She has too, but its the reality that does not transfer into action towards such life from both of us. ( I guess we are waiting both to each othet to make some magic move to have our future closer to our goal)

She supports me whatever I do and would sacrifice and do a lot for me, BUT thats the problem that she has no ideas on anything her self, she just rides along and it makes me ride along with myself and not taking control of our/my life. Kind of feel like I have to always think about what should we talk about, what should we do next in our life without getting inspiration from parner. ( I have understood that people around me gives me motivation and spark - when someone is around with the same energy).

I know that it would be easy to just start working on myself while keeping the relationship, I have tried multiple times, but it just dies down after short time.
 I am not sure if I love her anymore as I did 2 years back, I feel like I have been doing things for her because she deserves it - as she is so good person, as I should as her partner. Also my sex drive has died down as it was before, I don’t have the mood for it often, but I do because of her than myself. 
I have met new people, which I have more intrested in (at least thats what I believe) to talk about, joke with - more with my sense of humor and intrest. Hers sense of humor is often cringey to me which is also what I value - good sense of humor.

I feel guilty that I have lived with her for so long, I also proposed to her 6months ago as I was hearing about it from family, her and I kind of felt for some time that I should propose, but wasn’t 100% sure. Did it to also help me get the spark back, change the feeling, but now I think I regret it, (but it made me really question myself and start with tearing myself apart, so maybe it was for good). I feel bad after telling her this, explained that I don’t feel happy that often anymore and I know (and she has noticed) that I am not giving her the 100% love and attention as she is giving me, but I know I should, I just don’t feel that way anymore for some reason. I feel bad about the thought - to leave for a hope to find someone better as I have been lone with no real close friends anymore and thinking that maybe I just need to settle with what I have. As she would be my only close friend.

I feel like I have outgrown her and it would be the “kick” for my change to get my life together and stop feeling so bad about my life. Maybe it is the “near 30 years of age”, that have woken me up to reflect on my life as a last warning to be happy.
I am not sure if I wouldn’t regret to breakup, just because I was maybe bored or I was being selfish. I feel like if she would really be the one, I wouldn’t have come to these thoughts and wouldn’t question and doubt myself..?",Am I bored or am I falling out of love - 27M and 27F?,18o74tp,1703221667.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o74tp/am_i_bored_or_am_i_falling_out_of_love_27m_and_27f/,
"My bf and I have been together for almost 3 months. About a week ago he told he feels like, for the past ~1.5 yrs, he has had feelings for someone else. He initially said he wanted to break up because he said it wouldn’t be fair for me to stay together, but remained adamant that he wanted to be with me. He claims that he doesn’t want to be with this other girl whom he never dated, but regrets not “seeing it through”. It confused me because he says he really likes and cares about me, but felt guilty that he was periodically thinking about/regretting how things ended between him and this girl. He explained that he and this girl mutually ghosted one another and he regrets being too prideful to reach out again. I also know this girl personally and have been able to verify that this is all true, although she and him are not friends. I told him I needed to think about it after he spoke and he changed his mind, saying he didn’t want to break up anymore. I never suspected anything like this and he’s never made me feel like he wasn’t/isn’t faithful. He’s introduced me to all his friends, posted pics of us, and told his parents even though he is not close to them and doesn’t speak to them often. 
And for context, this relationship was his idea and he convinced me to date him although I was hesitant. He claims he didn’t think abt this past situation until after we started dating, and that he feels guilty because he is “very happy with me” and “doesn’t want to lose me because he thinks I’m perfect”. He briefly dated someone else prior to me and after this girl he thinks about, but it was a few months before he and I met. 
I’m conflicted because he keeps saying he wants to be with me, but I wonder if it’s best for me to leave, even though our relationship was otherwise fine.

"Hi, I’m looking for advice on what to do about my sister cheating on her long term boyfriend. They’ve been together for probably about 6-7 years now and he is REALLY freaking good to her. She’s 33 years old, lives in his house and pays no bills. She’s also had serious drug and/or alcohol problems since around when our dad died.. so like almost 12 years now. There isn’t a single family/friend function she can attend without showing up trashed or getting trashed there. Slurring, arguing, unable to stand.. her boyfriend has had to drag her out of many places and essentially puts up with it but he’s VERY clearly lost on what to do because it’s fucking draining. He’s vented to me that they can’t even go out to his friends houses or really do anything together because she literally ruins everything.

On top of all this.. for the past (almost) YEAR she’s been having a full-on affair with a coworker. The coworker has a wife and kids too but honestly that’s besides the point. My other sisters and I found out about it early on but then she said it was done so we all decided to let it go for the sake of attempting to keep the peace. Then a few months later it was a full fledged thing again, and basically seems like it never actually stopped at all during those couple months (more so we just weren’t hearing about it). 

So at this point the affair is clearly not ending and I’ve argued with her about it multiple times to the point where now she just doesn’t talk to me about any of it. But she gets trashed and will basically brag to our other friends/family about it and say how much she loves this other guy! It’s not only a drunk thing either because some of her friends have texted me WILD ass shit she’s said sober in the middle of the day essentially thirsting over this man and clearly having 0 regard for her fucking long term boyfriend that she lives with and who treats her amazing. 

It’s gotten to a point where we’re ALL so uncomfortable and don’t know what to do anymore. I consider her bf almost as a brother at this point because they’ve been together so long and I just love him he’s really great. I’m dying holding this in from him anymore because it’s so fucking unfair. But then my sister is SO unstable.. the fallout of having her bf find out is just unimaginable. I know I’d lose her as a sister but she’d also basically be on the streets. Any advice here is seriously appreciated :(

TLDR; my sister is openly having an affair and it seems like everybody knows it except her long term boyfriend, who we all love.

My neighbor-friend's bf has a grape kink that he perpetrates. We have incredibly thin walls and I can hear everything that goes on in their apartment, the other night I heard them having some fun and heard her saying ""no, please stop, stop, etc etc."" my skin was crawling but I felt helpless. I made extra noise in my apartment so they knew I could hear them, and he shouted ""don't worry, we're just fucking. She's not hurt."" Which freaked me out even more, but still helpless. They both had shitty pasts, and people have their kinks so I didn't want to intervene and be wrong making it uncomfortable for everyone. I talked to each of them the next day individually about something unrelated, and asked about what I heard. He told me that ""she has to do that [to orgasm],"" so okay sure. She told me ""he wants me to do that, and I kinda like it."" And that threw up the red flag. 
I already think he's a narcissist because he yells a lot, they fight all the time, and he usually starts the fights and doesn't leave her alone. 
I'm bigger than him, and I know I could restrain him if things ever got really bad, but I'm genuinely worried for her safety and don't know what to do to help her when I'm not home. I live in a small town with crooked cops, so I don't want to involve them if I don't have to. 
Is this a red flag to you all as well, and how do I help her get out of this relationship?

"We were together for 5 years and I just moved in with him 2 months before we broke up. While we were still together, he hooked up with a married female colleague. As they grew closer, he suddenly wanted to end our relationship (which was unexpected for me). I soon discovered that he had been cheating on me. I was furious, so I reached out to the woman and her husband.

The next day, the woman informed him that I had messaged her husband. He immediately returned home, yelled at me, said hurtful things, and kicked me out of the house. I had to quit my job and fly to another city to stay with my friends.

Throughout the entire breakup, he never showed any remorse or apologized to me. He might still be dating that woman and even waiting for her to get a divorce. 

I hold a lot of resentment towards him and that woman because of the way he treated me towards the end of our relationship and I'm considering making the whole situation public.

"Hello Reddit. My ex girlfriend of 2 years and I broke up earlier this year. It was devastating for both of us, but we decided on different life paths. I wanted kids and to buy a house and settle down, she didn't want kids and wanted to explore the world. We had a good relationship overall, we bickered quite a bit but we still loved each other a great deal. We broke up in February, and I still can't shake her off my mind. The longer we are broken up the more I realize her excitement for life and her care for those around her are what made life during that time so special. I miss her very much.

I've tried dating other people and getting away, I've tried being logical about it, but I still have love for her. I have a nagging sense that we should have been together this whole time. I find myself not caring about the kids or anything like that, because I miss her too much to care.

When I see her in passing, we don't talk. I try to strike up conversation just to see how life has been but she won't entertain it.

"I (M21), have currently been seeing this girl from college for about 9 months, and have been dating her officially for roughly 3 months .

She has completely integrated into the friend group that I left behind (I transferred to a different university), and we are going through LD as well as we can! We just took a vacation away together and it was amazing, but I keep having these repeated insecurities/thoughts regarding other women in my life. I have a track record of being a messy person, and I did have flings throughout our ""casual"" phase, and have even kissed some of my now girl bestfriend(s) (She does not know about this).   


I keep thinking about ""what could of been"" with this one girl. She is also at my old uni, and I don't really know what to do about this. To give context on this friend and I's fling who we started to see one another after initially just being friends for over a year. Things progressed online over a break, and when we got back in person to see each other we started to see one another casually. I broke things off after misperceiving one of her comments on her views of relationships, and did a ton of work to make sure to maintain our friendship, while I was also just beginning to have eyes for my now girlfriend (we had class together).   


I have gone to therapy before about relationship perceptions, and my own issues with insecurity/overthinking but I just don't know where to stand on this issue.

to attempt to make a long story short, my bf and i were together for 9 months when he broke up with me out of the blue (his friends were completely shocked and kept contact with me the entire time). then after 4ish weeks he reached back out to me and realized he “made the biggest mistake” and asked if we could pick up where we left off. i said yes because i still loved him and i missed him so much. two days after, i found out through my close friend that my bf had cheated on me for a few weeks while we were together the first time. by cheating i mean he was sexting a girl (who i loathed) creating hypothetical plans in which they would have to keep their relationship taboo. he never physically cheated on me. after long thought i decided to forgive him. we’ve been together for a year and some change and i love him more than ever. but im still plagued with the thought of him cheating, the images in my mind haunt me. i sometimes find myself searching for her ig handle and looking through her photos to try to figure out what she had that i lacked. i feel like i can’t trust my bf the way i used to. and im afraid to bring it to his attention that i still think about it because i would hate to make him feel shitty, but god i feel so shitty. how can i possibly move on from this? will i ever move on from this???

edit: after i found out he cheated on me, i had him explain everything to me and told him that if i didn’t get the whole truth from him i would get it from someone else so it would be better for him to tell me everything. he’d written on a piece of paper everything that happened and included an apology with recognition of his actions and that he’d hurt me.

When my husband and I got married, we had a small party. One of my friends flew down from out of state to come, we all stayed in a hotel room together. After the party, my dad called me and I went to the car to talk for maybe an hour. I guess in this time my husband and my friend exchanged numbers, I believe it was my friend who gave him her number apparently so she could 'check on me in case of emergency' (she does have a history of freaking out if she can't get a hold of me, but she also had told me she slept with a married man so who knows how and why this all went down). I did not know this at the time. 

A few months go by and my friend tells me my husband has been texting her asking for advice on our relationship, she told me he said certain things about loving me so much and appreciating everything I've done for him. For some reason, my stomach dropped. Idk, it just felt really odd like there was more to the story. I asked my husband about it and he got defensive and it turned into an argument. That was the same night he came clean about cheating on me (not with her). She told me this about two months after the texting had started between them. 

Later, after I got a better picture of the web of lies my husband had, I guessed his iPad password and checked it. The texts between him and my friend were not at all what she had alluded to. It was basically him complaining about me, saying super rude shit about me and just framing things in a really untruthful way. Now, I felt like that was a huge betrayal on my friends part, too- since why the fuck would you not let me know my husband was speaking about me that way? I am pretty sure he also called her, just from some of the things he's said. She never mentioned any calls. 

My husband and I are getting divorced for many reasons. He's a huge untrustworthy asshole. But I'm still really hurt by my friend, I've talked to people to get some outside perspective and they have all said she should have told me. I would personally never let things get to that level with a friend's husband. And I 100% would have told my friend if their husband was speaking about them that way. 

I understand it may have been uncomfortable for her but I just can't get over the fact that they exchanged numbers (I wouldn't have cared but why do it specifically when I'm out of the room) and she didn't tell me for so long that he was texting her so much. And what she did tell me about the conversations was a lie. It just all feels really shady on her part, too. Obviously I know my husband was the bigger asshole in the situation. 

But she also had really poor boundaries in the situation I think. She has really poor boundaries in all her other relationships, too- which I'm kind of just now realizing. She has vented to me about situations with friends/family where it's clear she's in the wrong and has massively overstepped boundaries but she is just angry with them and doesn't see it. So I'm not sure she'll understand where I'm coming from. 

So I have two questions, am I overreacting to feel like it was a violation of the trust in our friendship the way she dealt with the situation? Should I talk to her about it? I'm not sure I want to continue our friendship in the same capacity after everything, but I do feel like I should let her know why I'm pulling back? What should I say to her?

"I(f25) found me significant other m(26) 2 years ago on dating app, we were quite happy. Recently few days ago i logged in my bf reddit (he wasn't aware of it), i found him chatting explicting to a girl for around 3-4 hours.

They met on comments of NSFW sex page, where the girl asked my bf to guide her for how to please her sex partners. Initially my bf told her about all the stuffs what a guys like in explicit term like blowjobs, sex, eating pussy,tits etc. This continued for 1-2hours, later he asked her face pics to confirm girls identity whether the account was fake or not. They both exchanged their face pics. After confirming the identity, they both again started the explicit talks and in truth and dare game they both shared their nude pictures

In between when this was happening i had called my bf for a causal talk, instead feeling guilty, he told me he loves and a lot, and made me sleep and kept on texting the girl from reddit.

Next day, when i read the chats i was heartbroken, i was ignoring him. He sensed something is wrong, he deleted his reddit and confessed everything what he did the previous night.

But the problem is he is admant that he believed the account was fake (as the girl's account had no post, 0 karma) and the account was used by a guy, so he sexted to mess around with the fake account, otherwise he would have never done it. Although the whole sex chat was for 3-4 hours.

After i confronted him he has cried the whole night, hasn't slept till morning but i feel cheated on. We both were planning to marry the upcoming year.

Please help me, did he really think the account to be fake so he sexted? Or now he is giving me excuses to cover up.","My bf(M 26) sexted a girl on reddit and when i(F 25) caught him ,gives me excuses that he believed the account to be fake",18o67f1,1703218464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o67f1/my_bfm_26_sexted_a_girl_on_reddit_and_when_if_25/,
"A little bit of context. I (30F) have been in a relationship with my BF (36M) for 2 years right now we are, long distance he is Italian I'm From Latin America, we where living together for a while in Italy but I had to move back to my country for a health issue and a surgery. He travels to my country when he can and I do the same.  
For the time I live in Italy his mother didn't wanted to meet me, she accept to do a videocall with me once my BF was in my country visiting me for the first time, but just until I went back to Italy ,for a few weeks, she accept meeting me for just like two hours (where she just talk about how immigrants are the biggest problem in Italy and how her life its been so difficult) she didn't even let anyone else in there talk, when I was leaving she just ask me what i wanted to do with my life next, I told her that I wanted to open my own art gallery as im an Art curator and its been difficult to find steady job, and she just laughed at me in response.  
Recently I found out that she did a comment to my BF about how he should go out with the Lady that cleans and helps her around the house, I don't know the lady she is probably a great person I just know she is around 40 y/o, has a son and lives with her boyfriend . I wanted to know what do you think about this , but it seems like a very disrespectful comment to both me and the Lady.  
juts as a little note nothing to do with the main question my BF always says the him mom is a ""Drama Queen"" and everything is always about her, she is disabled as she had like a reaction to the polio vaccine when she was little.  
she also has two other children F40 and M38 none of them had ever had a relationship with anyone and im the first real GF of my BF y just find it a little bit odd

I asked him what he wants to do, and he says he really doesn't know, doesn't like the idea of school, feels generally disinterested in working st all. I feel at a loss and I think im picking up all the slack but I know he's depressed. He's also admitted that he doesn't care for medication, and believes they're temporary. He's never been on them. But I have, and he's always seen me smoke weed and drink and overall fuck up my chances of showing him how well they work in general. I lost my medicaid insurance so that all stopped. Im pretty low too, but I have hopes and dreams of being a police officer and that keeps me motivated. He on the other hand is super dependent on me and its really stressing me out. What if I fail? Or i cant support the both of us? He told me he would get another job, and doesn't want to mooch but I know he will feel shirts doing anything like that. He really has always wanted to do music.

"ello, I'm not sure how to start this since I'm not even sure how to feel anymore. 2 days ago my wife told me she was leaving me ""since it's never gonna change"". This came out off nowhere basically for context  that morning we got up at 5:45 ish to take out our dog but I just thought she looked really pretty that day and started hugging her, she was giggling and going along with my hugs and kisses unfortunately our doggo couldn't wait and peed on the floor. She got a little annoyed with me but it wasn't too bad. I offered to take out our other pups since she wanted to clean up her accident (my fault) so I figured I'd take the others out on my own. After I took out all the pups I noticed my wife was still cleaning very concentrated so I decided not to bother her much since I know she prefers space, I decided to try and make her laugh by learning a belly dancing routine and it seemed to work a little, giggled and make a couple joking jabs at me so I thought it was alright. Went out to the store to buy some PVC pipe things, came back she was moping but very intensely and silent so I went to fix the pipes could her hear complaints from outside. Finally fixed the pipes went inside to see her almost done with the living room unfortunately the mope bucket decided to break at that second, she looked at me and kinda screamed in frustration matched to the bathroom to get more water still cursing comes back and trips on water. I try and go help her up and she wails at me to ""JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE""  I'm a bit taken aback but I do go outside to continue with the PVC even tho I had already finished it. Bout an hour or so passed so I went inside to she her putting on her sweater so tells me in a annoyed tone"",I'm leaving"" I ask what do you mean so elaborates and says ""to the store to get the cat food we were supposed to buy today""  so the day before we made plans to go shopping and we were but then she had her moment? And so I stayed away but she said it in an accusatory tone so I stayed silent and let her leave. I was confused and a bit annoyed myself so I decided to have a couple beers and continue cleaning, she came back at around 4 ish and i was in bed napping. I woke up and couldn't stop myself and asked what the issue was. That's when she started going silent then eventually saying ""I can't do this anymore"" started kinda tearing up and I asked what she meant, she told me that's we are just too different and I asked if she was leaving me. She said something along the lines of ""it's for the best "" ""it's always the same"" and by the we never change or it's always the same line she's talking about an issue we have, her lack of communication? Anyway I told her ok I didn't think she was gonna end up leaving me, we were just talking about moving couple Days ago. By that point I was tearing up and she was stone cold. I asked why stay with me if I was so different, why not talk things but she only stayed silent. So I told her ok, I would not stop her but if she was too leave to please take her things. Told her to call her sister please take her things and her cats( I don't hate cats but I had never had them before meeting her and I'm not too familiar with their care tho I look after them when she's gone) she said she couldn't didn't wanna bother her, I admit here I got a bit petty and told her why cant they pick her up? She's always at their beck and call anyway. She's very close to her family and since she was the only unmarried childfree one for long they had her babysitting they children all the time. Even now that we married and moved to a different country she was expected to go watch em if needed and tutor her youngest brother. She doesn't mind tho. She stayed silent and just said she was leaving so I said ok. Next morning we are ok? She's leaving to see her family but she's saying she's coming back I go along with it playing my husband part, help her get her stuff ready, accompany her to the station buy her breakfast and set her off with a kiss but it's been 2 days and idk I'm just kinda numb and hurt? Idk I feel really weird, she told me she was leaving me but isn't? Idk what to even say to her once she comes back, she's texting me like normal and all but I feel really odd. Any advice?

Okay so, I’ve [20F] been talking to this guy [21M] for about four months now, we’ve gone to a couple concerts and have hung out a lot, we text and call a lot too. Recently, we’ve gotten way closer and when I asked him what he wanted out of our relationship, he told me he was open to one at some point, and when I asked for clarification, as in, should we make it official, he told me not yet. I’m not sure what to make of any of it, and the other day, I think I made a mistake by getting intimate with him. After everything happened, I told him I wouldn’t be willing to do that again, because I rarely ever do anything sexual without knowing there’s commitment and that it meant something to the person I was with. He told me that was okay and has continued on as if nothing happened and like everything is fine. He also treats me like his girlfriend anyways?? Like he’s always holding my hand or putting his arm around me, and he’s always the one initiating contact. 
I just don’t understand why he seems to be hesitating or if I’m just wasting my time..? And now I really regret getting intimate. I really, really like this guy but I’m so scared I’m going to get hurt and I don’t want to continue anything if this is just going to last another month and then die out… :(

"This is like my first post on Reddit. 

My 19y/o fiance and I 19y/o have been together for almost five years now. He just told me today that he sent nudes to some lady on Snapchat 8 months ago. EIGHT MONTHS AGO. (We were both legal adults at this time as well). This isn’t the first time he has lied to me for months and months either but I digress. He has begged me for forgiveness repeatedly. His story was this:

He was lonely while folding laundry one day and got a text on Snapchat from a spam bot who send naked pictures of some lady. So he decided to send a nude picture with his face in it back to the account. He then sent the account his Instagram handle- the Instagram that I created for him so I could tag him in my scrapbook posts of our relationship. The account threatened to send his nude easily identifiable photo to his following list which includes both of our families and mutual friends if he didn’t send any money to them. So he did. He sent $400 to them. 

Eventually when I did find out about the $400 I was very angry because he send THAT MUCH MONEY to someone online. He told me “I meant to send 40” what a liar. We did a thing for a while trying to scam scammers from those Snapchat accounts. That’s what he told me he was doing (a blatant lie).

So after this we went on vacation together where he actually proposed to me while this account was still harassing him for more money while threatening to send his nude. He only tells this all to me today because the account said it’s sending his nude to his following list on Instagram. 

He told his parents something (I’m not sure what exactly he told them) to get them to block the account. My parents don’t know about it yet, it’s my dearest mother’s birthday tomorrow as well. I hope her day doesn’t get ruined.


TLDR my fiancé sexted a scam account, his nude photo might get leaked to our families, and I’m angry with him for betraying my trust. What should I do?

I’ve built my entire life with him, he was my first kiss and everything. We have a house with several pets together. I don’t know what to do without him yet I’m not sure if I can get passed this. Advice from anyone please. Please.

"Hi Reddit, I've got a lot going on in life at the moment and need some external opinions about my (26M) partner (24F). We just celebrated our 5th anniversary as a couple after meeting in college. Our relationship got serious fast; we're both quite emotionally intelligent and mature for our ages. This is both of our first committed relationship and we have a lot of chemistry together. We also decided that we didn't want to hold each other back from our personal goals when we first started dating, which is relevant now. 

It's been a tough year for me personally. My parents got divorced, I was unexpectedly out of work for several months over the summer, and I've been navigating some financial decisions most 26 year olds don't have to make. I am at a tumultuous time in my career, have some immigration worries, and through all of this have been trying to maintain a long distance relationship with my partner. She went solo traveling for 4 months last fall then moved back to where I live for a few weeks early last year before accepting a job offer at a top-tier research institute for 6 months that fed directly into a master's degree at our alma mater. It was a huge opportunity for her and I supported her in her decision to move away, though it meant that we were long-distance for basically a year (and have been long-distance for a total of about 2/5 years). 

When she finally started her master's degree this fall, she moved in with me. After the summer, I had a long conversation with her about some concerns with our relationship. She had spent the last year living her life with minimal concern for ours together as a couple, and on top of that offered limited support during some difficult times for me. At certain points this summer it almost seemed as if I wasn't actually in a relationship, since she was remote and had limited service/wifi at her summer job. I told her that my expectation moving forward was that she take some more time for us as a couple, and especially shift her focus onto supporting me. She has a tendency to become very self-involved, particularly when she's stressed. It's something that's come up in the past, but nothing that has been super consequential to our relationship until recently. She is self aware enough to understand my point of view and agreed that she needed to put more effort into our relationship. 

The fall was busy with work while she sunk her teeth into her master's. I returned home a few weeks ago after working for almost a month straight; it seems she was not as productive as she had hoped over my absence and instead spent the majority of the time after I returned working on semester-end projects and studying for a big exam which fell exactly on the date of our 5th anniversary. She was so stressed out that she barely cooked, cleaned, or slept and I spent the majority of my time trying to keep our household organized since I was off work. We agreed that it was unrealistic to expect to do anything crazy for our anniversary, which have always been a big deal for us. My mom also decided to come visit during the few days around it, so we elected to keep it small and have a nice meal out after she finished her exam. 

The day of our anniversary rolled around. I bought her a bouquet and a bottle of bubbly for us to celebrate after dinner with my mom, who graciously offered to pay for a nice meal. For me, the wine and flowers were pretty low effort but enough to make the day feel special still. What I didn't expect was that for her, apparently low effort meant no effort. She didn't do or get me anything. She was barely even conscious during dinner after her exam, which is understandable. We basically got home and she went more or less right to bed after thanking me for the flowers. She didn't even acknowledge the bottle of champagne that I had purchased for us. Two days after, she left to go back home for Christmas. The morning that she left, she hastily made a card after we had a conversation the night before during which she got really upset that I had surprised her and felt guilty for not doing anything for me. She also bought me a few bottles of liquor to make one of my fav cocktails, which was nice. 

I still feel somewhat betrayed that she didn't do ANYTHING for our anniversary until a few days after. Is it so hard to take 15 minutes out of your day from studying to grab a card? Or buy a muffin or treat? I've been in a funk since she left and am still working on some things from this last year on top of it all. She returns just before New Years and we are celebrating our first NYE together, but I'm kind of dreading it. I've barely checked my texts because I don't want to talk to her. She has been the best partner I've ever had and I don't want to paint her in a negative light; she really is amazing and is more accepting and supportive of me than my own family. But it just feels like she's so focused on herself that I'm just an afterthought at this point, even after all the sacrifice I've made to support her over the last 18 months. 

I just don't really know how to approach this issue - it's something I've already spoken to her about and it feels like just another example of it. And every time I tell her how I feel when she does this, she gets very upset and starts to talk very negatively about herself which makes me feel guilty though I know it's not her intent. I want to start 2024 off with things good between us so I can put the miserable year behind me, but I don't want to ruin NYE with a difficult conversation and I feel like it's not something I can tell her when we're apart. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences with a partner that might provide some advice into the best way to handle this situation?

"Weaponized incompetence or am I being impossible?

TL;DR. 

Lately my husband (39) and I (35) have not been as close and connected as we’d both probably like. He’s recovering from being sick over a week ago. I’m stressed with being overworked. We have a child. There’s a lot of responsibilities and it’s the holiday season on top of it. 

It’s been an ongoing (for years) issue that I don’t feel like he pulls his weight within the household. He argues that I do not see the things he does do. Maybe so. I feel like it’s not to much to ask for him on his days off (he works 12hr shifts 2-4x/week) to look around and do things that need to be done such as dishes, laundry or picking up any clutter, cat box, etc if it needs it. I do it without a second thought. Saturdays I deep clean the house (usually) and with extra ‘daily’ chores like a cat box or dishes that pile up to do it can take me a lot longer than if it was maintained throughout the week. 

I’ve communicated many times in many ways and it usually ends with an argument/him getting defensive and I’m the nag that expects to much. So I’ve been quieter and internalizing it over time which isn’t healthy either but idk what to do anymore. 

Tonight we talked about why I’ve been quieter. I tried explaining in a softer voice without emotion that last weekend I expressed feeling upset that he left a lot of messes out while I was doing the weekly deep clean and that I want us to work together blah blah. I said I’ve waited for almost an entire week for him to step up like he said he would and take some of the load off of me. I don’t feel he has. 

Now to the point it all turned weird… he says he does a lot but I don’t ever notice. He asked what I’ve noticed he has done this week and I said took the trash can out but left the recycle able one? Sarcasm. Then I guessed that he did dishes and he said he did after emptying the fridge. So I asked oh you cleaned the fridge? He said no I just threw food away. Oh. Then I asked well what else did you do this week that I should have noticed? He said I’m not telling you because if you don’t notice then you’ve proved my point. I kept asking because I honestly wanted to know wtf I’m missing? I said you grabbed groceries today. And he got mad. He would not give me an answer so I figured he must not have anything to name off that is contributing to the running of the household and again he’s defensive and won’t communicate with me. I was confused and getting irritated so I said I really don’t like you anymore and he said then we shouldn’t keep doing this and I said we really shouldn’t. So he took his pillow and is sleeping on the couch which we never do. We usually make up and go to sleep together. 

I love him. He’s a great person overall. I’m just really worn out by the resentment. That feeling of 1000 small cuts. I don’t feel like I expect the world. I just want some effort and communication.

"So I have a crush on a guy at work. I started this job about 6 months ago and from the start, he was finding “discrete” (completely obvious to me) ways to check me out. He’d walk in the room and clearly look at me, go out of his way to walk by me, and just kinda lingered around without purpose.

 In the beginning, we hardly spoke, but I switched to a new shift and I happen to take my last break just as he’s leaving for the day (I go sit in my car on breaks). So several times a week, we’d talk on the way out. From our first real conversation, he was usually the initiator and we’d have a lot of random small talk, but his eyes look almost like sparkly, and he’s always smiling hugely/ laughing at literally everything I say, even if it’s not remotely funny or intended to be. Since I take my break at the same time daily, we’ve probably talked over 50 times. 

In the last few months, he started a new position within his department and hasn’t been in my area as often. When he is, he’s suddenly stopped going out of his way to look at me (I don’t notice it now, so maybe he still is but I’m not sure). Up until a few weeks ago, he’d greet me with a massive smile and we’d go on our way. Lately, I’ll see him in passing while we’re around a lot of other coworkers and he gives me a very uncomfortable/awkward looking smile, or he’ll nod hello, but otherwise he pretty much ignores me or acts as if he doesn’t even know me. This makes me feel uncomfortable myself, almost as if I did something wrong. 

At first, I figured he just lost interest, as we’ve talked a lot and maybe I was just the ‘mysterious new girl’, but he got bored as I became more familiar. I still take my break at the same time and run into him and he talks to me, just like he did in the beginning: super smiley and laughing his ass off at EVERYTHING I say. 

So I’m mainly wondering why he’s behavior has shifted so much? He seems to want to avoid acknowledging me much while around others, but will walk out with me (when people outside of our department are around) and has no problem talking to me while we’re alone. 

Also, I’m aware workplace romances are frowned upon in general, but I’m just curious about what is causing behavior like this, especially so suddenly.","My coworker (36M) seems to ignore me/act like he doesn’t know me (29F) when we’re around others, but talks to me when I’m alone.",18o5feb,1703215862.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o5feb/my_coworker_36m_seems_to_ignore_meact_like_he/,
"my girlfriend and first love of three years broke up with me about a month ago because she thinks we need time apart since we grew up together and we're all we know. i've been no contact and last night she broke it and wanted to have a conversation with me, we caught up about thinks going on in our lives, flirting a little, talking about things that have been hard during the breakup fun banter. we spoke for three hours straight she eventually said that she thinks we could work out in the future we just need time apart, and that she does have hope and if not she atleast wants to be friends. im obviously not gonna sit around and wait but i do want to get back with this girl is there anything i should do or should be doing to achieve this?do you think she genuinely sees a future or is just trying to lighten the blow, it just seems weird considering how well the conversation went, there's so clearly so much chemistry and we both love each other, but right now she thinks splitting up for a bit (she never mentioned how long) will help, any thoughts on what she's meaning?",My girlfriend (18F) broke up with me because she thinks we need to go and live life without each other for a bit (18M),18o5eia,1703215791.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o5eia/my_girlfriend_18f_broke_up_with_me_because_she/,
"My partner (29) and I (29F) have been together for almost 5 years. A couple years ago I reconnected with my childhood best friend (29F). My partner has been pretty judgmental of her from the start but they're judgmental of most people and I assumed they were just really open with talking about people with me because we are partners / best friends and we do share a lot of our personal thoughts even ones that we may not be proud of. We're all leftists and most of my partner's judgements are political and this is especially frustrating to me because my friend is very closely aligned with us politically I just don't think she's maybe as educated on certain things or as dedicated to causes, which I think is understandable. No one is perfect. To give an example my friend would say things about going to get something done to her car and didn't know how to answer some questions the mechanic was asking her and when telling us the story she jokingly said ""I'm just a girl."" This really annoyed my partner. I get it to an extent, I also had an initial mental reaction of ""plenty of girls might know that information."" However I don't think her describing this makes her anti-feminist in anyway. Most of the previous issues have been surrounded of my childhood friend making little girl/women jokes about herself. 

  
The last straw however had to do with Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In our group chat my friend was reccomending something a show to us they had reccomended many of times. The show features a lot of queer and bipoc characters so it would normally be right up my partner's ally. They came back after looking into it and there's a rumor that someone was let go from the show for making a pro-palestine statement. My partner and I are very pro- freeing palenstine. They started chatting a little bit about it and my friend had mentioned they were a little confused and at work at the moment so couldn't properly look into it and admitted to not being super educated on the topic. My partner asked if my friend was Pro-Iseral and before she could even respond my partner left the group chat and cut off contact with her.

  
I've told ot my friend quite in length about it. She does agree with our views on the matter and was just caught up and confused. She was also really hurt that my partner would just cut her off like that as they were friends too and not even let her explain her side of things. I tried talking to my partner about it because I know my friend wants to reach out and try to squash things and I was trying to see if my partner would be receptive but they are not. Whenever the two of us talk about it we fight. I don't expect my partner to be friends with all my friends but they were considering each other friends and I just feel the way they ended things is really unfortunate. 

  
This happened last month and my friend had already gotten us Christmas gifts so when I went to see this friend she gave me both my gifts and the gifts she got for my partner to give to them. I did this and they didn't want to take them but eventually I was able to leave them with my partner. A week later my partner finally opens them and tells me they don't want them and wants to regift them. They first suggest gifting it to another mutual friend of all of ours and I mentioned that feels kind of cruel. The thought behind the gift was personal and thoughtful but I understand that it's not something they actually want. I offered to take it because I do think I'll use it. I however became extra frustrated when they gave it to me along with something else they got from this friend for their birthday earlier this year. Something I know they actually liked and used previously. 

  
It just feels really immature and I am really fed up with it and not sure how to handle it but is my frustration unreasonable? I don't think anyone should be forced to be friends with anyone I just think the circumstances are really frustrating and unfair. I normally take my partner's side in things but I just can't see their justification in this behavior. Should I tell my friend about the gifts? Should I be as concerned and frustrated as I am with my partner? Any good faith advice is appreciated.

"I broke up with my ex a moth ago. I found conversations he was having with his exes and then logged into his instagram to find disgusting conversations with other women. One of these conversations had proof he cheated on me long ago. Throughout he relationship he was pretending he would not cheat and trying to make me look insecure for not trusting him. If you see my previous post, you’ll see what happened.

Well.. we have a project together. I feel I will be able to work with him in a little while and have been focusing on releasing the anger and resentment all his lies brought to my life. I’m ok with him in general, despite him not understanding why I don’t trust him (lol).

So today he came over to talk about the project. We had not spoken for 2 weeks. The conversation turned into a closure convo, where he told me that there are two truths: what he did was shit, but it is also “very common”. I was flabbergasted. Is this how someone justifies tricking another person into believing they are crazy and insecure for 1.5y? What sort of thought is that? How does that make anything better or acceptable?

Anyways, just sharing. Shit people are everywhere and the things they hold onto do justify their actions are… just… not acceptable! I’m just here like WTF!

"This guy (32M) is and I (29F) were hitting it off for the past 4 months. We texted all the time, talked in the phone for hours, binge watched anime’s and shows together, went out and had all sorts of fun together (no sex based on a cultural -mutual- decision). In short, we were a PERFECT match!
Then during the last month of so, things changed. We barely talked because he would leave my texts hanging for hours and only text back once a day or less. He suddenly became ‘busy’. His texts were less and less enthusiastic (no emojis or exclamation just plain text). I felt him withdrawing and tried talking to him about him but he would gaslight me into thinking that I’m overreacting, imagining things, being overly emotional or he would play dumb to avoid answering my question.
It went on for weeks and every time he would refuse to talk about it. He even derailed the conversation when I suggested (more than once) that we should meet so we can discuss what is going on in person as adults.
It even got to the point where I cried in front him for the first time while telling him about a family issue that was hurting me so deeply. I only needed someone to talk to and I felt like I could trust him enough to tell him but he started judging me and saying that I complicate things. His reaction showed that he didn’t care at all. That was like a wake up call. (I never judged him and always listened to his looong stories. I even kept checking up on how he is feeling for days until I am sure that he is fine)

I realized that he was selfish. He only showed interest in the conversation when he is the one talking, but he would barely listen to what I am saying. He forgets everything I say almost immediately since he doesn’t really pay attention.

I couldn’t play the game of matching his energy and acting distant as well because it made me suffer even more. Besides, I told him point blank that if he isn’t into me any more he can walk away, but he brushed me off.
Sensing that he was no longer interested and too childish to deal with it as an adult, I decided to pull away. I blocked him everywhere (social media, LinkedIn, phone number, literary EVERYWHERE) and went NC. He didn’t react at all.
It has been two weeks now. I am feeling better than before and I have stopped crying several days ago. However I can’t help but ask myself : did I act too fast? Should I have given him and myself a chance? Will I find someone with whom I will click the way he and I clicked at first? Am I not enough? AITA for ghosting him? And many more questions

"My bf \[24M\] watches twitch e girls and it makes me \[26F\] uncomfortable  
  
I will try to provide as much context as possible. my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year we did meet online and have met up once.  
  
So one of my friends who moderates for a relatively known streamer noticed my boyfriend in her chat. (We are all in the online space and me and this streamer also have a casual friendship. &amp; he knows that my friend moderates for her) it was Halloween and she was wearing a more revealing outfit, he had asked her to open her chest more and to move her hair and proceeded to create several clips of her. My friend ended up banning him and told me about the clips.  
  
I confronted him about it and found that he has a bunch of clips of twitch girls, in bikinis, or in revealing clothing and I saw that he followed a bunch of these girls. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable because I know we have been in calls when he is watching some of these girls. I'm ngl it also makes me feel very insecure. I told him that it really grossed me out and that if he was going to be doing this that I didn't want to be together. He said that he would stop, unfollow, and delete all of the clips. And that I could have access to his account if I wanted to, which I initially rejected.  
  
He also said that he never types in their chat and come to find there are chat logs of him talking about specific body parts in their chats. (My friend has some twitch tools that grant the ability to see that) So I know he lied about that..  
  
So, about a few months later hasn't, done this at least not all the way. He unfollowed a lot of the girls and kept maybe half? And ended up following 2 new ones and then he unfollowed them after I confronted him... &amp; He has all of the clips saying that ""he doesn't know how to delete them""  
  
A few weeks I finally confronted him about it again recently and asked him for his account and password because if he wasn't going to unfollow then I was just gonna do it. He said that he would give me account access that night. And didn't. I ask him the next day he says ""in 2 days."" At this point I'm tired of being jerked around and I did flip out on him.  
  
Was it wrong for me to ask that of him and take it that far?  
  
We are currently not talking much, he said he wants us to have a month long break. I just feel like I'm at a point where there is no trust anymore and am at a loss for whats to come next.

"I don’t know what else to do

I (22F) have a bf (25M) who is currently out with a female friend of his.

Context: Female friend was BF ex-crush in high school. They were best friends since middle school and remain in contact today. BF introduced me to her during our first month of dating, and she scanned me and acted really weird (ig she didn’t like me??). They did have a falling out when I stepped into the picture because the friend group my BF and the FF were a part of treated him poorly and I encouraged him to stand up for himself. Everyone including the FF were bullying and using him, and he’s blind to the past to really do anything. My BF sent the gc a breakup text, but they didn’t even respond or reach out to him because they had a separate gc without him in it (and they didn’t really care).

FF doesn’t talk to him for months, and because BF and FF have the same friends, when they see each other they don’t speak much. 

Some more months past and BF tells me he wants to reach out to FF. Not everyone in the friend group, just FF. I tell him I don’t feel comfortable about this, but do what’s right to you. He proceeds to plan a breakfast with FF at a local diner, and when I ask how it went, he said they’re amicable (kept it short). He continues to contact her, and I keep telling him how bad I feel about this. 

Ontop some other drama with him snapping a female coworker of his constantly while we do long distance. Additionally he was talking to this other woman I don’t feel well around and telling me. The final straw was when he told me he was wishing FF Happy Birthday and wanted to text her again. I sent the breakup text to him because clearly I was the second choice in all of this. I’d say 90% of the friends he has are women, and I feel fine around all of them except the three I mentioned. I kept suggesting couples therapy to him during the relationship, and in the past he’d always come up with an excuse. 

When I sent the breakup text because he wasn’t answering my calls, he immediately scheduled a therapist session and paid for three rounds. Because I wanted to work on us one more time, I stayed and did the therapy. “LDR plus our young relationship/ages equaled a lot of mistrust” claimed the therapist. He never went over the events of what happened that led us to his office, but instead made us complete a temperament test (helpful, but not what we needed)

Things were looking up! Up until last week. At a family meeting, he shows me a photo of FF and says “She’s still dating her boyfriend”. I immediately go in the bathroom to sort out my feelings and leave the function. He follows me out, and claims that he thought that I didn’t know that FF had a boyfriend (damn lie), and was showing me her and her bf together.

#1: He told me when we were breaking up that he won’t follow/contact her again

#2: If I showed him a photo of an ex-crush and was like “He’s still with her girlfriend”, all hell would break loose

This girl was his high school crush and best friend. He’s currently at a high school reunion thing with her and a friend right now. I’d like to say during all of this, FF has put the bear minimum into her and BF friendship, and its just him doing things with her. She has a BF, and told my BF out of respect for her bf, she can’t hangout like they used to.

another thing that she talks about that makes me uncomfortable and insecure is that there's no happy long relationships, like those couples that die together or at least have a good 20 years or something being together and that with time you get bored by the other person, and you just leave, but some people just keep being together and miserable. So is she just going to get bored of me, and that's not even a question? Like it's only natural that it happens in little to no time?

I know I shouldn't think this is forever and will forever be as it is, but I do wish that that happens to us, but she thinks that's wrong too which only feeds my insecurity that she doesn't wish the same thing I do, and I know that is only being a year, but I'm not saying that I KNOW it will happen or that I is GOING to happen I'm only saying that if anything should happen I hope is the nice one that we die together you know? That can be a bad thing, right? She never said the opposite but didn't say anything either when I mentioned, so what is she trying to say, you know?

She is my first gf, and she has dated a lot of guys before, so of course she has more knowledge and experience about those kinds of things. She said that she did have a boyfriend that lasted long, but it went bad because with time so she now knows all things that I mentioned here, so I think ""if she gets tired of the person in a short time, I basically have a timer set  to when she's going to dump me"" I know you should enjoy while it lasts, but again, is not a very nice thing to hear and know right? If something is good is only normal to me to WISH that it lasts forever, yeah I'm going to get hurt if it doesn't become true, but that's life

I, made more money than him, and it quickly became obvious to me and my friends that he saw me as a “sugar” fling. I did not mind it, while we were together, as my love language is giving and I was having fun. It came time for him to leave, and by this time things were fading but I had hoped that at least a friendship had come out of it, since we had great chemistry and I did help him out a lot. He is back home, and now, he has decided to call me once a day, 3 days a week, just to “string me along.” He limited me on social media “as consideration” so that I would not see him with his gf, bc “he cares about me” My friends and I think, He believes that when he returns, the same scenario will repeat itself. Or for whenever he needs something from me (place to stay for free, maybe even expenses, or we thought at one point immigration papers) At this point its just no fun for me. My ideas were to  block him, no explanation, or let him be and just come up with excuses for a while until he gives up and act uninterested, or play his game until he comes expecting more and I then tell him there is no way and that I was just playing along with him all this time?",Do I 38f Block 29m?,18o4wy3,1703214195.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o4wy3/do_i_38f_block_29m/,

I met a guy in may this year. He immediately took interest in me and started hitting on me. Invited me to Italy and did honestly everything for me. For the first time a guy is perfect. In every single way until now. In october he went and met his friend in another country while we were still flirting and had sex with her. When he told me this I got hurt because suddenly he had feelings for her and had to choose wich one he should stick with. 

He chose me and we have been dating since the end of october/beginning of november. Tonight I found texts between them where they planned a date and to hide it from me. He didnt go but still it makes me wonder if this has been a thing?? He deletes everything from the app itself so he knows its wrong. He has deleted everything damning. There were also other disturbing things I found.

Since we are just now actually a thing (he has told me since we met that im the only one he is interested in, we went to another country together in august and always something between us) can I confront him? How can I do it? I know I don’t have any right to snoop but I had a gut feeling. Can I say anything? Should I just let it slide?

"So my husband and I had an argument this morning. He has been off work for 4 months with a back injury, and it’s gotten much better - we just got back from a week down south. He can do everything. In the past, he always talked about how 40 hours of work a week is too much, he would love to not work, etc. My business is going really well, he’s talked a lot about working for me, and it never sat well with me. Call me old school but I like that he has his own job, even though I make much more money. Since he’s been off, I’ve asked him to take all of the time he needs to heal. Well, for the last few weeks, it was playing video games until 2:00 a.m., and sleeping in until noon.

During our vacation, my anxiety about him not working and always alluding to working for me spiked. We got home, I was swamped and getting ready for a long drive and meeting, he was still in bed, and I told him that I’m feeling anxious about when he’s going to go back to work. He lost it. Told me that I’m calling him useless, lazy, etc. I told him that I never said those things, but did eventually voice my opinion. I told him that sometimes he scares me when he talks about not working, he’s openly said 100 times that he’s going to work for me, etc. And he got really upset. I then said something stupid about men needing to provide in the relationship (we have many friends where the man makes more, and that’s not what I want from him. I definitely contribute more in our relationship. I just don’t want to be the ONLY one contributing).

Well, now he’s not speaking to me, and it’s really upsetting me. We have a big party we’re hosting tomorrow, the biggest one in our new house, and Christmas on the weekend. We went from being best friends over the last 4 months, to this. I’ve tried several times to speak to him, and he keeps basically telling me to fuck off. I’m just so stressed out.

"Got into a relationship with a very nice woman, only to later find out that she has had a fling with one of her colleagues during a travel for work. Broke up with her more than an year back citing this reason. 

Slut shamed her, cut contact, realised it was a mistake, profusely apologised months later, got back briefly, had satisfying physical intimacy. Got married recently, but still talking to this ex as ""friends"". Getting ample attention still from my ex, since she actually loved me, and a part of me still has the hots for her. 

After all these, containing, a good period of love and sex, i am still not able to digest that my ex took the first opportunity to get intimate with some rag picker.

"
I’m gonna preface this by saying. I’m autistic. Social situations aren’t my strong suit. I’ve neglected my mental health for the past couple months and it’s lead to some paranoia episodes that I have. I made a lot of baseless accusations and essentially…fucked up. 
I admitted to said fuck up and my partner texted me: “I’m just done. Please leave me be. Like I don’t want to talk anymore.” 
I said: “Is this just ‘leave me alone for now’ or ‘don’t ever talk to me again’?” Which is a genuine question on my end bc idk what that means. Obviously to leave them alone but the I’m done preceding it wigs me out.
They responded with: “at this point just completely leave me alone. I can’t handle this shit anymore. Bye. I’m done.”

Where do I go from here? Should I believe we’re broken up? Is this just where I give them space? What do I do? I’ve apologized profusely and I see my wrongdoing. I said shit I regret and admit that. Just don’t know where to go or what to do from here. I’ve lost sleep and cried a lot about this. Any advice helps.

Break comes by, he stops answering my messages until hours or maybe the next day.It feels like hes stopping putting in any effort.


 I see him online elsewhere but he wont respond my messages untol later. He doesnt try to have conversations anymore. Messages get emoji react, and sometimes a single word response. 

I invite him over for dinner one time and hes on his phone the entire time. then he leaves early, citing he has work to do-- i find out he was playing games instead.

I just feel so unloved but it sucks because i love him so.much. I told him, I felt like i was being ignored and i wanted to kmow what was going on. and he was really sorry about it, and told me it was very chaotic lately.. but no elaboration. Am i supposed to push farther, how much until im prying too much? 

Earlier today he drove us to a museum and his car windows have drawings from when they mist-- Ive drawn things in the past. I see a new one that says ""I love you!! c:"" I comment on it and he ignores it and says he never pays attention to what people draw in his car-- but he knew what i drew last time, we have bonded over that. Another tning: a cat i drew previously got vandalised to be dead.

Also his phone wallpaper is no longer me, but a random bird :[ we still have matching profile pictures 

He has 2 friends that regularily flirt with him and ive always just let it slide because he said they are friends and hes not interested in them but he doesnt want to cut ties with them. 

Apparently he had a guest for a week too, amd I had the impressiom he was busy but he said he wasnt. I thought something was going on but he said its fine. I cant help but feel like hes hiding something.

And a while ago, right before break on one of our dates, cop had asked him who i was to him. he said i was a friend. I just assumed he was afraid of homophobia but now im reslly insecure about it. 

I really cant tell if im just being paranoid but with all this-- i really get the impression hes seeing someone else and has lost interest in me. How do i approach him about this? Ive already mentioned the lack of communication/effort and he said hell do better but theres still all this other stuff.

"I been with my bf for a year. He's a loving and caring parther. Our relationship has its ups and downs, but I would say it's more good than bad and I really love him as he loves me. He can be really sweet and has promised me that even if our relationship doesn't work out he will love me for the rest of his life regladless. That being said we have our fair share of disagreements. Our latest fight was bigger than usual, so much that I'm starting to question myself and our future together.
 I been thinking getting a tattoo, a marching tattoo with my sister to be exact, but when I told my bf I was seriously thinking  on it he got mad and  eventually said that he would broke up with me because he could never be with someone with tattoos. It was a huge fight with lots of feelings hurt in both parts. The thing is that I have always known he doesn't like them, but not in this extent. He has said in the past that he finds mosts tattoos silly and would never get one, but doesn't really care when someone has one. I know for a fact that many of his friends have tattoos and he doesn't usually say something about it and just accepts it. I had supposed he would not love the idea of me getting a tattoo, but he would get over it. He's usually chill about my appearance. He never tells me what to wear and says I look good on everything. My bf  has said I would gorgeous even completely bald, tho he likes super long hair.I also have cut my hair short  (a bob style) and he said I looked beautiful and that I'm the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen while I have it. My bf has many irks, but most of them he doesn't care when it's about me. For example he's a bit of a germaphobe, but loves kissing me even when I'm sick. He also eats  my leftovers and food I've already bitten into. He would never do that with someone, including his exes when they were dating. So this situation caught me out guard. I've talked to his best friend, Emma, who has become a good friend of mine too. Emma says she doesn't know why he dislikes tattoos so much, but suspects it's some kind of trauma that he doesn't want to talk about. For me this is even weirder because my bf and I are very open and honest with each other, at least to my knowledge, and he and Emma have been friends for 15 years. There is very little she doesn't know about him and that even Emma  doesn't know where's this is coming from concerns me. If it is  a secret of him that she knows, Emma would just say  it's not her place to tell me and would send me to talk to him about it. 
Is it really that big deal for someone who doesn't like tattoos to have a gf with one? 
Someone has any idea where is this coming from, should it concern me?

"We've had several discussions before he moved in a few months ago about him contributing and he did agree to contribute to all the essential expenses. 

Since then, it's been an uphill battle trying to get him to stick to it. For the first 3 months he contributed NOTHING. Eventually after a huge fight where I had to practically beg him to help pay the bills, he gave me money for the 3 months he was behind on. 

After that we agreed he would pay me on the 1st of every month. Has that happened? No. And I'm sure you all know, EVERYTHING is insanely expensive right now. So paying for all of the essentials is eating up damn near every cent of my paycheck, which is not even half the size of his.

Everything in our relationship has been going perfect, we love each other, support eachother, and we are very much in a really healthy relationship.

The thing is that since we started having sex, I have very rarely really enjoyed it, we have tried different poses, different environments, lubricants, even 🍃, etc.

I always tell him what I like and what I don't like, we have always had good communication, but even so, I never manage to enjoy it (not even a 70%).

I love him a lot, and I know it's not a problem of attraction, because I love him in all his ways, he will always be the finest man on earth for me.
The only thing I have noticed is that while we have sex, things keep going through my mind;  If I look good or bad, if he is enjoying it, the way I move, etc.

Even other types of things, thoughts from my daily life, or even bad experiences from the past.

"Exposition: I (24NB) have never had a relationship longer than a few months, so I'm already out of my depth here, and am kind of nervous about the concept of entering a relationship in general. I met my best friend (29M) online, and we've been super close for the last 3+ years or so, despite living 12+ hours away from one another. I knew he had a crush on me for a long time, but I had always been keen on shutting the idea down due to the distance.  
Here's where the problems started: I recently moved to his city for a variety of reasons, and we started hanging out a lot IRL. I started catching feelings (I think??), and we talked about the prospect of dating. I didn't want to rush into anything due to my inexperience with relationships and the novelty of being able to spend time together IRL, so I made it clear that I'm not necessarily ready for that step. He was super understanding--he always is--and we took it slow. It was going really well, and I decided to ask him to be my bf last week after the cute night out on the town I had planned for us, and he accepted.  
Since then, I've started feeling weird about our relationship. He asked if he could post/change is facebook relationship status, and I agreed since I didn't think it was a big deal, but I didn't realize just how far-reaching his social circles extended. One of my random hookup/FWBs from my old city messaged me after the post went up to congratulate me, and it caught me off guard. He wants to have sex fairly regularly (we're both pretty sex-positive) but I just haven't been feeling like it. I feel like the way he looks at me he constantly wants to take my clothes off, and I feel guilty for not wanting the same. He's very into physical touch, but I feel like it's too much for me, the way he looks at me, constantly wants to be close to me, hug/kiss me, I feel as though I'm constantly pressured to exude affection, but I just want to interact like we always have, and be intimate now and again, and it's like he's become a different person now that we're officially together.  
Today, I got to his place to hang out and play games, spend time, etc. I love talking/spending time with him, but he constantly wanted to put his arm around me, caress me, look at me longingly, and compliment me, and I think I emotionally shut down because of it, and had to excuse myself early to go home. I felt horrible for it, even though he was super understanding when I told him I wanted to leave.  
I don't know how to talk to him about this. Is it a red flag that I don't feel the same way he does about displays of affection? I feel constantly like I can't meet his emotional needs, even though he promises me I'm not disappointing him by not displaying affection. I don't want to break up with him, especially when we've been together for barely a week, and especially right around the holidays. He's a fantastic person, and I admire so much about him, but I can't shake this feeling. I feel like if I told him this, I would shatter his heart of gold and lose someone I care so much about.

"My friend is in a toxic on and off again relationship. They are a matched made in hell. She comes to me constantly crying and complaining over how he treats her. I could be here telling you all how horrible he is to her and how bad she is towards him. It’s like she has extreme highs of happiness just like euphoria but just for him to put her in an extreme depression right after that.

I’m engaged and I do admit even with the issues my fiancé and I have. We do have a normal and healthy relationship. My friend always loves to spend money on her boyfriend and to her spending a lot of money “shows him that she cares for him”. With my own relationship I’m more reserved and careful with my spending. There have been numerous times my friend and I go out for dinner and she would order food for her boyfriend like an appetizer, dinner, and dessert. Then she would ask me if I’m ordering food for my fiancé and I would say “no”. She would then say “I didn’t know you’re so cold in that way” and I would turn around and say that my fiancé is 29 years old and can figure out his own meals. I’m not a complete monster there are times I do bring home leftovers for my fiancé or if the restaurant isn’t expensive then I would bring home a meal for him.

The other night I saw my friend for dinner and we were talking about Christmas. She revealed to me she spent close to $1,835 for Christmas and birthday gifts. I was completely shocked. She told me she bought him gaming stuff, a gold chain necklace, clothes, and a suite getaway for a few days. She then proceeded to say how she loves him so much and it’s normal to want to spend so much on someone you love. My fiancés Christmas gifts aren’t even close to $1,835. Heck I’m sure my engagement ring didn’t even cost that much compared to what she spent on her boyfriend. I tried to tell her it’s a lot of money for someone that constantly hurts her and puts her in a severe depression. She then told me that I need to understand that she’s a giver and that’s just part of her personality. She has told me that numerous times that I think to her that’s her personality trait. 

Later that night she revealed to me she bought gifts for everyone in her boyfriend’s family but didn’t buy much for her own family. I told her that it’s kinda of weird to buy for his family and not her own. It slipped that I think she’s buying off her boyfriend (maybe I shouldn’t have said that) but to that she didn’t seem upset but just stated that she loves him and that’s how you show love. But just from knowing her she always have issues with money and she always shares to me her financial struggles and how she needs to help her family out and how sometimes she can’t finish a college semester because she doesn’t have the money for it.

She called me not to long ago and she was crying that her bank account has a negative balance, that her family expects her to help them financially, and her dad is upset with her spending. She asked for my opinion on the situation and I told her that she wasted too much money on this guy and that money could have went to something more important. I also expressed how this guy doesn’t deserve her. She spent around $700 to stay at a hotel suite and it’s not like she’s going anywhere exciting it’s just 20 mins away from where she lives. That’s the biggest waste of money. Plus she spent around $400 for a gold chain for him and she bought him stuff for his gaming. 

I know during the course of their relationship she buys him stuff and she’s spent probably a total of $10,000 on him. From what I can see she buys his love and he never spends a dime on her. She spends too much money on him and he treats her like shit.  

I love my friend but I’m really worried over how much she’s spending over a man that constantly hurts her and treats her so horribly. I don’t know if I was right in telling her my opinion and I don’t know if I should have sugar coated what I said?

"I know having to go to a couples therapy thing while we’re young may seem like a red flag and I really don’t want anyone to say the relationship is going to fail because of it. 

My bf and I fell in love young, before we both learned how to love someone else respectfully and how to communicate and treat eachother how a significant other should be treated. We are still in love and our relationship is going very well, we’re growing and becoming our own individuals together and I really am so happy with him. 

However, a lot of things happened while we were young, things that hurt the both of us. We didn’t know how to establish boundaries, or speak to eachother in arguments, we didn’t know how to reassure one another and there wasn’t trust in the relationship. We’ve worked really hard to communicate with eachother and grow from these mistakes, however I personally feel like I’m stuck in them sometimes. 

Occasionally I feel like the trust I had in him at one point is gone, and it’s taking me a lot longer to regain that trust in him than it was for him to regain it in me. He has done things since that repeatedly broke down anything I worked towards healing, and I know it’s a process, and there will always be times where things get harder. 

However, because of this it’s made a block in my ability to forgive and forget. I can’t forget as easily as he can, I can’t move on the same way. I’ve become such an insecure and anxiously attached person because of the things he’s done, and I don’t know how to heal it. I wanted to try going to couples counseling with him, to learn how to resolve it and help him understand that it’s been a lot harder for me. 

Is this even worth it? I don’t want the relationship to come to an end, I want to put in the work. I’m just not even sure if this is the right step, or if I should do it on my own.

"Rejected me months ago when I asked her on a date. She turned me down (after not responding for over a week) and I agreed to stay friends just to make things not dramatic. I sorta regret that because its not what I want but saying no we can't be friends is harsh. Now she only contacts me via snapchats. She sends me like one exactly a month they are very neutral of course nothing suggesting interest. I do see her among other friends still, sometimes we talk a little. Doesn't seem like she's enthusiastic to do that though. Just seems a dead end and her still sending me a snapchat is like throwing me a bone or her validating herself.  
  
I don't want her to send me these in absence of other contact and with no hope of being closer. Should I just respond and say she can stop sending them to me and I know she means well. Or should I just open them and not respond. Or just not open them at all. It's been a while since the rejection I am not going to flip to not seeing her romantically. I know I should fully move on but I figure I should take the option above that at least puts the chips the most on my side of her changing her mind. If that's combined with not getting these messages anymore it's a win win, they keep her on my mind unnecessarily. Again...I KNOW the odds of her changing her mind are very low.

"TL:DR: My partner of 5 years spends up to 16 hours a day for the last 3 weeks to solve programming problems instead of spending time with me and I need advice on how to approach him about it.

What is Advent of Code?  
""Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."" Subreddit description from r/adventofcode (my post there got deleted and I had to make another throw away account to fit the criteria of this subreddit)  
I'm seeking advice on the following situation:  
My partner participates in Advent of Code for the 5th time in a row now. We got together the same year he did AoC the first time 5 years ago. We both studied Computer Science (we met in uni) and we both work as DevOps Engineers at different companies. I never participated in AoC but I think it is a really great event for programmers and I also understand the appeal of solving programming puzzles.  


My problem is how my partner is going through this event. The first few days are not so problematic since I understand the programming problems start out easy and get progressivly harder. But this also means that someone will need more time to solve a problem the harder it gets. So my partner spends up to 16 hours solving the puzzle for the day. I think (at least the previous years he did) he is also trying out different solutions or is trying to optimize his solutions. In the past years I asked about it when we had lunch or dinner because I obviously want to show interest in what he is doing and it is of course of benefit that I also understand what he is talking about.

  
But this year is just particulary bad. I took this week of from work because he originally wanted to fly on vacation. And he started to plan stuff but at the end it was all to short term because he spent the time doing AoC. I was ok with that and suggested to do stuff in our country since we moved recently and I want to get to know this region. We did nothing of that. Because even after I'm letting him solve a problem for 5 hours and asking him to stop so we can do stuff together in our days off he always responds with ""I'm done in 30 min"". Well, I come back in 1 hour and he is still not done. If I just let him be he doesn't even eat. And I get that. Being ""in the zone"" and fixing one bug after another, trying out different pieces of code until you finally find the solution. And I also get that he doesn't want to use tips or other solutions and come up with the solution himself. But not for this amount of time. Day after day after day. We didn't had sex since AoC started. He doesn't care about anything but AoC. I'm just extremely sad and angry. We argue every day. I don't know what to do.",My (28F) partner (27M) is obsessed with Advent of Code and I need advice on how to approach him?,18o4771,1703211958.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o4771/my_28f_partner_27m_is_obsessed_with_advent_of/,
"Would you date someone who tried over and over again to hookup with your best friend? Even after you told them no?  And tried to talk to them about it every time establishing ""clear"" boundaries .

This is the situation

I’m a girl , 23 yo just not dating because I don’t want to right now my health took a turn and it’s making dating weird. But I’m not worried, that stuff isn’t hard for me ❤️. Just waiting for my health to get better.You can call me Amy I’m bi, not a pharmacy student.

My best friend is a 23 yo dude of 10 years his name is Lyle we met in freshman seminar when we were 14 so we are good homies.  He’s straight.

Lyle and I are like the best of bros- we have a sibling dynamic not flirty at all

Lyle just started pharmacy grad and met a girl- her name for story’s sake is Sue.

Sue is a 26 yo pharmacy student who says she’s bisexual but doesn’t consider sex with girls to be “real sex”

Sue and Lyle had a FWB situation for a month or so. Amy was really happy for him, calling Sue- Lyle’s “girly friend” and telling people that she thinks Lyle is going to have his first relationship in college.

Lyle hasn’t ever really dated anyone. He had one gf in highschool and he doesn’t remember it as ending well

&amp;#x200B;

Setting: Lyle and Amy pickup Sue to hangout at a bar in LA - there’s no alcohol involved just some weed and cigarettesAfter Lyle and Sue were FWB for a bit he introduced Sue and AmyThey got along and Sue even aggressively flirted with AmyAmy went along with it mostly just to make time pass easiest- she honestly isn’t attracted to Sue. Just isn’t her type physically, mentally, emotionally. And she is only hanging out with her for Lyle. Amy was feeling sick and didn’t want to be on Lyle and Sue’s joyride (Lyle was helping Amy run errands that day and get busy work done) . It was a last minute thing when Sue had called Lyle out of boredom. Lyle asked if Amy wanted to hang out with her, Amy said yes for Lyle- she knows him and it’ll make him happy.Amy would also be very happy with a new friend to just run around with too if things worked out thatd'd be reall nice ☺️(It’s worth noting in private Sue told Amy she could make Kyle do whatever she wants, lyle even started smoking cigarettes for her. Sue also suggested to Amy they do coke together within the first few min of meeting)When Lyle goes inside at some point Amy and Sue are left alone outside.There She starts telling Amy how she wants to kiss her. Amy says Sue would have to ask Lyle, she tells Sue why it would make her uncomfortable because Lyle is more of family than even friend, and that she could never do anything like that behind his back. She said all of that to Sue. Sue is really aggressive with flirting, commenting on Amy’s appearance, what she wants to do to her, she even says Amy can be their “side piece”. This supremely grosses Amy out, because she isn’t attracted to Lyle or Sue- both are especially not her type- politely. Amy is even compelled to tell Sue how unattracted she is to her best friend to make clear it’s not a reality Sue can manifest.

Amy tries to dodge her advances but also still validate her, with the type of flirts Amy does with her friends. Amy wanted to appease the situation then confide in Lyle after- honestly and privately.Lyle comes back out from the bathroom.Sue doesn’t ask Lyle if she can kiss Amy. she just says she wants to kiss Amy in front of Lyle, Amy just repeated what Sue said to her back and said she wanted to kiss. Mostly for appeasement and to go along- it’s just a kiss. Lyle stares and enjoys it a bit- even telling us he didn’t mind us kissing. Which made Amy really uncomfortable, she didn’t want Lyle to watch and she told Sue that when she first brought up kissing.When Lyle says he enjoyed Amy and Sue kissing, Amy jokes to Sue “you should’ve made him pay to watch” and they all smoked a cigarette together and went inside. When the night is done Lyle and Amy drop Sue off at home and drive home together. Amy doesn’t have a car and Lyle is her neighbor. Amy tries to talk to Lyle about why she was uncomfortable with the whole kissing interaction and asks Lyle what his boundaries are with Sue and asks Lyle if he’d be okay with Sue kissing other people.  Because anybody who cared about Lyle knew he wasn't okay with it. it.  he says no, and he also says he isn’t ok with Sue and Amy kissing. And that he will talk to Sue. Lyle is possessive.

Then some time passes, maybe a week or so and then Lyle’s Gala rolls around. Lyle wanted to take Sue to the dance, and they both agreed to going together. Then Sue asks Lyle if it’s ok for her to go with someone else if she gets asked. This really bothered Lyle and they wound up having a fallout because Sue and Lyle both were defensive, and didn’t go to the dance together at all. Lyle wound up taking Amy as a friend. Lyle told Amy Sue and him had some distance the last few days.Setting: Pharmacy dance, kinda lame, just drunk nerds all trying to fuck each other in a micro sized schoolLyle invites his friend Greg and they Uber together from his placeAmy catches a ride from their hometownAt the Gala Lyle and Sue don’t interact much except for when Amy shows up. Amy arrived late like three hours- she lived over an hour and a half away and was really weak that day. After Lyle and Amy hang out for a little. Amy sees Sue, the only person she knows at the school and sits down next to her to talk all three of them hang for a bit and go outside to smoke a cigarette.  Sue and Amy kiss in front of Lyle again while they smoked.  Lyle got angry and whispered up into Amy's ear ""Don't ever do that again."" Amy couldn't process Lyle was only mad at her for the kiss, Sue instigated it again after all, and Amy said, ""Of course for my best friend of ten years"" .  Lyle's eyes lit up and he hugged Amy, that response made him happy.Time passes, Amy and Lyle go inside and dance together for a few minutes.  Sue sit's down at a table somewhere.  Lyle disappears for a bit.

Amy goes to sit with Sue because dancing was making her feel sick.  Sue immediately starts making moves on Amy, grabbing her leg, talking about how hot Amy is, talking about how she wants to continue the kiss from the bar and how it’s all she’s been thinking about. Sue says she’s been waiting only for Amy all night. Amy isn’t really used to such aggressive behavior specifically from girls, and also assumes Lyle and Sue have talked. Amy is wondering if maybe Lyle is letting Sue see girls? Immediately Amy’s response was to ask Sue if Kyle would be okay with it. Sue said she didn’t have to ask Kyle. Amy told Sue that Lyle had told her he didn't want them kissing or doing anything less than an hour ago.  Amy also feels pressured to reciprocate because she’s worried about making Sue feel insecure and doesn’t want a lot of confrontation.

Amy didn’t touch Sue like Sue was touching her, but she called her pretty back and complimented the kiss from before and said things to make Sue feel validated.Sue and Amy walk outside together to smoke again. Out there Sue got way more aggressive and tried touching Amy’s privates over and over. Rubbing her hand on her underwear. And was begging to have Amy sit on her face. Amy aggressively rejected Sue multiple times (which made Amy uncomfortable; she isn’t good in these situations), saying she couldn’t do that to her best friend. And also didn’t want to give Sue the satisfaction of being with her- because again. Amy even told Sue how Lyle doesn't want this. Amy is by no means physically attracted to Sue and Sue also never once asked Amy how she felt or what she wanted and that made Amy feel uncomfortable..

By the time Amy and Sue went inside they realized their lipstick had been smudged all over from kissing. Amy’s lipstick was kind of messed up Sue asked her why her lipstick was so much worse than Amy’s. Guilty. Sue’s face looked like a clown or a baby with makeup, with super red lipstick just all over her chubby cheeks chin nose lips.Amy remembers looking at Sue with her messed up makeup and just thinking about how her face was a measurement of her omission of guilt.Amy and Sue fix their makeup in the bathroom. Amy awkwardly tries to bring up Lyle in convo and make small talk. She has no idea how she’s going to tell lyle all of this.Lyle calls Amy looking for her. He asks them where they were and what they were doing. They both just say “walking around, smoking, fixing their makeup in the bathroom. “. Dishonest.

&amp;#x200B;

Sue tries to invite Lyle, Amy, and Greg to an after party. Andy encourages Greg and Lyle to go, and says she might grab dinner somewhere. Kyle really doesn’t want to party Greg wants to. Amy encourages the both of them to “party for her” because she physically couldn’t that night. Lyle and Greg just wants to stay in and be homebodies. As soon as they get in their Lyft to go home, lyle starts sobbing on Amy’s shoulder because the kiss made him cry hard.

&amp;#x200B;

When they get home Amy gets really cold and sick and Lyle takes her home at 5am because she forgot her medicine. Amy tells Lyle everything that happened, he firmly makes up his mind he wants his distance from Sue because he doesn’t want to just be friends and sleep with other people. Amy already knew he wanted this and told Lyle that she told Sue, but Sue didn’t care and kept pushing herself onto Amy. Lyle said he didn’t like that.Lyle resolves that Sue and him have to date or they can’t fwb anymore.  Sue calls Amy after the gala about how Lyle wants to date.  In this conversation  Sue never says she has feelings for Lyle, never calls him handsome, doesn’t compliment him a lot.  She confides she has a history of cheating and doesn't know if she wants a closed relationship. She talks about how her parents are very strict and traditional, who won’t let her date anyone outside of her culture so she can’t “let herself like him” and Sue also talks about her serial cheating history, and how she is bi and that she just wants to have Amy and Kyle at the same time. Sue joked it’s why people hate bisexuals. Amy joked in her head it’s why people hate cheaters- not bisexuals. Sue talks about how she’s never been with a girl but wants to. Amy tries to make small talk by talking about her experiences with girls and what she liked about them that was different from cis guys. Sue tried to relate by saying Lyle dresses nice, and has good hygiene and tries. Amy liked hearing that because none of her girl friends ever complimented the way Kyle dressed and so she went heavy on saying Sue should just stop playing around and ask Kyle out. Amy pressed that Sue liked Kyle and she wouldn’t be having this convo if she didn’t. Because Amy also knew that was what Lyle wanted. She said she was going to talk to Lyle about getting permission to be with girls.  She never did- Lyle had to bring it up.

&amp;#x200B;

The pharmacy finals are after the gala so Lyle and Sue stay at their campus to study for 2 weeks. Sue fails a class and lyle barely passes.  Sue has to stay on campus for winter break. Lyle goes back to his hometown.  Sue and Lyle are dating now and are officially monogamously boyfriend and girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

The day Lyle goes back home Sue starts texting Amy at like 7am offering to spend $150 in Ubers to get Amy to her dorm so they can hook up and kick it. Amy was confused when she just woke up. Her texts were basically behaviour from before in essence, except she was trying to instigate the hookup at her place when Lyle isn't there, and she was ready to spend $150. Amy again validated her, and declined.

&amp;#x200B;

Amy immediately tells Kyle but asks to not be involved and to not have her name brought up because she doesn’t think anything will come of it anyway, because nothing changed the last two times, Lyle says “of course what stays between us stays between us” after he reads the text messages he wants screenshots and gets really upset. Amy doesn’t want to be brought up, lyle said he wouldn’t bring her up, why does he need screenshots? Lyle gets weirder out by Amy’s reaction and starts getting defensive “what’s wrong with you why aren’t you on my side” your reaction should’ve been to “block that bitch” Amy is only on his side but wants to be on in good terms with whoever he is dating, even lyle has said he wants them to be friends . But Amy isn’t confident anything is going to change.Lyle talks to Sue and says he established “clear boundaries” and that she was “confused” on what was ok for her to do and not do.Even though Lyle has communicated what he wanted over and over and he has the most basic view on a monogamous relationship- it couldn't be confusing, Sue claims to have been confused.

The day after Lyle established his boundaries Amy woke up again to the same message chain except now she was getting nudes from Sue. Amy didn’t send any back (even though she loves to take nudes) she just sent her a photo back of the painting she was working on and validated her a little bit. Till Sue was ready to Uber Amy again, then she asked if Lyle and Sue had talked yet. Sue admitted they talked and told Amy what Lyle wanted didn’t matter because she still wants to be with girls and will do just that.

Amy screenshot the photos Sue messages “O:” and Amy sent one last message “I’m sorry Sue it’s an uncomfy situation. I hope you two can figure it out” then called Lyle, he got worked up again because Amy was uncomfortable getting caught up in the middle of it, just for it to turn out exactly the way it was before.Amy wanted to talk with Lyle in person because she knew it was a hard conversation and didn’t want to get shushed or hung up on because he was going to have to be hearing the hard stuff. Which is hard for anyone to sit and listen through. He was aggressive about picking sides, He told Amy “I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you, but you need to send me those screenshots right now” even though Amy was in the middle of sending them. And had told lyle as soon as Sue had sent the nudes and texted her. He said he was going to talk to Sue. After they talked on the phone he called Amy. He told Amy Sue said she was confused on the boundaries and didn’t think it applied to the internet. Sue got defensive and said that Lyle needed to figure out what he wanted. Basically an ultimatum. Even though it seems like Lyle was abundantly clear in what he wanted- it would’ve been clear to anybody.

Amy thinks that was a cheap cop out, because Sue only got caught with the best friend internet stuff of course she’d address it. But Amy told lyle “Sue said I could’ve uberred over” which meant she was okay with hooking up, so it wasn’t just internet stuff. And Amy also brought up how Sue said in her message that she knew Lyle didn’t like us talking. Lyle said “oh… I need to call her back” he called her then called Amy and said he was going to drive over spend the night still, and depending on the vibes he'd meet the parents. Amy asked why he was spending the night just to talk when he has an apartment nearby .  Kyle says he didn't even think about that and that no matter what he won't spend the night there because it's too intimate for him after she just broke his trust.  And that meeting the parents would be affected by it.

They’ve been dating for two weeks, Amy thought obviously if they sleep together they aren’t going to split up- and his decision with the parents would ultimately be affected by the fact they had slept together hours before.

He spent the night and sent Amy a photo of a baklava they were baking for mom and dad at 3am.  He met the parents. How could he not wonder if Sue’s parent’s would want their daughter to date someone she has already on cheated on five times?  If he really valued that?

Amy thought it was weird he spent the night regardless because that means that Kyle either lied to himself or to Amy about why he was driving over.

Amy is concerned because Lyle was lucky to have his best friend tell him about the times Sue was dishonest. He already had four opportunities where his best friend outed behavior he considered cheating. Now he won’t know because if Sue is pursuing or pursued other people Lyle won’t be able to have his best friend tell him.

That seemed. Like a luxury not a lot of people have early on in relationships. Would you date this person who tried over and over again to hookup with your best friend? Even after you told them no? I can't help but wonder if she had been caught with a guy kissing, and if it wasn't a girl best friend, would it have been different?  And isn't there no reason for Lyle to assume this behaviour started and ended with me?  Isn't it obviously probably happening with other people?  And not just the instances she was caught?",I am a (23F) and I'm worried about my best friend of ten years (23M) and his new GF (26F) who has tried to sleep with me multiple times in their first weeks of a relationship.,18o4726,1703211946.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o4726/i_am_a_23f_and_im_worried_about_my_best_friend_of/,
"Female best friend

This is a bit of a long one I think, but here goes met this guy and we’ve been dating for two about to be three months and it’s been great, except for the caveat that he has a female best friend. Now at first when we started talking for the first two weeks homie asked me out spontaneously then cancelled after a few hours because his friend got back to him, I.e this girl we’ll call her Emma . I gave a another Chance we went to a restaurant hit it off and I asked how he found this restaurant he proceeds to tell me that he and his best friend Emma came together and he enjoyed it so he brought me, felt a bit weird but I shook it off.

Went of consistently once a week one the weekends and we TEXT! very important distinction we text everyday all day he says he’s not a fan of talking on the phone, okay I gave him grace suddenly in one week he and Emma go to the outlet malls together and grab breakfast, then in the same week went to the city to go to a store he didn’t even want to go to, to see the Christmas tree and have dinner at a restaurant. I just to mention at this point this is just the two of them. And he consistently texts me throughout the day of their various activities with one another 🙄

I asked him about this friendship and he told me they met in school and that she pushed him to finish his degree and that they have their ups and downs like arguments and stuff but ultimately let it go, his words not mine. I asked if they had any romantic history he said no and if they’ve ever been attracted to one another and again he said no. All through text mind you I told him it bothered me that I wouldn’t get to see or hear from him for two weeks on account of his activities with Emma, and he gave me a surprise call that lasted maybe 10 mins or so. Then a call when he left the city with Emma which again lasted 10-15 mins. 

Now they are going to see a late showing of aquaman together tomorrow night and then on Saturday they are going to go out with her coworkers to have dinner, then I finally get my day on Sunday. So we talked about in person and he said that they are just platonic and nothing has happened and if it it did it would have happened by now and that I’m just making things up in my head then went on the deny that he called her his best friend when we were talking about it face to face. 

I feel like this friendship is more than what they are trying to admit to themselves and each other and he pointed out that I have three male best friends but they are all gay men so it’s like there is no risk of us ever sleeping together or falling for one another.

" Recently I’ve had an ongoing problem with my boyfriend of 1 year that I’ve been uncomfortable with the amount of porn he watches. I don’t mind if he watches porn but the amount in a day is kinda alarming. I’ve brought it up to him before he always says he’s gonna stop all together nd cut down but in reality he’s finding ways to try to hide it. Every time he tries to hide it I always find it again when I go through his phone, he then flips the argument on me and tries to make me feel as if me going through his phone is as bad as him sneaking the porn. We had made an agreement that I wouldn’t go through his phone and he’d stop watching the porn, but that agreement ended when I found him trying to sneak it again while I went through his phone. Not trying to justify why I went through his phone but our sex life started taking a decline, we were having sex less, he wasn’t staying hard during sex and just was making me feel unattractive.  After catching him once more he then says he’ll delete just all his social media and stop doing it. The issue wasn’t his social media but him being sneaky, I told him deleting his social was too much which he said he’ll delete the apps that he watches the porn on. Since he said that everything had been cool, our sex life got better we’d been really good. Till I looked on his phone today when I was calling my phone in search of it and there it was the apps and more that he uses to watch porn. Hoping I’d be wrong about him having secret accounts then they were, secret accounts on these apps. Idk how to confront him about this or if I should.  I really love him but my mind is split on if this is even worth trying if he hides this stuff from me. What’s fucked up to me is that I’ve proven and shown that I’m honest in our relationship.

"Heya!

I was out and about the other night and met someone I clicked with decently well. Asked her to dance — we did for about 45 minutes, maybe more, and talked about common interests, grad school plans, and how we both wanted to go ice skating (perhaps together). Exciting stuff!

Naturally I asked for her number. She (seemingly gladly) obliged, and typed out her full name. We said our goodbyes since it was closing time and went our separate ways. Sad to say when I texted the next day, I saw the green bubble of doom (she most certainly had an iPhone). 

I’ve been on the recurving end of the *give guy fake number* routine but based on everything else, it didn’t seem that way. We were both certainly tipsy so the idea of a slip up seems very feasible. I am also aware that it can be creepy for a guy to try and confirm a number the second you give it to him why is why I generally don’t. 

Anyways, I found her instagram pretty easily with what we talked about (and her full name) and am considering shooting a message. I don’t want to be a creep or bother her if she’s not interested. 

TL;DR: Met girl, clicked well, number she typed tipsy was wrong, found her insta. Don’t want to be a creep, but would like an ice skating date.

So:

1. Should I send her an Instagram message/give her a quick follow request?

2. Confirm numbers at the bar (when she seems genuinely interested)?

"Hi, I (66) need advice. My adult son (28), DIL(26), and their son (3M) are moving in long term with me due to their financial hardship (son lost job). This happened quickly (they asked a week ago and I said of course) They are coming from a different state and will be moving in January 2nd and there is no move out date currently or plan. My son, DIL, and I have been working to improve our relationship as I had different parenting views than them. They have boundaries related to their son and I at first didn’t understand but I am working hard to follow the rules. Things have been better. I am very nervous with them moving in, that it will put a strain on the relationship again and I don’t know how to navigate this. I know I need to sit down with them to discuss boundaries and rules again now that circumstances have changed but they are so stressed and dealing with so much I don’t want to make them feel unwelcome or cause any other stress. Should I maybe do this in a text? Do I let them lead the conversation? I really don’t want to ruin the progress we’ve made over the last few months. My son and DIL are very nice but I can tell they are wary of me. For example, I have a 3 bdr home. I offered the guest room to my son and DIL and offered to convert my hobby room/office  into a room for grandson to sleep in. They declined and said it would be better for them all to sleep together even though I know grandson usually sleeps in his own room in their current home. I sort of feel like I may be walking on egg shells until they are comfortable. Another concern is financially they need help (minimal savings) so a budget between us all will need to be part of the discussion (I’m not charging them rent, more just for food and necessities like that).

"I (F20) have been with my boyfriend (M20) for more than a little over 7 months. I love him and see myself marrying him in the future as he is everything I have ever wanted.

I come from a very conservative Hispanic family and have kept the relationship a secret. My parents think I should concentrate on my studies at university and avoid dating until I graduate and have a stable life.

My boyfriend has expressed interest in meeting my parents. 
Every year my parents have a party or a small get-together for the holidays, most of my mom’s family is coming from out of town and for the most part, we don’t typically invite people who are not family as it is seen as disrespectful to invite others, especially if we are not married or are in a  “serious” relationship (meaning more than 2 years). I am pretty terrified even to mention that I am dating, I know they will disapprove and I just don’t want drama between my boyfriend and my family members. 

When my boyfriend and I began dating, I informed him early on that 1) I wouldn’t be allowed to see him all the time and 2) I would be keeping the relationship a secret and away from my parents, he agreed and didn’t mind as he liked the idea of keeping the relationship more private as we both don’t use social media or anything like that. 

My boyfriend and I talked about this matter and I explained to him that I was not ready to tell my parents about us, I am still in school and I don’t want them to get mad at me or feel like I failed them, etc. He understood and again, over text my boyfriend brought iup the matter again and now he is saying that “i dont love him”,  “i am not putting enough effort” , “if i really did love him i would just tell my parents as normal couples do tell their parents when they are in love” these comments made me feel some sort of way i am really do feel like it is manipulation to a degree. i really do love him but his comments really hurt me.

"Me and her met towards the beginning of this year. We were friends for a short while but then she asked me out. After that we started hanging out all the time. It was amazing. We were both so happy. We would see eachother once or twice a week and she was frequently over at my house. Things were amazing for a good while and we had so much fun together but fast forward half a year later and things are just not the same. She has stopped coming over as frequently and now there's multiple weeks between vistits. She has gotten a new job that keeps her busy almost the entire week. She seems way less happy and relys on getting high to ""be okay"". She also shows less affection towards me and when she does come over it doesn't feel like it used to. She responds to my texts way less often and with fewer words. When she does come over it feels less special and happy and she's usually high. Things only seem to be getting worse now. She somewhat recently admitted lot of personal things to me over text about the bad things she's done and how she doesn't fully understand love. She said she told me this so I could know ""who i've been dating"". She said she was a ""bad person"" and that this was ""an out"" for me. I told her that I don't think she's a bad peron and that I would never break up with her. But after that whole conversation it still feels like we're farther apart than ever and I cry so hard whenever I remember how things used to be. Things feel more one sided than ever. She's supposed to be coming over for Christmas but after that I won't get to see her at all for the rest of the year cause she'll be too busy with work. I really hope that Christmas is when things start getting better but I've almost lost all hope. I'm not sure if I should bring up these issues face to face with her so she can't just avoid them like she does when I text her about them or if it would be best to not bring it up. I really don't know how to make things better. This is my first real relationship I've even been in and I can't tell if this is just a phase or if things are beyond saving or if there's something I can do. I don't know what the main problem is or if it's even something that can be fixed. I don't ever want to give up on this relationship. I want to spend my whole life with her. I always have.

He tries to tell me again that he loves me but we are both drunk so I accept it this time and I actually said it back but whenever we are together during the day or when we are sober he never says it to me!

TLDR: Girl I'm talking to is being short it responses sometimes and I dont know how to respond.

Doing on a burner account lol but need some advice from the internet, let's see how it is💀. Im a 20 year old male that I would say is above average in looks wise from the words of other people but I still look down on myself a lot. Anyways back to what i need advice for, I've been friends/co workers with this one girl for about a year now and I've always thought she was pretty and sweet but one reason or another I never pursed her even though I knew she kinda liked me. If you want more context i wouldn't mind saying it, but I just started perusing her and shes already said yes to a date but shes very busy with a internship, the job we work at and other things (from my knowledge she has a very active social life) and when texting her she sometimes comes off as short. She doesn't ask many questions, she sometimes responds with one word and I've always hated people who are short texters. I always lose intrest in the girls that are like that immediately but I want this time to be different. Ik she could just be busy with life and I'm probably looking way to deep into it but does anyone have an idea on why she would be short on the response?

So I've (30M) worked with this girl (30F) for 5 years and we've become very close at work, sometimes chatting for long periods of time. 
I have a crush on her and I've sometimes hinted at it jokingly but I never took the step of asking her out because we work together, and me being the overthinker that I am, have a rule of never dating a colleague because if it doesn't work out, things can get complicated at work. Plus I generally like to keep my private life and work life separate. 
Now that she is leaving, I am crushed but at the same time, I feel that maybe now is the right time to ask her out. 
Bonus question: she always sends me a gif that she knows annoys me so I am thinking of putting a screenshot of it on a mug and giving it to her as a leaving gift.

"I’m a 18 (F) and my boyfriend is a 22 (M). We’ve been together for about 8 months now. His family consists of Mother 39 (F), Father 40 (M), sister 21 (F), and brother 23 (M). I’m his second relationship and his first girlfriend was not exactly stealer, she never got a drivers license till the age of 19 and she vaped so much she almost became a highschool drop out. She also crashed a car illegally driving and she was far from being intelligent in many ways. Unfortunately his ex and I both have curly hair so his whole family sees me as her… it hurts because I work a full time job and I graduated highschool early and got a scholarship to Wright State University. I’ve had my drivers license since 16 and I was forced to be mature at and early age. My boyfriend and I have a house together and I help pay bills and I work my ass off to take care of all our reptiles, quails, and cats. I cook, I grocery shop, I clean the house, do laundry, and all the stuff. His parents thought me being with him would be bad but for 6 of the 8 months, I’ve been taking care of him and sharing a home with him. This brings me to the main point of the post, his, “family best friend,” we’ll call (Libby). Libby is best friends my boyfriend little sister 21 (F). Anytime his sister goes anywhere and she mentions my boyfriend and me are there, Libby has to come no matter the circumstances. At first I didn’t think anything of it, but one time I brought a dozen of eggs to my boyfriend (before we lived together) and Libby decided to drop by 2 hours later to give my boyfriend 2 dozen of chicken eggs. She made sure to give my boyfriend huge hugs that lasted longer than 10 seconds with full front body contact. I would just stand there and pet his dog, pretending it was normal. But things kept getting worse, we go to family dinner and Libby was there to hug my boyfriend and she never would even acknowledge or say hi to me. I began to feel like I wasn’t real or a person. His father was the only one saying hi and bye to me and his mother wouldn’t even acknowledge my existence no matter how kind I was. His mother tonight at his sisters birthday recommended that him (my boyfriend) go out drinking with his little sister and Libby this weekend without me… because I’m just a stupid “non drinker”. She did this right in front of me. My boyfriend just said, “Nah,” because he loves me and enjoys our time playing video games and loving the animals more than partying. I said I can’t go to their yearly cabin Christmas trip because I have to work sadly, and his mother just looked at Libby and she smiled. I knew this ment that Libby gets my spot at the Cabin with my boyfriend. So I’m stuck working my ass off and taking care of this whole house by myself while Libby gets to drink and flirt with my Boyfriend. I talked to my Bf about this and he said it’s no problem because we trust eachother and Libby will be nothing more than a family friend. But I told him Drinking can lead to unexpected events. In return he said he’d never change his love for me even drunk, this seemed like a strange counter to me. I told him I didn’t like how Libby held the door open for him and not me at the end of the night… she proceeded to slam the door in my face. He said it ment nothing and she was just nice.

"TLDR: My Boyfriend doesn’t really seem interested in doing much of anything and I really feel like it’s directed towards me. When I invite him to family events he says “I’d rather not go if I don’t have to.” 

I (F20) have a boyfriend (M22) and I just don’t feel like he is interested in me. It drives me insane because I don’t know if I’m overthinking. He and I have been dating for a little over a year and I feel it’s important to say that we work together, and while we see each other, we don’t really interact with each other and when we do it’s usually with our friends after all work is done. We broke up one time earlier into the relationship bc he ignored me for a whole weekend after talking to me regularly, flaked on many dates, just general communication stuff. We later got back together bc he said he just doesn’t like doing things on the weekends and tends to have times when he wants to shut himself away and not talk to anybody(mental health reasons). I was like fine but let’s have breakfast on Fridays so I’m “out of your hair” that’s actually what I said. Well breakfast turned into breakfast with friends and I was okay that’s fine. Well almost every weekend he’s with his one friend (we’ll call him J), and I know this because BF gives his location out to ppl he’s close with and he tells me on Monday providing I ask or I overhear when he’s talking to other ppl. I like J he’s told BF that he’s not going somewhere unless I’m invited bc you can’t just invite everyone but your partner, in front of your partner and we’re all friends. Regardless he goes out with J every weekend meanwhile I can’t even get a text out of him when I rarely text him. And just today I asked him if he’s coming to the Christmas party my family was holding that he was invited to. He flaked on the last one. He’s only went to two events, my grandmas funeral and a party, we mostly stayed in the basement away from ppl bc he doesn’t like crowds. Well I said “I’d really like if you’d go” and he stayed silent and didn’t want to look at me and then said “I’d rather not go if I don’t have to” I told him that him saying that kinda hurt, that what if his mom invited me somewhere and I said that, it’s kinda insulting. So then he said he’d go, that if I’m forcing him then he will and I replied that I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing him and that I shouldn’t have to force him. I’ve brought up how I feel like it’s just me he doesn’t want to see and he only really says that it’s not true. I just don’t know and I’m kinda starting to feel like maybe it’s me and I’m just being dramatic.","I ( F20) have been dating my BF ( M22 ) for a year, I’m starting to think he’s not interested in me, should I be worried?",18o3qy9,1703210582.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o3qy9/i_f20_have_been_dating_my_bf_m22_for_a_year_im/,
"My bf (M 30) says hes afraid of me (F 30)

We’ve been dating for 2 years. Within those two years he’s been emotionally avoidant and he started dating me within months of breaking up with his ex which I wasn’t aware of. 

Now also within those 2 years, I caught him sneaking around and hanging out and going out to eat, as well as texting constantly with that ex multiple times. And I lease it clear to him that I did not feel comfortable with him hanging out with her. It got to the point where I know now that he was emotionally cheating on me with her. Venting to her, complaining to her about me, even admitted he said some not so nice things about me. One of the most traumatizing things he did was one weekend when I was feeling like we hadn’t been spending a lot of time together bc he was always working. I expressed that to him and he didn’t care. That day I had to go celebrate my sisters birthday. On the way I took a picture of a biker couple (he has a bike) and captioned it “could he use” trying to be funny and he responded saying it was too cold to ride. Later that night I found out while I was with my sister he took his ex on a bike ride up the mountains. 

Fast forward to this year he developed a drug and alcohol addiction. But he confessed to me that he didn’t want to treat me badly anymore and that he loved me more than anyone else. 

We were living together but I told him to leave this year bc of the drug and alcoholism. But we still stayed together. He hated his new living situation and always begged to stay with me because he felt safe but last weekend he left because he said he didn’t feel stable and was going to drink so I let him be. 

I called him Saturday multiple times and he didn’t answer. When he finally did he asked why I was blowing him up and basically reduced me to being worthless. That Sunday he came around acting nice and took me out. It was all fine until I found out again that night that the reason he wasn’t answering is because he took his ex out that day for her birthday. 

That was the last straw but even now he blew up at me for getting angry and still being angry. He’s been all nice after that but I don’t want anything to do with him. He keeps saying he doesn’t know why I’m mad because he didn’t hide it, he told me. I preface by saying he only told me because I asked him that night if he had talked to anyone while he was away that weekend. He didn’t actually tell me on Saturday when it happened. 

He then told me that he cant tell me anything bc hes scared of me. He basically think it's OK to do stuff that he knows is going to hurt me as long as he tells me that he did it, but even then he doesn't tell me on his own. I have to ask him questions to even find out.

I do get emotional when I find out he's done stuff that I don't want him to do so I can understand that he's scared to tell me stuff, but at the same time I keep telling him that he shouldn't be putting himself in those situations to begin with .

"           LONG READ BUT PLEASE HELP!!
      Hi first time posting to this group.ive been married for going on 8 years now. In 49 year old  male she's a 40 year old white female we are in the Marienville area of Pennsylvania. Like most marriages we have had our ups and downs. 
            Overall we are pretty solid and she is one of my best friends. The truth is about 2 years ago our sex life was not hot or exciting it had become routine and mundane at best. I'm not sure what happened comfortability, busy work schedules we kind of grew apart romantically. Sex was really a chore or felt like an obligation. It was flat out unfulfilling. Same positions same routine just vanilla.
         So around that time we both were extremely dissatisfied with our level of intimacy. We had a serious and frank discussion and we're both honest with ourselves and each other. Neither of us wanted to find excitement and satisfaction in an affair. The thought had crossed both of our minds but we still loved each other and we have built a life together.
        We were good in almost every other area of our relationship but weren't really in tune with each other sexually. It was really a crossroads for us. If things didn't improve and quickly we were in trouble. Communication they say is the most important element in a relationship. Let me tell you they are right. 
          So we had what was a nerve wracking and uncomfortable discussion. It was really a time of introspection and exposing your own inadequacies and it's tremendously difficult to be that vulnerable with another human, even your partner but we did it.
            What we realized that after 7years and change of being married (and 3 dating,) we just got lazy. We weren't taking the time to explore new things or step out of our comfort zone. To say we needed to spice things up is an understatement. We decided to spice things up and we agreed not to judge one another for our fantasies. That can be awkward and takes a great deal of trust and comfortability with your partner. I guess we both held back a little. We started small.
       We watched porn together. We experimented with sex toys and lingerie (, for her not me)they were all ok. We even went as far as to have a threesome with a call girl. We both would agree the experience was very underwhelming. It certainly isn't what porn makes it out to be at least in our experience. It was awkward we were both unsure of boundaries even though we talked about them beforehand it was just awkward and not hot at all. Plus the call girl I'm pretty sure was a heroin addict she looked nothing like the picture on line and she reeked of camel cigarettes and bad decisions. So that was pretty much our clue that wasn't for us and we aren't exactly swinger type people. Sorry but gross, no offense to those in the lifestyle but it's just not our cup of tea. 
         So my wife who is very conservative and I guess you would describe as shy and reserved said that she does have a fantasy that she was reluctant to share because she feared being judged by me. I told her that at the outset if this journey we agreed no judgement. I would regret that agreement shortly thereafter. She asked me to participate in a role play. She has just one particular role play that she wanted to engage in. 
           There is a TV program from the 90s I think it's called family matters. I had seen an episode here and there wasn't a big fan but my wife apparently was, at a level that I have never known.
     I guess she had a celebrity crush on the character Steve Urkel. He's kinda the goofy nerdy science geeky character. So she asked me to play him in bed. Again promising to remain judgement free I agreed without questions. At first she had me wear a pair of thick glasses and would just say ""Call Steve Daddy"" repeatedly at the beginning that would get her riled up and she was satisfied. The problem is it keeps progressing.
           She had me start wearing suspenders and hiking my pants up. I have to talk in a high pitched nasally voice. She makes me repeatedly yell ""did I do that"" louder and louder she at this point is unable to reach orgasm unless I'm in full character and using the voice and catch phrases. Then there are off shoots to the role play. It's Steve Urkel in various situations it's dirty teacher Steve Urkel teacher &amp; naughty schoolgirl, there was family matters scenario where she played some character from the show called Laura? Not a fan of the show when it was on much less of a fan now. There were countless other scenarios there was crooked cop Urkel, plumber Urkel, Burglar and rapist Urkel, Doctor Urkel I don't even remember all of them. 
       I know I promised not to judge but this Urkel fetish is really becoming uncomfortable for me. 
          My wife has begun buying me clothes similar to his and repeatedly asks me to do the voice even out of the bedroom. She is totally disinterested in sex unless it's Urkel themed. When I try something I'm interested in she lays there dead fish style. She is totally unable to achieve orgasm unless I'm in character and asking his catch phrase. She recently asked me to come to bed in black face make up to make it ""more believable,,"" her words. I also found a stash of teenage magazines from the 90s like tiger beat and I'm not sure of the rest of the names, teen scene and whatever. She is totally out of control with this fetish. It's like she has no interest in me anymore. I regret trying to spice things up.
        
    Things sucked before. But at least I knew she loved me. Right now I'm just a vessel a  body/sex toy that she can pretend is Urkel. I really believe this has progressed to the point where we can't return from. I mean I'm a middle aged white man I'm not Steve Urkel, i look nothing like him and never will be Steve Urkel. I believe that as my wife's appetite for a more Steve Urkel Like sex experience she will progressively require more realistic experiences. I really think she will start looking at younger African American teenagers. Glasses , smart socially awkward I know she has lost interest in me unless I'm in full Urkel character. 
       I know we said we wouldn't judge at the beginning but I'm uncomfortable and I think we are past the point not no return. In my wife's eyes she only really wants Steve Urkel sexually. I don't think she even loves me at this point. She asked if it's ok if she calls me Steve. My name is Mark. I told her I'm uncomfortable with that. She was pissed. I need advice. I'm trying to save my marriage but this Urkel fantasy is making me feel like less of a man.

"this is going to be a very long post I think. first I do want to say I love this girl with all my heart. we met October 2022 and up until now, we only had one serious break and that was mid may until the beginning of august. the reason why we broke things off was because I wasn’t trusting her like I was supposed to. around April of 2022, the curiosity got the best of me and went through her phone. there I saw her talking to what she said one of her old guy friends from high school and she said she saw him at the soccer field when she was playing soccer. she never mentioned it to me so before I saw her texting the guy, the texts were nothing bad from what I saw but she hid them from me. she muted the guy and deleted all the messages they sent. she said she only did it because if I was gonna go through her phone I was going to see them and get mad and possibly “end things with her” and than she started crying bc she felt guilty. only reason I saw the text was bc he texted her as soon as I was about to get off her phone, I saw her Instagram dms go up one. I believed like I said they weren’t texting like she was cheating but the fact that she hid it from me hurt me. I thought if she did this once, she’s probably doing it almost everytime we see each other. I thought I would’ve let it go but it was bugging me so much. I lost trust for her and I got insecure in a way, I would always ask her for reassurance and asking her almost every time where she would go and we shared locations. I was getting controlling and it hurt us from there. I loved her more than I loved myself and it was the sad truth. we went our separate ways in may and I did things that made me find my happiness. (FYI she’s my first every love and relationship. I never had anyone there for me in my life so she’s my first.) I went out to a family party and there was a girl who caught my eye and we talked and danced. the girl was pretty and I got her number after, this was in mid June but I didn’t do anything with her. I felt guilty though I was single bc I was thinking about her. I missed her so much it hurt. July is where I really started to love myself and that’s where she contacted me. she called me at midnight and told me, she missed me and loved me still very much and I did too. we tried again in mid august and I felt like I fell in love with a whole different women. we loved each other so much and I did everything different. I trusted her again and took her out on more dates and bought her flowers. towards the end of September she told me to sleep over her house bc her mom was out of the town and so I went for 2 days. my life changed for ever after those days. everything went well but I felt like she was hiding something from me. I should note she told me she went out with a guy during those months we were broken up but she said it was nothing at all. I had dreams of her cheating on me before the sleep over and it was daily. i had the biggest gut feeling I ever felt and it wasn’t good. i fucked up and went through her phone twice, the first time I saw her texting other guys and a lot of them. I didn’t care about that bc we were single. the second time I digged harder and wished I didn’t, I went through her snaps and nothing bad but than I went to her memories and I saw a video of her kissing another guy and taking pictures. my heart dropped and a part of me died, I was a dead man walking I swear. she didn’t cheat bc it was when we were broken up but she lied to me… again. she told me she didn’t do anything with anyone. she wasn’t in the room when I saw it. also her dad was home so I had to be extra quiet and careful. when she told me what’s wrong I was quiet and cold and she got mad, I had to cool myself down bc my emotions were all over the place. I told her I went through her phone and saw her kissing another guy and she looked confused and scared. few mins pass by and we talked, she was crying and saying that she’s sorry and said we were broken up. she blamed herself. I was there in disbelief and still shocked but I comforted her and let her cry on my arms. I was the one hurting so much but I loved her so much. the video was from July also so that’s what hurt even more. I tried to forgive and forget but it’s still so hard. everytning hurt me, physically and mentally. I understood we were broken up but it really took you 2 months to go and touch another guy and than proceed to contact me knowing you were “talking” with that guy and say y’all did nothing? A part of me thinks I should’ve left her then and there and the other part loved her too much to even leave her. I’m still with her and im still trying to trust her. it’s hard not thinking she’s doing something behind my back nowadays. she isn’t the type to hookup too, she’s very religious and is waiting for marriage. it does look like she’s trying but the overthinking sometimes gets the better of me. please tell me what to do and how to be better.",I(M 21) having trouble trusting my girlfriend.(F 19),18o3bwl,1703209297.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18o3bwl/im_21_having_trouble_trusting_my_girlfriendf_19/,
"Often times when my gf tells me that she will do something for example shower or eating she would ignore my texts while being online on social media (she doesn’t know that I can see her online status). What could be the reason behind this? Even if I message her on her social media she would ignore while being active. Also whenever she then posts something (while ignoring me) she then send me a message so it doesn’t look like she was ignoring my texts. 

She would constantly do this. We make an appointment to call with each other and while I’m rushing to be on time to call with her cause I care about her time too. This is what often happens.

Back in October he had a 4 people get together for Halloween an didn’t tell me cause he automatically assumed I was free. I knew everyone that went to the get together so I know he isn’t cheating on me or trying to hide me. I approached him about it and told him it made me feel so unwanted. He said he’s going to try harder to remember these things. He was doing great for a month but then fast forward to yesterday. His brother (23M)  is in town which he barely sees so I told him to spend as much time with him and how we’ll just see eachother on Christmas Eve. I was then told that he’s going to the movies with his brother, his brother’s girlfriend and other friends. So it just being a bro thing is out of the picture. I’m so angry. I’m so disappointed. I’m so sad. I feel so unwanted and forgotten. He didn’t invite me! He said that he forgot and he didn’t put two and two together cause I told him to spend time with his brother. If so many other people are going why was I not part of this? He then promised he’ll try harder which is what he said last time.

"How can I support my wife?

TLDR: my wife is excluded at work after accepting the position based on the team atmosphere she was told existed. 

My wife has worked for her company for over 10 years in a few different roles. She is about 6 months into a role she moved into that is different from what she was doing previously. Prior to changing positions she interacted with her current co-workers, and they talked about what a happy team they were, how they shared lunch most every day, and always helped each other out. She has not experienced any of the things they spoke about. 

She gets her work done, despite the complete lack of training she was told she would receive. Her co-worker or supervisors didn’t train her on anything and told her “it’s easy, you’ll figure it out”, however others have stopped by to “help out” on occasion and they get personalized instructions. She leaves for lunch and is met with “what did you bring us” on her return, however if any of them leave they openly ask each other if they want food from xxx, but never ask her. 

Today was the last workday before the Christmas break. Her and her coworker decided to go in together on a gift for their supervisors, and my wife got her coworker a gift as well. Supervisors each got my wife’s coworker a gift, and my wife received nothing. The gift isn’t the issue, it’s the exclusion and lack of acknowledgment. I guess they were’t lying when they talked about how awesome of an environment it was, just neglected to tell her she wouldn’t be included in it.

"
i have been dating my boyfriend for over two years now. we have a wonderful and very special connection. i’ve never been treated better in any other relationship. he loves me deeply, and i love him deeply too. our first few months of dating, the sex was great and frequent, however i did notice he never went down on me (despite me going down on him pretty much every time.) as the years have gone by, his sex drive has plummeted. we have sex…maybe once a month. it’s been like this since month 2 of our relationship. i would be happy with at least once a week (but previously in relationships thrive off of once a day.)


here is what i have learned from over two years of dating this man. he does suffer from depression (which seems to get worse in the winter) and his sex drive definitely corresponds to how depressed he is. he also doesn’t like going down on women in general very much. he swears up and down (at my behest) he has no sexual trauma around it or anything. we have had countless conversations about how much it means to me for that to be reciprocated, but at a certain point it just feels like pressuring someone into a sex act they don’t enjoy, and the only thing worse than no oral sex is reluctant oral sex. i take good care of my hygiene and no other men have ever complained, and if anything, were very eager to go down on me frequently. i also take good care of my body and stay fit. i’m not the skinniest girl in the whole world, but i’m around 5’4 and 120 pounds and live a very athletic lifestyle. he also swears he likes the way we have sex and it’s nothing to do with performance. he’s had this exact problem in his previous relationships too. i’ve also tried not going down on him anymore, and after a few months of no blowjobs he didn’t say anything or even seem to notice their absence and was perfectly content to just jump into sex without them. i honestly missed giving blowjobs so i just gave up and started doing it again. he has sworn up and down his disinterest in sex has nothing to do with my appearance and he promises i am attractive enough (even though i sometimes feel otherwise). we go through phases where he’ll temporarily have a higher sex drive where we’ll fuck once a week or more for a month or so, but it always wanes and goes back to our typical once a month cadence. the first year of our relationship he admitted he watched porn and was jacking off every day, while rejecting me for sex constantly. he has since addressed his relationship with porn and claims he no longer watches it a problematic amount. he also has avoidant attachment due to some childhood neglect and abuse he has not addressed. i’ve been basically begging him to get a doctor’s appointment to check his hormones and get into therapy, but he’s maintained he can’t afford it due to shitty insurance. this may change in the new year though. 


here’s where i get fucked up. we have tons of friends who do open relationships and polyamory type stuff, and while we were monogamous we were always adjacent to that lifestyle. once last year, in the midst of us not fucking, he told me he’d be interested in opening our relationship sexually at some point. this broke my heart because it felt like he didn’t want to fuck me, but wanted to fuck other people?! anyways fast forward i do a ton of research on poly (while he does almost none) and im like fuck it. maybe this is a great way to get my sexual needs met while still getting to keep the emotional connection i have with him. so we tried it. he seemed thrilled i suggested it. his sex drive for me immediately increased and we started having amazing and frequent kinky sex with each other. it was almost like being desired by others made him want me more. i had massive success and lots of potential lovers besides him. he, however, found himself struggling to find partners. he wanted to close things up again. i was devastated. he said he learned poly is a dealbreaker for him, and he realized how much he appreciated me. 

we ended up breaking up for a few weeks, mainly over this because i realized i didn’t want to give up my poly lifestyle and newly acquired lovers. it was devastating. i’ve never missed anyone more in my life. i’ve dumped and been dumped before and definitely missed my ex partner, but the way i felt about him was deep in my gut that it was wrong that we weren’t together. we stayed in touch during the breakup period and were still having frequent and kinky sex. he also went down on me enthusiastically every. single. time. my close friends all said we should probably stay broken up a little longer, but it felt so wrong. we got back together monogamously. everything was good for awhile. and now guess what’s happening again? classic story. he stopped doing those things. he once more seems disinterested in sex, and doesn’t go down on me when we fuck. we almost fucked the other day, but after extensive foreplay and a long blowjob i got into the 69 position. it was so awkward with him only fingering me and not eating me out (one of his old classic moves) that i stopped everything and told him i didn’t want to have sex anymore. his reason was (i shit you not) it was hard with a low sex drive to want to go down on me when i haven’t shaved. i normally am pubeless and personally prefer it that way too, but recently got surgery so my showers are quick and focused on hygiene vs my usual beauty routine. 


i’m at a loss here. what else can i do? i love him and want to be with him, but am so weary from all the emotional labor i’ve had to do. i’m so sick of crying myself to sleep over not feeling fuckable enough for him. i get the sense he might have some kind of madonna vs the whore complex. i also suspect his avoidance of sex might have to do with his avoidant attachment and childhood trauma. part of me wants to wait to see what happens with us after he finally gets medical attention and/or therapy for this. the other part of me is extremely sexually frustrated and just wants to get fucked again. not just fucked…desired. wanted. even when we do have sex he doesn’t usually seem super into my body. again he swears he is, but he rarely compliments me or makes me feel sexy. we’ve discussed scheduling sex and he agreed to the cadence of once a week. i’m hoping that helps. but the root problem of not feeling sexy to him is still there. 


tldr; bf won’t fuck me as frequently as i’d like. tried polyamory and he hated it. improved for awhile upon breakup, back to old habits now.

"My bf (19m) and I (18f) have been getting into the little mood recently and have been very close to having sex. We’ve had conversations before which is something regular between us now since we’ve been together for a while. But, recently he’s been telling me if he can put it in “just to see how it feels” and then take it out. I tell him no because I know that gonna lead to sex and I don’t want to do it without a condom or any protection. We’ve gotten into it again and have been extremely close to doing it and he asks me the same thing again, which he did end up doing a little bit but just the tip until I told him to just stop because I know that’s not what I want. I’ve told him to buy condoms or that we can go together or he can at least come and wait for me outside to buy them. But, it just sounds like he doesn’t want to and is using small excuses to not buy the condom. Why is this? Why can he not possibly want to buy the condom? Is he “embarrassed” or does he actually  just want to have sex to leave me after and that’s why he doesn’t care about the condom. Lastly, I wonder if he’s trying to get me pregnant ? We’re not at a good place to even be thinking about having kids since we’re both basically teens/young adults. I know he cares about me but these small things make me wonder if he really does.

"So, I recently broke up a toxic two year relationship with my ex, for the sake of the post I'll call him M. M and I worked at the same store for a few months, and I got to know all of his coworkers. One of his coworkers, the girl he's now dating, I'll refer to as A.   
A has always been one of the younger workers, I believe that she is now 19, but I'm not entirely sure. I hope she is for M's sake. A's mom is also a manager at the store, a manager my ex hated.   
My ex would, at any given chance, make fun of A to me and his friends. He would call her really terrible things, call her a whore, and just absolutely ridicule her to me and his friends, but never to A's face. My ex would do the same to A's mom, and make fun of her mom at any given chance.  
After the break up, he's now posting pictures of him and A on his social media, something he never did with me which tells me he's trying to flaunt her.   
I worry about A for her own sake, and while I don't want to be bothered by him and his antics anymore, I'm seriously worried if I should tell her about these things. If he was so ready to verbally abuse her without her there, what does he do when she's around? What does he say now to his friends , now that A is allowing him to be intimate with her? M is the kind of guy to not care about boundaries, or the other person in a relationship.   
A has gotten into relationships with other coworkers in the same place in the past, but I don't think it's ever okay to say those kinds of things about a woman. And while A's mom isn't always the best manager, especially recently since her mom has a lot of family troubles, I don't think it's called for what he's said about her.

obsessed but I always catch him looking at me. More recently when I had to take gym he did
this thing when we would have to run the track were if I would slow down, stop, or fall behind
(not in a 7 foot distance to him) he would stop and act like he was doing something. Like tie his
shoes, change his music, or go on his phone. We have had VERY FEW interactions. We have

There is a coworker that I made a move on and she rejected me. We talked about the incident after in which she asked me not try again and I promised. 

Problem is she behaves like a moth to a flame around me. Always wants to talk, wants my attention, texts me constantly during the day. I want to ignore and move on but she really makes it hard and I cannot be rude since we work very closely. I feel like she wants my attention but nothing more. 

I want to move on and decrease the contact to absolutely necessary things but how do i do that when she spends half her day trying to talk to me. I cannot blatantly say we can’t talk since our work is dependent on each other.

"I’m (19m) currently confused on what I should do. Recently I was technically in a relationship with someone (19f) and it ended after a few days of our first date because we did move a little fast by giving each other the labels already of “boyfriend and girlfriend” on that date. This is the first time for both of us dating, so we didn’t really know what to do. After a few days, She called me at night sounding worried and saying that she wants to break it off because she’s worried that she was going to leave me after college since apparently she has done that with old friends before. I understand that she may worry, but now she wants to stay friends and wants to focus on herself for the time being. All this could be fine if it wasn’t for the opinions I’m getting from most of my friends. Recently I texted her and we texted back and fourth pretty well for a decent bit and I eventually asked her if she wanted to call sometime for her to take 40 minutes to respond and say she’s busy for this week and apologized twice. Most of my friends are telling me that it’s a sign she’s not interested anymore, only a few people have told me to wait and this is just one time saying she could legitimately just be busy this week.

"It’s summer where I live, and I went to work with a simple dress that didn’t cover my arms and the fabric wasn’t thick. My coworker, let’s call her Jenny, is pregnant, and we all try to make sure she is comfortable, but in the end, we are all equal.  
Since it’s getting hot some days, it’s normal to use the air-conditioning, but I am kinda sensitive to the cold when it’s too much. It’s not such a big of a deal, sometimes I ask the rest if I could change the temperature for a while, and then adjust it to what it’s needed, other times I wear a coat, sometimes other coworkers would ask to shut it and open the windows for a while to avoid too much of a closed environment.  
But today we were just Jenny and I. And from the very first moment she was at her desk, Jenny put the A/C pretty strong and stated “I’m putting the A/C high and whoever doesn’t like it, put on a coat”. That annoyed me, not gonna lie, I didn’t have a coat with me, it was easy to tell, and the fact she couldn’t just ask like we all do taking in consideration the others pissed me off.  
I worked for like an hour feeling pretty cold, trying to hang on to the A/C, and in a bad mood until I couldn’t take it anymore. So, I did something petty and wrong. Jenny was with her computer working, and she had her own jean jacket on the side of her desk (we have big desks at work), and after looking at it for a second, I took it and put it on, and proceeded working without feeling cold anymore, a blessing I have to say. I work right beside Jenny, our desks are right next to each other without any kind of division between desks and just a meter away from each other, so I knew she would see me using it eventually. I was hoping she would also take it as a joke, after all we all prank each other at work, some are harder than others.   
After an hour Jenny noticed me and asked me “Are you wearing my jacket” to which I answered “Yeah, it’s too cold here”, she continued “You could have asked me“ and my response was ”Hey, it was your idea I put a jacket if it was too cold for me” Jenny didn’t like my action, so I took it the safe way and took of the jacket and gave it back to her, she even said I could use it if I wanted, to which I said to her to not to worry, I rather keep the cold than to make more drama. Even so, Jenny put the A/C on a more bearable temperature and we kept working. I was all ok at simple sight, but I’m used to passive aggressive actions, so I know she was pissed. I gave her space and almost didn’t talk to her, but I knew she was moody.  
I know perfectly well I am the one at fault. I shouldn’t take the jacket without permission, not matter how cold it was or the fact I was right next to her, I should have considered her feeling, after all, she is pregnant in summer and she didn’t want to boss around me when she said I had to deal with the cold the same way I didn’t mean to make her angry by taking it. I think there are a lot of bad things going on in my country right now, and a lot is happening because nobody seems to care about the other. The individuality seems to be taking extreme consequences, and it just annoyed me the fact Jenny put the A/C strong without caring I didn’t have a coat, so I took it the wrong way and did something I shouldn’t.  
I have to apologize to her tomorrow, and I’m afraid I do it in some manner that looks fake or insincere. So, reddit, any advice on how to make a proper apology?

I didn’t disagree that we shouldn’t have a joint account I’m all for it but I just want to have something that’s my own. I think it’s super important in a relationship to have your own thing. You shouldn’t blend into eachother and intertwine in so many aspects.

"For a week or so we had been talking about going to see her parents. Her dad was coming back into town where they live, about 2.5 hours away. She was talking about going so we could pick him up so her mom didn't have too this Friday. Nothing was actually official though.

I was all good with this. I used my last holiday PTO. Rescheduled our dogs boarding scheduled so we wouldn't have to worry about him. I was all good with going. We hadn't seen them in a while and they could see the grandkids. We only would have been gone for a night. 

I asked my wife a couple of times throughout the week what was the plan for the weekend for her family. I was asking so I could reschedule the dog boarding. At one point he was scheduled to be there from Thursday through Tuesday. 

This morning she called me to tell me that her period had started. We had been trying for another baby. I listened to her and knew she was sad. I still wasn't sure if we were still going to her parents for the weekend and I asked her about boarding our dog and the plans for the weekend. She got mad at me and she eventually hung up on me. 

This evening we kinda got into a little spat and she said I was being insensitive to her, and that all I was thinking about was the dog. All I wanted to know was what the plan is for the weekend and I really didn't want to spend unnecessary money to board our dog. 

Also I mentioned about taking our youngest to daycare in the morning but she kinda snapped at me a little and said she isn't going anyway because we didn't have a Christmas gift for her teacher.

"I’m considering ending my relationship with my gf of a little over a year. To preface this we had pretty immediate chemistry and started out as FWBs for a couple months until she asked if I wanted to take it to the next level which I obliged. 

She is an honest trustworthy person, and we have great physical chemistry but I find I have to make many compromises due to the station she is at in life. Her dad was absent most of her childhood after her parents lost custody of her as a child because of their meth usage. While she had some contact with her mom as a teen she was primarily raised by her stern older grandfather, who is now ailing due to dementia. As a result she doesn’t have much familial support like I grew up with.  

Her car was repossessed a couple months ago when she was between jobs. That makes me the sole form of transportation in the relationship, and she lives 45 minutes away. On top of that she struggles to take care of her basic needs and keep food in her pantry. I’ve paid for everything in the relationship including many of her Ubers to and from work, and on occasion her groceries. 

Between all these factors it’s left her horribly depressed, and she cries most days. While she hasn’t explicitly said so she’s alluded to being suicidal. I believe her depression is preventing her from growth. I could suggest therapy all day but she lacks health insurance or the income necessary. 

She doesn’t have many friends left and I have become her sole emotional support which has become a big cause of stress, and often makes me feel hopeless. It doesn’t feel right to leave her in this state as I do care very much about her, however I feel like she relies on me for happiness. I believe if these factors that are largely out of her control weren’t in play I’d be much happier in the relationship. Lately I’ve considered ending things but I don’t want to be rash.

"**Tl;dr:** I fear my boyfriend’s drinking is getting out of hand again and don’t know how to express my concern and get him to commit to sobriety (or at least get him to drink less often).

So, we’ve been in a relationship for a bit over than 1.5 years and it’s been quite blissful, I’ve never felt as loved as he makes me feel. However, things get tricky when he drinks.

I’ve been diagnosed with autism and CPTSD, this makes confrontation and dealing with people mad at me very difficult to navigate, so I just avoid it as part of my flight response. In my family there’s history of alcoholism, my grandpa and both of my uncles were alcoholics (one of them has been sober for more than 30 years). I’ve had problems with drinking that has led me to a lot of trouble, when I was younger I was the kind of drinker that didn’t drink often but when I did I wouldn’t stop until I’ve passed out or made a huge mess and put myself in danger. Nowadays I’ve curbed this habit and rarely drink.

My boyfriend however has a longer history with alcohol and substance abuse, including an overdose. He told me he hasn’t touched coke for more than a decade but alcohol is another whole story. During the pandemic, he lost all his money and was stuck at home in a terrible relationship with his ex which led him to drink at least a bottle of wine a day with benzos and hide this habit. When we started dating (we don’t live together), he told me he had stopped drinking and we were indeed having a nice time. Sometimes I’d notice a distinct smell or hear slurred speech but never made anything of it as I didn’t want to start any fights. Until the day I found bottles in his drawers while I was folding and putting away his clothes. He told me these were old bottles but later, when he started a fight over something small, he admitted things were bad again (his ex was threatening to take all the money he had left besides what he had already given her) and he resumed daily drinking. I was super upset but stood by his side as he returned to AA.

Every time he drinks he gets passive aggressive and the littlest issue can set him off. Frequently he picks fights with me when he’s drunk and I just try to flee the scene because I know nothing good will come out of such situation. Last sunday was one of these days but as we were both drunk it turned into a full blown fight. Yesterday (wed), as I was cleaning his kitchen cupboards I found half a bottle of wine that he haf drunk the day before (tue). Today (thu), as he was out during the afternoon, he had a couple of beers and smoked some weed with his friends. As he recently moved to a new place near his friends I vented my concerns over the shift in the dynamics, considering he’s often been at his friends’ to smoke (and maybe drink). On sunday he told me he was never going to drink with me again but alone and with friends seem to be an exception. 

There are two main issues: his drinking impacts our relationship because every time I hear him speaking weird I get uneasy and fear he’ll get mad at me. Second, he’s a big guy and quite sedentary and alcohol is definitely not good, specially for someone like him. It’d shatter me to see his health take a serious toll over something so unnecessary like alcohol.

The things is: is it that bad? We’ve had just a couple incidents between us when he drinks but enough to make me walk on eggshells. How do I carry this talk with him and show him my support in helping him achieve a healthier life in sobriety?

"28 (F) daughter setting boundaries with mentally ill mother 56(F)


Hello, 

This situation is very complicated. My mother 56(F)is an energy worker, and I want to first share that she will not seek help from a therapist, take medication, or do any sort of treatment. I am 28(F).

So please don’t comment with suggestions for any of the above because it’s simply won’t help. 

There’s been an ongoing feud between us for the past 10 years. She blames me for XYZ, the details aren’t important.  She’s endured abuse from family members and carries a lot of pain and victimization/abandonment. The memories of this abuse started to resurface when I was around 15 and it was extremely challenging, because we lived in a caravan without electricity, and I had to care for her as she became more and more depressed. 

When I turned 18 I moved to the United States and started college. This was 10 years ago.. she believes I abandoned her and that she sacrificed everything for me and I’m not grateful for it. Over the past 10 years, I haven’t been able to apologize in a way that’s good enough for her….. and her anger, pain and resentment grows. She just wants to be around me and feel loved by me, but whenever we’re together, she won’t stop reminding me of how much I heard her and it’s really hard to be around. All we do is fight and fight and fight. She latches on harder and I push away more.


We are now trying to work on our relationship through setting timers for talking. She can talk for five minutes and I can talk for five minutes….. 

We have tried it only a few times and she already has spoken over her five minutes and then when I try and interrupt and tell her that it’s not OK that she has crossed a boundary she starts yelling at me and telling me that I am being controlling. This is not new. She thinks I am always controlling the situation to exclude her from my life (her abandonment wound).

Basically anything that I say, or do she twists and manipulates into me being controlling, may not seeing her for what she saying, and me being abusive towards her….. 

Over the past 10 years, she has blown up and become a monster. During her anger outburst, she doesn’t remember what she says. She said some of the most hurtful things that I don’t even need to repeat. To her own daughter. When I try and bring these things up and share how much they have hurt me she takes control of the conversation and tells me how it’s nothing compared to the pain she has endured. 

I can’t move forward until she can acknowledge and apologized to me for the hurtful things she said, and all the guilt and shame she’s put on me. I am acknowledging my mistakes and apologizing over and over but she simply won’t let this ongoing feud be resolved. 

I’m asking for advice on how to set boundaries. Knowing the circumstances, can somebody please advise me step-by-step, what to do. I’m not so good at setting boundaries… because she is so manipulative and easily blows up I need to carefully set them. 

For example, if she breaks the time boundary and I hang up the phone, or tell her I’m going to hang up the phone, she will respond with “ oh classic you’re just gonna leave me here all by myself just like you did 10 years ago…. Etc.” it’s so hard to set boundaries because I feel so guilty.  How can I start setting them?

(Long as* post lol) Hi, I know that title sounds bad but I need advice and also sorry if I can’t be clear at times but  English is not my first language , so I (21 M) have a 2 year long relationship with my gf Amelie (19 F), 2 years ago started to develop feelings for my university professor (41 F) let’s call her Elena for the sake of the story, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, she looks so young but at the same time she has this mature haze in her eyes and the way she talks and walks, she is just different from anyone I’ve ever encountered in my life, the first time I saw her in Uni when I was in my 2nd semester of Anthropology I was 19 , she is best friends with my intro physical anthropology teacher at the time ( teacher Carla) , they were chit chatting while working and drinking coffee, I came in to the room to ask teacher Carla to help me out with a investigation and essay, mind to tell you me and teacher Carla became friends , she at that time, offered me to help her out with investigations done by her or some colleagues of hers and I was extremely grateful, she said I’d be and incredible anthropologist and saw me as a son since she lost hers when he was 17 years old due to a car crash. Back to that encounter teacher Carla greeted me and so did the most prefect face I’ve ever seen in my life Elena, oh god I immediately lost my breath when she shook my hand and went back to sip her coffee and typing on her laptop, I saw her beautiful brown eyes so deep and so glowy, her perfect cherry brown hair in a messy pony tail, it fits perfectly with her round glasses and her make up with cherry red lips, she has a small nostril piercing, a labret piercing on her lips it was like a ring around the center of her bottom lip that almost made me faint, she has some ear piercings but they just looked so good on her , I felt like I couldn’t speak properly, I baffled some words to teacher Carla while looking directly at her direction while she was working not realizing about my existence. When I came back to my apartment I got out of that  shock and started blushing like when I was 13 and gave my first kiss, I first thought she was a student of teacher Carla because she looks so so young.

I decided to get to know her or maybe ask her out? I just wanted to be able to talk to her, so days passed by and I couldn’t find her around campus at all, my friend Anthony (18 at that time) realized my lack of energy so he asked me “what is wrong with you?” I just said that nothing happened, he invited me to a party but I just wasn’t interested he definitely noticed something was off since I’ve always been a party animal, he pushed me to tell him what was wrong if I argued with Amelie, and to be honest I totalIy forgot about her existence and ghosted her for days but no it wasn’t the case so I told him about Elena and the huge crush i developed, he knows everyone in uni so he said he’d help me out to find her, 3 days passed and he came to my apartment with “bad and good news” I wanted him to tell me the good one first and he told me that he knows perfectly who Elena is, I almost died with excitement and then he dropped the bomb she was a physicist and his physics professor at uni, she teaches Linear Algebra, Optics and Waves, Quantum Mechanics and Solid State Physics, he also mentioned she was 39 at that time, I just looked at him dead in the eye and said “how can I solicit a undergraduate change from anthropology to physics” he just bursted out laughing and thought I wasn’t serious but looking at my face he figured I was completely serious, and yeah I hate maths and physics I almost failed my sophomore year in high school due to calculus but I couldn’t care less, literally the next day me and Anthony went to the uni secretary and asked for my undergraduate change, she and Anthony had a fling so she helped me out to get in physics the next semester which was in like 4 months, ofc teacher Carla was crushed and confused  cause I was one of her best students but she understood my “sudden change of heart”, so she wished me  luck. Amelie gave me her support and said she she’d be excited to be in the same uni as me in the next semester but honestly I couldn’t care less like we went out on dates and etc but I always thought about Elena EVERY TIME.

So the day of my first class with Elena came I was so excited to see her I got my best clothes out of my closet, got a haircut, got an expensive ass perfume and prepared everything to be perfect to introduce myself to her, oh god that Wednesday at 11 am i just remember everything I saw her coming in with knee length high heeled leather boots, black nylon tights, a black dress with sleeves and a turtle neck idk how to say it in English lol that hugged her body combined with a belt, a trench coat and a flawless makeup, she had her hair down and her glasses just looked perfect in place I wrote on a notebook every single detail about her face and clothes, she presented herlself as Dr. Elena Acosta (fake names lol) she introduced us to linear algebra  and offered to help us out in any doubt we had, she acted and looked like an angel, I did not understand shit about the class it was so confusing for me but I tried my best, I always ended up just staring at her, it’s been two long years and I’ve just have fallen in love with her, with her multiple tattoos, intelligence, gorgeousness, attitude, she is a jojos fan, she loves animals, she is a history nerd and so on  I’ve stalked the shit out of her likes and dislikes from online forums, because her username is always the same lol.

I suck at physics but Anthony has been helping me out and doing my homework for 15 bucks each but overall he’s been a good friend, Amelie is studying international business (I’m not sure lol) I’m not so close to her I think but she is regularly planning dates for us and l just show up with flowers sometimes so she doesn’t bother me asking for them, giving her presents or just saying yes on what she wants just so she doesn’t bother me, she is nice and pretty I guess.

My main concern is that I can’t establish a relationship farther from student - teacher with Elena I just can’t I guess, she is polite and kind to me when I ask her a question or when I ask her about a project but the moment I start any small talk she cuts me off or gives short answers, god I wish I could ask her out or get her number, I looked for her in social media but she has a private profile and I think she just accepts people she knows, I recently found out that she is from South America, Ecuador to be precise even tho she is an immigrant and I had an apprehension against ilegal immigrants I don’t care anymore if she is one I love that about her, I’m taking Spanish classes to be able to talk to her when we get in a relationship and googling about Ecuadorian culture, I’ve heard her speaking Spanish GOD SHE SOUNDS SO HOT, I just need her, I want her to be the mother of my children and to be my wife, to love me at least, I’m just so in love with her. I’ll take some time but I won’t give up.

"Hi everyone! I know I'm going to come off as very vain but I really need advice,

I've been in a relationship with my bf for a little over 3 years. My bf is a very attractive man (conventionally tall, symmetrical face, muscular, etc.). We go out a lot and every time we go out he always gets a ton of attention. Everyone always compliments him and every time we're out with friends, it always seems like they drawn towards him. 

I absolutely love him, for more than than just his looks, but I'm struggling with feeling inferior. I often think, ""Would he be happier with someone in his league?"" or ""Am I enough for him?"". To add to my insecurities, he also had a crush on a friend of mine in the past, who was absolutely stunning and also got a lot of attention, so it makes me feel like I'm a second choice in a way.

I've talked with my bf about how I've felt and he has reassured me that he finds me beautiful and that I am enough but despite this I just think of things pragmatically and can't genuinely believe the things he's saying.

My main problem is my insecurities and I want to know if there's anyone else who has this experience, and if so, what you've done to help cope?

"My partner rarely initiates sex. When we do it, half the time he just wants me to suck his dick. He has admitted to having issues with porn in the past. He had naked pics of his ex from their relationship in his phone but claimed they were saved because she always asked why he didn’t save them on Snapchat. He doesn’t have a single naked photo of me saved. His instagram explore page is filled with chick with huge tits. I have modest boobs. He never calls me beautiful even when I get made up for a night out. I have to ask him to tell me I look beautiful. Today I walked out of the bathroom naked and he quickly looked away from me.

"After finishing High School this year, I didn’t know what I wanted to do. And instead of taking 1-3 years of like the rest of my class, I decided to just try out the business university as it is free where I live. I quickly realised it wasnt really for me. I kinda already knew that, as I have already found out that I have a huge passion for working on my own stuff (entrepreneur). Something I Can easily spend all my time doing. 

But I feel the preasure from my parents, as i still live with them, combined with them being having both taken the university route. Everytime it comes up They, especially my mom, mentions that I dont work hard enough, and I find it super hurtful because as I already tried to explain my passion isnt the university, But actually having my own business and spend a lot of time working with that.

I have quite an easy time going to School and Can get by doing minimum work, so my mom always complains about it. And today she just texted me that I dont study hard enough, and then “I just Think it’s a shame that you dont Seem to care about your future”. 

But I do. If I didnt I would just continue on with studying hard at the university, But I dont want that to be my future. 

I’m currently waiting to move out together with my gf some time near may next year. And will get $1k a month for studying by the State. So right now I feel like just getting away now. Move to a different city where rent is cheap and Cut ties with my parents, as I dont see their version of me and my own version both surviving.

"First of all, I am generally TA so don’t say I’m an ahole for things that I already acknowledge, I’m just looking for advice

Anyways, I’ve been friends with this guy for about 6-7 years now. We met through another mutual friend, and we got to know each other and even went to my (junior) prom together (we were both 17 by this point). After prom, we ended up seeing each other, meeting at the park pretty often and getting to know each other more romantically and occasionally making out.

As soon as school started, he ghosted me throughout nearly the whole year. Even though I was understanding of him being busy, I still felt and feel offended that he didn’t even take the time to say “hi” even once.

Come Senior ball, he asked me to his senior ball out of nowhere. I still liked him, so I went, but then learned later that he actually asked another one of his friends who said he’d go with him if I said no.

I tend to hold a grudge, and I’ve been holding this grudge about him ghosting me since forever. A lot of my (male) friends have said that it’s petty to hold a grudge for this long (and I’ll still hold it)

The main concern is that I don’t trust him, and while it’s been a long time and we’ve both changed as people, that’s all I know about him in terms of relationships, and his longest relationship thus far is 3 months, which also doesn’t give me much hope for relationships.

As we hang out, I find myself happy with him and I do like him and he likes me, but I can’t find myself willing to trust him or put myself in a relationship with him. I also don’t want to lead him on, but he chooses to keep pining after me for the last few months.

"I have posted on here before from a different account but providing an update giving background info again as deleted the original post.

My husband and I have been together for almost 20 years, we were each others first. He was my first ever relationship but he had a few girlfriends before me. When we first got together, I thought things were perfect and thought he was perfect. A few years into our relationship and he had a friend visit, they ended up sharing a bed together but nothing beyond cuddling happened (a lot of people previously commented saying he had definitely done more but I know that this was all that happened and I am certain). The cuddling set off a cascade of feelings within him and he ended up confessing to me that he had feelings for this other woman and he considered leaving me to pursue a relationship with her. 

A few years after that, a very similar incident took place. He shared a bed with another woman, lines could have been further crossed but nothing beyond cuddling took place. 

Fast forward 10 years, we got married and began our family. About 5 years ago when our firstborn was almost two and I was pregnant with my second child, we had a friend who moved nearby. Let's call her A. A began making frequent visit to ours and developed a close bond with our firstborn. When our second child was born, A was a great help. The extra pair of hands was just what we needed. She became part of our family. A and my husband got along really well, they had similar work backgrounds and shared many similar interests. I wasn't worried about this friendship, I trusted my husband.

I did notice my husband was very fond of A but we all were, the kids loved her and I cared for her a lot also. He however at times would make these big gestures for her, for instance he learnt how to play her favourite song on piano for her, he commissioned a friend to make some art for her new place. I always put it down to him caring for her in the same way we all did. I later learn that in this timeframe of 4 years he has falling in love with her

Fast forward 4 years and my husband confesses to me he had a year long affair with A and explains he has had 5 months worth of counselling that helped him come to the decision to leave our home to pursue a relationship with her. I refuse and essentially weaponise the kids against him and explain if he left there'd be no decent coparenting relationship and our counsellor sides with me and says that the reality is, decent coparenting wouldn't exist if he left. He then decides to stay and he is committed now to working on our marriage even when kids were the motivator for staying. He seems truly at peace with his decision to now stay-this part does surprise me since he had to be coaxed into staying, if anybody can explain the psychology of it, that might help me. He is committed to making our marriage work, he attends marriage counselling and has been on NC with A. 

Recently A got in touch with him to let him know she is pregnant and she intends to end it. He tells me he wants to be there for her through it as he feels responsible but also admits he doesn't trust himself around her. This might sound crazy but I trust him and have agreed for him to be there for her. 

Despite all this drama, he does seem at ease and and more importantly at peace with his decision. He has commented that the marriage counselling giving us open communication has be profoundly helpful.  I however can't help but think and wonder why that is since i had to convince him to stay. His decision to stay was 7 weeks ago, will he suddenly wake up and change his mind? I know nobody on here is a fortune teller but is this a honeymoon period we're currently experiencing. It almost feels too good to be true

EDIT: for everyone bringing up the “weapoising kids” tactic. I am fully aware I did that but him being at peace is what is confusing me currently. He seems genuinely at peace

"Have never posted on Reddit so sorry if this is hard to follow. Sorry, this is so long. Might have to leave some details out for anonymity.  
  
My boyfriend and I are about to reach 4 years in our relationship together. We started dating when I was in my first year of uni, he was ending his senior year in high school. When we first started dating, one of the things that attracted me to him was his ambition and dedication to his passions. He also is extremely kind and caring and helps balance out my anxious tendencies with his go-with-the-flow attitude. He had a plan to go to uni for a software degree in the coming fall and did go. But quickly into his first year, he began to struggle with handling the responsibilities of keeping up with his studies, began failing his courses, and dreaded continuing the degree. I tried to help him with studying suggestions and advice, I know how hard it can be. Despite this around 1.5 years into the relationship, and after two failed semesters, he decided he wanted to drop out to pursue his own freelance software business with his friend. I was very hesitant about this, but I wanted to be there for him and support him through his journey. I believed in him and thought maybe this path was better suited for him. I saw how ambitious and driven he was about his passions when we first met, and thought school isn't for everyone so, I'll try my best to be there for him. We had a serious talk about this and I told him that if he was going to make this decision he had to put his all into this and not half-ass it because then he really would have no backup.  
  
It's been almost 3 years since that point, and it's not been going well, to say the least. He quickly fell back into the habits that led him to drop school in the first place. Projects that should take weeks, turned into months, and one even turned into years. Which meant the money he expected to make was paid out more and more infrequently. He and his partner have no clear organization and structure, and when he had to work on projects he didn't like, he would procrastinate with video games and excessive doom scrolling. I tried to be understanding and help but noticed when I would try to give suggestions on how to fix things he would make it seem like I was exaggerating the situation. It's not just with his work, but with anything he needs to get done it's like he's his own worst enemy, and takes him 2028023840482x times longer to get shit done. He mentioned maybe getting a diagnosis and medication for ADHD, he has suspected this is what has him in these negative cycles. He talks often about having to make a change or having to get his shit together, but never follows through with it or doesn't let anyone help him. Very recently, his dad offered him a job in his company if he got a business degree. I felt some relief, okay maybe now he will have a backup and more secure income, but again he is taking so long to take the steps necessary, like applying to a college or creating some kind of a plan. Also, it's a very recurring theme that when he has something going on in his life, like a conflict, he can't get anything else done until that thing is finished. But that way, he will never get anything done because life will constantly throw conflicts your way. I feel like he never had to ""grow up"" and do the things that needed to get done even if he didn't like it.   
  
Things then really took a turn for the worse. Recently, maybe the past 6 months or so, we've been struggling seriously with intimacy. Not just sex, but basic intimacy too. We've tried to figure out why this may be the case, I thought for the most part it was my repressed sexual trauma I hadn't worked through properly, maybe low libido from my constant anxiety in my high-stress uni program, and not being able to get out of my head. We tried a lot of things, but for him, his love language is physical touch and he is on the clingier side than I am, emotionally. I think he reached a breaking point recently with those needs not being met, even as understanding as he tried to be about my struggles. He expressed that lately, it seemed like he was always having to put aside his needs to help me through my anxiety and problems, and his emotional and physical needs were being neglected. I feel horrible about how I've been making him feel but I had no idea myself why things were this way.  
  
I've been trying really hard to do some self-reflection and to understand why I've been withdrawing romantically and emotionally from the relationship. I think I've been suppressing a root issue, and it's that I think, and I feel so awful about this, that I'm becoming less attracted to him, mentally. I think part of it is that I'm losing respect for him as a person. Physically I still think he's very attractive and there are no problems there. But I think for me over the years the more he began to show a lack of direction, purpose, self-control, and drive, the less I felt the ""spark"" or sexual/romantic desire. And the closer my graduation date approaches, the more doubts I get about my next stage in life with him. How am I supposed to be more serious, get married, have kids, etc with someone who has no direction or plan? I don't think it's enough for me anymore that he is a good person and loves me. I realized I also needed stability, I tried to suppress this feeling initially because I didn't want to seem like a ""gold digger"" and I'm not very traditional, I'm willing and want to work too. I'm worried I will never find it with him. When I try asking him what he wants to do, he says he is content with working a minimum-wage job if necessary to get by and has no desire or ambition for something greater. This is causing me a great deal of stress and the doubts have begun growing in my mind exponentially.  
  
I know I need to talk to him about this but I don't know how I would. How do I tell someone all of this without sounding like a condescending asshole? I also don't know when the right time to talk about this would be. We have Christmas plans and a vacation coming up together, and then soon I'll be back to my final semester of studies and I'll have school to distract me from my doubts again, leaving this feeling to grow into resentment. I really don't want to end things but I'm at the end of my rope, and admittedly I should not have let this get to this point and addressed it sooner, but I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt out of love.

"I’ve been struggling for a long time with not wanting to have sex with my partner and i recently feel like i’ve lost almost all sexual attraction. It’s only gotten worse over the last year/two years. He betrayed my trust and made my self esteem non existent for the first year of our relationship. 

He is very sorry now and has changed completely but I’m still hurt and find it hard to move on. I find myself only getting “in the mood” when I’m half asleep because I’m not conscious enough for anxious thoughts. I really want to move on but every time I try to imagine something sexual with him I only think about how he hurt me, fantasized about others, ruined my self esteem and made me feel uncomfortable in bed. I felt used and not enough or pretty. I still long for sexual intimacy but not with him. I just want to see him for how he is now but i feel scarred by the past.
