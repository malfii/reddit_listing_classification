"I live in a nice suburb and quiet and secluded neighborhood, near a northeastern city in the U.S. 

My next door neighbor constructs a front yard ice rink every year which takes up most of the yard and uses a loud commercial unit to cool the ice. This whole thing is up for 6 months and the freezing unit runs constantly. It’s incredibly loud and annoying, and the sound is inescapable, not to mention that hockey can be a loud game. 

This started about ten years ago as a tarp with water, with freezing solely dependent on the weather. A few years in, the neighbor increased the size of the rink, added lights, nets, and the freezing system. 

They never had a permit, and at the time when this was first built, initial oppositions were met by inaction from the local government. Recently, new people have joined the board and stated that now the neighbor requires a permit each year for this whole rink display. They’ve received permits for the past 2 years, but none prior. 

The neighbor appealed, and ultimately asked for a ruling by estoppel (essentially being allowed to continue to act because no one ever questioned it in the past).

"Hello everyone. 
So I’m reaching out for any advice. 
My husband was shopping at Walmart and had the cart full of groceries. He had picked up a little scooter for our toddler daughter, that he accidentally forgot to scan while on the checkout.
 He said the store was completely full, the check out Cashiers, only had a few lanes open, so the self check out was the one that was less busy.he was trying to rush to get home to me and our child.  He paid for over $160 of groceries and since the bags were covering the bottom of the cart and he was rushing he forgot to pay for the scooter, it was $38. 
as soon as he was walking out of the store, three CHP officers pulled up and arrested him and put him in the car with handcuffs. he didn’t know what was going on. He was asking them why, and then he remembered oh my God, I forgot to scan the scooter. They checked his receipt and confirmed that he did, in fact forgot to pay for the scooter. 
The officer told him that he had two options, that he needed to sign the citation for petty theft, or go to jail. My husband didn’t want to sign it because he kept saying it was an honest mistake, and he would walk inside and pay for it, but they told him that they were not gonna let him go and that he needed to sign the citation or go to jail. They told him with all the shoplifting that is going on in California. They can’t let it go. 
So he signed it and came home really shaken up and flustered. The officer kept telling him that it’s only gonna be an infraction, since it was not something he meant to do, and that he can fight in court. But I just looked at the ticket, and it’s circled as a misdemeanor. We are both really distraught by this and are afraid of what is going to possibly happen Over an honest mistake.
 
Does anybody know if this is something that he can possibly get dismissed? He has never shoplifted before, it’s not something he does, or has ever cared to do. He is a very honest man. We are really confused and upset by all of this. Any legal advice would help.

"I have a friend in Florida that is going through the following:

Context: Friend (the employee) works remotely. She tells the company how long the job took her and she gets paid based on this. Company has access to when and what time she logged in, logged out. Etc.. she’s not supposed to work on projects if she’s logged out of the system. 

Situation: Friend worked on the project 2.5 hours, she then goes to the company and tells them that it took her 3.0hrs to complete. Company figures out that there is a pattern on the way she’s charging the company and realizes that she’s basically stealing from them based on the log in and log out times. Company tells her to come in and gives her the option to either get fired or resign. She tells them that she’s going to talk to the Union first. While this is happening, company realizes that other employees are doing the same thing (around 10 other employees) but company doesn’t call them in to fire them or make them resign. The Union at this point gets involved and tells the company other ways to deal with her instead of firing her i.e demoting her/ suspension/ paying the money back/ etc.. Company comes back and tells them that they’re going to discuss it further and come back with an answer tomorrow.

The question is: If she gets fired for this, but the other employees that were also clearly stealing the same way don’t get fired, can this be considered wrongful termination? Would the company be required to fire all the other 10 employees for the same offense? 

 Technically Company also doesn’t have proof that she wasn’t working on these projects “off the clock” and therefore charging for the work that she did while logged out.

"Hello All,

I signed up for a slick marketing service a couple years ago. The company promised they could manage an Amazon store for you, fully hands off. They would find products, source them and list them. We would split the profits. Sounded great. 

It became very clear they simply hired overseas workers for very cheap and employed borderline strategies that ended up getting my account deactivated two separate times due to violating the terms of service.  

According to the contract that both parties signed, if their mismanagement caused my business damages, then they would be held liable up to $15k. 

The business is in Florida, I’m traveling overseas for three months. I’ve never hired a lawyer for a fraud or breach of contract claim for my small business before. Is it worth it to sue them? Should I push for third party arbitration? I can’t be physically present for any mediation either way. 

How much is worth it - I don’t want to wind up paying $5k to get $15k…or risk getting nothing at all???

"Last week I was driving home for an early Christmas when an 83 year old woman made a u-turn from a southbound freeway to my northbound freeway. In an attempt to get into a right-hand turn lane, this lady cut across three lanes of interstate traffic without signal, casing me (on the right-hand side of the north bound interstate) to avoid her. This resulted in my car hitting the gravel shoulder at high speed, spinning out, and colliding with an interstate sign. While no collision between actual vehicles occured, my car was totalled while she was let off as a ""witness"" to the accident by a state trooper who arrived on the scene shortly after the accident.

 On top of this, the trooper allowed this elderly woman to leave the scene of the accident and come back to fill our her version of events because she was in a hurry to drop off mail before the post office closed. When asked if the elderly lady was going to be ticketed or found at fault in any way, the trooper said no because he had not been there to physically see my accident occur. 

I am now left with a totaled car and a potentially large increase in insurance because this trooper didn't want to point fingers without having been physically present for this old lady's potentially deadly error. On top of being an older individual, this lady also was clearly in a hurry to drop off her postage AND had a loose dog in her front seat, which I feel is cause enough to warrant at least some evidence of wrongdoing or distraction on her part. Despite this, due to her label as a ""witness"" to the accident she caused, I am left with the bill and no car. 

I am just wondering if there is any possibility of proving her fault in court. I am already a broke new grad and probably wouldn't be able to afford a trial anyway, but the way the trooper conducted the accident report seems entirely biased to me, especially considering what I imagine to be clear prsense of distraction on her part. This type of money is enough to set me back years financially. 

TLDR; an elderly lady ran me off the road and the state trooper investing the scene listed her as a witness, leaving me solely responsible for my totaled car.",Car accident with no proof?,18nfck0,1703136338.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nfck0/car_accident_with_no_proof/,

For starters this isn't about me, the probation officer is coming to check the house for my cousin to see if he could live here with us.

 Its a pretty full house, 4 of us and my parents. There are no free bedrooms, and I don't really understand what would be done about his living situation.

I have my own room, and my 3 brothers share a room next to mine. I don't really know all the specifics of his charges, but my mom is his only family left. I tried asking what my mom would plan to do and she got very defensive, so I'm not sure what the plan is right now.

"Can forgery of e-signatures be proven with IPs?

So, I have 2 roommates. Let’s call them A and B.

We all share an apartment (in MA) and pay by room. A company manages the property and sent us a second lease after we moved in. it had a few differences and some extra charges that we had questions about. 

Neither A nor B signed the second lease, but somehow their signatures ended up on it and they freaked out. We were already living in the apartment with a lease we all signed so we just wanted some clarification from our landlord/property corp. about this second one.

It was never resolved and our questions were ignored, stating we have to pay because we signed the second lease.

We signed on DocuSign so it comes with a signature summary, a log of each signature with date, time, email… and an IP address.

This is when i realized A’s IP matched the IPs of 2 employees at the property corp. I lost it after checking the location, which matched the company’s work building. 

Then I checked B’s IP on both the first and second lease and saw they matched. I thought this was odd since B lived in the apartment during the time the second lease was signed. B swears they didn’t sign, so i look up the IP and it matches the address of their previous location before moving into our apartment, confirmed by B.

B thinks they copied the signature information from the first lease and pasted onto the second one. At this point i’m both freaked out that the landlord would do this and baffled that they would be so brazen. 

I’m honestly unsure how they would go about forging anything on DocuSign.

"For some basic context: our previous landlord is in North Carolina and goes through a realtor. We paid a security deposit of $1,250. Never got the information of where the deposit was kept. I contacted them five days ago about the deposit since we haven’t heard anything from them. Nothing about the move assessment or possible damages. We did get an email saying they’re waiting on the invoices but nothing specific or itemized. Today, I get an email saying that we owe $340 after the deposit and that we have to pay it through their online portal. 

We left the place relatively clean. We were charged $350 for a cleaning fee. They even charged us for the moving the chairs that the place came with for $75. We were charged with replacing the air filters when we had replaced them not even a month prior. We were charged with repairs to the carpet after someone came and cleaned the carpet after we moved out. All of the invoices have the dates that everything was done 3 days after we moved out with the exception of the carpet repair being done 27 days after we moved out. I don’t understand why we didn’t receive a notice within 30 days and I’m not sure how to go about this. We were told that the move out assessment was completed 10 days after we moved out. 

What would be the best course of action? My husband took a video of how we left the place. We are no longer staying in North Carolina though. Is it better to wait and dispute it in collections or should I try contacting them before the 30 days they gave us to pay it? Or should we just pay it?

"A lot of questions with this and I’m being advised by 3 different friends to sue my old company (Pepsi) over wrongful termination. 

I was a merchandiser, I stocked shelves at different grocery stores. One store I stocked at 12/15/23 around 7AM. I wasn’t planning to take photo’s, but they put wine next to Gatorade and I needed to snap a photo toward when I was done with the isle to show a co worker how insane that was. 

Around 9AM the following day my manager tells me he needs to speak with me 12/18/23 after my shift. I ask him what for, no answer. It’s been sited due to my autism and medication, I need to be made aware of situations otherwise it would trigger non stop panic/anxiety attacks which he already knew. For 4 days I was in torture, trying to figure out why I was being called in. 

The day of I go in and he looks at me, smiles, then goes to talk to another co-worker for 20min past when our meeting was all while giving me the side eye. He then comes in, I ask him if I was in trouble, and he proceeds to laugh in my face and says I need to wait a little more time. Finally he comes into the meeting room and informs me I’m being fired for not stocking the shelves. 

According to him, in a span of 9 hours, it was impossible for certain popular drinks to sell as fast as they would of and showed me photo’s of how empty the shelves were claiming I didn’t do them at all prior. I showed the photo’s I took of the wine display with the fully stocked Gatorade in the background from two different angles, claiming this is false termination as I did. He said he knows more than me and I’m mistaken, took my ID, and later HR told me there’s no evidence despite my photo’s.

"Today a sheriff and a local police officer (in Utah) showed up to our house and confronted my husband with a blurry still image from a video that they said came from a local grocery store. They didn't show him the video, just the still image, but the officers did say that they had seen the video. They asked my husband if that was him and he said that it looked like him but he didn't think it was him and he didn't say anything else. They took his information and said that he was being accused by the grocery store of shoplifting and someone who my husband used to work with (who now works at the grocery store) had identified my husband. The officers didn't arrest him, they just spoke with him and looked at his driver's license.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest is theoretically speaking, of course: THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, IF my husband admitted to me that, during a period this year when I was very ill and bedridden (preventing me from working) and his salary alone wasn't providing enough for us, he had, in fact, panicked and shoplifted from a store because he couldn't afford food for our cats and dogs (a situation we have never been faced with before, but my illness, coupled with our business being all but destroyed during Covid put us in a really bad financial situation)... What THEORETICALLY would be the best course of action? He's only ever had one legal infraction on his record, for something like ""destruction of property"" or vandalism, when he and his friend broke a store window when they were 20 years old (he just turned 50 years old).

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTIONS:**

**1)** The officer said that it's a Class B Misdemeanor. I looked it up online and from what I saw, the punishment is 6 months in jail and a $1000 fine. My husband is a gentle, kind man who THEORETICALLY got scared and made a really poor choice that I'd be REALLY shocked about if it wasn't theoretical, because it's so far out of character for him. So how likely is it that he'll be sent to jail?

**2)** So if this THEORETICAL situation had actually happened, would it be best for him to throw himself on the mercy of the court and plead guilty? Or what would be the best thing to do? I imagine that having a video, even if it's blurry, would make it an open &amp; shut case?I'm completely heartbroken that my husband, who works so hard for our family could have THEORETICALLY felt so desperate. :(",Husband Accused of Shoplifting,18ne298,1703132018.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18ne298/husband_accused_of_shoplifting/,

His former band teacher (for 4 years in a row) asked him if he ""wanted to come over for a party"", then, ""a party for just you and I"". Then goes ""I keep forgetting you are only 15, thats not ok.....unless you think its ok?""

Some backstory:

My son is a musician and has always looked up to this teacher. I have been on band trips and Marching Band competitions and I was fond of this teacher, too. When this teacher accepted a job at a different high-school in the county, I knew that my son had messaged him on social media. He really looked up to this teacher and I felt like he was a great influence and example of how one can use their love of music as a career. My son has always been open and I have seen the messages in the past, because of course my son is a child and this was an adult, so I kept my eye on it for that simple fact, even though I trusted and loved this teacher, you just never know. And I'm glad we were paying attention. 

So, I spoke to the police officer on the phone (they were already there when my son called me) and she explained that a crime has not been committed, but they were going to involve a detective. I got a case number and asked a few more questions. My son is a bit grossed out, but fine. My heart is broken for him being treated that way, but Im so thankful it wasn't worse. 

What can I do as his mother? I was tempted to message the teacher. I found his Facebook and stared at it forever. I just see this long list of schools and accomplishments and I wonder if there are other students who's trust he has broken. I looked at every county he's worked in and looked for his name on all of the sex offender registries. I started to look for his address, and decided to post here before I do something stupid. What, within the boundaries of the law, can I do to make sure this person isn't trusted? I know they said legally no crime was committed, but since he's a high school teacher, doesn't that make this worse?

Almost 5 years ago, I was in involved in a car accident. I sustained back injuries. Long story short, I got a lawyer and was told to see doctors through their referral instead of my insurance. We went to trial and we lost the case. I was told the medical bills will be written off.

I went to a Physical Therapy place as part of my treatment. I presented my insurance card to them (and all the other doctors I saw) and they all said they'd process everything on a lien basis through my lawyer. I was never told the prices. I never got the bills until now. At the time, before treatments, I was told by my lawyer and the doctors that if we lose the case, I won't have to pay anything and that's why they said no to my insurance. Obviously, this was a mistake on my part. I didn't know any better. I should've insisted on using my insurance at the time.

Yesterday , I received a letter saying this is the final letter from the facility and if I don't pay 10k, they will refer me to a collections.

"I’m in CA and work in security.

The issues are pretty long so I won’t document them in too much detail here, but they do include an argument via phone call with my boss because I wasn’t somewhere that I was supposed to be according to his schedule, even though it wasn’t showing up on mine. There was nothing on my schedule. Anyway, this conversation took place 4 days after asking for the number to HR so that I could find out about sick time payments and a conversation about increasing my pay rate as other people with the same job are making more than me. 
Following that was an event where I was at work and I was outside and didn’t have access to my water, sweaters, and feminine hygiene products. The site policy is that officers can’t be near their cars because they don’t want them sitting in their car instead of patrolling. Nbd, I understand that. My issue was that I had to call the only mobile officer to pick me up if I needed to get anything (water, my lunch, feminine products, etc.). If the mobile officer was busy, I had to wait because I wasn’t allowed to leave my area and walk the mile back to my car. My calls wouldn’t be a priority if they suspected that someone was shoplifting/vandalizing/etc. Because of that, I didn’t receive my last break and I didn’t have access to feminine hygiene products, water, or extra layers (there was a freeze warning in effect). The following day, I insisted that I at least have my small bag with me so that I could have what I needed without having to call a mobile officer. Supervisor said I couldn’t carry the bag with me. Instead he would lock it up nearby - which defeats the purpose of me having the bag if I had to wait for him to unlock the area when I needed them. I ended up taking my car anyway because his solutions required me to not have access to what I needed unless the supervisor unlocked doors and gave me access providing that he’s not on a call. The following day, I was removed from the site. 
I tried calling my boss and his office, and received no answer for days. I have to call my boss to be scheduled and he wouldn’t take my calls or schedule me. I finally went to the office to see wth is going on, and they refused to give me answers. They didn’t even want to give me HR’s number or my boss’ boss’ number. This all took place from December 4 - 11th.

"The following took place in Oregon.

Hello, I’ll try to keep this short. In October of last year, my brother (34) was hospitalized in Southern Oregon for liver failure and was placed in the ER. The first few weeks were very intensive but was finally stabilized and his condition was improving until he had a cardiac event and developed an infection and shortly after transferring to another Hospital in Portland, he passed away in November 2022.

A few days ago a representative from the initial Hospital in southern Oregon called me and let know that there is currently a criminal investigation involving a nurse that was working there who had been caught stealing patients pain medication and replacing it with tap water. Upon review of patients under this nurses care, they believe that the infection my brother developed is directly linked to tap water and that my brother had fallen victim to this nurse’s disturbing behavior.

Again they assured me that this nurse has been reported and is no longer working in the medical field and that there is a criminal investigation underway.

The boss won’t even call the police when this man shows up, even though she does so when other violent patrons do. Jane is terrified for her safety and wants to quit, but she’s been taking a course that the library is paying for and if she quits any time in the next six months they’ll charge her for the course ($1000). 

So basically they’re charging her $1000 to quit even though she’s being threatened, repeatedly, by the same patron. Obviously this isn’t right, but is it legal? Is there any way she could quit without having to pay?

"Good evening everyone,

We are looking for some advise regarding an issue we came across with our fertility clinic. We began IVF back in January and everything went well. The issue is that yesterday I decided to google the fertility clinic and it stated it was permanently closed. We have embryos stored with the clinic and did not receive any notification from them advising they were closing. After some research we found out the clinic went out of business and was bought by the fertility dr. who was running it. Is there anything we can do legally?

"My wife is the leasing agent for the North Carolina apartment complex we live in. She works for a property management company based in New Jersey. I am the leasee. She is an occupant. I pay the rent. She was unemployed when we first moved there. My income is high enough to cover all rent and all rent is current and up to date. They hired her a year after we moved here and she has been employed there for about one year.

Last week they sent a memo saying:

* Hi, moving forward it will be mandatory for all employees who live on [company] property to set up a payroll deduction to pay their rent.

Please have all employees who live on our property fill out the attached form and send back to [email address]


The form says:

* I [blank] , employee at [this complex] authorize [The company] to deduct $[blank amount] from my bi weekly paycheck toward my rent in [our address and apartment number]

My wife isn't the leasee. I am and always have been. I feel that the company making changes to the payment arrangement of my lease would be them breaking the lease. My wife's salary isn't enough to qualify her as a lease holder here and never has been. 

Can her employer force her to deduct a portion of her salary from them, back to them like this? This isn't a matter of work uniforms or taxes which I believe is the only things a company can force deductions on. It feels like wage theft.

Also since there is no amount specified, either dollar amount or percentage, can we just put in $1 and otherwise tell them to pound sand? (This option pisses me off because there is a convenience fee to use the rent portal. Which means getting hit with the fee three times a month instead of just once when I pay the rent.)

I'll have her make them fire her and/or move us out before I let them force her into working for them while forcing her to pay them to do it.  Thanks.

"For the first 2 months of the first year lease, the landlord would accept my rent via Apple Pay or Zelle, while her setting up ACH transfer was “in progress.” First month I sent her rent via Apple Pay 5+ days before rent was due. She got very upset because she said that I agreed to set up the ACH. I said no, the lease explicitly says that you will be taking funds from my account via ACH and my account info is on the lease. I have no way to send funds to your account as I do not have your account info. On her end she received the Apple pay funds, but it said “pending,” so 5 days before rent is due she is telling me she will charge me a $500 late fee. She’s also saying that the ACH transfer is set up anyways. So I’m like okay send me the Apple Pay back then. She says no, I will wait to receive the ACH transfer, then send you the Apple Pay back. But also will charge you a late fee. She called her bank and apparently it takes a month+ for ACH to be set up. She is continuing to hassle me about Apple Pay, sending me 50+ messages in one day. I eventually tell her 1) it is illegal to force me to do auto pay and she has to give me the option of paying via cash or check (so again if she has some emotional issue with Apple Pay she can return it to me and accept cash or check, not charge me rent 2x), and 2) I have a right to quiet enjoyment or whatever and she cannot harass me like this. I end up sending her money via Zelle so she now has $8k+ from me, and she returns the Apple Pay. This makes no sense. She does this exact same thing again the second month. Calms down once ACH is set up.  

I spoke to 2 prior tenants and they both said that the landlord charged them rent via ACH for *months* after their lease expired and they moved out and it took *months* for them to get that money back. 

A year later I sign the lease again for another year, and I tell her I am not doing ACH anymore and I put a stop pay on her account so she cannot receive funds from me via ACH. I pay the first month via Zelle, days before rent is due. She does the same thing again asking that I pay rent again, and I’m like no, I’m not paying rent twice. Then she says that since she isn’t cancelling ACH, she is going to send me the rent money back every month, so I have to transfer her $8k+ and she will return the $4k+ after she receives both the Zelle and ACH. This is insane. Since I put a stop pay, the ACH did not go through, and I refused to pay rent again via a diff method. The Zelle says completed/received so this convo should be over. Days later I receive a wire transfer to my account in the amount of the rent money, and I receive countless emails stating that I did not pay December rent and I owe her money. 

I haven’t returned the wire transfer because I’m sick of this shit and I’m not doing this weird exchange of funds every month. I do not need this random $4k from the wire transfer and I’m not spending it, but I feel like delaying returning it will at least make her realize that I’m not going to do this weird game every month where she tries to charge me 2x. I don’t know why she can’t just remove my account info from her records and stop playing these games with me. You can’t say I didn’t pay rent after I received rent. You can’t “refund” rent. I make good money and pay rent early and keep the place clean, idk what else she wants. 

TL;dr - I pay rent on time, landlord asks me to pay rent 2x via 2 diff methods every month, then sends me “refund,” and tells me I did not pay rent on time, asks me to pay rent again. This time I only paid rent 1x but received her “refund” and I don’t plan on returning it.

"Hello,

I was robbed of 1100 after an individual illegally withdrew money from my bank account at a physical branch.

I filed a claim a few days after (because I wasn’t aware of this until later checking my funds), via their customer service line. 

I also visited my local branch the day after to see if there is anything else that needed to be done on my end. During that exchange with the teller, he confirmed to me that the signature present on the withdrawal form did not match my signature on my ID, nor the one I drew for him (I also have a screenshot and downloaded copy of this form as they scan it into their system, my signature doesn’t match). 

I was told this would be resolved between 10-12 business days. 13 days after I figured to check in with the branch (I don’t usually have time because I work all day, every day). I was told they closed the claim because they believed that the signatures matched. Not only that, but I wasn’t given a call or email notifying me about the claim being closed. 

I was told to file a police report in order for them to reopen the claim. So I did that. 

I am going to the bank tomorrow to get as much information as I can about their policies regarding withdrawals, claim notifications, and a copy of the claim information that they have. Also to drop off a copy of the police report.

Is there a case here at all or would my situation be better by contacting a lawyer at all? Or do I just continue on with the bank’s process of things? Or do I even really have any options at all?

My kids are very young and aren't even tall enough to see what's on top of the dresser, let alone get to it.

"Possible TW: SA of a minor

Throwaway account because I don’t want my husband to see this. I’ll try to summarize as much as I can so this doesn’t turn into a book.

About 10 years ago when I was 15 years old I was using a dating app mostly out of boredom. There was one guy who frequently messaged me and convinced me to meet up with him. I usually enjoyed talking to him, and we had talked for a while before actually meeting up. He was somewhere between the age of 29-31 at that time. When we did finally meet up he coerced/pressured me into doing a lot of disgusting things to/with him. For some reason even after this we continued talking. The only excuse I have is I was a lonely teen who didn’t get much attention elsewhere. Obviously I regret all of this now. 

He played a lot of mind games with me and convinced me he loved me and wanted to be with me. These meetups continued off and on for 2.5-3 years, every meetup was just as awful as the last. I don’t think I can post the things that happened, but they were things that I don’t even do now as an adult and sometimes he’d bring another person with him. But I was convinced he loved me or something. the last time we met up was when I was 18. Something around this time made it click for me how messed up this guy was and how awful this kind of “relationship” was. 

This has been eating at me for a while now, and all I can think of is what if he’s still doing these things with other young girls now? I can’t find ANYTHING about him online. No social media, no arrests, it’s like he never existed. I even tried downloading the dating app we had used to talk. Nothing. I know he had a Facebook when we talked. I should be able to find SOMETHING proving he existed, right? He had a very generic name, but I know it was his real name because I had him show my his ID at one point. I’m honestly starting to feel crazy. 

The thing is, if I just go to the police and say “hey, all this stuff happened 10 years ago when I was a minor, but all I have his name and approximate age.” They’re going to laugh in my face. I don’t have the same phone or phone number (I had to change my phone number to get him to stop contacting me) so it’s not like they can pull old messages. 
Is there anything I can legally do??

My husband knows about all of this, I’ve been bringing it up for a year or two now. He just says that I “blew my chance” to do anything about this guy and gets annoyed with me whenever I talk about it. I haven’t been able to sleep well in weeks because I’m searching everywhere trying to prove to myself that he does exist, or that he’s still in the area and that it makes sense to do something.

Two weeks ago I completed my month long credentialing process with my healthcare recruiter and was cleared to start my 6 month hospital contract.  I drove to the location where my contract was to begin, about 1000 miles from home. When I arrived I started my search for housing. I quickly realized I had underestimated the housing costs in the area. I communicated this to my recruiter by email requesting assistance, either by an increase in stipend or a hotel voucher (I’ve worked with this recruiter for 2 years now and  conversations with her are usually one sided so I prefer to write to her) 
She insisted we talk by phone, and I insisted she let me know by email if there was anything she could do for me. There was a power struggle. Then she sends a final email saying “we could assist with a hotel for two weeks until you can find something suitable, but this contract has already been canceled” ………wait, WHAT?! 
The recruiter follows up with an email containing her directors contact info,  and tells me to contact her if I had any questions. I contact the hospital administrator where I was contracted to work instead and ask her if she cancelled me. She responds “I have no interest in cancelling you” I’m thoroughly confused by now, if the hospital doesn’t want to cancel me, and I’m here ready to work and have not cancelled, who cancelled me? 
I call the recruiting agency director. During our conversation she states “I don’t know if you believe in a higher power or not, but maybe it’s a good thing this contract was cancelled. The hospital administrator is notoriously hard to work with, some of our most seasoned travelers have walked out within two weeks of working there” I was shocked! After I let that sink in for a day or two I realized that my recruiter had most likely cancelled me, and the director said what she did to save face. They started sending me job openings at other facilities promising to get me a new contract asap. And that’s basically where it all ended. This cancelled contract was for a 6 month term. I am out of work during a challenging time of the year to secure a new contract. I won’t work with this agency after this, I’m sure I will never try to negotiate for a higher stipend, but
my legal question is whether this was wrongful termination?  My recruiting agency insists that I cancelled the contract, which I did not. Our contracts are pretty straightforward, if the hospital cancels we are not reimbursed, but this case is different. I’m no lawyer and apparently not a negotiator either.

I believe that we qualify under this law. I reached out to my work about it back during open enrollment, and they said that ""eligible dependants include a legal spouse"" so would not include my partner. However, I found that statute today and I do think we should qualify.

My question is:
Would we indeed qualify under this law and would my work legally have to offer health insurance to her? Do we have to officially register as domestic partners to qualify, or would having a shared lease (as stated in the statute) be enough? And lastly, this might be a question for other places, but since we are outside of the open enrollment period, if this law _does_ apply to her is it too late to get her health insurance?

"I received a letter from my state’s environmental agency warning me of potential PFAS contamination in my drinking water. 

I live in a small town (less than 10k people). My drinking water is supplied via a well. 

The letter supplies details that a recent groundwater sampling has confirmed the presence of PFAS in my area. The “area” highlighted in the letter via a map is oddly specific. My initial thought is that everyone in the area would be pulling water, via wells, from the same ground water supply. 

Additionally, the letter seeks permission to perform a sampling of water from my well. 

My questions/concerns:
 - is it in my best interest to have my water tested?
 - what if it tests positive? There aren’t any manufacturing plants in the area. I’m mostly surrounded by farms. Will I have any legal ground to press charges?
 - should I allow them access to my home for testing? Nothing illegal going on in my home, but always cautious of allowing anyone in and should not do any of my own documentation?

"I recently moved and made a doctor's appointment with a physician for a routine checkup. I've lived here before (over 4 years ago) and have seen this doctor previously, but the appointment was treated as a new patient due to the time since last seen.

The doctor had an apprentice shadowing him in the room when he saw me. Appointment was smooth. I am on several common heart medications and we discussed having some standard lab work done so he can check different levels in my blood (dont have the technical specs but they are routine checks). This was expected and matches how my health care is always handled.

I informed him I am currently uninsured (self pay) and that I would like to get the minimum tests done which allow him to manage my health care, and that any preventative type testing should be postponed until after Jan 1 when my insurance kicks in. He made a comment that he is glad I mentioned that and he would note for just the minimum tests.

I leave, receive my discharge paperwork, and give blood later that day. When giving blood there is nothing to sign and no discussion about what tests will be performed.

A few weeks later I receive a bill from a lab testing company for 300 for measles testing. I look online and clearly see this is not a high priority test for my age and race. I review my discharge paperwork and the lab tests ordered are listed. I recognize all of them as the standard tests I am used to, definitely nothing about measles.

 I call the doctors office and have a long talk with the doctors nurse. I explained the situation and she was very receptive. She pulls the notes from my visit and confirms there is a specific note from the doctor saying only do the minimum tests. She concludes that whoever processed my paperwork (admin) missed the note and just processed it in a standard way which would typically include a range of tests for a new patient. I did not feel she was being deceptive and believe this is what happened. I don't think it was malevolent. I said I didn't ask for this test and shouldn't have to pay the bill. She said she would send a note to her supervisor to see what they could do. This was the week before Thanksgiving. I have not heard back. I did not get the nurses name (although I believe each doctor has specific nurses and I can likely find out her name).

Last week I called the office again but (without really thinking) selected the option for billing instead of the doctors nurse. I get on the phone with the billing department. Again, I get a reasonable agent who hears me out. She could not see the doctors notes. She put on hold to talk with her supervisor. When she came back she told me she is putting in a ticket for this and that I should hear back in 30-45 days. She specifically asked, ""you're sure that is in the doctors notes?"" which I confirmed. I asked her if I should pay the bill or wait since it will get into overdue status and she said wait. I left it at that. I didn't get her name or a case number (although I'm sure I can obtain it).

So I'm waiting and hoping this will work out. But today I recieve two more lab testing bills. The first was for the tests that match the discharge paperwork, no problem there. The second was 300 for hepatitis screening. Again, a quick check shows this is not a high priority test.

I'm trying to decide my strategy here and the order in which to proceed with the following items (written in no particular order):

1. Call the doctors nurse to check on status of initial inquiry and inform her of second bill. Confirm her name.
2. Obtain a copy of doctors notes, if they will release them to me.
3. Obtain name of apprentice who was shadowing with doctor the day I was seen (witness).
4. Call billing department to inform them of second bill.
5. Send certified letters to each lab testing company (two total), informing them I did not authorize those tests and direct them to my primary doctors office.
6. Send a certified letter to my doctors office outlining all events, along with a statement that I didn't authorize those tests, and provide copy of bills which I do not feel I am responsible for.

Future/escalated actions, if needed and only when appropriate:
1. Contact the practices' parent company to place a complaint and seek resolution. For example the doctors office belongs to company A but they are likely owned by a larger parent company B.
2. File in small claims court. Ideally with a copy of the doctors notes and the name of the witness, but if I can't get those, compel the doctors office to provide them (would research the right way to handle this).

Overall it's 600 and I can pay it. But I'm happy to put a decent amount of leg work in if they try and be shitty over this. Depending on responses I get here, I assume best case I wait and they resolve this in my favor. If not, I start launching missles.

I let them know that I was not comfortable with a general inspection as well as general inspection is not legal according to California civil code 1954. The guy pressured me into coming by saying that it was in my lease to allow him in to do inspections and he came and took a picture of the entire inside of my home. He took pictures of every single room and different angles, and then he claimed his reason was just to look at a few things that I had called for maintenance which included the washer dryer leaking as well as the toilet having issues but did not require him to take pictures of everything. I let them know I was uncomfortable with this as well as him doing a general inspection under the guise that he was there for maintenance. Now it has happened again months later where I scheduled an appointment with the property management for someone to come and clean the carpets and then the day of the appointment the owner and the property manager show up as well without notice wanting entry to do an inspection. I let them know that they did not give me 24-hour notice for them to come and do an inspection in my home and the same guy insisted upon entering so I told him I would video him the entire time and that he is only to stay in the carpeted areas since that was what was being serviced and he walked around the carpeted areas as well as look through my bathroom which does not have carpet. I have since sent them another email letting them know that this was not appropriate and they can't keep doing random inspections under the guise of other reasons. I also told them I've contacted the fair housing authority and they then know as well that this was illegal and my property management is basically telling me that they do not care and that what they're doing is perfectly legal they also let me know that they are allowed to enter my home when they want to with notice because they are the owners. I also let them know that I was not comfortable with this person who did the inspections coming back to my home but they told me that the owner likes and requested him so he is the one who will be coming anyways, this is regardless of how I feel. I have sent a demand letter in the mail that is certified letting them know what they're doing is not legal and I'm not sure what the next steps are because it's making me very uncomfortable and causing me extreme anxiety and I feel like this is a gross breach of my privacy especially them telling me that they are allowed to enter when they want to because it's in my lease which is also violation of civil code 1953. The fair housing has told me what they are doing is illegal and I know for a fact that in order for them to have entry it has to either be an emergency or they have to have a valid legal reason for entry with 24-hour written notice.

"I moved into my house in Eastern Pennsylvania about a year and a half ago. This property has a stream that cuts through the corner of the lot and has a \~60 year old concrete culvert (maybe \~20ft from the road) that directs the water into a 2 ft pipe, under the road, and out on the property on the other side. This structure is old and cracked and the stream has meandered over the years so the water comes at it from an angle which is eroding the dirt from behind the culvert.  When it rains heavily, the stream gets backed up -- I'm assuming because the small size of the pipe and the angle at which the water is hitting the culvert.   
This causes my entire front yard to flood and has erosive effects on the road, the driveway across the street, and other properties.   
The township apparently inspects water structures every 3 years. I had an inspector come and tell me recently that due to the condition of the culvert and the erosion that I would need to replace it. He stated that I would receive a summary and further instructions in a letter from the township shortly -- I never received any communications from them though. The inspector also stated that in my deed (relevant section pasted below), I was responsible for all water systems and structures even though it was the township that built the culvert (potentially incorrectly). According to him, I own the culvert but the township owns the pipe.   
Today, I hired a structural engineer to come and inspect the culvert and give me a proposal. It's not pretty -- I'd have to dam the stream, pay for a new concrete structure, add rip rap rocks to prevent future erosion, and potentially divert the stream to hit the pipe head on (which may involve red tape from the army corp of engineers). The engineer did say, however, that while he's not a water engineer, the pipe was obviously inadequate to protect the surrounding properties and road.  He also found it quite odd that the township wouldn't be the ones on the hook to fix the issue.  
My plan is to take the engineers proposal to the township and ask them to replace the pipe that runs under the road. In doing so, I would imagine they would have to fix the positioning of the pipe and build new culverts on each side and subsequently fix our flooding issues. Before I do that, I'm curious if the language in my deed is fairly standard (especially the parts regarding structures, water courses, etc.) or if it definitively pawns ownership of the culvert on to me. I have no idea what I'm doing, who I would hire for these kinds of things, and definitely don't want to pay tens of thousands of dollars to address these issues.  
My ask: can someone with more legal knowledge than me please read the following excerpt from my deed and let me know if it implies I have a responsibility to fix/maintain the culvert?  If I am in fact responsible, I don't want to open a can of worms and draw attention to the issue when I go down there demanding they fix the culvert/pipe.

"So I was dumb and driving my Camaro that just had its engine replaced. The new engine is very different then then old one, and I was apparently going 100 in a 70. I truly didn't realize it bc it's a manual transmission, and usually I just set the cruise at 2000 RPM in 6th gear, but this new engine apparently that's way too high. Anyway-
I got pulled over and the State Patrol said I was going 98 and he stopped clocking me. But he issued the ticket for 100. (First ""error"" on the ticket). This means no option to just pay it, I have a mandatory court appearance next week.
I have only 1 other speeding ticket for 5-10 over, over 2 years ago.
I'm wondering a) can they tack on reckless op on top of the speeding charge?
And b) the ticket has many errors on it, one the speed limit where I was is 65, but the office listed 70. He also listed he was stationary while clocking me, but, he was in fact moving the opposite way across a highway. I also mistakenly gave him *completely incorrect insurance* information, but he still took it and said its valid (it's actually for a different car, different person, and expired?).
When I go to court how should I go about it? If they just do speeding, I was thinking pleading guilty and just paying it. But if they try to say reckless should I try to fight it? Can they add reckless after the citation?

"Burner account, sensitive info. tl;dr- my dad's health is failing and his ""nurse"" may be scamming him

  
My family and I are having grave concerns about our father. Sadly it has gotten to the point that it has been suggested to a few of us, independently, that we look into power of attorney. So this is a request for advice, guidance, suggestions from any who may have them to give.

  
Some background: My mother died some years ago and, while I believe my dad has been a depressive alcoholic for many years (30 at least), he spiraled a year after my mother’s death. After about a year and a half, at his lowest point, he was  totally incontinent, prone to bouts of weeping, actually asking family and friends for help and admitting to bouts of severe melancholy despite having always maintained an air of stoicism. He had rarely ever been to the doctor, never been to a hospital, and never even considered any sort of psychiatric therapy, counseling, or rehab. 

  
The latter was the recurring suggestion from everyone he appealed to for help, but again, sadly, he decide he would “do it on his own” bolstered by the support he felt from those who tried to help. And while he did go through periods of curbing his drinking, most sadly of all it seems the damage was done and he now has irreversible liver damage. As a result his physical and mental state has declined substantially. While once he was a grammar nazi and fastidious about spelling, his emails are now littered with mistakes and redundancies. He seems to forget words with increasing regularity and will often times just say “yeah” completely out of context. For the past six months he seemed to find it extremely difficult to do things like put his shoes on or groom or dress himself efficiently. He has recently been admitted to the emergency room and then hospital for a nearly two week stay due to an infection that would not heal and left him unable to get up on his own. He is now home with a wound pump and an antibiotic drip administered through a picc line.

  
There is another aspect to this story though. Through the real estate agent he bought his condo from, he was introduced to a woman (we’ll call her Faith) as a cleaning woman who’s also had ‘experience’ with caregiving for elders, palliative care, hospice, and PT training, though it has never been made clear if she is licensed or educated in any of these fields (and I’ll tell you right now, she’s not much of a housekeeper either.) Also we’ve never met or seen evidence of any of her other clients. In the time she has worked for my dad she has done quite a bit for him, taken him on vacations, many walks at the mall, dinners, lunches. But he has also compensated her for her service to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, paid for vacations that he did not go on, offered to buy a car for her daughter and has, through his will, bequeathed to her an IRA worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that would have gone to my mom. On top of this he constantly harps on how wonderful/kind/smart/beautiful Faith is, meanwhile pushing aside help from us, his family, and discounting whatever help we do give (my sister recently spent weeks away from her job and life two hours away to be here with him in the hospital for which she was given scant thanks or praise in return. All of it went to Faith.   


In the hospital, Faith presented herself as Dad’s caregiver, being careful never to refer to herself as a nurse in front of other, actual nurses. But she demanded to be around for all discussions with doctors and medical staff, a demand my father eagerly supported. Still, even after being given exhaustive instructions by the hospital staff on how to administer the antibiotics, when the moment came she seemed to find the process confusing and needed to look up a youtube video.

  
I try to believe that people are good, I think most of my family does, but the time has come that we cannot push aside our suspicions about Faith any longer. Is he really just in love and showering her with gifts? Would it be ok for her to accept so much even if he was? Is she manipulating him because she knows his mental state is feeble and he’s easily suggestible? Is there even anything we could even do if we found out this was the case?

"Hello, I realize its difficult to determine advice for a particular case, but wondering if others have been through a similar situation as we gague what is the best course of action.

**Background:** 

- Grandfather (just going to call him defendant) arrested due to a misunderstanding where a proprietor alleged they told him to leave, however defendant claims they never realized this, and defendant also does not speak English. Proprietor has city police posted at property due to prior incidents with other people at this location.

- The officers posted at the property effect an arrest (presumably for trespass) without warning the defendant, and used force during the arrest. Bystander records this situation, where every bystander present aside from proprietor vocalized that they are using excessive force. Defendant, whom happens to be a disabled man over the age of 80, is kneed and struck repeatedly by the officers during the arrest. This is all on video.

- Defendant is unformally charged with the trespass as well as with resisting arrest and battery on LE. Defendant denies the charges and retains a defense attorney while in jail, posts bail and is released on bail after which he is taken to the hospital where injuries are recorded. While in jail, defendant is never read miranda rights yet interrogated without a laywer and it was attempted to transfer him to HSI because police believed him to be undocumented (he is a US citizen). 

- The bystander video is featured in local television, social media and various newspapers overseas, all where the department is alleged to have used excessive force on an elderly person. 

- Attorney contacts assigned prosecutor and explains the situation and why they believe state should dismiss. Additonally, a complaint is made to the department, bodycamera foortage requested and an internal affairs investigation is commenced regarding excessive force (this was communicated by the prosecutor to defense attorney). Attorney also communicated to prosecution that due to the force they intend to bring a lawsuit under 42 USC 1983 against the city. 

- 3 months go by without any development, defendant still not formally charged or indicted, no arraignment has been scheduled. Prosecutor contacts defense attorney and states they are still awaiting body camera footage from the police which for some unknown reason they refuse to provide. Attorney promises to send prosecutor a mitigation packet.

- Mitigation packet is sent to prosecutor's office and includes various letters of character, awards, etc and most importantly a section showing the amount of negative attention the case has received from public through the press. 


**Current Situation:**

- Prosecutor contacts defense attorney and states the office is willing to dismiss the case and not charge (still hasn't been charged) after seeing the mitigation packet; however, they want defendant to sign a liability-release/dismissal-release agreement so that the city/PD will not be sued. Nothing has been offered in writing, only the informal communication of this fact to the attorney.

- Attorney informs defendant of the prosecutor's intend to offer a dismissal in exchange for signing a release, defendant and family are now trying to come to a decision of what is the most prudent course of action. Defense attorney recommends that signing release is the quickest way to dismiss but will attempt to convince prosecution to dismiss without it. They believe the prosecution does not have enough evidence to convict but may possibly be stubborn enough to file an information for at least one charge to tire out the defendant. 

Additional info:

The Florida rules of criminal procedure, rule 3.191 makes it clear that a defendant in a felony matter must be brought to **trial** within 175 days of arrest. It has been over 120 days since the arrest, and defendant has not been formally charged. It further defines commencent of trial at the point where jury panel is sworn for voir dire examination. In other words, the state must swear in a specific jury for this case in 65 days or less, at which point the court offers a 10 day ""recapture"" period to give the prosecution one last chance to begin trial. If trial does not begin, the court MUST dismiss the case with prejudice. 

While it is likely prudent to consider the dismissal-release offer, it seems that the prosecution is bluffing that they are willing to dismiss out of kindness but rather that they lack evidence and time to  bring the case to trial. However, they still want to protectthe city and police from liability, which to seems like a complete violation of ethics/ conflict of interest on their part, as does the ABA and many other legal organizations. 

Is it worth the gamble? The family and the defendant wants to be made whole for the injuries and suffering they have experienced by the actions of officers who failed ot properly do their job. However, this costs at the risk of further time and money and of course possibility always exists that a jury could convict. 


**TL;DR:**

- Grandpa arrested and beat by cops when they arrest, posts bail, retains their own attorney, goes to hospital due to injuries. 
- Case blows up on local news, social media and overseas, attorney intends to file a 42USC 1983 civil suit.
- 4 months go by with no charges, prosecution states they want to dismiss out of kindness but expects defendant sign a dismiss-release agreement so that the police and city can't be sued for damages in civil  court. 
- OP calling their bluff and believes they don't have the evidence (according to prosecutor they still dont have bodycam footage from police) as well as time to bring case to trial (only have 70 more days to do so or the case is dismissed with prejudice according to rules of criminal procedure), but attorney believes they might file information anyways just to ""punish"" the defendant for not signing the release, causing further headache, expenditure of money and a risk the defendant could somehow be found guilty of a charge. 
- Defendant of course wants the case to be dismissed but also doesn't want the damages he suffered just be forgotten to protect unprofessional cops and wants to be made whole.

"Hello, 

This is my first post in the group. I use Gov Deals for my business and have been using Gov Deals for the last couple of years. Yesterday, I was bidding on an auction through my phone and placed a high bid with a perception that I would get the second last bidder's price if they didn't outbid me. I placed bid of $460 and the second last bidder's bid was $160. 

I won the auction and was sent an email with my bidding price plus tax. So, I reached out to Gov Deals and explained to them that the second last bidder's price was $160 and they took my high bid as the final price. She mentioned I could have missed the Auto Bid option which needed to be checked while bidding higher. She also said to reach out to the seller. I never checked that as I have never used that option and never used it on other Auction Websites. As I said the reason for the high bid was to outbid and to still get the second-last bidder's bid price. I reached out to the Seller a government agency explained this situation and asked if they could accept the second last. That person said he would talk to his manager and see if they would accept the second-last bidder's price. He got back to me and said they would relist the item and that I could bid again. The relisting suggestion was from them not from me. During our conversation, I never refused the payment, instead, I made a polite request. 

Right after the call, I received an email saying my account was defaulted for non-payment, whereas the payment is due within 5 days after the auction and I am good with the due date. I have not violated the legal agreement of Gov Deals and the Terms and Conditions of the Seller.

I called Gov Deals and they said the Seller had marked me defaulted. Then I called the seller and the seller said Gov Deals handles the account. I finally sent an email to the seller and gov deals explaining the whole situation of mishandling my request and expressed my disappointment in this situation and with the customer service associate telling me two different things.

"Hello all and TIA for any information. 
I live in California and must break my lease due to unforeseen circumstances with our parents health. I let the property manager know three months early that we will need to move out early. That was two months ago. At that time, the property manager stated she will advertise the unit and let me know once someone would like to see the place. She also stated Lease Takeovers aren't available, which I am not sure is true. Foe the past two months I have been scouring the rental sites and have not seen a single ad for our property. I also have gone onto the property management website and there has not been an ad for an upcoming available unit. I went on the site again today and there still wasn't an ad for an upcoming available unit, so I reached out to the property manager. Of which, she ensured me that they are advertising the units on the ""Market"". I kindly asked her for a link to the ad because a few of my friends are actually interested in a lease takeover, or renting the unit. The property manager has refused to give me a link to the ad for the unit. She has flat out stated ""We are not going to send you a link to an ad every time we post an ad for the unit."" I assured her she only has to send me it once and she once again reiterated she is not sending me any link for an advertisement regarding the property. After she refused, I sent her a screenshot of the property management website which showed nothing upcoming available. She has assured me twice that the unit is being advertised, bit it is nowhere to be found and she won't send me a link to any ad, so I can send them to the people I know who are interested. This place is hinestly super cool and a great price and many of my friends have wanted to move in but units are hard to come by here. The property manager states she will only allow communication if they email her directly so she can show them.
I live completely alone in a 2000 Sq ft. Loft. I am too old to party. I don't play loud music. I read books most of the time and work on my computer. I guess I'm kind of a quiet recluse. So its not like I cause issues for the management team. Rent is always paid and on time. Some other issues I have experienced are: 
1) I was locked out of the apartment the first day, after the maintenance man handed me the keys due to the property manager being unavailable. The property manager got upset that the maintenance man handed me the key. But, I was supposed to meet with her, and not the maintenance man, the day my lease started at 9:00AM. The property manager just never showed up and the maintenance man got tired of waiting. I was still required to pay for that day. I didn't have a place to stay during that night and had to sleep in my car.
2) the range kept going out, so I was without a dishwasher, oven or fridge for the first 5-6 weeks while the electrician worked to troubleshoot the issue. 
3) The property manager has mistakenly placed an eviction notice on my door twice on a Friday night, and not responded to the mistake until the following Monday, even though she lives four doors down the walkway. So I was packing up my stuff and trying to find a place to live twice. 
4) I was never given an initial walkthrough by the property manager and when I asked for it, I didn't receive a response for weeks. The property manager finally emailed me a scanned piece of paper for initial issues I had found with the apartment, but the firm wasn't even for the property I live in. I had decided to make a long video of the state of the loft when I moved in, just as backup. 

Just wondering if I need to reach out to someone, or have any recourse.

"Located in California. The residence is approx 1100sqft with just the upstairs being carpeted, roughly 500sqft plus stairs. 

I rented a duplex for about 3yrs. Per the lease, at the end of my tenancy I got the carpets professionally cleaned and emailed the property management company the receipt. I cleaned that place top to bottom as well as patched up any nail holes. The only thing I forgot to do was a couple lightbulbs and the air filter. 

I left the place just as clean as I got it and have it documented via multiple videos. They sent an estimate of 

* General House Cleaning- $475
* Carpet Cleaning: 80% replacement- $2000
* Blinds- $250
* A/C Filters, light bulbs, door stops, &amp; outlet covers as needed- $65

I reiterate, I left the place in perfect condition (as in, perfect for having resided there for three years). No staining on walls or carpet, no pet damage, the blinds were not damaged, and the house was left spick and span. In fact, when I'd received the apartment it already had outlet covers basically falling out off the wall and the blinds did not fit the windows, about an inch too wide making for a very awkward fit and difficult to use them.

The security deposit was originally $2500 so they are now asking for an additional $290 to be paid to them. 

Is there anything I can do to fight this? Is it true I must wait for the final security deposit transmittal in order to disagree with it? This estimate is outrageous, especially since I put in so much effort to make sure it was clean and repaired.

ETA: Im also unsure if I should immediately respond via email that I disagree with it as Ive just received the estimate today, 12/20.

"My cousin( who was raised by my mother via the foster care system)asked me to let her have some of my eggs since her body wasn't all that great for having kids and it was known i dislike children but am able to have them.she begged saying it was the closest she could get biologically. So knowing my mom wanted grandkids and saw my cousin as her daughter, i said yes as long as she raised the kid good and we signed papers to get what was needed done

now what lost me was that once she had a successful pregnancy, she stopped caring. She started smoking ,doing drugs drinking, committing crimes, doing things you never would expect from a mother to be, who was so desperate for a kid.

And like one would guess, she got caught and basically threw the kid she had at us. Despite not telling us this baby needed many surgeries and was born with inverted feet.We happily raised the baby, thinking that when she got out, she would take the baby back. Since she claimed to be working on herself while in jail and her therapist, she was doing good.

she, in fact, did not saying they could do a DNA test that the kid wasn't hers and she wasn't going to take care of my kid .which I foumd funny because she was the one who's on the kids birth certificate since she did labor not me.So I want to know if this legal can she force me to take care of a kid she gave birth to and found a man to make a kid with just because it was my egg used.

 I'll say already now there was no laywers from the us present when I gave the eggs or no proof (for the country I live in) since we did that in another country then i came back to the US ( since her bf who would be the kids dad was in mexico). I assumed she would stay in mexico, but she didn't coming to the us later in her pregnancy basically right before birth.she gave birth in the US and wrote her name and info for the baby doing the naming and etc. 

That was stupid on my end now that i  thought about it. I should have had a mexico and US lawyer, but i only have a mexico one . Now I might end up with a baby that she just suddenly didn't want (because she was to expensive even though my mom's been paying all the surgeries)while living a busy life with college work marriage etc

Also, how would I have to tell finance that despite us never wanting kids, we might be screwed legally into having a baby. Both us agreed not to have kids due to childhood traumas present in both of us and after talking it over decided we're not mentally healthy enough to care of anything living thing(such as pets)/children. since we both have major random depression episodes and who's to say we don't forget we have a kid and something happens to them.since we've had times where we've having episodes forgetting to eat and complete basic needs for ourselves

My landlord recently contacted me and my girlfriend about a trail leading from the front door of my apartment complex to my apartment (up 2 sets of stairs and about 20 ft total). This is very faint and I had not noticed it until she contacted us about it. We have lived in this apartment for 14 months and the trail just starting being visible. We think that this may be due to my girlfriend working in fast food and having grease on her shoes when she comes home from work every day. She has said that since it is due to us and/or our guests, and it could permanently damage the carpet if it is not cleaned, we have to reimburse them for the cost of a professional carpet cleaning service to come and clean it.

The only part of my lease that I can find that deals with this is saying that if we damage something outside of normal wear and tear we need to pay to fix it.

"Hi. I worked over 40 hours in a workweek back in early September. My Executive Director approved the OT. I submitted my timecard on 9.15.2023 that reflected all hours worked, including the overtime. The next day, 9.16.2023, my ED called me and stated the agency (non profit) allegedly doesn’t have the funds to pay me at that time, so to submit a regular 40 hour work week timecard and on the next day, to turn in the regular timecard again with my OT hours. I was told I would be paid a seperate check with the OT hours and have my regular paycheck. My dumbass, ok yea anything to help out the agency. 4 months passed. I continuously followed up on the OT check that never came with the following checks. One response I got in early December was “this check is on hold by the ED”. Fast forward to today. I get an email for my pay stubs for payday tomorrow. It was my OT check on there but with a lower $ amount I calculated.
Ok now to the good part
I have a conversation with the deputy director (also handles some HR duties). She says the agency work week is Sunday. BAM! Ok. From Sunday to Saturday, I worked more than 40 hours. She said the ED approved “extra” hours but those don’t count as OT pay. She also said that’s why it says in our employee handbook that OT is not approved for employees. I countered with- there is no “extra” hours without extra pay. In CA, if an employee works more than 40 hours in a work week (which I did), they are legally entitled to OT pay. There are also emails from the Deputy referring my hours as OT hours. AND it states in our employee handbook that OT can be approved by the ED (which mine was). I also told her that I’ve submitted two time cards reflecting those overtime hours via email.

"Hi guys, I have a question, but I have a story to tell first.

I am a school based clinician based in Vermont, and I was offered a job at the local hospital. They wanted me to join officially at the start of their next pay period, which happens to fall in the beginning of January. Given I work at a school (which is a 501 (c) 3 charitable organization), there is about a week and a half worth of vacation before the start of the new year. So this meant that when I gave my two weeks notice I'd only be physically present for about 8 days as the other days are holiday pay. In essence there is no good time to quit in the month of December.

  
On the day that I was aiming to announce leaving all the staff were pulled into a meeting by the CEO of the school that announced we were getting a Christmas bonus (1,000$). That it was thanks for all the hard work everyone had put in up til then, and should people stay through the end of the year then they'd get another bonus in May or June. After than I waited about 15 mins and went to see my immediate boss, the principle, and announce my two week notice and hand in my resignation letter. She wasn't happy, but there was little fuss. 

  
For the next week or so I did what was ethically proper and wrapped up sessions with my clients, finished paperwork, really went into overtime making sure everything was taken care of. One of the Union reps from the school (lets call her Gertrude) came and asked me how attached to the bonus I was. I said I was very attached. She stated that because the union considered me no longer part of the union on the day I announced my resignation then I may not qualify. I asked her how that worked and she said she wasn't sure, she was just working with what she'd been told. She asked me if I wanted her to fight for me and I said yes. She engaged in some back and forth and told me in private that she thought because of some talks she'd had with other people higher up that I would get my bonus.

My coworkers started saying they'd gotten their bonuses. I had not. I emailed the financial person and asked her if I was going to get a bonus. She cc'd in the CEO and together they said that according to them I officially stopped working at the school on 12/12/23. 

However my last day on paper that I'd put in my resignation was for 12/26/23. 

I then asked if I was going to get paid for the wrap up and termination work I was doing during that period, to which they said that they had chosen to pay me for that time. I pointed out, in a very courteous manner, that I must still count as an employee if I was still getting paid till the 26th. I made sure to point out that my understanding of wage law was that bonuses, once stated/promised as a thank you for sticking through hard times and going above and beyond, were considered part of someone's wages. 

(This assumption is based on this: ""A bonus is a payment made in addition to the employee’s regular earnings.  Under the FLSA, all compensation for hours worked, services rendered, or performance is included in the regular rate of pay."" from the US Department of Labors page on Bonuses under the Fair Labor Standards Act: Fact Sheet #56C.)

A follow up email from the CEO said that the: 

""bonuses are discretionary, variable and have a retention slant; bonuses are NEVER factored into wages/built in to one's salary. I (the CEO) would never pay out a retention based bonus for someone who tendered resignation days before the actual payout.""

He also stated that since I'd stated I was going to touch base with legal counsel that the school also had a lawyer that would ""be willing to participate"". In addition to this, in talking with fellow staff, I learned they'd been urged (VERY STERNLY) not to engage me on the matter. I learned from someone through the grapevine that the CEO was talking shit behind my back calling me ""unprofessional, selfish and self-absorbed"".

***So my question is this, under the law, can I argue to keep the bonus if we were never notified that it was a retention bonus, and never made to sign anything that stated it was a retention bonus? Can my CEO take back a Christmas bonus because I'm leaving?***

&amp;#x200B;

Now for those of you sticking around who wonder why I'm so stuck on getting $1000, hear me out. The school I worked at is considered a ""therapeutic day treatment facility"", basically a place for kids who have emotional, behavioral, and educational needs that exceed what a normal school will tolerate or compensate. As such they usually bill for clinical therapeutic care for the clients. On average the tuition for each student is about 75,000-85,000, and with about 25 students in total, they're brining in about 2,000,000$ per year if we mid-ball it. 

I interned here, and the person who was supposed to be my on site clinical supervisor (lets call them Joe) was not there for 4 months due to a) dealing with a broken arm and leg from falling down some stairs at the school and b) battling cancer. 

HOWEVER the school stated that they had a clinician on hand when I was not a clinician. They received clinical care and treatment from me, and the school billed that it had Joe for the clinician, but was not paying him for the work that I was doing, or at least not giving full pay. Meanwhile I am doing Joe's job for him and not receiving any pay, and supervision came from visits from my field supervisor. I did this person's job... for free.... cutting into my available time to work and actually earn money.... while doing a better job at Joe's job than Joe did when they were at work. Joe even fully acknowledged this to me and other staff.

I gave the school six months of free labor, on top of making a whole therapeutic DnD group for the summer which once again cut into my time working. So in reality the school was making money off a clinician who was not there, and the therapeutic person who was there (me) was getting jack shit. In another conversation with Joe, they stated that they made about 23$ an hour, equally about 14,720$ of lost wages for Joe over the course of the four months they were gone, and about $22,080 worth of labor on my part (assuming the work I put in was worth 23$ an hour and not counting summer work). All together the school made an additional 36,800$ off of both of us, and they don't think I've earned that bonus? On top of that when they did hire me they only paid me $18 an hour... for someone with a masters.... going for a licensure...

"Hello! Sorry in advance for the long post. I was fortunate enough to purchase a home in California recently with a traditional mortgage. However, due to unforeseen health issues (car accident), I can't move in right away. I anticipate needing support from my cousin (she's a RN and physical therapist) for what looks like a long recovery journey, and she's kindly let me move in with her to heal quicker (my newly purchased abode is in Northern CA, and she lives in Southern CA for reference). Long story short, I can't move in, and likely won't be able to for another year. Because I am still on the hook for my mortgage, I want to rent it out (in fact, financially I MUST rent it out)-- it is 3 bedrooms, and I think it would be lovely for a family! That said, I signed a ""occupancy affidavit"" that say in relevant part: ""... Buyer will occupy and use the property as borrower's principle residence within 60 days after borrower signs the security instrument... Borrower will continue to occupy and use the property as borrower's principal residence for at lest one (1) year from the date that borrower first occupies the property... HOWEVER, borrower will not have to occupy and use the property as borrower's principle residence within the time frames set forth above if Lender agrees in writing that Borrower does not have to do so. Lender may not refuse to agree unless the refusal is reasonable. Borrower will also not have to occupy and use the property as borrower's principle residence within the time frames set forth above if extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.""   
Does this mean that I can write to the lender and request that they waive this provision in writing? And if they do, does that mean I can rent it out? Has anyone gone through this before? Based on what I was reading online, if I go ahead and rent it out without asking, then it's ""mortgage fraud"", which I obviously do not want to do. If anyone has some guidance or advice, it is GREATLY appreciated at this time. I also do not want to open up a new ""investment property"" loan because I do plan on moving in once I am healed, which should be in the next year hopefully (and those rates are much higher).

"Our friend died suddenly without a will. He had a minor child with an ex girlfriend who is a low budget lawyer. She is acting like they were still together which they absolutely were not. He spent a lot of time at her house because it was the only way she would let him spend time with their child. (No custody/visitation agreement). He had some previous dui issues and she manipulated him into doing a lot of things for her by saying she would ruin him and he would bever see his kid again (even though he eventually handled the dui stuff). For the last 6 years our friend has lived with his ailing mother and had another girlfriend. While everyone is processing the shock of loss, the ex is grabbing whatever money she can... some quite literally like pushing her way into his room and taking things of value out of an open safe while his mother watched stunned. He and his family have bent over backward being nice to her to try and keep a realtionship with the child and all she's been is cruel. She said that she is filing for probate and we're worried that she is trying to be named the individual representative of his small estate. She is the beneficiary of his life insurance (most likely because she filled out his paperwork and lied to him and said it named their child). He was lazy with paperwork...thus no will. She's very good at manipulation and we've all had enough. His mom's appointment with a lawyer isn't for a few weeks.

It's notarized and also contains my thumbprints in red signifying my blood pact. Yep. I know. I know. I was in a tough spot. I was indoctrinated into a cult.

"Me (23f) and my child (2f) have separated from her father (24m) about a year ago. We resided together in Indiana for 2.5 years before we left. He was abusive during the relationship and after. I got a child support court order on him roughly 3 months ago. It’s the standard visitation rights for him (every other weekend, one day a week) and $50/week. During the last 3 months, I’ve received less than half in support, and he has never abided the visitation aspect either. Whenever he has her, he’ll call me after a day, and claim I need to come get her and he’ll call her out of her name and mine.

I filed a police report for battery and the case was sent to DCS. I got a restraining order since the officer had advised me to. DCS did a home visit with me and my daughter and they said they would fight for supervised visits for him.

"Long story, but two years ago, I had 1 truck and 1 SUV involved in gentleman’s agreement with a mechanic. 

The agreement was that in exchange for repairs on my truck, I would give him the SUV. He agreed, and I paid to have the SUV and Truck towed to his yard so he could get started on the repairs. I gave him the keys to the truck and SUV so that he could move them around his yard. I kept the title to the SUV. The truck is a toy for me, so I was in no rush to get it going. 

6 months goes by and I swing by the yard to notice that the SUV was missing. I inquire to the mechanic, who said he towed it away to his house to work on it. I thought this was odd, as he didn’t even touch the truck repairs, but I shrugged it off. 

2 months later, I stop by and still no repairs on the truck. He says, “I’m working on it” and keeps BSing me saying he ordered parts, sent the engine for rebuild, yada yada. He refuses to tell me where the SUV is. I keep on stopping by every few weeks with zero progress on the truck. 

After 3 months of this, I was fed up with this and decided I just wanted to sell the truck and be done with this whole deal. I sold the truck, and had it towed out of his yard. Clearly he was not serious about holding up his end of the agreement, despite taking the payment for it already.

At this point, the truck is sold, however, I feel I am still missing property. The mechanic refuses to tell me where the SUV is, and I would like it back. Should I file a police report for a stolen vehicle?! What bases do I have? The SUV is not worth much (like 2000) but I still feel wronged that I would let this scumbag get away with a move like this.  The title is in my hand, I am the rightful owner.

"I live in a town of about 4,000. I’ve been doing my practicum for 30 hrs/week, working overnights for 20 hrs/week, and attending grad school full time for the last 4 months. I was driving to a gas station and was behind a school bus at around 2:15pm. I wasn’t thinking and the bus pulled over at the street I was going to turn left on to get to the gas station. My mind just automatically assumed that they were pulling over (it was around 2pm and it didnt enter my mind that kids would be off school at that time) and I drove by. I realized my mistake when I had almost completely driven by the bus and then they put the stop sign out (our drivers windows were close to in line). I panicked at that point as I was getting ready to turn left and the driver honked at me and I kind of accelerated to hurry and get out of the way. Then I went about my day.

At 5pm the local cop showed up at my house to ask me about it and wrote me a citation saying my car was on the bus’ video. I had forgotten the whole incident until he point-blank asked me about it. He said they didn’t know who was driving but might be able to tell if they zoom in on the video. He said I have to appear in court. I then looked up what the penalties for this are and it’s essentially a minimum $345 fine in addition to a 30 day suspension of my license. 

Before I found that out I was prepared to plead guilty as I did the crime, no matter how much of an accident it was.

My US partner of 6 years is trying to move to the UK, with her child (12). The father of the child has only been in the childs life for approx 5 years and has been offered the same amount of parenting time he is currently entitled to, he hasn't ever taken all the time he is entitled to until the court case, but in blocks over school holidays rather than every other weekend.
I am not really part of the argument as the basis she is trying to move on is for work in the UK and also arguing that the child will benefit from living in the UK also.

"I currently live in Talladega, AL.  In late October we moved into a rental. When discussing the terms via messenger, the landlord told my wife that rent would be $950 per month, plus a $50 per month per rent for our cat, and a $100 per month per rent for our dog for a total of $1100 per month rent total.

When we with the landlord to sign the lease, my wife noticed in the pet section it states ""No animals on the premises unless the tenant pays an additional $300 pet deposit, and an additional $100 per month pet rent."" Nowhere in the lease does it say that it is per pet, or anything along those lines. That is the only line on pets allowed/pet rent.

Today, the day our rent is due, he is trying to tell us that the pet deposit is supposed to be $450, so we owe him an additional $150, and that the pet rent is $100 for a dog, $50 for a cat, and so we needed to start paying a total of $1100 a month. Our lease states $950 for rent, for a total of $1050.

My county seems to be pretty strict. Got pulled over twice. I’m in Florida state. I was caught driving with a broken headlight which I had no money to fix. The first time I got pulled over, I was informed that my license was suspended. I did not know. He informed me to get it fixed as soon as possible because the next officer that will stop me won’t be so kind. I thanked the officer and proceeded home with caution. 15 minutes later, I got pulled over again and another sheriff approached me. He warned about my headlight and asked to see my driver’s license. I don’t remember what I said but the first thing I said when I was pulled over was “yes, I was warned about my headlight and was just informed that my license was suspended.” He proceeded to check my license and registration anyway. Turns out that both were suspended. He asked me to step out of the vehicle and I was arrested on the spot. He said that I was under arrest for knowingly driving under a suspended license. After I served time, I spoke to my public attorney that I had no idea that my license was suspended that one night. I had to go home one way or another. I guess I was ignorant about the law but I was told that I should’ve immediately stopped driving but that’s not what the first sheriff told me. I was simply on my way home.

"I live in an HOA in CA. Looking for legal advice on towing laws in CA.

A friends vehicle was towed today 12/20/23. I called the patrol company that services the community and was informed I'd need to reach out to property management for details.

I reached out to the property management of my community, who forwarded info from the patrol company. They let me know the car had been cited back in June (with photo proof of the citation on the vehicle and photos of the car), then again earlier this month (with photos of the car, but not a physical citation on the vehicle). They also let me know the car cannot be parked in the community more than twice in a 6 month period. Ok that's fine. 

My issue is the second citation was never physically found on the car. Had to go to impound and pay near 400$ to get the vehicle back. I'm trying to get some type of proof of the citation provided on the second instance, but doesn't look like the HOA is trying to help. Had the citation been on the car, the car would have been parked elsewhere (when it was towed this morning). 

The HOA did provide some digital ticket of the citation earlier this month, but the crux of the issue is a physical citation wasn't found which would have averted the need to tow.

Long story short I filed my tax return in February.  got my refund back; and went about my business

Fast forward to September, I get a letter from the IRS that i owe over 2000 dollars due to a ""change in my eligibility from my EIC and child tax credit"" Very confused so I call IRS and HR block and spend a bunch of time finding out what happened.

Apparently when filing my returns, HR Block missed one of my W2s (between my wife and i filing jointly there were 3 W2s and 1 1099) So they didn't enter one of them at all

Without informing me at all, or even getting in touch with me they did an Amended tax return in May and with the additional W2, it pushed our income over a certain ""threshold"" and changed our eligibility for a couple of the credits that we received.  Over 2000 dollars, and we've also begun acruing interest.

I've spend hours and hours going back and forth on the phone with HR block and what they keep telling me is that ""the amount that i owe is what i would've owed regardless of whether I knew about the return or not"" but my issue is that if I had known (or if it was filed properly the first time) then I could've budgeted that money out of my return.  

Now I am having to pay a surprise 2000 dollar sum to the IRS out of my child's christmas money; my tax return money being long gone.  And i'm acruing interest on top of that.  

And to top if all off HR block keeps asking me if I have ""peace of mind"" coverage selected on my amended tax return.  And I dont.  They keep saying there's not much they can do for me without peace of mind coverage.  But I literally wasn't even consulted about the return.  How would I opt into peace of mind without even knowing a return was being filed.  I'm just at my wits end.

They are currently still ""processing my requests"" for any kind of compensation and I feel like i'm just getting the run around.

Where applicable, the court order needs to specify:
The name and Apple ID of the deceased person.
The name of the next of kin who is requesting access to the decedent’s account.
That the decedent was the user of all accounts associated with the Apple ID.
That the requestor is the decedent’s legal personal representative, agent, or heir, whose authorization constitutes ""lawful consent.""
That Apple is ordered by the court to assist in the provision of access to the decedent’s information from the deceased person's accounts. The court order should be addressed to the relevant Apple entity.”

"Hi all, first off I appreciate your time in reading and commenting on my situation, as it’s hard to find any concrete answers on the internet. I am based in the UK. 

About 8 months ago I took a financed car to a car dealership to sell for me on consignment, I handed over everything except the V5 document to prove I was still the owner of the car until a sale was reached, in which i’ll go and hand over the paperwork, it’s maybe worth noting that I have continued to pay the finance on the car with zero late payments. I recently got back in touch with the company to state that I’ve found a buyer myself, and to see when the soonest it is they could return it to me, they’ve stated they’re happy to return to the car but only after I have settled a bill of £240, £40 for an MOT, and £200 for valeting fees, advertising etc. 

After a semi-heated back and forth over email stating that I was never made aware I’d be charged a bill like this, and that I never signed anything legally binding to say I would, we’ve both come to a stalemate of no one wanting to budge, but it’s been left at “if you want your car back, pay us”. I’ve asked for receipts of the valeting and a copy of some kind of agreement that I would have signed to say I agree to these terms, but thus far nothing has been provided. My last email stated that they have until Friday to return the car to me with the intention that I would pay for the MOT but nothing more, before I look to get the police involved for potential blackmail and/or theft. 

They’ve stated that the fees incurred come from posting advertising on their own site, which apparently branches to places like auto trader, but when I’ve looked i’ve not found a single trace of my car on said websites; the most i’ve found is a sloppy slapped together facebook posts with pictures of my still dirty car, and a one line description with a spelling mistake, as well as their website listing which had the same dirty pictures, and a hastily written 2 line description. 

Really I need to know what my options are moving forward after the Holidays, do I have no choice but to pay the fees just dropped on me with no forewarning, or is there other routes I can go down to get my car back?

Instead of correcting me or showing me how to do it, or listening to my reasons that I thought would be understandable, she began berating me, speaking to me like i was an idiot child. I admit some mistakes were just memory lapses but not all and i lived up to them and told the truth.

Eventually she even began belittling me over little things. Id sweep, id mop id do all the things needed ontop of the more clerical work, and shed still accuse me of doing none of it even aftee photographic evidence.

One day, she came up to me and told me she removed a new employee off the schedule without telling him. He only worked dor a day so obviously he would make mistakes but instead of training him she removed him without his knowledge and didnt tell him until he quit due to having no hours.

This is when things went really bad. As ASM im required by corporate to work 35-40 hours. She began cutting my hours little by little until just last week she had me working 25 hours and a part timer working 36. I made calls to HR reporting it. I also reported to HR when she told another worker that he had to work with a mask even though he had covid.

The hours were fixed, but today i heard from a coworker that she admitted the district manager called her and repremanded her for it, so now, according to my coworker, she said that if i miss anything today, its an immediate write up.

Am I being retaliated against? I mean, this feels like a reaction to her being repremanded for what she was doing? What should i do? I have evidence and pictures of what shes texted, said to me and my coworkers. I dont know what to do. This feels wrong on so many levels.

Edit: I should say this is my third write up. The first two were justifiable and ive since corrected myself on them. I work in Ohio, USA.

"Hey guys,

I'm a new home buyer, I've owned my home for several years now (Well, paying a mortgage on it). I'm a veteran and have taken advantage of a VA home loan.

Recently I was approached by a real estate investment company, let's called them RIC. RIC said to me that they want to buy my house. I, thinking it was a scam, gave them a number approximating 150% of the home's value, thinking they'd leave me alone. However, they didn't shy away from it.

They want to assume the loan on ""Subject to"" terms, it sounds like (AKA Wraparound). I'm on the very edge of just telling him to F Off, but 150% of my home's value is enough to move to a much better area and improve my life significantly, so I'm going to give RIC at least a little bit of consideration.

Again, VA loan on good terms, I'm not under financial duress or anything like that, it just seems like an opportunity for headache in exchange for a big paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

What is my exposure here? How dumb is this? I assume it's legal as VA loans are assumable, but do I need to check with my lender? There is ZERO chance of me trying to ""Go under the radar"" with the lender or something like that, my lender must be aware and OK with me going around the Due on Sale clause. I'm not interested in anything unethical or illegal.

Anyone have any thoughts here? The real question is, is my next step to tell RIC to go away, or should I talk to a real lawyer and have them draft an agreement that exposes us to little risk?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Since I know this will be asked, it sounds like RIC is in this because they're trying to convert equity/cash into cash flow for wealthy investors, which renting my property would allow them to do.","[USA - CA] ""Subject to"" or ""Wraparound"" for VA loan",18n7e3d,1703112056.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18n7e3d/usa_ca_subject_to_or_wraparound_for_va_loan/,
"I have been working at a remote start-up company in CA for 1.5 years, providing therapy services for kids with autism virtually. I started out for 4 months as 1099 part-time because they hire all their workers as 1099 initially. They had promised after a few months, I could become W-2 and get to full-time hours. I did become W-2 and have been for a year now, but I had to force them to reclassify me.

Currently I am pregnant and informed my employer of my pregnancy, and then later requested to go to 32 hrs instead of 40 so I could have time to prepare for the baby and manage stress from work better (I have a mental health condition). My employer agreed to it, but only if I become 1099 again. This means I will lose all benefits, have no FLMA, state disability, nothing as I'm giving birth in a few months. She literally explained that W-2 costs them more in state taxes when I asked what is the difference in reclassifying me due to 8 hrs.

I think legally, looking at laws like CA AB5 or IRS regulation, I would still technically be an employee at 32 hrs. I am using a laptop that was provided to me from the company, I have not worked anywhere else or offered my services elsewhere since taking this job, and I contribute to the main course of their business (they make money solely through providing group therapy which I run). I am setting the days I want to work, but the hours of the groups are set by them although I've seen them change group times to accommodate therapist schedules. It does feel like they tell me how to do the work and supervise it to be that way.

Am I being misclassified? I'm not sure about pregnancy discrimination or not meeting accommodations because they are agreeing to less hours, and they said technically they only have W-2 for 40 hr employees and not part-time. It seems like they are not obligated to do less hours W-2, but it still feels off to me. Only one other coworker is W-2, and the rest are 1099 even though they are doing the same role pretty much.

Her and I were looking for a cheap apartment in the Miami area, so we found a real estate agent through Facebook marketplace that posted a rental listing nearby.

"Back in May, I bought season passes to the Stevens Pass ski area, which is located in WA (as am I), though the parent company, Epic / Vail Resorts, is based in CO and their T&amp;Cs state that CO is to be the legal forum. At the time I made the purchase, their website listed the blackout dates for this particular product (the Select Pass) as being only the last week in Dec. I bought passes for my whole family.

Just this week, I noticed that the blackout dates on their [website](https://www.epicpass.com/Passes/Stevens-Pass-Select-Pass.aspx) are updated to exclude every weekend the entire winter. I talked to a customer service rep, who confirmed that they had made an error with their original published blackout dates. She claimed they had sent an email to this effect in October, offering a refund, but the window to refund has passed. I never received this email (though I've been receiving all of their other marketing comms).

I ended up upgrading our passes to their Premium Pass, which has no blackout dates, at a total cost of $818.

Even if I'd chosen to cancel in Oct., per the email offer that I never received, in favor of a competing product, I would still be out hundreds of dollars: by purchasing in May, I took advantage of early-season discounts, which were no longer available in Oct.

All that aside, it seems fundamentally unfair, and antithetical to the principles of contract law, that one party to a contract can just unilaterally change the consideration from what was represented at the time of the agreement. I hope to get them to honor the original terms I agreed to but I'm trying to understand what legal leverage I actually have, if I was to file a small claims case.

[Their T&amp;Cs](https://www.stevenspass.com/policies.aspx?tc_1=2) have a clause that reads:

&gt;Vail Resorts expressly reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to modify any portion of this Policy. If we make a material change to this Policy, we will dispatch a notice to you of such changes and/or post the amended terms on epicpass.com.

"Hi r/legaladvice,

I hope someone can provide me with some guidance as I'm going to court tomorrow (12/21) for eviction on a house I'm renting in Austin, TX.

Here are the key details:

**1. Eviction Court Date:** 12/21/2023 (tomorrow)

**2. Monthly Rent:** $3,295. Owe for October, November, and December.

**3. Total Past Due:** $12,105 (includes penalty fees, legal fees, property management fees).

**4. Current Bank Balance:** $8,195.

**5. Attempts to Negotiate:** I've tried contacting the property management company twice in the last 30 days for partial payments and a payment plan, both denied. They insist on full payment.

**6. Reason for Back Due Rent:** Lost my job due to a major tech layoff in June 2023. Started a new job on October 23rd, 2023.

**7. Personal Situation:** Single dad caring for a 4.5-year-old (50% of the time). Paying $1,800/month in child support, prioritizing child support payments. I have stayed on top of these payments.

**8. Upcoming Payment:** I'll receive $4,600 on December 29th, and I can pay the entire balance then. However, concerned about the typical 3-day notice to vacate after the court date (Christmas eve).

I'm seeking advice on what I can do to potentially stay on the property until December 29th when I can pay the balance in full. Any legal insights, tips, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

My father in law is in the process of buying a home that was foreclosed. It was listed on Auction .com and he bid on the home and won the bid. At that point he paid the earnest money and began the buying process. There's a few points that we wanted to get legal advice about.

1. The original tenants of the house are still living there but we were informed by Auction .com representative that the seller has started the eviction process. However when we called the sheriffs office and the clerk of court's office they both were unable to provide any information or updates on the eviction. We're hesitant because we don't want to close on the home until it is vacated. We don't want to be legally responsible for evicting the tenants so we're not sure what to do.
2. We're going with the banks closing company which I'll keep anonymous, and they want to do a remote DocuSign or mobile notary  to close, even though when we looked them up we found that they have a local office in the area.

Classic example someone reports sexual harassment then is fired or experiences some other negative outcome as a result.

"Should I sign for my sister’s death certificate?

I’m in a bind emotionally and idk how to feel. Im going to delete this after a while for fear of it being found. 

To give a little bit of a backstory, My parents got divorced when I was younger. I’m the only child that my mom and dad have in common. My dad has an older daughter from a previous relationship with his first wife, who passed away. 

My older sister recently passed away due to illness. She didn’t have any insurance so my dad had to scrape money together to bury her. The day after her death, I found out that my mom had an insurance policy on her. When I found out my dad had to rob Peter to pay Paul, I asked my mom on my own volition to give some money out of my sister’s policy to dad so he could bury her. She said no. They were married for over 10 years and It was quite contentious. The divorce was also very bitter and my mom still harbors some resentment to my dad for how he treated her. She told me that that was a hard pill to swallow and she couldn’t get past that. So she didn’t wanna give her any money. 

My mom called the insurance company to cash in the check and they asked her for a death certificate. Although death certificates are public record, there’s a specific lengthy one that can only be obtained by family members, and that’s the one the insurance company needs. My mom called the vital statistics office and they told her that I would have to be the one to sign for it because my parents are no longer married and she is therefore no longer my sister’s stepmother. But since I’m her sister and I’m over the age of 18, I can get it on my own.

While I am more than happy to help my mom (we struggled so much due to the divorce), I do feel some type of way about being put in this situation out of fear that my dad could potentially find out about the insurance policy, especially since he had to pay out-of-pocket for her funeral expenses. Furthermore, I don’t want him to find out that I was the person who signed for it. After years of contention due to parental abandonment, my dad and I are finally getting our relationship back (I’ve always been a daddy’s girl) on track and I don’t want to ruin that.

Are the people at the office allowed to tell my dad I signed for the certificate? Can I obtain the death certificate without him knowing? I’m trying to prevent a fallout over the policy.

"TLDR: Roofer that I did not sign anything with and who I did not go with for the job, but who I discussed roof claim with and pooled into the loop with insurance, sent me an invoice for $5,200  
  
Hi All,  
  
We noticed some leaks in our commercial property roof and engaged a roofer to get an estimate. I met with the roofer on-site a few times and called him a few times about this whole ordeal. I then introduced him as 'my roofer' to the insurance and copied him on correspondences with the insurance, as this was my first time dealing with a roof claim. The insurance company ended up sending out their own adjuster and also separately sent out their own engineer before paying out their own justified / calculated claim, which was approximately $50k.  
  
I was initially intending to use this roofer for the job as I had seen his work, but I never signed a commitment letter or a contract. Two reasons I did not end up using this roofer - (1) he told the insurance company he did a 'repair' which he never did. In fact I told him to do the 'repairs' and charge me separately to slow down the leaks, but he basically ignored my requests and never did them, and (2) once he knew from me the claim was approved (which took 3 months), he kept pressuring me and border line harassing me to book the job without caring to answer the questions I had, and all the time making it seems like this was the most urgent roof replacement ever.  
  
Now some nine months after this whole ordeal had started, he sent me a invoice for $5,200 for 'inspecting roof and assisting with insurance claim'. I agree his insights and what not were somewhat helpful to me as a commercial roof claim newbie, but the charges seems ridiculous. Reminder - I never signed a contract or an engagement letter of any kind. I am personally upset that he would send me an invoice for this exorbitant amount, which seems purely out of spite for not giving him the job.  
  
Does this roofer actually have a legitimate claim to these charges? Should I be consulting with a lawyer? There are several emails and texts back and forth between this roofer and I where I was asking for advice on how to deal with the insurance company etc. that he could use as evidence, but nothing where I agree to giving him the contract or agree to pay him anything. Also, these same texts show the several texts where he is repeatedly trying to get me to book the job and claiming impending doom that the roof replacement is absolutely urgent! So it could go both ways, I think.  
  
I want to respond and / or close this one way or another because I don't want there to be a lein of any kind put on my property. I am thinking of responding with something like this - ""You provided an estimate like any other roofer and provided some documentation material to the insurance company, but the insurance estimate was vastly different than what you had provided. And the insurance company sent their own separate adjuster and own separate engineer to arrive at the conclusion for their claim. I never signed any sort of engagement letter or contract with you, nor did you provide any notice or pricing of these services you believe to have provided. If I would have known copying you on emails to the insurance company or talking to you on the phone was going to cost even remotely this much, I would never have engaged you."" Thoughts?

"I filed a complaint with my state’s (Pennsylvania) public utility commission against my utility company due to poor quality/reliability on the electric grid. Since they filed their answer, I’ve been in discussions with their attorney (ordered by the PUC as a resolution conference) to attempt to resolve the issue amongst themselves. 

It’s looking like we may be approaching a settlement, where they agreed to make repairs. These repairs may already be complete (I’ll find out tomorrow during my next conference call with their attorney). 

My question to you all is…are there any suggestions or good advice I should request be included as part of the settlement? 

Big things that come to mind are:

- I need time to verify the repairs they made actually fixed the issue. The issue was outages occurring randomly. Never more than 4-weeks between outages, so I’d like to stay the matter for 4-weeks to see if any more outages occur (that’s really the only method I can think of that confirms it’s fixed)

- I’d obviously like the ability to re-file the same or a similar complaint in the future if the outages start to occur again. I think I should be able to do this, but want your thoughts. It’s not a true “settlement” because the paperwork from the PUC for the resolution conference indicated that the goal was for the “parties to achieve a full resolution, including withdrawal of the complaint”

Any suggestions from this community on anything?

"Backstory: I am 19yr girl who still lives with my parents. For about 3 years now, my family has taken care of a stray dog that showed up to our house and never left. I personally have never liked dogs. I didn’t  want it or emotionally cared about it. My parents “took in” (to say the very least)  the dog but never took it to the vet, never trained, or etc. We live on our own property, so the dog was always outside with no leash or collar. You can get an idea of how irresponsible my parents were with this dog. I did warn them multiple times that this was bad, but they would just blow me off. 

Today, animal control showed up to our house and I was the only one at home when the officer arrived. He asked if we owned the dog matching my parent’s dog description and I said yes. He told me that that dog had went to our neighbor’s house and killed its 3 kittens and injured the mother cat. Because of my parents’ situation, I had to take legal responsibility/ownership of the dog.

 The officer informed me our neighbor does not want to press charges or sue. The officer also explained that the dog must be kept inside the house. I want to apologize to my neighbors, but what else should I do? What should I do going forward with this dog? I am very upset because like I said, I did not care for this dog. OBVIOUSLY our neighbor CAN press charges and possibly sue in the future. 
Can I offer to pay for the mom cat’s vet bills and have my dad pay for them? I really would appreciate advice. I’m probably to blame as well for not pushing further about this problem with my parents. I honestly want this dog put down or gone.

"I live in CA and was hit by a vehicle over a month ago. Thankfully, with video evidence it was determined the other driver was 100% at fault , however my car was totaled and her insurance has a liability cap of $5000. The discrepancy between my car's value and the $5k is about $3400. Does it make sense to take her to small claims court for the $3400, or should I just take the $5000 from the insurance company and move on? I had to buy a new car for $9000, so the additional money I'd get from small claims court would help me a lot. 

My main concerns are:

1. Somehow, even with the clear video footage, she's not determined at fault and maybe I don't even get the $5000 (I don't know if that's how it works or not)
2. That even if she is determined at fault and told to pay the $3400, she just won't do it and it was all a waste of time (my insurance agent told me this is a likely and common scenario, not sure if that's true)
3. We have the same insurance company and the same claim agent is representing both of us. I'm concerned he will somehow try to sabotage the case because I don't trust insurance companies and this person has already mishandled the claim twice.

Any suggestions? I've never been in an accident before so I'm new to this. I'm also a grad student and not working, so $3400 to cover some of my loss would be really helpful.

"I'll try my best to convey as much as I can as most of this is from my father, but soon, I will have a sit down to discuss everything.   


This is in California.  


So, I am a young adult who lives with his parents. Back in February of this year, those door-to-door solar installers approached my father. While he would usually turn them down, he eventually caved and set up a meeting with them. After some convincing that solar panels would cut our electricity costs and seeing that our neighbors had signed up as well, he decided to sign up himself. However, because of his bad credit, they requested that someone co-sign for a loan to cover the solar panels (which the sellers gave me the impression at the time was to approve the loan in my father's name), which is when they turned to me. While I adamantly denied requesting my father reconsider, after some familial guilt-tripping and reassurance that ""nothing bad will happen,"" I signed with my father. The expected installation was around 3 months. 6 months later, at last, the solar panels are ""finally finished"" but not working, but my father (I guess me as well) is still responsible for the payments. The installation wasn't smooth. The installers took a long time, did a lot of modifications to the home without permission, and blew a fuse for our pool equipment, including pool lights and the pool filter/pump. My father tried to have the company repay him for the damages for a couple of months but dodged his calls or declined any damages because it was ""not their fault, not their problem."" Eventually, the pool got full of algae and he had to drain and refill the pool. My dad did have to pay 5k for a replacement pump because he did not want to drain the pool again. He continues to try to get this settled, but it goes nowhere. Yesterday, I helped him try to cover the pool situation, but at the time of writing this, I got an email from the solar company stating that because ""they did not access the service for the pool damages,"" any reimbursement was voided because they did not fix the issue themselves. Because of all this, my father recently went to a lawyer who was willing to take the case to get this payment for the damages, but we are low on money because of another unrelated legal case. Likewise, they have been calling him, saying he needs to make a payment or his account will fall under collections. This was when I started receiving text messages saying payments were due, and that is when I found out the extent of the mess I got myself into. I'm worried this whole ordeal will ruin my credit since my father is refusing to pay or is unable to pay most months. I am currently trying to finish my last year of grad school and owe 25k in student loans. I cannot imagine adding almost 50k on top of that. I had a gut feeling this whole thing was not a good idea, and I really don't want to be on the hook for 47k, not to mention the solar panel company has not fulfilled any of their promises, plus the damages they did.

"[https://fingerprint.az.gov/applying-good-cause-exception](https://fingerprint.az.gov/applying-good-cause-exception)

I could use some help interpreting what to do here, securing my wife a Good Cause Exemption, so she can get her fingerprint clearance and work at my daughter's preschool, which is short staffed and urgently needs help. She has a shoplifting charge from Gilbert, AZ, that is 8 years old with no priors or other arrests, ever. 

\--

Background:

So my Wife, whom I love, rolled very low on her wisdom check when she was 21, and her dumbfuck then boyfriend convinced her to go along with his own shopplifting behavior, stealing alcohol. My wife, again, whom I love very much, has a terminally low wisdom stat, and tried not to go along with this foolish plan by not being a part of it, and paying for her groceries. But when he was confronted by security, she froze. Said dipshit, got tackled. She panicked, admitted fault, attempted to pay for the goods, and gave them the contraband he planted in her cart, making her complicit. (She's a lovely woman, and never would have done this except she loved, and trusted, an idiot.)

Again, very low wisdom, she listened to the police and judge who told her that she did not need a lawyer, and to simply plead guilty. Which she did, without ever consulting the adults in her life. So she was convicted, served no jail time, and has this permanent misdemeanor on her record for ***99 years*** \-- *because in Arizona we're tough on crime to the point at which our laws ruin your life permanently for simple offenses that prevent you from getting a job &amp; rentals and making enough money to, I don't know, improve your life and escape a cycle of bad money-motivated decisions.* 

There is, in the infinite wisdom of the State of Arizona, no way to expunge this conviction or mitigate its effects, as I understand it. For 99 years. Which I could consider deeply unfair, bordering on cruel and unusual, and unconstitutional. But what do I know? I just live in reality, not an old west tv show like our state leg. 

She has no further or prior arrests or convictions. And never would have any, if not for her idiot ex.

It's been 8 years.

She applied to work at our daughter's preschool, and went through the process of getting her fingerprint clearance. 

Of course, they denied her. She didn't expect this and is devastated. She also lost a job opportunity driving for a delivery app a few weeks ago to this same issue, which compounds her heartbreak and feelings of being hopeless.

But, looking at the paperwork, she can receive a Good Cause Exemption, and someone can vouch for her.

However, the website, linked above, provides this need:

`Two letters of reference (completed on the forms provided by the Board). Both letters must be completed by someone who has known the applicant for at least one year. One form must be completed either by the applicant's current or former employer or by someone who has known the applicant for at least three years. Applicants may submit more reference letters, if they like. However, they must submit at least two, and the references must use Board-prescribed form.`

I have known her for years, so that counts.

But she doesn't have a current or former employer. She hasn't worked a day in 5 years now, since we found we were pregnant and she became a stay at home mom. Any job she could have keeps getting blocked by this damn sentencing from 8 years ago, which she's been punished for enough at this point.

Though, she has ""worked"" for my mom, helping care for her in her disabled state, and mom has given her pocket change for it. It's not a lot, but I figure it counts, and my mom could write her the other letter. Would that count?

Additionally, she wasn't given any community service or other penalties at her sentencing. She was simply released, and that was it. So there is no proof she ever completed the terms, because there were no terms. 

Currently, I really need her getting back into society, because staying at home, she's going nuts. Her preschool needs help, and it would be a great fit for my wife, who is great with kids. It would also lower the ruinous bills, which are 250$ week for just 4 days/week. 

But she can't work at the preschool, with this asinine charge on her record, because she can't get finger print clearance! 

Unfortunately, because my wife can't seem to find work, nor can she lower my bills at the preschool, I am cash strapped after buying a house and can't afford a lawyer. 

Thus, I ask Reddit, and hope there's a lawyer out there with time and knowledge of the Backwards State of Arizona law. 

What do you do when you can't expunge a shopplifting charge, and have never been arrested, let alone convicted, of any other crime?

"**tl;dr:** Family subjected to years of harassment, threats of violence and false accusations of ""brain hacking"" by a distant family member with worsening mental illness.

I write today from my home in California for legal advice on a situation involving a distant family member, referred to here as Bobby (not his real name), who has terrorized my family for nearly four years now.  
  
Bobby is my wife's stepbrother. Because of their age difference (about 10 years), they did not grow up together so they're not particularly close, though up until about 2019 or so, they had a friendly relationship whenever paths crossed. I've met Bobby once and we had a positive, if not largely unmemorable, interaction discussing old family stories and a recent vacation he'd taken.   
  
Starting around 2019 (or perhaps before then), Bobby started exhibiting signs of mental illness. When he'd go out in public, he believed others were talking about him and holding their noses because he claimed they were saying he had an odor. When living with my in-laws during this period, he once got a gym worker in trouble because he told her supervisor that she'd told him he smelled bad. (She denied even speaking with him). Some years before, he had a falling out in medical school that he believed was the result of a man called Dr. Reynolds and once got upset because my MIL had purchased a few rolls of Reynolds Wrap (the aluminum foil brand), asking her if she'd been paid by anyone to put that out where he'd see it (which was on the table after a grocery trip, to be clear.) Another example: He approached my MIL once and informed her that he knew she'd been reading his diary and that what he'd written about her was purely the result of venting. (She did not know he even kept a diary and took great pains not to enter the room where he was staying). Sometime after that, he moved out and none of us have seen or spoken to him since, except his father, who up until about a year ago would occasionally send Bobby money so he could pay his rent or afford his medication.  
  
Beginning in early 2020, Bobby’s condition started getting worse – and he’s used every avenue possible to hurt us. He’s filed more than a dozen frivolous restraining order requests against family members, none of whom have spoken to him since 2019. In them, he alleges he’s been the subject of something called “remote neural monitoring” or “brain hacking.” (This appears to be a common term among people experiencing schizophrenia.) He believes that he’s the target of a coordinated campaign by family members to hack his brain, keep him from achieving his goals, etc. He also alleges that through so-called “brain hacking,” he’s received threats of violence and been called vile names that I will not repeat here. None of us had even heard of “remote neural monitoring” when the first police officer showed up to serve the restraining order. Again, none of us even speak to him. He’s contacted our employers to make the same false and defamatory accusations, leading to a series of uncomfortable conversations that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone. He’s also continued to call his father and leave lengthy and threatening voicemails where he says he plans to kill us all and urges us to leave him alone “or else.” You should hear his voice in literally dozens of voicemails we've saved from Bobby. It is full of anger and paranoia, unlike few things I've ever encountered. The most recent instance of this came in September 2023 when a local police officer called to inform us that Bobby had told a VA worker that he planned to kill my wife. At the time, she was four days from her due date to give birth to our second child. He faced no clear repercussions for any of this and we continue to live in fear.  
  
Most recently, Bobby called an anonymous tip line and knowingly filed a false Child Welfare Services report against me and my wife, repeating the same outlandish accusations of brain-hacking, etc., that he alleged before and while being subjected to court-ordered mental health treatment. While we are confident and hopeful this case will be closed with the allegations being unsubstantiated, it nonetheless subjected an innocent 7-year-old to questioning and a potentially traumatic experience. (I assure you, it is also traumatic for us.) Through this, he also appears to be circumventing a criminal protective order that's in place to protect my in-laws because he falsely believes my family lives with them and sent a social services worker to their home to further harass them. They are terrific caregivers to both of my children, as are we.  
  
I say all of this to say: We are hurting. When we first started filing restraining orders against us, we spent about $2,000 on a lawyer only for Bobby not to show up to the hearing before a judge with the lawyer admitting that there was little else he could do to protect us. In the many instances since, we've shown up representing ourselves (since we can not afford to drop thousands of dollars for each such instance of Bobby's malfeasance.) He never shows up. We've attempted to file a restraining order against him with two issues arising: 1. Bobby is often unhoused so we don't know where he's living and when he's stayed in an area homeless shelter, process servers will not serve court documents to a shelter for a variety of reasons. And 2. We suspect Bobby has schizophrenia and we see little point in going through the process over and over when it's clear how far detached he has become from reality. We've been in touch with our local DA, a local police detective, victim's advocates, and others and frequently are met with indifference - if we even get a response from them at all. Though our names are directly mentioned in Bobby's various threats, we are treated as though we have no standing. And it's clear when we do hear back that multiple involved agencies are not communicating with one another about Bobby's actions despite repeated inquiries by members of our family.  
  
My question is: What are we supposed to do now? We've been the subject of years of violent threats, constant harassment and falsehoods about ""brain hacking"" by Bobby. He does not appear to be getting the court-mandated treatment that he so desperately needs and we constantly live in fear that one day he will make good on these threats. That's an awful feeling. I'd much prefer that Bobby get the help he needs to live a better life, but at the very minimum, I want our family left alone and to have the necessary legal protection from Bobby's threats of violence. And I'd like some guidance about what we can do to move forward.

"A few weeks ago at 2am a drunk driver jumped the curb, hit the neighbor’s tree, drove across their lawn and crashed into my daughter’s car and my car in our driveway. The passenger in the car (a woman) was apparently injured because there was blood all over the inside of their car. She got out of the car. Then the driver (51yo woman) decided to leave the scene of the accident and backed out of our driveway but ran over her passenger. 

My husband awoke when heard a woman who he thought was laughing. He thought it was our daughter and her friends so he jumped out of bed to tell her to be quiet. He didn’t put his glasses on so he couldn’t see very well. 
When he opened the door he saw my daughter’s car smashed up sideways in the garden and he saw a woman underneath a car. The woman was wearing the same color top my daughter had on earlier that day, had the same hairstyle, and the same build. He thought my daughter was dead in our driveway. So he started to run to her. 
Luckily the neighbor got to the woman first and immediately told my husband it wasn’t our daughter. 
But both my husband and the neighbor thought she was dead. 
My husband (and I) both have PTSD because we previously experienced the death of our daughter. The shock of seeing this led to a flashback for my husband. He was so distraught and upset. I thought he might be having a heart attack. He wasn’t, thankfully.  But he did suffer greatly. I took him to see my therapist to help him process the trauma. 
The driver does have insurance but it’s a very bad insurance company and they are dragging everything out. 
We had to buy my daughter a new car. My car will have to be in the shop for 2 weeks. And we have had to pay the towing company that the police called to tow my daughter’s car. 
We will also be out the deductible on our insurance plus the cost of a rental car while mine is being repaired. 
My husband thinks that eventually the other insurance company will have to cover these costs. I am not sure if they will. 
Also the police said we could press charges but my husband said no. And he didn’t ask what kind of charges we would have. 
So I’m wondering if we should have pressed charges and if we should sue the woman. My husband just wants it to be over. 

My question is would anyone here know what kind of charges we should have pressed? It seems like that’s a police matter and not an insurance matter. 
And would it be worth it to sue the woman? 

Thank you for reading all of this.

"Back in June, I took paid 3 week primary care leave and with approval from my leadership team, an extra paid 2 weeks of PTO directly following the 3 weeks.

Last week, (4 months later!) HR notifies me this violates our paternity leave policy and they have to code those 2 weeks of PTO under unpaid FMLA. This week they began clawing back the 2-weeks of pay, in a set repayment plan.

Is this legal when I had approval? This should have been prevented with people manager training or gates in our timecards. Had they notified me, I wouldn't have taken the time off. However our busy season was over and my team fully supported the extra bonding time. I personally feel the company should take the hit or only consider a few days FMLA to separate leave and pto.

I am bio mother of my autistic son whom was conceived via anonymous sperm donor from a Cryobank. My ex wife signed birth certificate and is non bio. No adoption process. I've had three consultations with family law attorney's, gone to the Clerk of Court, went to Special Provisions, have spoken with Vital Records and the Register of Deeds. None, quite literally, none of these professionals have been able to answer my question. Which was how do I remove her from birth certificate? But now that doesn't even matter anymore, as today I was just served custody papers by a sheriff. The one thing two of these attorneys did tell me was that I am able to remove my child from his school if I wish and 'hide' him so she can't check him out of school. I did. Now this court paper states I am ordered to a mandatory mediation orientation, I'm well aware of how that works as she filed last summer as well (she voluntarily dismissed it), but I will not reach any sort of agreement in mediation due to me not recognizing her as a legal parent first of all, and secondly due to her history.

1) An ex parte was granted to me last year at the start of our separation (now divorced) when she was charged twice with AWDW, simple assault, and assault with minor present, after she tried to prevent me from getting my son in the car to take to preschool, tried to block me from backing out of the parking lot then tailgating and following me all the way to the police department. She was arrested right after. No contact order was dismissed in court due to no substantial evidence on my part.

2) Her medical records have a long history of substance abuse and positive drug tests.

3) After her arrest, DSS concluded their investigation finding her neglectful of child. 

4) She has prescription for bipolar disorder and ADHD stimulants. She has admitted to selling these pills after her release from jail (in writing).

5) I have a letter from two coworkers (we worked at the same place until she was fired for leaving on the clock to follow me at Target) stating that she admitted to doing cocaine after her jail release with her new wife.

6) Had my son at the new wife's house without my knowledge for an entire weekend months ago when I allowed her to see him one weekend a month, when the agreement was he would spend the weekend with her where she was living still at a responsible and safe relatives home. My son returned home to me with bed bug bites. I have letter from physician. 

All of this to ask, what are the chances of her getting any sort of visitation? In a perfect world, we never have to see her again.

I’m not here for a moral judgement, I understand what was wrong and the problems associated towards the issue. I’m still in the process of rehabilitating so please, read this with an open mind. 


I was 17 when they knocked on my door earlier this year, I was foolish to not ask for warrants, but they searched my phone and found my telegram where I was in a group sharing CP. I was not participating, saving, or sharing any of it. They were about to let me off and just give me a warning until they say my fraudulent money making methods, when they asked what it was, I just said no comment. Thats when they seized my device. 

Fast forward to now, it has been almost 7 months since the incident, I am now 18, I’ve changed my ways, looked to the bright side and looked at getting rehabilitated. But since then I thought a smart idea wouldve been to delete all my telegram accounts, and after they made a copy of that icloud device, I deleted the icloud.

"So I'm young and stupid and don't know how this works. Yesterday two minors stole a car and in the middle of the GTA 5 star pursuit they jumped the curve into a one way street and straight into me. They then took off on foot but were ultimately caught and the cop mentioned I could choose to file civil suit against them. My insurance should be covering the repairs although they mentioned I should expect LKQ parts and not OEM parts but I could pay the difference. I really don't want to devalue my car with non original parts but also money 🙃 I will also have to pay some amount of deductible money, at least $500 but could be more. So I guess, the question is can I sue this people for the deductible cost and whatever extra money the OEM parts cost, maybe even the time its taking me to deal with all this? I'm going to guess that if these kids are taking joyrides these families might not be well off to cover these costs. Part of me feels a real ick about making someone's life difficult but also these kids kind of ruined my holidays and why should I have to incur this expense for just being in the wrong place at the wrong time?

"This is in Indiana.

I just wrapped up a home renovation project that has spanned over 2 years total after all the back and forth, issues with various parts of the project, and attempted remediation of said parts of the project. This was a project that included laying new flooring through a large portion of the house, taking down old wallpaper, paint prep and paint, a new slider door and a new picture window, some mansory work to fit a new oven, electrical/new lighting, some drywall work, new baseboards etc. Kind of a general renovation to update some things.

1. Paint - The first painter that came in did an awful job. Very sloppy prep work, and even sloppier painting. They had gotten paint all over our stained crown molding, even though they masked everything. Im not kidding you, there was not a piece of crown molding they didn't get paint on. Missed corners and edges, sloppy brushwork on the ceiling especially. They came in and cleaned up the crown and tried their best to fix the missed areas of paint or sloppy work. In the end it was still not great. A big thing was our contract stated that they would provide any drywall work needed to have the walls finished to paint-ready. They did none of that and you can see the old cracked plaster under fresh paint. I feel they skipped this step. I brought it to their attention and all they did was go back over it again with a different painting company. I am not satisfied with the result and I feel they did not complete the work as contracted. My expectation was they would sand/get rid of any old flaking paint under the wallpaper they removed, fix any cracks or nail holes, and have a nice surface to put fresh paint on. They did virtually no prep work before priming and painting
2. Flooring - We started a bathroom remodel in September with another company and had to pause to remediate some water and mold issues. The remediation company said without a shadow of a doubt the subcontractor would have seen the water damage and wet subfloor. We were not notified and the underlayment and vinyl flooring was put down anyway. I contacted them to remedy the situation - requesting that they come take up the flooring and now damaged underlayment and then reinstall once remediation was completed. They originally said they wouldnt and then agreed to do so after I supplied some proof that the subflooring was indeed water damaged at the time of installation. They just came back this week to finish and of course, there's issues. Some of the vinyl planks aren't locked in properly and I can tell they reused some of the vinyl flooring they took up even though the underlayment it was on top of was very water-damaged. They missed a small piece of baseboard as well.

I'm at my wits end. At this point I want some money back that I paid for this project. Its cost me time, money, it extended our bathroom remodel by 5 weeks because we had to remediate before we could continue, emotional distress, potential health issues with the water/mold under the flooring they installed.

"I have Lupus, treatment-resistant depression, and PTSD. My cat used to help me through these issues but unfortunately, she passed away this spring. Things have been really difficult without her. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I believe I could benefit from an emotional support animal. 

This summer I’m moving into the triplex I will be living in until I finish getting my degree. I’ve already signed my lease. I know how much an ESA would benefit me, however, the triplex’s landlord has a strict “no pet policy.” From what I’ve gathered, it seems Oklahoma law only works around these kinds of policies for the service dogs of people with physical disabilities. 

Here’s the grey area: Studies show that 80-90% of Lupus patients have some type of neuropsychiatric manifestation (the most common being depression). This means that my need for an emotional support animal can be attributed to a physical disability. My reason for wanting an emotional support cat is the same as someone who wants an emotional support dog: I have a disability. 


With all of that in mind, what is the likelihood I could get around my landlord’s “no pet policy” with an ESA?",ESA and “No pet policy”,18n4skw,1703105250.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18n4skw/esa_and_no_pet_policy/,

TLTR: I’m just wondering if there are any laws protecting consumers post sales. If a company changes the functionality of software that inhibits and/or renders the products ability to be used effectively.

Once trial membership ran dry the “Freestyle ride “ that the computer function (you have to have a tablet/phone to access metrics) uses to display just current progress without participating in a class has been changed to aggressively market their membership/classes to the point that it seriously inhibits being able to view the metrics.

"Hi, thank you in advance for any direction.

My wife and I previously lived with each other near Knoxville, Tennessee. Married here as well. We stopped living with each other with the intention of getting a divorce in early November of last year. We had intended to pursue an “agreed” divorce, uncontested/no-contest divorce, whatever it may be referred to. I am prepared to fill the forms out, drive back to Tennessee (when we split I changed states) and have them notarized.

I have one small problem that makes me question if this is possible now. 

Shortly after our split, she became pregnant with another man’s child. I believe the child was conceived in December of last year. The forms I’m viewing on a government site indicate that we would each need legal representation if any kids are involved. Neither of us have real property, pension or retirement plans, own a business, etc. But the now-born child of another man seems like it may be problematic.

Are we still eligible to file an agreed divorce?

"**Location**: California

**My question**: I want to get an independent 3rd party to come to and inspect some failed plumbing work from a prior company (using a drain camera) that is under warranty and write me a report on the actual problem. If I do this, will this invalidate my warranty in any way? The bad plumber is shady with horrific Yelp reviews and I am sure he gets this a ton, so probably knows the ins and outs of the system far better than me, putting me on shaky ground when trying to advocate for myself.

**Background**

7 months ago we had some major plumbing work done to fix a problem where roots were penetrating one of our sewage lines. Very expensive, very painful, but problem [solved.](https://solved.At) The plumbing company gave us a 1-year warranty against leaks and breakage.

Last weekend the toilet stopped working, so I snaked it and within 3'-4' I pulled more roots out. This is the exact area of the repair in question, clearly something has failed. I called the plumbing company immediately.

\[insert lots of shady shit this plumber tried to pull during this discussion, not relevant here but I have contemporaneous notes about it\]

The plumber is amazingly(!) unable to get his camera into the area of the problem, even though his team was able to get a camera into that spot 7 months ago to verify the fix, and insists this is a NEW problem and unrelated to the work they did. He also insists that the only option is to 'blow it up and dig down and fix this new problem' and for me to pay for that. Shady AF on top of the prior mentioned Shadiness. I am out of trust now and no work will happen until I see the problem with my own eyes.

Our last contact was me saying ***'Well, get a camera that can get us eyes on this, nothing is being blown up until I can see what the problem is.""*** This got heated and he stormed off with a promise to return, but he has ghosted.

It's pretty clear to me, that he wants to gish gallop, gaslight, and confuse this situation until I give up and either go away or pay him to do the work.

"Do I have to pay a PayPal money request that I didn't agree to?

I received a payment request from a non-profit for photography services that was hired for our annual end-of-year event. I was on the board but needed to step down after moving and dealing with heart issues from stress. Every year we'd hire photographers that were voted on by the board. Any of us would suggest a photographer and the board would decide. I guess they're upset that I stepped down after acquiring the alcohol sponsor and replacing old posters that were in poor condition. We agreed to bring in two photographers, one of whom I suggested. The organization hired him last year as well. All services hired for the organization are paid for by the organization. Or supposed to be. There hasn't been anything in our bylaws stating that a board member is required to pay out of pocket. I just ordered new posters since we needed new posters and it was crunch time. I never agreed to pay out of pocket for one of the photographers. What should I do about this PayPal request? I rarely use PayPal. I'm glad I stepped down, the high turnover rate and in-house drama is very unprofessional and stressful. I ended up on anxiety medicine, a heart monitor, and having both anxiety &amp; panic attacks since serving on the board.

"Hello

I live in California. I moved out from an old rental place a little over a month ago. Recently my landlord sent me their itemized receipt for my security deposit, taking over half of it for various cleaning fees that they said my professional cleaner missed. (It was written into the lease I had to have the house deep cleaned before move out, which I did, and sent them the receipt for).

When I reached out to them to ask about all the charges they informed me that the charges were “estimates” and that they had not actually been billed by their cleaning vendor as of the 21 day mark they’re legally required to return my security deposit by.

They told me once they’re done with the various things they claimed needed to be cleaned they will send me a “revised statement”

Can they legally keep my security deposit based on estimates without actually having done any of the work?

"I'm in Alabama but traveled to FL to get this camper my partner and I really wanted. All seemed fine until they started trying to process my debit card as a credit card, and it kept getting denied. The salesman ran it multiple times at a few different amounts, thinking it was a limit issue. However, one of those transactions for $1500 actually ended up going through. It came out of my account, as I thought to look once we got back home.

I contact the company, and they say they checked their records and didn't see the transaction. So I contact my bank and inform them, and they give me a temporary credit while they look into the matter. In that time, the transaction actually posts to the dealership, but they weren't looking for it, it just hit their account a few days after I called. Eventually, my bank contacts the dealership and inquires as to the issue. The dealership says they don't have the money, they already checked, so my bank denies the claim. Unfortunately, if the dealership had looked or expanded their search at this point, I'd have my $$$ and wouldn't be here on reddit.

So after a ton of back and forth, I call the dealership and they finally say ""oh yeah, we found that transaction, but after we found it, we disputed it with our card processing firm, and when the bank called, since the card processing firm was involved, we disputed the bank's dispute."" I've been on the phone with our bank and the dealership back and forth for months. The bank won't talk to the dealership directly b/c it involves my personal account info, so I end up being a messenger for both sides saying they don't have the funds anymore. Eventually, the dealership stopped talking to me and told me to contact the card processing firm, who won't even return my calls.

So. That's where we stand. I have 4 parties essentially, 3 of which claim to not have the money (myself included) and one that won't even answer the phone. I've worked really hard to get nowhere, and I can't prove to my bank that a 3rd party doesn't have a specific transaction, and I can't get my bank to talk to the 3rd party, and the 3rd party won't even talk to me anymore. I'm so frustrated. I can't seem to get anywhere with anyone, so I started the process of contacting an attorney, but I don't know exactly if its going to be worth it (will my fees be higher than what I recover).

My CA lease agreement states the following:

""The Property is a unit in a multifamily residence (for example, an apartment, condominium, tenancy-in-common, in-law suite, duplex, or multiplex) (Building) located at [ADDRESS]. The Property includes all appliances, fixtures, and equipment installed on the Property as of the Start Date (as defined below), including the following: Refrigerator; Oven/Range; Microwave; Dishwasher; Clothes washer; Clothes dryer; Garbage Disposal; Electric ; Range Hood.""

AND

“Landlord will maintain the Property in good order and repair Building common areas. Landlord will be responsible for, and will pay for, repairing appliances”

But also states:

""Maintenance and repair of the all appliances, including A/C , are responsibility of the tenant""

If it adds color, this lease is through Zillow, and the line about tenant being responsible for repair of appliances looks like it was added in by the landlord (not a very sophisticated party, just a one-off guy) on top of the boilerplate language from Zillow's lease.

My washer/dryer unit is malfunctioning, and I am 100% certain that it is a system malfunction and not something I broke (if it was, I would not be asking). I asked my landlord if he knew how to fix it, and he pointed me to the lease which said I was responsible for all repairs. But part of my rental property explicitly includes the appliances. So how exactly does the responsibility work legally? Because as far as I understand, if the appliances are just provided ""for convenience"", then it would be my responsibility, but if I am paying for them to work as part of my lease, is it likely to be found as my responsibility if I take him to small claims court if he tries to put this expensive repair or replacement on me? Or, is the more likely solution that I would just pay a lower rent since this appliance is no longer part of the property?

As part of our court order, my daughter’s dad has to pay 1/2 of extracurricular activities.

3 Non Sponsored activities such as horseback riding.

"I had a Lowe’s delivery of a washer/drier that was contracted out to Spirit Logistics. They knocked holes in my walls and damaged the flooring on all 3 levels of my house and the stairs (they came in through the garage/basement). This was after they tried to get me to pay cash for something I had already paid Lowes for (haul away). I was advised by the store to get an estimate for repairs and Spirit would send their own contractor to do an estimate and they would likely go with/cut a check for the less expensive option. My contractor said that since I have engineered wood, the whole floor would have to be taken up, and not just replace the damaged planks. This caused the estimate to be ~$20k.

"We just had our first 1/2 hour phone call with the attorney who created a trust for our parents. He explained the next steps to process the estate transfer to the beneficiaries. 

The entire estate, apart from their home and 2 small retirement accounts, is in an irrevocable trust with 4 or 5 mutual fund accounts. The estate is not being contested in any way by any of the beneficiaries.

He explained that those accounts will have to be re-registered, and a final tax individual return and estate tax returns filed, notices put in local papers, and a property valuation done. That was the extent of the work to be done as he explained it.

At the end of the call, when asked, he said his fee is 1% of the gross assets of the entire estate as his fee for settlement. This amounts to over $30,000.

"Hi everyone! I need some advice. 

My mom passed away in Dec. 2021. Afterwards, we found out she was still collecting child support for my adult sister who is now 31 from a man my sister had never met or heard of. The child support still due is about 20k. I opened her estate in Aug. 2022 and during that time, my lawyer said that I'd A. either have to get another lawyer to take the case to court as she was inexperienced in that area or B. Go to juvenile court and get the case transferred to my sister. She said he pays so infrequently that it wouldnt be worth it and that the state is going to take a portion for Medicade so we'd only get about 16k in the end. I closed the estate in July 2023. And forgot all about the child support. 

Now that I'm on break I figured I'd inquire with the juvenile court system. The clerk told me it would have to go through probate! Great, back to square one. I'm hesitant to get a lawyer because this man pays infrequently, so juggling with would it be worth it to only possibly get 1k a year but at the same time, that money they're collecting is just going to sit there and I'll be damned if this state gets it after it goes unclaimed for years.

"This summer, the air conditioner in the apartment we lived was kept breaking. After asking around, I found that more than 20 people in the building had the same problem. We called maintenance technician three times. First time, we ask the maintenance man in the building, but he couldn't fix it. Then, I found a technician outside and he said there was a problem with the pipes in the building, which would accumulate air and cause the air conditioner to not work. Then we discovered that the air conditioner in many resident’s condo was working normally after releasing the accumulated air for the same reason. Because of this situation, I concluded that it needed to be checked by the building. After reporting to the management office to no avail, the department said that the air conditioning inside the apartment was the individual responsibility of the residents. But if the pipes are broken, the apartment building is responsible for inspection. So we can only take the form of protest, we jointly signed a protest signature on the website change.org. Then we collected about 120 signatures, but the management office now says that there are only 30 associated apartments, saying that the signature number we had on the website was misleading. However, it is normal that not only the apartment owners but also family members signed the signatures(which the management don’t care). As the leader, I sent an email to the condo management office. The management office said they would find someone to check it, and now the management replied to me via email saying that they had someone check it and there was nothing wrong with the air conditioner.

"I'm seeking feedback on a case of mine that was recently dismissed. As the plaintiff, I struggled to persuade the judge with a preponderance of evidence regarding a material defect not disclosed by the seller in our home purchase. Specifically, the HVAC furnace's heat exchanger had a crack which was inadequately repaired. I'm curious about how I could have better presented my case and whether appealing from the magistrate to the district court is advisable. This case is in North Carolina. Here are the key details:  
  
**Facts:**  
  
***Purchase Date:*** Bought the home in November 2022.

  
***Due Diligence:*** Conducted a home inspection and addressed discovered items.

  
***Discovery of Defect***: Moved in December 2022. A blown fuse led to discovering a crack in the heat exchanger.

  
***Repair Attempt:*** Found an attempt to repair the crack with low-temperature silicone.

  
***Seller's Response:*** Raised the issue with the prior owner/seller, who denied knowledge, suggesting the previous owner might be responsible.

  
**Case Argument:**  
  
***Failure to Disclose:*** Argued that the use of silicone sealants, which don't bond effectively with metal alloys (like heat exchangers) and aren't durable beyond 500 degrees Fahrenheit (while the furnace often reaches 1000 degrees), indicates a temporary fix.

  
***Seller's Background:*** The seller is a general contractor. Argued that he likely made the repair himself and failed to disclose it. During questioning, he claimed not to have had any work done on the HVAC system since his purchase and subsequent considerable renovation of the home.

  
**Evidence:**  
  
***Service Report:*** From the HVAC company, showing the crack in the heat exchanger and the use of low-temp silicone.

  
***Professional Opinion:*** Conversation with the HVAC company confirmed that such a sealant wouldn't be durable for nearly five years.

  
Given these facts and the evidence provided, what could I have done differently in presenting my case?

"Before you read this, I know how it sounds written out but I can guarantee that my father had every intention of leaving me with at least half of his assets. I know that if it came down to it I have people that would vouch for that fact so it would be appreciated if you work with that assumption as well.

This is in CA

To start my father passed away 2 years ago. Leading up to his death he would openly talk about what his plans were for his assets after his death. He wasn’t talking about it because he was assuming he’d die as soon as he did, he was under the assumption (as we all were) that he had a couple decades left. He spoke about it because one of the assets that he had assumed would be his, a condo, belonged to his parents who everyone assumed only had a couple years left (which is undoubtedly true since they were in their mid 90s and one recently passed).

On top of the condo he assumed he would be getting, he also already had one condo. His plans were for my older brother to keep the condo he already owned and for me to get the condo he would inherit from his parents. The reasoning behind this is that my brother had trashed the condo my dad already owned quite badly (broken doors, holes in walls, etc…) so it was fair that he got the one that he fucked up while I got the one that was in a good state.

The issue with this is that my grandparents already helped him quite a bit more than they thought they would need to, especially later in life. This is just due to unfortunate circumstances that aren’t important. But because of this my aunt is likely going to be getting the condo since my dad was already given so much. This was something my brother and I found out after my dad passed, he was also unaware of this.

My main problem is that my brother’s name was added onto the condo that my dad already had ownership of shortly before his death. When my father died I believe that the condo became my brother’s. We ended up needing to sell the condo for reasons that aren’t important here. But it was sold for about 200k the assumption of everybody was that half was my brother’s and half was mine. This is also what my brother said multiple times. After more consideration we came to the conclusion that it should be split 3 ways, my brother, my mother, and I. This was now the new agreement.

I haven’t seen a dime of that money and it’s been about 1.5 years. I’ve been putting off going after the money more aggressively because 1) he keeps saying he’ll give it soon until a new reason pops up that he can’t and 2) I don’t know where I stand legally in regards to rights to the money. 

Since the condo was sold my brother has purchased a brand new Toyota RAV4, a multi week vacation in Hawaii where he also payed for his wife and friends, and a nearly month long vacation to Costa Rica. He does not make new car/long vacation kind of money. I am extremely frustrated to say the least.",I believe that my brother is keeping almost 100k of my money.

"Hey All,

A family member was working in MA (we live out of state), in a warehouse where at the end of the day, they found a forgotten wallet with an ID in it that was from my families city. My family and I live in a major city where MULTIPLE time's we have found wallets, phones, etc, where we look at a card or the phone's emergency contact info and call them and meet with them later. Because the ID was in our city, out of state more than an hour away, my family member decided to take the wallet home and contact the person themself to get in touch with them.

My family member brought the wallet back home with them, and I was meant to come home and help them contact the woman in english and let her know we have her wallet and can meet her to give it back, but I stalled for the next morning. There was NO cash or anything in the wallet, and we did not touch or take anything! We used her ID to search her online.

I feel awful, because I feel like if I sent a message the night before, the morning after would not have happened.

The next morning, police showed up at my family's job, checked the cameras, and saw them picking up the wallet and taking it. Of course this looks awful, and my family's excuse that they were going to call the woman themself does not sound promising at all to the police. Of course I asked why they didn't just give it to the manager or leave it at work, but they just weren't thinking that anything could happen like being accused of robbing them. We never had a problem before contacting the people ourselves so unfortunately they didn't think anything of it when they just grabbed it and took it home.

My family member was not arrested, and due to anxiety and a language barrier they are unable to clearly to tell me what exactly happened with the police.

My family member received a ""Notice Of Magistrate's Hearing on Complaint Application"", and the ""Police Dept/Applicant"" only named the county's police, not the woman.

This incident took place back in early September, we did not receive this notice until mid-November.

I have a few clarifying questions because NONE of my household have ever been involved with the police, so much that none of us have even gotten pulled over before. (Except for a few red light camera's though)

Did the woman go file a complaint months later or because her name isn't under ""applicant"" did the police department decide to press charges against my family? Because this is a ""hearing"" at a ""trial court"" are they eligible for an attorney to be provided to them from the court? If this is not the case, should we be looking into free legal aid in our state or the state where the court is taking place?

Edit: I'm also wondering how the woman got the police to show up? I'm not how other places are, but our major city we grew up in.. they do NOT care about these types of calls. If someone where I lived called the police to say they forgot their wallet somewhere, they would tell us to take it to small claims court. I believe where my family works is in a small predominantly white town, maybe they have more time to take more calls like that?","Undocumented Family Member Received ""Notice of Magistrate's hearing on Complaint Application"" to trial court for a hearing for ""Larceny Under $1200"" in Massachusettes, is this a risk of deportation?",18n1bm9,1703096403.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18n1bm9/undocumented_family_member_received_notice_of/,

"TLDR; Water leak was reported to landlord. The leak was fixed within a couple days but the company tore up the floor boards to dry the floor and never repaired it. It’s been a month and a half.

We had a water leak that we didn’t know about until the light fixtures in the apartment below us started dripping. We did a written request for repair in the tenant portal and the leak was fixed within a couple days.

The problem is that they ripped up all the kitchen floorboard to check for water saturation (which was at 100%) and then spent a week and a half drying it. After it was dry they said they’d come back to fix the floor within a few days. Over a month has passed. I went down to the office and asked about it a week and a half ago and she apparently didn’t realize they hadn’t finished the work. She said she would contact them and I just haven’t heard anything from her since.

In the initial written notice/repair request of the damage I followed up a couple days later addressing the floor damage and asking when it will be repaired and was not given any specific answer. So technically the apartment has known about the floor damage for about a month and a half now (they just thought the company had taken care of it I guess, idk).

"I vacated my apartment on August 5 and my lease had a 60 day clause for returning the deposit.  

I never received an itemized statement of security deposit deductions.  I finally received a security deposit refund check yesterday, well beyond the 60 day window.  

The only deductions were for my final utility bills.  I don’t dispute that I owe the utilities and the main reason I didn’t pay them was because I lost access to the resident portal when I moved out and figured they’d be deducted from my deposit anyway.  My understanding of Colorado law is that the refund check and itemized statement must be sent out with 30 days, unless your lease stipulates 60 days.  If this does not happen, the landlord relinquishes the right to deduct anything from the security deposit.  

I’ll admit that the main reason I want to try to fight this on a technicality is that I had a terrible experience renting from this company and I’d like to stick it to them in the end just one time.

"hello, im just going to get right into it

my step sister who is 17 years old, turning 18 in 4 days, is talking to one of her teachers/counselors outside of school and having an inappropriate relationship with him 

shes told me she stays after school to be with him, that he has 3 phones, that they text and he asks for pictures of her, that theyve kissed, abunch of inappropriate stuff. they haven’t had sex and i suspect because hes waiting for her to turn 18

i have no idea what to do. should i go to the school, go to the police? im scared nobody will do anything because shes almost 18, but even at 18 this relationship is inappropriate because hes in a position of power

ive gone to the schools website and looked at some of the teachers/counselors and none of them match his description, on one hand i dont put it past her to make something like this up to seem cool, but i am concerned shes not making it up

if i knew the exact teacher it was i would go to the school, but i dont. im scared of the school/police not taking me seriously 

i dont want to tell her mom (my stepmom) because they have a very weird relationship and i know her mom would just get HER in trouble instead of protecting her. going to her mom would be my last resort

i really need advice on what to do and how to protect her. she doesn’t care when i try to be serious and say this relationship is not right

if anyone knows any other subs i could post this on for help that would be really great too. i dont know if this is a good sub i know its not exactly legal stuff but it could be if he got in trouble. idk. thank u so much",sister having inappropriate relationship with teacher,18n0fle,1703094268.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18n0fle/sister_having_inappropriate_relationship_with/,

"My uncle used to be my grandmother’s DPOA. He started being on a power trip and started doing several shady things so she removed him and put my mother and myself.

Needless to say he was pissed and has been extremely difficult.

My aunt passed without children or a will so her affairs went to probate. He became an heir. He refused to agree to anything with her estate dragging it out over 5 years until finally a judge settled it.

My aunt was on the deed to my grandmother’s house. We are trying to sell my grandmother’s house and since he is an heir of my aunt’s affairs, he has to agree to sell. He refuses. 

We are being told by our attorney that since he refuses her house will be “sold on the courtroom steps” meaning it goes for auction to the highest bidder. We had it under contract (not knowing my aunt was on the deed) for $125k, but could be sold for as little as $10.

"Our entire building’s AC &amp; heating went out in July. In June, our landlord announced “they’re currently working with contractors to replace the entire HVAC system” (because prior to July, I’d say 60% of the building didn’t have AC/Heat for 3+ years, despite an HVAC system being included in the apartment and in our rent) 

Work only “started” on it 2 weeks ago and all of a sudden, they’re waiting on a small part due to supply chain issues and now they don’t have a timeframe when the new HVAC system will be fully replaced and operational. I say this because my father is a building manager for 20+ years, with a background in HVAC and knows many HVAC contractors in our area. He says it’s BS because if they’ve been working with contractors for the last 6 months.. they would’ve known they needed the part in question wayyyyy early on. The HVAC contractors my dad knows even say “yeah something weirds going on” 

It’s also worth noting that our landlord was indicted on more than 100 criminal charges including bribery, theft, tampering with records and fraud (in regards to all the residential buildings he owns, including my apartment building) by the county and state several years ago and currently is on probation.

So I got sick of their obvious lying about the new HVAC system, that I gave them notice I’ll be putting my rent in an escrow in 30 days. As expected, they kinda got pissed - they even had their lawyer email me a letter saying I have no right to do so, etc etc. - which I interpreted as a scare tactic. 

They are providing heat sources for tenants (space heaters, heat pumps, etc). Prior to my notice of escrow, I filed a complaint with the city as well and the city tells me “they’re working with them” 

My question is, can I (&amp; should I) still go through with putting my rent in an escrow? I mean it’s obvious they’re not getting it complete anytime soon. My main goal is to just get out of the lease. I’m not sure if my landlord being on probation has any pull towards my favor.

"I am due to attend a probation meeting on Friday, where I am expecting due to the context, I will be let go. There is a lot more to it.

At the back end of November, I made a grievance against a manager, which then took 2 weeks to begin the complaint process. After investigation was completed, I received a phone call and a letter stating a probation meeting has been set up and I’ve been suspended with full pay, due to allegations that could result in termination of my employment. 

Regarding this, all of the allegations they have presented to me are unfounded spin-offs of the truth, re-imagining the exact complaints I made about my manager, of which they will have no evidence to support. 

The really fishy thing is, my probation period ended on the 2nd of December, which I have in writing. I also have in writing from the individual conducting my review, on the 15th of December, that because of the grievance my probation would be reviewed in due course, but my probation had already ended almost two weeks before this email…

Regarding how my probation period went, I’ve received nothing but praise from the company, in the first 2 probation meetings I had being told I could go to the very top if I wanted to, that I’m very confident etc. My initial probation period was extended to January due to sickness, however the manager I complained about was so content with my progress that he brought it forward to the 2nd of December. No meetings have been held with me prior to this suspension and possible sacking that they aren’t happy with my progress, in fact putting me through expensive courses which tells that they see a future with me.

Illegal immigrants would come to our offices and bring in fake documents in which, we were told to fill out applicants and I-9s for them, falsifying information.

Me and other recruiters not wanting to lose our jobs if we did not comply, we would then send out the illegal immigrants to different companies, who are also aware that our agency hires illegal immigrants and sends them out to them as borderline cheap labor to be exploited.

"Here’s the run down, I am from Michigan and I had tried to sell my lump sum annuity payment of 265k in 2056 (essentially a retirement plan) something I had gotten because I was abused as kid.. 
long story short my wife has cancer and I’ve almost gone bankrupt paying medical bills and treatments. I’ve been working 2 jobs sixteen hours a day for 6 months just to keep the lights on. In July I contacted jg Wentworth to sell my payment because we were struggling, they sent me 3 grand upfront as an advance before the end of August court date and during court the judge got very angry with jg Wentworth and told them it wasn’t a fair deal and said she couldn’t approve the sale for 15,000 dollars. And my wife and I were left hanging. Now at that point other companies started contacting me because they knew it was for sale. And I was told that I’m absolved of paying back the 3 grand they advanced me. 

So I continue with two jobs and damn near killing myself trying to keep the lights on. A few weeks after the first court date we end up trying to sell the annuity again to the same company for 750 dollars more ( I know they real broke the bank on their new offer and dug deep on that one) October 16th we go to court and the judge almost turns it down again when I tell her why I’m selling it. I explain it’s for my wife’s medical bills and if it means taking care of her and making sure she’s ok I would shovel shit with a spoon to not lose her. And she says against her best judgment she was going to approve the sale and I was very concerned about time of funding. We agreed in court that they would fund me before the week was over. Well they didn’t. Actually they waited an entire month.

 In that time frame my wife and I were struggling and I actually made five grand at a casino(I know selfish and irresponsible) but it was a miracle that I needed. and I was able to make all my payments in time and get on track. So I told them I needed time to think about signing the final document. And I needed a month to see if I can get back on track and keep our retirement. 

On December 7th I was served with a ucc filing from the state of Michigan saying I owe them(jg wentworth) 5,000 dollars etc and threatening emails and calls with notary’s at my door saying if I don’t sign right now they’re going to charge interest and renew it every 5 years until the payment 2056. And then I will have nothing. So; my first question is are they legally able to charge me for 5,000? Because I thought I was off the hook for the three grand after it was shot down in court back in August.

Am I only only on the hook for two grand? What happens if I tell them I’m not signing shit? What are my options moving forward as my wife and I are moving forward? I’ve called a few law firms near me and been told they don’t deal in ucc and one guy wanted 800 for a consultation. I’d rather not pay the lawyer but I have until Saturday to make up my mind.

Quick context:  My mother (64) divorced my father over 20 years ago.  He cheated, racked up debt, and ran off.  He has been in trouble with the law for a long time, in and out of prison.  He was not a good husband or father.  They have not spoken nor been associated since the divorce, but my mother and I learned recently that he had moved back to her county a few years ago.  She still has his last name, but absolutely no contact. (to emphasize that)

She received the following voicemail today, with identifying information noted in brackets:

&gt;Yes, this message is intended for \[Mother's Name\], \[DOB\].  My name is \[Name\] with an attorney's office and we have a case that's being filed in \[County\] against a \[Father's Name\], \[DOB\], and a \[Mother's Name\].  Case #\[6 digits\].  My name is \[Name\]. I'm the gentleman handling this case, so please give me a phone call and I will explain to you what's going on.  My number is \[#833 area code\], extension \[#\].  Refer to case number docket number \[#\].  Thank you.

A few notes:

* the names and DOBs are correct, though I know these are easy to find online
* the person's name can be found online, but what I find says he is a public defender in a different county on the other side of the state
* the case number doesn't pull anything up in her county's online judicial public index, nor does searching their last name show anything new (same results for the county the public defender works in)

Neither of us can think of a reason for her to be associated in any case with him, other than missing child support from many years ago.  (I'm mid 30s now)  But she would have to be the one to initiate that, yes?  She is coming over Friday for Christmas, so I told her I would post to Reddit first, and if we did call back that I would lead the phone call.

"I was driving to my office yesterday when I saw a tow truck coming from the opposite side started to drift into my lane. I tried honking and literally stopped on the road, but of no help. The truck did not stop and eventually hit me from the front. 

I know it’s an accident and I was planning to go through the normal procedure of sharing insurance details and calling the cops to make a report. I was a bit relieved as the tow truck had cameras and can prove he was at fault. However, when the cops arrived, they refused to make a report even though I told them several times to at least make a report and i will let the insurance handle the case. But they were too adamant on not making the report, stating NJ is 50-50 state and no matter who was at fault, both the insurance have to pay 50-50 for the losses. I agreed to that and asked for a report nevertheless, but they didn’t make a report of the accident. Rather one of the cops suggested me that the tow company is a multi million company and you should go to them and they will fix it (the owner called me and said he will fix my car and was asking me to get it towed at their facilities).

I felt the things to be a bit shady and told I will decide which way to go once I get home. Do you guys think there was some corruption involved between the company and the cops. I am not sure what to do anymore? The insurance company was asking for the police report and now it seems my case is not that strong as I don’t have a proof of me not being at fault (except the camera footage that the tow truck has).",A tow truck hit me and the cops refused to write a report of the accident.

My brother in law was convicted on two separate occasions for possession of child pornography, and will be out of prison soon.  My spouse doesn't like to talk about it and has avoided the discussion as much as possible, but has agreed that BIL should not be around our young child.  Their parents and other siblings are adamant that BIL was framed, is innocent, and would never do such a thing.  When I have brought this up in the past, I was overwhelmingly met with ""oh you don't actually believe he could do that, do you?  He was obviously framed/set up/police had to meet their quota/whatever other bullshit we can come up with!""  MIL has a habit of going behind my back when it comes to my child and doing things she thinks are ""better for the kid"", even if I've asked her not to, then keeping the truth from me.  She has encouraged my child before to keep secrets from me about little rules she breaks to gain my child's favor, such as giving candy when asked not to then saying ""it's our little secret"".  For this reason I am concerned that one day she will be watching our child while I'm away and sneak my BIL over without asking or telling me.  No amount of reasoning will convince her that her son could have done anything wrong, and in her eyes, he deserves to be welcomed back into the family with open arms and to have a relationship with my child.

Legally, is there anything I can do when BIL gets out to prevent him from interacting with my child, or do I have to wait until MIL's already gone behind my back?  What should I legally do to prepare for this possibility?

I had no pain and they didn’t do any x rays. since my insurance was ending soon, they were more than happy to schedule 7 in one day. i was nervous about my insurance expiring, and having so many unfilled cavities i didn’t get a second opinion. the whole experience was really uncomfortable and painful, and i wanted to wait to until i was better on the side of my mouth they worked on before doing the other side. after two months of still having pain in the teeth they filled, i payed out of pocket for a follow up to explain i had pain and sensitivity- I couldn’t (still cant) chew on that side of my mouth. the doc looked at me for like 15-20 seconds, and the assistant came in with some sensitive tooth toothpaste and questioned when i would be coming in for the remaining cavities.i responded “when i can comfortably eat on the other side of my mouth”??? every other question was answered with “i don’t know”. 5 months later, i found a new dentist to follow up on the remaining 7 cavities, also because i didn’t want to go back there. you guessed it- i have no cavities. to make everything worse, one of my teeth have died due to a failed deep filling they did right on my nerve. so now i have to have a root canal. from a filling i probably didn’t need. unfortunately I trusted them and didn’t think that mentioning my insurance ending the same month would incentivize them to convince me to agree to unnecessary treatment. luckily i didn’t have all 14 done, but now i will have to deal with these holes in my teeth for the rest of my life.

- froze with all 3 credit bureaus

Dear Employee,

I have worked to accommodate you during the period when remote work was necessary due to your allergies and the unfortunate incident with your vehicle.

I acknowledge that despite your efforts, managing your allergies while receiving treatments has still presented challenges. However, with the relocation of Sophie, I hope this will significantly alleviate the issues you've been facing.

Effective January 2, 2024, I request you return to the office on a full-time basis. Your physical presence will greatly enhance the collaborative efforts and efficiency required for the successful execution of your role. 

I look forward to welcoming you back to the office and continuing our work together.

Me: 
Hi Boss, 
 
I appreciate you relocating Sophie but that makes me feel really guilty, I won’t lie. She has been there for so long and is a support animal for everyone at Earl’s Place. 
 
After seeing the allergist on Tuesday she recommended that I start a new drug called Tezepelumab. Getting my cat allergy alleviated would be beneficial for us as well as me personally because I still haven't seen my grandmother since.
 
I don't know the timeline of you relocating Sophie but my allergist seems to be very hopeful that this medication could work for me. It's still in experimental phases with cat immunotherapy but has proved to work better than regular allergy shots. I am starting this treatment next week over a 7-week period while being exposed to the allergen once weekly. 
 

Again, I know how important Sophie is to everyone and would really like to make this work. Would you be willing to wait until the 7 week period?
 
If this works, I would have to drop back down to being a part time employee which would reduce my hours. 
 
All of this is very new for the both of us. If you have any further questions I can see if my allergist can speak to you.
 
Let me know what you think of this plan.
 
Thanks
 
Date: 12/11/2023 

New letter: 

Dear Employee,

Thank you for sharing your update regarding your allergy treatment. I genuinely hope that the new medication proves effective for you and that you can reconnect with your grandmother soon. 
 
I appreciate your request to wait for seven weeks during your treatment. However, the position requires a full-time commitment, and transitioning to part-time work wouldn't align with our needs, even if the treatment were successful.
 
Given this, I regret to inform you that we're unable to accommodate a part-time arrangement.  As a result, continuing employment in your current role is not feasible under these circumstances. We will continue your employment through December 29, 2023.
 
I'm grateful for your efforts. Please plan to return the keys and any other items that may belong to CCH by December 29.

"The job I work at has a call in policy that some us are starting to wonder if is even legal? If we call in we accrue what is called “manageable time.” “Manageable time” is essentially the same as a point based system used widely by other companies where it could be 6 months or a year after that call in before the time being held against you will fall off on a rotating calendar. Now while we are aware that a general call in using vacation just because you didn’t wanna come in would easily and acceptably fall under this policy, this is the first job I’ve worked where calling in sick falls under the same policy, even with proof of a doctors note saying you cannot be at work. Even recently I was told by our on site medical if I provided a positive flu test and wanted to go home it would be held against me and I would accrue manageable time. Our companies managable time policy contributes to their disciplinary action if you are to accrue 40 hours(5 days) or more time. With that being said if someone were to be out for 5 days sick with a doctors note and then come back with 40 hours accrued they would then get a warning that they have reached their max allowed time and in many cases in the next call in would result in their disciplinary action that withholds raises and places you on a probationary period for a year. I’m my personal experience I’ve accrued 24 hours of manageable time after presenting a doctor’s note saying I could not be at work. In this same calendar year I also accrued 8 hours for calling when my daughter was born. At this point a lot of us are just wondering about the legality of this policy as far as sick time being federally mandated and us essentially being punished if we use it.

\- Tried to switch into 4 wheel again, CV axle snaps.

  
I start digging around, 5” RC lift has torsion bars extended to 7” to fit 37s. I invest in a BDS suspension to drop the front diff and level out that CV axle because I need 4 wheel. I figure to run a Carfax report just to see what it looks like.

"Unfortunately, both my grandparents passed away this year. They were in their 90's, in a retirement home in California. Grandmother had Alzheimer's, Grandfather was blind with all sorts of health problems, at their age and all that they were going through the deaths weren't unexpected but of course you still have that shock. Ultimately I'm just grateful to have had them in my life this long.

Originally, my father was named executor of their will(s) but never received any documentation. (or at least we can't find it...he was in denial about their mortality) He passed about 7 years ago and my aunt became the executor. My aunt ignored a few requests for copies of the will. We were told by them and my aunt that their home was to be sold to pay for the retirement home monthly fees. I asked my aunt to keep me in the loop as I might want to buy the home. That never happened and she started renting it out to someone. As far as I can tell, the home and some stuff in storage is all that was left. The home was never sold but last year my aunt was suddenly asking us for help with making the monthly payments. When we asked about selling the home as was planned, she suddenly said ""Never mind, I moved some money around, we're ok."" She also ignored another request for a copy of the will. Started to sound sketch but we didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

During my last visit with my grandfather, he mentioned he asked my aunt to remove my uncle from the will (substance abuse - didn't want to enable him) and said it would just be us and my aunt left. I asked him to ask my aunt to send us a copy of the will and he agreed. That never happened. That Christmas, I asked my grandfather about some specific leftover keepsakes and he said ""they're yours"" and told me to ask my Aunt for them. Out of the 40 or so that she had, her response was ""oh sure, I'll take you to the storage and let you pick out one."" Was really bizarre and she never took me to the storage shed.

Now that it's been a few months after the last funeral and during a call about holiday plans my Aunt casually dropped ""oh there is nothing to discuss, they left everything to me. Your father left your mom well enough off so yeah, removed her when your father died."" Talk about a gut punch. Doesn't make sense or fit with what we were told by the grandparents (they said 3 way split among all their children, later a 2 way when they wanted my uncle removed) nor is it logical as her current husband (#4) is quite wealthy so it's not like she's struggling or in a bad place. Her evasiveness from the get go, and possessiveness at Christmas probably should have prompted us to be a little more blunt in asking for documents but we didn't want to cause any drama.

For now we've sent her a written request for copies the will/trust and all amendments. I think her willingness or lack of cooperation there will say a lot...but as executor, wasn't she was legally required to notify us when there were any changes? (like removing my mom) She not only failed to notify us, she ignored our requests for copies. Can only speculate but it seems like she unilaterally changed the will to inherit everything herself. When and how, we won't know until we see the documentation.

We bought an office suite in a HOA managed condo building. The Unit # on the title is 1-2.
The other tenants/offices in the building use a numbering scheme of 101, 102, 103 etc. So, our office suite was installed with a number placard showing 102. We then found out that the neighboring tenant had been using the number 102 on his office suite door and as mailing address for a long time. Initially, through email he agreed to us in using 103 and he would change his office Suite # to match his title 1-3. When we closed on our office condo, he was using the correct matching Suite #103. However, after we moved in, a few weeks later, he started using Suite #102 again and now there are two doors displaying Suite # 102.
 
This is in a big city in California. So far we have gone to the county tax assessor office who said they agree with us but cannot enforce the other tenant to change their office number.

I left my home at 4:30am got to airport at 5:45 ish and had two connecting flights and an hour Uber and was then delivered straight to the office. This was around 245 CST (I was coming from EST) so for me 345. I then took a tour met some folks and spent about hour meeting with different staff and my supervisors. Before leaving time - around 5:30 I was told they were concerned for me and required a drug test to be done immediately. Since I wasn’t on drugs or alcohol I was very concerned and ask where it was coming from and she told me - it was more they were concerned my smile was crooked and I might be having a stroke. Which sent me into a borderline panic attack. They asked what medications I took that day to which I said only my ADD meds and showed them my prescription. I said i was not on any other medication or alcohol. They said I needed to go get tested immediately and checked out by doctor to make sure it wasn’t something more serious if it wasn’t drugs.  She even had me show her photos from my phone where I explained my smile was always crooked. She said because possible medical issue like a stroke I needed to go right away. They put me I an Uber alone thousands of miles away from anywhere or anyone I knew and I was driven to a testing site where I peed in a cup. I then waited further evaluation since they had insisted I needed to be checked out for stroke signs and other possible
Issues but nurse at center told me it was just a collection point for drug testing s that was all and I was then supposed to leave.i was really
Upset since I though I was going for a medical evaluation as I wasn’t on drugs or alcohol so i was extremely worried something else was wrong. They put me in an Uber and sent me back to the hotel.

I stayed up all night afraid to sleep bc I might be having a stroke or aneurysm and next day they put me in a room to take notes from their online manuals which I did next 3 days and they barely spoke to me. The day before I left they gave me a rapid fire verbal test to which I explained I had no training other then the manual which was not the same as practical experience. I shadowed someone else for a couple hours the day before last day there and that was it. No mention if I was ok or if the doctor said anything. I passed the drug and alcohol test and the only person who talked to me about it was an HR person. I was miles from home, alone, and terrified I was having stroke (their words) and their move is to have me go alone to a drug testing site then alone back to my
Hotel? They said we think something is wrong with you I said I don’t do drugs and didn’t drink what else - thays when they brought up possible stroke etc. if they thought that why let me go alone to center  and tell me I would be checked out by a doctor when it was really just a drug test location.

"Pretty straightforward: my former roommate (convicted felon on assault charges, fantasizes about beating small animals to death, delusions of grandeur, legitimately thinks he's part gorilla and will use that as justification to eat more food than anyone needs, even if it means I've had to go hungry because my food was stolen) tried to physically assault me on 10/26, but the owner of the house BEGGED me not to get a restraining order, told me to come to him with any problems, and for the next 3 weeks, the felon and his girlfriend continued to terrorize and harass me, letting themselves into my space when I'm gone (found his hair), stealing my food, using my toothbrush, unplugging ONLY my devices from the wall and modem, leaving his pubes on my food and things, leaving feces in the common toilet so I'd have to clean up after them, refusing to wash common dishes so I would have to clean up after them, there's a theme here. The whole time, the owner refused to do anything to alleviate the situation, and then helped them file a bogus restraining order on me,  citing non-existent cat allergies, claiming I tried to kill the felon by ""washing dishes"" and ""doing laundry"" (they went in front of a judge and said this), and when the judge asked where the threat was, the landlord claimed that me taking back the food and toilet paper that I paid for is what he considers to be threatening behavior. The landlord also filed restraining order on me claiming I threatened him, but since he couldn't find one instance in court (because i was the victim of all threats), the judge threw out the cases, and literally laughed them out of the courtroom. But she also refused to hear my side at all, and so they never received justice for what they did to me.

They knew exactly what to write to get the initial orders against me, but they were never able to back it up. He went in with an eczema flare up on his eyelids and tried to claim I entered his room and shoved cat hair in his face, claiming that's why his eyes were swollen. In court, the felon tried to explain to the judge that cat dander is transferred via saliva, since it's hard to argue I forcibly entered their space when they already claimed to be barricaded, supposedly for their protection, but the landlord originally claimed it was for my protection after the felon attacked me. Neither were true, they were out in the house as often as they pleased, including when I was home, they did it as a show of dominance like everything else, and the landlord would try to gaslight me saying I can't tell they've been in the kitchen cooking even though they never clean up after themselves, or I can't hear them walking around. Tried to tell me they're scared of me when they were doing everything I listed above and more. 

The landlord lives in the house but is basically never home, and he keeps an unregistered firearm in the house, but he made sure to hide it when I came back with police escorts to retrieve my belongings. The other roommates have been unemployed for years, can't hold a job, don't pay rent, don't clean, don't contribute in any way to the household. The landlord is somehow okay with this, and I'm not sure what's wrong with him because he's keeping 2 grown adults as pets (I speculate that the landlord had the felon hurt someone). I paid rent. I paid to have the power turned back on at least 3x while I lived there because the owner is a 36yo silver spoon who doesn't know how to pay bills (he bought the house with an inheritance and doesn't pay his bills, so I helped him make the house spotless so he could get it refinanced). I helped him buy a new sink, a new washing machine, and a lot of things in addition to the rent I paid. I am a business owner, and I don't have time for petty drama. I could easily own a home if I'd been given $50k five years ago when the market was less inflated, and I'm sure I wouldn't have to refinance twice and have my friend pay all my bills in order to get by.

The other problem is that I had to spend thousands of dollars on accommodations, gas, food, etc. that I wouldn't have to spend if not for the bogus restraining orders. I was already planning to move out December 15th, but they exploited the legal system to get me out sooner. What are my options? This is still keeping me up at night with how wrong everything is. Even the serving officers were apologetic when I read and explained what I was being served for. ""Oh wow. Sorry you're going through this. We're just doing our job, but here's how you can fight it,"" they told me. I should've filed the restraining order the day the felon attacked me, and I know things would've been very different.

"I live in a rented house (England) with an joint assured shorthold tenancy agreement. I want to end my tenancy before the fixed term, but I have paid 6 months in advance. The agency says that I will not get my advanced rent money in a lump sum, but that I will receive it monthly, making it unclear whether I will get all my money back if the replacement tenant does not pay. They said that they will contact the new tenants guarantor, but basically said that if the new tenant doesn't pay then I'm not getting that months rent refund.  I'm confused, as even though I will still be fulfilling my tenancy obligations up until a new person moves in, I still could not get all my rent refunded if the other tenant decides not to pay, which would be no different from me just subletting my room as either way I'm still tied to the house. This is how the agency explained it:  
*""Yes if someone is found that pays monthly you wont be able to be refunded until they have paid so it will be better to find someone that pays in advance the same as you""*  


Can anyone advise whether they have the right to do this as all other 3 tenants pay monthly. They also want £100 admin fee to change tenants but I checked an the regulations said that is a cap of £50 unless the agency can prove the extra fees for doing the paperwork, so I think they are trying to see how much they can get out of me.

"The store I’m currently working at is an absolute disaster, but I was desperate and needed the money to get by, so I picked up a part-time from them.

The holidays are here, which means lines persist no matter how many cashiers are at the registers. I was pushing 6 hours into my 8hr shift (I had already taken my 15 minute break), and I felt unwell. I was close to fainting on the registers, and felt lethargic and disoriented because I hadn’t eaten since before my shift. I had asked the managers supervising us like hawks if I could go on my lunch. They refused the first two times I had asked throughout the last 2hrs before I felt this way, so I toughed it out until I felt like I was going to collapse if I didn’t eat in the next few minutes. I leave for lunch, and once I clock back in, I get scolded by them and told “You have to ask if it’s okay to go to lunch before you leave,” but they had been refusing me, already, and I had to put myself first. 

Furthermore, they have me working earlier on Sunday, and for religious reasons, I can’t attend. I have to go to church. I had filled out an availability form that was also approved, specifying I couldn’t attend during that time on Sundays specifically. If they are not willing to change my schedule, and it’s a given that I risk being penalized for this, what can I do!?

"TLDR: How much verbal or written notice must a landlord give me via their agent or the super on rent raise and new leases for a room in a state registered rooming house? Also is there a cap on the rent hike? 12% hike seems like a lot.  My goal is time and to not be ripped off. 

Hey I am un/fortunate enough to live in one of New Jersey’s registered and regulated rooming houses. I rent a single room in a building with 13 other  tenants and share two bathrooms. As per fire marshal no cooking except for microwaves allowed. There is also no kitchen.

I moved in a week before COVID lockdown in 2020 lived in a smaller room before moving to slightly bigger room. To compare the differences, the original I had to put my mattress vertically up against the wall first thing in the morning before I could use my desktop. Now I can walk around the mattress. The original lease showed a weekly price but the original landlord allowed me to pay monthly and the lease stated I had to give 14 days notice before moving out. 

Last year a corporate real estate bought the place (TAX ADDRESS) Associates LLC and Recently it made local news they own half the mixed use properties on the block with plans to tear down to build a 15 story mixed use building. 

With all that said, two important questions:

How much notice are they required to give to me and is it verbal or written requirement? Is there a limit on how much they can raise rent?

New landlord gave me the lease last week it’s month to month. Three weeks ago the vaguely stated the rent was going up and couldn’t say more or now much.

First question; is there a way to request bail be lowered in Oregon and how would I go about doing so? 
If not- Second question; From what I’m understanding, I only need pay 10% of the bail for him to be released? Is that true? If so, is it like a payment plan to pay the full amount, or do they only actually take the 10%? 
Third; How do I go about paying bail? Do I just walk into the police department with a smile and some cash in hand????

"(Backstory) When I was 16, I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital and then did a few months of outpatient care. I met these girls in one of the groups and we all became friends. This one girl in particular liked to run away a lot.  I got an iPad for Christmas and had one of those girls over at my house to hang out. I was really trusting and naive so when she said she wanted to borrow my iPad, I said she could. She took it with her that day and I never saw it again. I turned off find a phone a few days before (such an odd move on my part but what can I say). She ended up losing that iPad to some guy she stayed with, whose address I have right now. I think he might have access to my account despite kicking my iPad out of my devices. I noticed my billing address had changed.

The nursing program will not allow their class to take the NCLEX until after January 1st despite meeting all requirements for graduation from the program. Is it legal for the school they graduated from to prevent/delay them from taking the licensure exam despite having graduated and meeting all requirements to test? 

Additionally, they have gone through classes utilizing accommodations for ADHD which allowed time-and-a-half for exams. They have been informed that, should they request similar accommodations for the NCLEX, the state could place ""restrictions"" on their license.

"My mother moved into a studio within a complex that was previously an extended stay motel. Each building has 4 studios on the bottom and 2 loft style 2 bedroom units on the upper floor. All have been newly renovated.

She moved in December 1st. My mother (trying not to be a burden) paid 2 men in a truck $700 to move her in. My husband and I spent a day hanging her pictures, hooks, mirrors and her Television. She paid xfinity come and hook up her internet shortly afterward. 

December 7th - my mother comes home to a big orange ""DO NOT OCCUPY"" sticker on her door. The reasoning on the sticker is - failure to obtain certificate of occupancy. She emails, calls and goes into the office to see what's going on. Silence from all fronts, someone even hid from her in the office. 

About a week later, the manager of managers  contacts her and tells my mother there is some electrical problem in the unit and the walls need to be opened up and she has 3 options. Refund all of her money and find a new place to live. Move into a loft at a substantial rental increase (all studios are occupied). Move into a loft with prorated studio price rent until March, Januarys rent waved and the company would pay for movers to move her into the new loft also offering to pay any other moving related costs. She chose option 3 and signed a temporary lease. We appreciated the extention of movers and we pitched in to move her kitchen and clothing and boxing everything up again. 

The movers were unable to fit her regular sized couches into the door way due to a tight overhang and the high sides of the arms. I find this very strange and might go over there to try again with this with my husband. It's so odd and I'm sure other residents have moved couches like hers in. This creates a huge problem for her and is not the same standard of living she was able to have in the original apartment she leased.

In emailing with the manager of managers the evening of the move my mother relayed she would have to pay the cost for xfinity to come back out to hook up her internet. Along with her couch, a long high table (we mounted to the wall), and her TV (still mounted) were left in the studio unit. The manager asked why my mother had to pay xfinity to come back out and couldn't just take her equipment to the new place and just plug it in. Manager also has no solution to my mother not having a couch other than they will just cover it in a sheet to protect it from dust in the studio. Manager expects my mother to take down her TV and set it up herself in the new place. 

We were all grateful that she was able to stay in this location and help was offered. We're trying not to rock the boat bc this location is the perfect price, close to us and her job. But now the manager is acting like she is doing my mother a favor with all this. In reality my mother is a 61 year old woman with anxiety. The whole thing is a mess. My mother has been nothing but understanding and it feels like they just want her to go away, but she's the one living their mistake.

My real question is - in the temporary lease she signed it looks like they prorated her February rent down to 488.06, then she would begin paying 890 after that. The manager has only said she would go back to paying the 890 rent in February. I think this is another oversight of their mismanaged office and they will be pissed if she pays this prorated amount. If she just pays the 488.06 on February 1st could they come back and try to charge her for the rest? Am i interpreting the lease correctly?  We're at a loss. Please help.

Her lease states 

RENT AND CHARGES. Unless modified by addenda, you will pay $890 per month for rent, payable in advance and without demand.

February rent of $488.06 is due for the remainder of (check one) [x] 1st month or [ ] 2nd month, on February 1st 2024.

"Hello, this is my first &amp; probably most important/urgent reddit post. Im starting to run out of hope /options so I chose to come here. If even one person responds i’m thanking god.

I don’t want to go into too much detail in fear one of my family members finds this &amp; breaks my phone but i will try to answers as many questions. 

On November 1st last month my dad told me we are going to India for my brothers wedding for one month, (and when I say told me, i mean i had no choice) I wasn’t even financially stable to go, but he still made me pitch what i had for the plane tickets (250$), everything was going well on the journey from airport to airport, my dad was honestly being nice to me, buying me drinks the whole flight, that being said on the final plane to India my dad told me to give him My passport &amp; return ticket so he can look after it for our return flight on Dec.5… That’s where i fucked up big time man. 

Not even 3 days after landing in India at our in-laws house, My Father asks me if i would like to stay with my In-laws and forget about coming back to Canada, I told him i don’t want that &amp; I want to come back the day he promised me we would originally… My uncle &amp; him laughed at me and said i have no choice… I have a history of depression so this news didn’t sit well with me at all, I wasn’t even able to enjoy my own brothers wedding because of the news, I looked like a hostage in every photo/ wedding video not able to smile, i was in fear and I still am... After the wedding was done one week into the trip, my grandma noticed I wasn’t sleeping at night and I would cry in my sleep or have bad dreams of loosing the life iv’e always lived. I tried one last time to reason with my dad to let me come back with him like he said and told him he’s treating me like a minor (im 23) on top of that i have a job in canada expecting me back on the 6th of Dec (my dad told my boss i would). He just got angry and yelled i’m a low life because i only make 1 grand a month and i’m not working the job he imagined (i’m a kitchen helper) &amp; don’t have the body he likes, (chubby). I was living with him in Canada &amp; suggested i just move out on my own if he’s fed up with me, I’m an adult now after all, I could go on EI or get a 2nd job &amp; get a cheap place, My dad said No, My in-law uncle is now my New Dad and my In-Law Aunt is Now My Mother (triggered me because my real mom left when i was young) I finished the argument by saying he lied to me and my boss &amp; he’s holding me in a foreign country against my will &amp; stole my ID to get back or anywhere. He yelled at me go to sleep so i did. (I think he knows he’s in the wrong) Me and my Grandma sleep in the same room and when she noticed I couldn’t sleep she told me not to worry i’m only staying in India for 4 months then me &amp; her are going back to Canada for one month then i’m moving into her house in the U.K. I felt a-bit of relief but everyone i’m messaging (friends and family in England/Canada/social workers) think this is fucked up what my dad did. They suggested I contact the Canada embassy in Delhi &amp; when I emailed them all they said was I should report my passport as Lost/Stolen with a side note of my story and pay all the fees on top to get a new passport… well when I said i paid $250 for the flight I have 0 money now… I’m fucked so I didn’t bother replying…

So to come to conclusion I have good friends back home willing to pay for my return flight &amp; Taxi but that doesn’t fix My Dad is withholding my passport… that’s all I fucking need.

Any help would fix my everyday anxiety I’m facing now and help me sleep because how do I know if my family will ever bring me back or give my ID. 

Thank you if you read this far, honestly guys❤️

Concerns/Questions -

1. Is there ANYTHING the police in Canada or India can do?? or would they take my in-laws side? I’m scared to contact them or anyone in india because my family here are strict / traditional. I have my birth certificate &amp; Canada Care Card.

2. I read there are harsh consequences in Canada for ID withhold.. I wan’t to press all charges but I can’t afford or call a Canadian Lawyer (no minutes) My friend in the states has a solid lawyer but he doesn’t know if he can help cuz its Canada/India/different laws.

3. My friend told me I’m basically getting disowned by my dad &amp; kidnapped by our in-law, is this true?

4. I have a E-Visa aloud to be in india for one year i was told (attached to passport)

5. My friends advice is just play along for the 4 months my grandma/in-laws are planning to keep me in India, then Pack/Run away as soon as I make it to Canada w gma (He’ll pick me up) Only problem is my family could change there mind whenever with me ever coming back…

"On 12/6/23 my vehicle was towed from an apartment complex garage while it had an active visitor permit. I have a copy of the visitor permit for this date. The towing company states that my vehicle was not in a designated ""visitor parking spot"", however there is no signage or markings in view anywhere to differentiate between visitor and non visitor parking spaces. Along with this fact on my towing receipt it states the reason for towing is ""No Parking Permit"" which is incorrect according to their reason for towing. There is a towing sign located next to the garage, but contains no language that would state visitor parking is not allowed within the garage, only that it is within designated areas.

Upon realizing that my vehicle had been towed I immediately sent an email to the towing company, at 1346, informing them of the immediate release of my vehicle. After providing notification to the company I arrived at the lot to retrieve my vehicle. I submitted my payment for release at 1539, but after receiving payment the towing company refused to release my vehicle for another hour after payment, stating that it was within their rights to hold my vehicle for up to an hour after I had paid for release due to signage that stated ""vehicles released with an hour notice"".

Though my email should have served as notice for release of my vehicle I believe that the company held my vehicle for an exorbitant amount of time further stating ""A tow truck was hooking up a vehicle"" and I would not be allowed to retrieve my own vehicle during this time. Though I observed multiple tow trucks go into and out of the lot carrying different vehicles (assuming this is backed up through their own security footage at the gate) I was finally able to take my vehicle and during this time there were still tow trucks operating in the storage lot. I believe that is not operating under Texas code 86.711; 86.715(o) stating that companies must ""Conduct or perform towing operations with honesty, trustworthiness, and integrity,"" as it is my belief that the company lied to me in order to hold my vehicle longer than necessary.

"Context for this, as I wish it were as simple as ""bad store owner hasn't paid me.""

I worked for an interstate truck company that has their office in Rossville, Georgia, but is supposedly registered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I worked there for about 75 hours over the course of a week and promptly resigned. It is now around 45 days since my resignation. I'm going to try to keep this in order, as it's a set of bad events that has me missing a fair amount of money and a lot of confusing specifics that keep me from having a direct path to said money.

I was hired on to do flatbed for this company. In the employment term I signed, it said I was to be paid $20/hr or $.53 per mile after 100 miles. Upon being hired, I was TOLD I would be making less than that, as well as that I was pulling dry van and NOT flatbed, but did not sign anything stating such. Clauses for this term included deductions for quitting before 90 days as well as other deductions. Not enough to drain a 70+ hour workweek check, but that is the first and last time I'll ever agree to anything like that.

I played their game for a few days and figured out quickly that it takes a particularly miserable soul to endure this job. I gave them a two weeks notice, but I fell short of that and ended up giving a shorter resignation notice a week after starting and resigning the next day after. This job was hell on my time and not worth any of the compensation they were willing to provide.

Fast forward to resignation day. I offered to finish out my load and return the truck to the yard afterward. Per their terms, quitting under a load is a deduction. Dispatch told me no, I am NOT to finish out this load if I won't work the rest of the day after. Okay, fine. You've just nullified your terms. Also, per their terms, I made sure every single piece of paper was in order, all assigned items were returned, the truck was cleaned, basically by the book, and to the T. I also photographed EVERYTHING; papers, returned items sitting on their counter, the truck I cleaned out, everything. The only deductions I *should* face are in regards to quitting within 90 days and not fulfilling a 2 week notice. That's fine by me. 

I go by the office after being told not to finish out my load, provide all the above, and sign my resignation. The HR lady tells me verbatim, ""We have up to 21 days to pay you your final check by Tennessee law."" Remember this. So, great, thanks for showing your colors there. Because I can not fathom these guys want to deal with federal labor enforcement, they'll pay me. Right? 

Day 21 rolls around, nothing. No mail, no contact, nothing. I try calling the billing department on and off to no avail. I get into a new job that has me working nights, so I can't reasonably call them during the day until earlier this week. I get a hold of the office finally. They transfer me to billing, and again, nothing. I leave a voicemail with my intent to file against them, and they finally chime in. In the voicemail, they try to insinuate I never returned all of their property (that I have a picture of sitting on their front desk with meta data and location). Cool, so I'll come in the next day and we'll sort this. 

Yesterday, I walked into the office, and the only person there is the lady in billing. The one I have not been able to reach at all. I inform her I'm here to pick up my check and that they're well beyond the 21 days allotted by the state of Tennessee. She retorts with ""you have to sign something before that takes affect"". Failed to elaborate further. She then informed me that she wasn't notified that I returned any of their property and that the owner is not present to write me a check. I let her know I have pictures of it sitting on the front desk as well as literally everything else. Knowing this is clearly not going any further at the moment, I ask her kindly if she has my number readily available to contact me when the owner is in, and she says she does.

Now, I will call when they are open today and ask one last time for them to provide me with my check and paystub. If they won't/""cannot,"" I will pursue a claim with the federal Department of Labor (as interstate companies fall under that jurisdiction). However, that is where I hit a roadblock. I have no accurate number to provide for my expected/earned compensation other than hours logged at work due to the pay criteria discrepancies, and I cannot find solid information on what state the company is registered in, nor their actual registered business name. I may be able to have them identified by their DOT number via the Department of Labor, but I'm unsure.

Failing them paying me what I am owed today, is the Department of Labor the best course, or should I look into getting a lawyer and pursuing them for more money?

"Long story short, I (F) broke up with my emotionally abusive ex (M) a few days ago. Today I got a notification from Apple as I was driving home that an AirTag was detected near me and was first detected near me while I was at work hours prior. I get home, track it, and it's duct taped to the bottom of my car. I call the cops and they say they will send someone but they never do. All I get is a call(not a visit) from an officer who is just brushing it off and telling me they can't prove it's him and to get a restraining order. However, you can find out who the air tag belongs to via Apple and it shows the serial number and the last four digits of the number it's registered to. It was registered to my ex's phone number.

"I’m a registered nurse at a hospital and I recently had an elderly patient who I suspect was neglected by his daughter who is his DPOA. The patient came to the emergency department with a stage four pressure injury, severely dehydrated, and in septic shock. His wounds were so severe that the infection spread to his bones. This is something that doesn’t happen over night. The DPOA is his at-home caregiver and everything I know so far suggests that she has been neglectful to the patient.

Well, the patient gets admitted to the ICU and his daughter is the one calling the shots because the patient himself is essentially non-verbal and has altered mental status. The daughter has been refusing critical life-saving treatments which would be fine if she hadn’t insisted on keeping her father a full code. This meant that if his heart stopped or if he stops breathing we would have to start chest compressions and put a breathing tube down his airway. As the patient’s DPOA, I had to respect her decisions to refuse medications and therapies. 

The daughter has been showing abusive behavior such as refusing to leave the patient alone, refusing staff to inspect his skin, refusing staff to turning him, refusing staff from feeding him themselves and insisting she do it herself. With regards to the latter she actually witheld food from him because she was upset about something and was using it as leverage to manipulate the staff into getting what she wants.

So here’s my question. When do I get to call security and have them remove this suspected abuser away from my patient? What happens to her DPOA status when it’s clear that she is NOT acting in the best interest for him?

"Location New York

I, 21M, just started working at this restaurant about four weeks ago. Three days ago, I was working with a 19M coworker (it was my third day working with him, and I had never met him before starting this job). While working, the restaurant started getting very busy, and he was getting pretty stressed out. He said, 'I’m gonna shoot up [restaurant's name]' four times in a row as we were walking past other workers, whom I later found out didn’t hear him say this. About an hour later, while working together, he came up and called another coworker crazy. I said, 'You're one to talk; you just said you're gonna shoot up the restaurant,' and he replied, 'Yeah, if you're working next Thursday, be worried.'

Two days later (yesterday), I reported what he said to my boss, the GM. He called the cops, and I wrote down my statement for them. The cop came and questioned me, and I went over the story and anything else I knew. The officer said they were going to contact him to come to the station.

I came into work today, and my boss updated me on the situation, telling me that he is getting charged with felony terrorism. From what I've researched, I assume he's getting charged with felony terroristic threats, but 'felony terrorism' is what my boss said.

So, I was wondering if you guys had any advice or opinions on what I should do, if anything. Should I not talk about the situation with other coworkers? I know that it’s probably going to come down to me saying he did and him saying that he didn’t. Do you think they have other evidence on him since it’s only been 24 hours, and the cops are already charging him? Will I have to testify against him? If, after everything, he's proven innocent, would he be able to try and sue me for defamation?

This whole situation is eating at me because I know I did the right thing by reporting him, but I also feel like I’m playing a part in ruining this kid's life.

"I work for a small ish real estate brokerage. my office has 20 employees, the same broker is over 4 offices in my state. there are roughly 30 offices in the US. our day to day is typical real estate. I've been there 4 months, high initial turnover but many long tenured agents making lots of money selling lots of houses.

yesterday every employee of the MY STATE offices was mandated (in so many words) attendance to a 'think coach' and motivational speaker, who 'coaches' the broker, as well as the manager of each office.

we were told 'nothing in your business is more important and there is no excuse to not be there.' I was running late after a meeting with a client and was called by the manager asking where I was. one agent's sisters funeral was on that day and he was told to talk in private. he showed up late but he was there.

during the event it was mostly Tony Robbins 'take control of your attitude and life' type stuff with some God intermingled. I considered this inappropriate but nothing crazy, just rolled my eyes.

The last 2 hours were essentially church. agents were asked directly 'do you know God?' We were told to stand up, place our hand on our heart, link arms, and devote our life to Jesus Christ etc etc. We were invited to join this church. At the end the broker said 'none of you had to be here and all of you chose to be here so I appreciate that.'

I recorded most of this, as did other agents.

Personally it was just a waste of a few hours and not really the biggest deal in my life. But it was wrong and should not be allowed to happen especially for weaker minded and younger people trying to make it in the world.

I have contacted a lawyer but am not sure if I want to pursue for obvious reasons. There is a lot of money in this business and this is a very strong brokerage. the top agents clear 500k up to a mil within a year or two of working. it is a niche market that I do not want to go into specifics.

I'm not really looking for a pay day but obviously who says no to money. I do not want to get invovled in a long legal battle and again my career has not been damaged or threatened but it was simply wrong and illegal.

"I live in a condo in Toronto and my father visited me earlier this year and stayed with me for several months. There was one day when I was at work, he tried to exit the building side door and accidentally triggered the fire alarm. He can't read English and the alarm is positioned very close to the door so he probably mistaken it as a door switch. When the alarm went off, he immediately told the building management that it was a false alarm, and stayed there the whole time until the fire department cleared the situation and left.

Since I know even though he was not intentional, I need to take responsibility for this so I talked with the building management the next day. I acknowledge that I will take some responsibility, however, I also point outed the flaws of the fire alarms in the building. First, some alarms are positioned very poorly which are easy to be mis-triggered (some are right beside the entries and even less than one feet from the Automatic Door Openers). Second, there are no covers for the fire alarms which are close to the entries - my assumption is this is the main reason why the false alarms happened very frequently in my building by the rate of at least once per month. Thus I stated that I should only take part of the responsibility not all. They agreed to add covers to the fire alarms and also told me the bill usually won't be that high, a few hundred dollars on average.  

After several months, the invoice has arrived and my building sent me an email asking me to pay the full amount of 1600. I was shocked why it was so expensive at first. On the bill, it says 3 trucks are dispatched so the total adds up to 1600. 

I don’t think I should take full responsibility for this. My building did a very poor job of maintaining the fire system. Besides, I also read the byLaw and found that they can ask for a reimbursement up to 90% of the fee if proper upgrade is made to the fire system. I noticed that after several weeks of the incident, they added cover to the alarms so they definitely can submit a reimbursement request. If so, why I still need to pay the full bill? I am afraid they will ask for rebate anyway but never give me those money back.   
  
I really need some advice on what I should do next. I honest feel 1600 for the first time violation is too much. I am a honest citizen who pays tens of thousands of tax to government per year, and never miss a single bill of monthly building management fee (500+). Besides I helped improved the situation in the building to reduce future false alarms from happening. Is there a case to request for a fee reduction in the bill? Should I talk to the fire department to appeal? Or seek resolution with my building management so that they can also take part of the bill? Appreciate any helpful suggestions.

"My ex moved out about 3 months ago, the first month he would pick up the kids to take them to relatives, but since then I have allowed him to stay at my house with the kids for his parenting time due to him still building a house and the kids wanting him there instead of couch surfing with him. His address is changed and we have court coming up for child support only. He hired a lawyer to fight the calculated amount and is claiming he has 50/50 visitation. The CS order was input with him having 95 overnights, because the schedule we agreed upon was he take them overnight every Saturday and every other Friday, he take them Wednesday nights after work until bedtime and Sundays he will keep them until bedtime, this is based around his work schedule. (I was a stay at home Mom and homeschooled the kids before the break up and am attempting to still do so until summer so the kids lives aren't changed anymore then necessary) He is arguing the agreed upon schedule is 50/50 and his child support should be calculated with equal overnights. My question is, now that he is doing visits in my home and actually staying overnight about 50% of the time or more, will that count as him having parenting time so that support is set at a 50/50 status? He provides no support, pays no bills, does no cooking or cleaning, just plays with the children and eats the food I've bought and prepared. To me I feel getting a lawyer isn't necessary because it's pretty black and white, the kids live with me full time, but I want to be sure the law looks at it that way.

So, I want to know how I am protected legally. Obviously this cant be legal for them to refuse that I enter the apartment to collect my things, right? I am scared to go there by myself in the event that this person is really unstable and attempts to do something out of character. Should I bring a Sheriff? I really am terrified of police so that is troubling but I want to be safe. Also, am I putting myself in too much risk not ending the lease agreement directly with the landlord?  
Looking for advice, let me know if there is a different sub I should be posting in.

"I am a full-time employee at a manufacturing plant in North Carolina. Recently, I put in a resignation notice via my supervisor for January 2nd 2024. This was sometime last week, maybe Dec 11 or 12th.

My supervisor got back to me, letting me know that HR says that my last day will instead be Friday - December 22nd 2023. They let me know on Tuesday, Dec 19th. This is despite the fact that he clearly stated Jan 2nd would be my last day.

I have not signed or agreed to anything, nor have I emailed or spoken to HR personally. If I don't concede, are there any grounds to claim unemployment?

For context, we don't work 12/23 - 1/1. We get paid for 3 holidays, and I have some paid vacation time I intended to use for the remaining days. I do not have another job lined up as of yet as I planned to do more thorough job hunting during this time.

HR is clearly trying to avoid giving me holiday pay. There is a policy that employees must be present the day before and the day after a holiday to recieve pay. Hence, January 2nd.

My supervisor, who is on my side, suggested that I rescind my resignation and see what they do.

In the 2 years I've been here, I have interacted very little with HR as I've never had any reason to. My supervisors have been great and I felt very happy with the company up until now. Honestly, the fact that I might've been better off without giving a notice is the main thing that's making me angry. I just wanted to give them time to train a replacement before I was gone. 

TL;DR - I put in a resignation notice for January 2nd. HR says my last day will be December 22nd instead. I have not signed or agreed to anything as of yet.

"Looking for some advice on a unit I moved out of a couple months ago that is seeking payment:

I had a job change and bought my lease out per the terms in the lease contract ( &gt; $10k despite living there for 2 months), the Leasing Specialist communicated by email this would release me from the lease however I was later informed that I would still be required to pay rent through the notice period of 30 days. 

Because of my job, I fully moved prior to the end of that 30 days, but on my “Notice to Vacate” form I noted i would vacate at the 30 day mark. As I had already moved, I mailed the buy-out check with my keys back to the landlord but with an email that stated my intent to return to the unit to collect some final items. I hadn’t yet booked flights but stated it would be before the official vacate date. 
The landlord responded confirming the receipt of the check/keys but noted that my apartment had been cleared as the unit was considered “surrendered” the moment I returned keys. 

What are my options here? Items were worth ~$2k and they had the information of my intent to return by email before they received the keys (also my Notice to Vacate date provided)

Note: lease contract does have a clause for Surrender and lists when all dwelling keys are returned but hoping for some options considering the context

"Hi there! So I’m in a very frustrating and frankly traumatic situation. About 2 years ago, i came out to my family and let them know that my step father had engaged in sexual activities with me when I was 13. This immediately resulted in my family’s horror, my mother leaving my step dad abruptly, and his isolation. 

Due to the advice of some child abuse hotline that my sister called in an effort to figure out what to do, she was basically told hat we were in contempt of the law but not making a police report, so I called the police and gave them a report, which they were reluctant to take since it happened in 2008 (I’m now 28) and happened in Hawaii ( I live in CA). 

In connecting with my step fathers estranged family, we learned that he has a history of doing this and getting away with it, but were either unable to prove it in court or never tried to press charges. We of course never knew this, my mom was very submissive and took his for his word early on. 

Of course, since I’m not a minor, all law enforcement essentially doesn’t care and nothing can be done.  My family members posted on his social media that people should stay away from him as he is a predator.  In the meantime, my former step dad has felt emboldened to try and harass us, posting on social media pictures of my sister’s house, making statements about my mom, etc. 

Now he is trying to go after my mom for defamation and I’m sure I’m next.  I’m in a hard position because the abuse isn’t objectively provable, he acknowledged it to my mother when she first confronted him, but I don’t have anything on paper or otherwise that anything happened minus a police report I made and probably notes from my therapist outlining my trauma around it. 

For reference, my step dad is pretty much a broke dude that I’m pretty sure is living in his car. He has a history of extreme financial misgivings, so there isn’t really a point at which he’s lost business or anything related to my comment specifically. In an effort to get back at us he’s been trying to get each of us into court through any harms related to my family reacting to the information I gave them.

Basically my question is - what do I do? Is there any real worry here? Should I be lawyering up? I’m a victim here, but I almost feel like I’m being put in the position of having done something wrong by telling my family.

"[Sorry if this is a little long] My (38f) grandfather passed away when I was 17 years old. He was a writer all his life and partially inspired me to become one as well. I have since gone on to write several books and short stories, and have written many screenplays that were filmed for a small indie company. My point being that I do know my way around the writing world now. 

Before his death, my grandfather had several books published as well, but we didn't know until afterward that he had been taken in by a vanity publisher (predatory company that offers to publish your book for insane costs upwards of 15k; they also hold the rights to your book throughout publication.)

Here's where the legal questions come in. His will was very vague on who should take control of his writing, so it has largely come to me and my aunt (his daughter). She and I are somewhat estranged for unrelated reasons. I have resolved to continue his unfinished work and to revive what was already done. I plan to get the rights back, give the edits another pass, get brand new covers, format, and re-release.

I contacted the vanity publisher informing them that my grandfather has since passed away and I would like the rights handed over to me. They responded yesterday with a form to fill out, a request for a death certificate copy, and a W-9 form (I presume to forward uncollected royalties?)

Question 1: what legal standing/argument do I have if they try something shady such as demanding payment to release the rights to me?

My sibling is responsible for the theft. Which I filed the items and turn ithe form into Police. 

June 28th this year I board a flight from Will Rodgers Airport OKC at 8am to ATL. I spent two months visiting family there. Near a week of my visit my mother called me outside with her laptop screen open. My brothers face clear as day in custody under my legal name. Using my OK DL during a traffic stop he was arrested for operating a stolen vehicle, he impersonated me to dodge his other felonies and current offense. 

I called the city police and immediately made them aware. I was told it was going to be taken care of. 

A month and a half ago I called 911 asking for help to a sober facility. When the officer reached me he made aware the warrant out for ""my"" felony"". I let him know at that moment it was my brother. 

We have a significant difference in body weight. No resemblance facially. Height. I was sure our fingerprints compared would fix the issue. If not the drastic difference in mug shots would raise concern. No shared medical concerns or needs. 

Ever moment I had with staff I brought to their attention the issue. All were indifferent. Over a week to begin with I was not given any of my psych meds for co-existing conditions of Autism (Bipolar 1 most concerning). This was despite seeing the psychologist after 2 days in holding. Whom I only had an assessment with once. 

Total it was 31 days. In that time I was attacked by a reoccurring violent inmate who they brought in to be my cellmate. I was not on a floor designated for mental health at this time. I was seen by a judge a little over a week. When I spoke of my innocence, that I was impersonated, he pointed out and mentioned the discrepancies of weight and height with expressed frustration with the attorney. Said quickly moments later I would be released. 

Something's I may be forgetting. 
Overall it has been very difficult since. I do not know where to start. My psychological well-being I am concerned with. The physical issues I face will be extremely painful (plastic surgery); bone removal from gums from fractured jaw. 

My ear was bit off by the violent cellmate. Teeth pulled out. Stapled head. Hemorrhage eye. Previous illnesses with chronic pain has been exacerbated greatly.

Well somehow he found out I reported him and he started a bunch of rumors. He told people I tried to rape him, that I'm a pedophile, that I'm autistic and stupid, he trashed the apartment, smashed the brick wall on the front porch, and blamed it all on me.

Then he openly admitted to me when we were alone that he was gaslighting to get rid of me, he grabbed my penis and called me ""trash"" while gloating about how he can do that because nobody will believe me. That I'm gonna end up in a mental hospital because everyone gonna think I'm crazy.

My husband and I recently moved out of our apartment in Orlando, FL. Rent was paid in full and had been on auto payments. Our lease ended 11/21/23, but we moved out and returned the keys on 11/17. Everything seemed to go smoothly enough, and we hadn’t heard anything from them until today, 12/19/23. Technically, we still haven’t heard from *them* per se, because in our mail today came a letter from a debt collection agency stating we owe a little over $1k to the apartment complex, and we have no idea why. We’ve received no phones calls, voicemails, emails or letters about why we may owe them money. That said, it’s less than a month since the lease ended, and we’re somehow already with a debt collector, and I don’t understand how. Even if they *had* attempted to reach us about something (they haven’t) and we hadn’t paid, I don’t see how they could have us in collections so fast. I suppose my questions would be is that legal and how do we go about dealing with it? If it’s already with collections, is it even worth talking to the apartment beyond finding out what on earth the charge is for?

"We've been looking for the perfect rental in the CA East Bay suburbs. We're looking at relatively expensive units at the $4,000/month price point - nice homes in nice neighborhoods with high property values. One of our potential landlords asked for a family photo before they would agree to arrange a tour. I was immediately suspicious that they intended to use the photo as a form of racial discrimination against applicants.

They did not explicitly say the family photo was a requirement for the tour, but it was heavily implied. A brief summary of our initial contact:

\_\_\_\_\_

Found rental on aggregate website, requested a tour of the property through user interface.

Received interview call from property owner.

At the start of the interview I asked for an application form and I asked again to arrange a tour. They largely ignored my request to arrange a tour, but said the rental application would be sent to me after the tour (that they didn't even try to schedule).

During the interview call I was asked for details like family size, pets, income, job stability, credit score, debts (all the usual stuff), and to send a picture of my family (???). I told them my FICO 8 (over 830) and Vantage 3 (less than 780) scores. They said they never heard of a score over 830 before and asked for a screenshot of my credit score as well.

I asked to arrange a tour again at the end of the phone interview, but they said they would arrange the tour after receiving my family photo and credit score screen shot by email.

\_\_\_\_\_

If they only arrange the tour after evaluating the picture of my credit score and the picture of my family, then those were critical pieces of my application as a potential tenant, correct? The implication is there are qualities about my credit score they may find unacceptable (obviously) and there are qualities about the picture of my family they may find unacceptable.

If they deny to provide a tour (and therefore deny to even provide an application), is there any case for illegal discrimination based on race? If I claim they used the family photo as a form of illegal racial discrimination, but they claim they used the family photo as a form of legal discrimination (nice clothes/clean appearance??), who is more likely to win in a discrimination suit? They literally thought my credit score was unbelievably high - does that evidence support that I was denied based on the picture of my family, and not my financials?

Finally - if they do provide me with a tour and an application, but they deny my application, do any potential grounds for a discrimination suit change?

All my other family has moved out and have new houses my mom even lives in another state, my grandfather moved in 3 years ago because my mother forced me to take him in because it's ""her house."" For 5 years I've been paying all repairs, property tax, and utilities on the property, and every time I talk to my mom via texts or phone call asking for a legal lease to be written up for me to either be a legal renter or a rent-to-own since I'm already doing the actions of such she declines it and will not allow me to, everything is also all in her name all utilities, and house but I pay them every month. Last month she told me via text in agreement that she'll sell the house to me for 10k if I get it together and pay her within a certain time frame she has yet to still give me, and now I'm trying to see where I stand legally because as said before there's no legal/verbal contract other than the one on her selling me the house which is like I said with an undetermined date or time frame on her end. We never truly had a full conversation or agreement about the house as she was living in it with my sister and I one day and then the next day packed all of her stuff and moved to a different state keeping everything in her name and basically told us to keep paying everything if we wanted it to stay on while also refusing to remove anything out of name, and no utility companies will take her name off of them because she's told them personally to not connect any utilities in my name. The house now needs further repairs like a hole in the roof, a breaker box needing to be fixed, and the appliances she left needing repairs but when I ask her to take care of them or help take care of them like a lease and tenant sort of way she tells me to fix them myself and figure it out, not to mention there is no insurance on the house because it was never looked at by an insurance agent to pass any inspections to get such thing, so anything I do to the break box requires a licensed electrician to turn power off to the box and fix it the fuses keep blowing turning off my furnace and the weather, has been reaching into the 20's here in the night making the house very cold.

"TLDR: I got injured on my hand and my job is reducing my hours due to this. Other department managers told me it’s possible for me to do other things in the meantime. The assistant store manager talked to me about this today.

"Hi. I was told this would be a better place to post!

I'm struggling to deal with something I believe was wrong and I'm wondering if I'm wrong for being upset by it or if I should try to do something about it?

So one of my parents unexpectedly passed away about a year after my parents' divorce. We all kinda believe the cause of what killed them was stress and depression from the divorce but that's besides the point.

My deceased parent received a certain amount of money from my living parent before they passed because it was ordered in the divorce (the living parent got certain assets and had to pay the other their part of them). This money was in their account before they died.
After they died, my living parent deceptively got access to that account through my sibling and took that money back. The money they had to pay up in the divorce, they took back after my parent died.

They did not keep the money, but they paid back the loan they took out in order to pay my deceased parent.
Like ""oh guess they won't be needing this anymore, now I don't have to pay"".

It felt so wrong and awful to me, like they took advantage of their death.

When we brought up the fact that we felt deceived and didn't like it, they denied any wrongdoing and claimed we knew, which was untrue. We had no idea that money belonged to my passed parent. We were under the assumption it was a loan he took out. Not money that was legally theirs via the divorce.

I don't know if there's anything legally we can do, and it isn't even about the money, it's about the icky feeling that the alive parent is so greedy and slimy and did that.

"I recently filed a wage theft claim against my employer which I THOUGHT would be anonymous but nope. 
Basically, I reported the business for: not paying over time, automatically clocking employees out at 10pm when they’re required to stay past that time to clean, editing time sheets when employees do clock out past 10pm, deducting $20 for being 5 mins late or $50 for being 20 mins late from your check, owners not paying the manager a legitimate salary and his pay is basically his share of the tip pool, manager claiming a share of tips for a shift that he did not work. Although I wrote all these in the notes of the complaint, I reported a small amount of money they deducted from my check for lateness and not being paid overtime which came out to around $120. The DOL sent a letter to the owner with MY NAME on it saying that I made a complaint and was owed $400. The manager immediately pressed me and I told him why I filed the complaint. He made the schedule for next week and my hours were significantly cut and he gave more hours to the new hire. He cut my cousins hours as well even though she took no part in what I did. I eventually talked things out with my manager and he told me to volunteer to withdraw the claim and that he’ll keep me since I’m a good employee.

"Hi, I had a tenant from hell situation - 65 year old tenant signed the lease but never moved in insisting we install a brand new washer and dryer, a whole house water filter and a radiant heater when the house is already a very nice brand new construction with brand new hi-end appliances and heater.   


She was citing extreme allergies as the reason and offered to pay for the new units but we found the requests unreasonable for several reasons. We tried to replace the washer and dryer and spent weeks on this - but the delivery failed because the house is in a very remote area and the delivery guys couldn't make it down the hill - the existing washer/drywer were already a mission to install - which we had already warned the tenant about. The whole house water filter required us cutting into our brand new drywall and tying into the main house copper line - which we did not want to do for risk of damaging the house and messing with existing perfectly working plumbing. Lastly she wanted one of those outdoor infra red heaters for indoor use - but after talking to manufacture they explained these are for outdoor only and a fire risk. All this and she only signed a 6 month lease.  


We immediately offered to release her from the Lease without penalty and even offered to compensate her for any expenses to which she refused and continued to pay rent without moving in to the space.   


I contacted several lawyers and Riverside County Fair Housing Council - all of which said her requests were unreasonable.   


9 months later I received a letter from Civil Rights Department in which she had filed a complaint. Stating I discriminated against her disabilities (allergies) and requesting $15,000   


Last week I was interviewed by the Civil Rights Investigator and explained everything to her - and declined to pay any settlement.   


Today I received a letter from Civil Rights addressed to my tenant stating that it has been 100 days since she filed the complaint and that they have not yet completed their investigation and that she has the right to file a private lawsuit.  


My apologies for the long post - I will be talking to a lawyer this week and in the meantime was curious if anyone out there might have any experience with this? and these letters of investigation from Civil Rights.

If you had to use the restroom while “on stage”, you had to pray that one of the supervisors would walk through your sections so you could ask them to leave your station. This happened at most twice a night, and sometimes didn’t happen at all in a night.

2. We were provided no breaks at all. While the longest I was “on stage” was about 5 hours, we were technically on the job for usually about 2-3 hours before we went on stage, getting our makeup done, getting in costume, and getting ready. This was especially brutal when I was strapped to a wall with a harness that left lacerations on my neck. Or when I was in a room with constant strobe lights, intense fog, and screeching over the speakers for 4 hours and no one came to check on me. I did manage to sneak out for a break just because my headache was so bad, but I was technically not authorized to do so. 

3. It got very cold, and a majority of us were outside. If you were inside, there was no heat, only respite from the wind. We were told we could layer up, as long as it fit under our costumes without showing. On the last night, when it was snowing, they provided 2 hand warmers to outside performers and 1 to inside performers. I told a supervisor at one point that I could not feel my toes and she just shrugged. 

4. We were provided water, but it was limited. It was never an issue for me, but another cast member I knew spent a lot of time running around and screaming in a big bulky suit. He was provided 2 water bottles, but when he went through those bc of how much he was sweating, he was cut off. 

5. When it rained, we were each provided about a 3’x3’ sheet of scrap metal to stand under while we performed. We still all got pretty wet, and this was in very low temperatures. 

6.  We almost always worked overtime with no additional compensation. (And while I know this isn’t illegal, we were promised bonuses that we didn’t get)

7. My employer forgot to pay me. When I went in to get my check at the end of the season, he handed me a check for a very low amount. When I questioned this, he said “oh, you got the other payment, right?” I told him I didn’t, to which he asked me if I was sure. I told him I was, so then he looked harder and found that he never printed my first check. I did end up getting it, but I wouldn’t have if I didn’t question him. 

8. The masks and gloves and costumes we wore were not cleaned unless they got muddy. Maybe not illegal, but definitely gross since the one time I wore a mask I couldn’t help but slobber all over it. Especially post covid. 

These reasons on top of the horrible burning alcohol makeup they sprayed on our faces made for a miserable experience, but I just wanted to know if any of this was technically illegal.",Were the things the haunted house I worked for was doing illegal?,18mkjy6,1703042397.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18mkjy6/were_the_things_the_haunted_house_i_worked_for/,
"Hi, first time poster here. I was laid off from my job on 12/8/23 because the company decided to liquidate after having filed for bankruptcy two months ago. Up until that point, they had been telling us that things were fine and we would bounce back and be “stronger than ever”.

"I live in a super fancy high rise with a 24 hour concierge. I brought an Amazon package down with no label to be held at the front desk until a UPS carrier picked it up, scheduled that day or the next. I was very explicit with instructions and asked multiple times if it was ok for me to leave it there. The concierge did not write down which carrier it was for, had it sitting on the wrong shelf for weeks and then insisted the USPS guy take it. It’s now MiA. 

The package was a return of new AirPods Pros, like $300. When I asked for a rent credit as compensation, the apartment sent me their addendum that states “Any packages or personal property delivered to us or stored by us shall be at your sole risk, and you assume all risks whatsoever associated with any loss or damage to your packages or personal property” and offered me $250 in credit to use to PAY FOR OUR OWN AMENITIES like reserve the party room (costs us money).

"Hey all,

I have kind of a weird situation I’m dealing with where I’m essentially being swindled out of $250 for “not picking up my dogs poop”

Before anyone gets mad that I didn’t pick up his poop let me explain, I signed on this apartment 7 months ago and they do a program called “PooPrints” to get dna from dogs to trace back if any poop is left on the ground. Which in theory sounded great to me as I ALWAYS pick up my dogs poop.

So months went by without issue because I pick up every single turd my dog releases. Then I received an email yesterday saying I have been charged $250 for failing to pick up my dogs poop, which was odd because I know I pick up his poop.

I looked at the date the sample was taken and it was “11/10/23” which immediately made me realize what it was. On November 8th when I was in office working, my roommate texted me saying my dog was sick and diarrhea’d on the balcony and I asked if he could take him out to go to the bathroom. Which he did. While doing so, he sent me a video through text of my dog violently spewing liquid diarrhea. This sickness went on until 11/12 of that week. 11/9 and 11/10 I literally took off work to tend to him having to diarrhea every 10 minutes. 

So, I went to the leasing office to clear things up because I am 100% certain the sample they used to test was liquid dog shit. When I went to talk to them also showing them the videos taken a day prior as well as the texts I was sending about his diarrhea the day of the sample being taken! They told me it’s a standard fee and there is nothing they can do about it.

When I asked them if they could show me a picture of the sample they took or some type of proof of the sample they said they don’t take pictures or anything and just send it to the lab.

When they said this I immediately thought in my mind, what’s preventing someone from just walking over to the dog poop can where all the bags are and just tossing a random dog shit into the grass and they can just charge you for it? Is there something I can do on my end that ensures they don’t continue gouging $250 on fees like this?!?!",Is there any legal recourse against my apartment building?,18mkack,1703041582.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18mkack/is_there_any_legal_recourse_against_my_apartment/,
"I was recently fired on the spot from a place I have worked at for about 7 months. Let me kinda give some background information. 

First of all, I live in Colorado. So, when I was first hired here, I was hired on as a server and occasionally help out as a banquet server as needed. I really was 90% banquet server, which isn't what I was expecting, but sometimes the money can be good. But there's a shady thing that they do.. They pay us $30/hour ($15/hr cash that night and $15/hr in your check), but we do not get the 20% gratuity that is included in the bill which, on most occasions, is more than what we are making hourly. Because they are usually parties, we are only there from 4-6 hours, so $30 isn't really that much when you realize how many hours we work. And definitely less than I'm capable of making in the dining room. So.. that's the first thing I'm wondering.. is it legal for them to charge a gratuity, but then withhold it from the servers? 

Secondly, why I was fired. So my bosses are husband and wife, he's the chef and mostly manages the BOH and she's in the front dealing with the customers and us servers. So, the chef recently told one of my co-workers not to get greedy (she's bummed because we're supposed to be making way more money this month since it's mainly Christmas parties, we work our asses off). He told her we are supposed to present the bill to the customers and tell them that we are paid a decent hourly so they aren't obligated to leave extra (when they leave extra, we are able to keep that...but then they're basically tipping twice, which is super shady). So, the other night, I did just that. As I was presenting the check and explaining that to the customer, my lady boss ran up and started aggressively correcting me, telling him that the gratuity is included.. although he was nice and left us more. I was waiting for the customers to leave because I knew she was mad and was going to want to talk. Eventually the customers left and I heard the tail end of her speaking to another employee about what happened, basically bitching about me behind my back, which I was confused of why I did anything wrong. I waited for her to start the conversation, but she didn't... So I felt like I had to. I started with

""Hey, I think we all need to be on the same page about this."" She turned around, she was so red in the face and she came stomping toward me, yelling ""YEAH, you're right, we do! You do NOT fucking discuss your pay with customers like that."" (also, she never cusses)  
Me: ""Well that is how chef told us to say it.""   
Her: ""NO he didn't.""   
Me: ""..yes he did, he told (insert coworker's name) the other night.""  
Her: ""Well, you do NOT present it like that, the tip IS included""  
Me: ""Well we do not get any of that...""  
Her: ""You are paid THIRTY dollars an hour!! Where else are you going to make that much money?!""  
Me: ""Ummm.. in a dining room... anywhere?""  
Her: ""GET OUT! I'm serious, LEAVE""  
Me: \*Stares blankly\*  
Her: ""GO FIND A JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR""  
Me: \*still shocked.. staring\*  
Her: ""I'M NOT KIDDING, GET YOUR STUFF AND GO RIGHT NOW""  


So I clocked out and I left... The next day she did apologize and said ""not sure if you still want to work here but we should still talk"" I told her I didn't feel comfortable coming back to work for her and I wished her luck. Soooo.... Was that legal? To fire me like that, on the spot? She knew she was in the wrong after speaking with her husband and she ate her words. I dunno, I'm glad that I don't work there anymore, that was extremely inappropriate and I don't agree with the pay system there.

"TL;DR: my ex and I bought a car together 2 years ago. We financed it in his name because his credit was better. We split up over a year ago. Every payment for the car has come out of my bank account and it has always been my car. Now he’s threatening to repo it and take it away from me because he’s mad about the money he gave to me (that I never asked for, he forced it on me) and wants either the car or the money. Is this something that he is able to do legally?

Longer story:
2 years ago when me and my ex first started dating I was shopping for an older used car in the 14,000 range because that what I could afford. He was a travel nurse doing covid contracts so he had a bunch of money to throw around and he gifted me $10,000 to put toward it. I told him many times I did not want it but he got my bank information and put it in my account anyways. He also was very determined for me to get a much more expensive car than what I was wanting and it doubled the monthly payments I was hoping to have. Whatever, I’ve made it work. We split up a year ago and he said I could keep the car. I’ve always paid the note on it other than a couple of times he helped me while i was in school last year. Now, a year later after we split up he has decided that he wants the money that he gave me back or he’s going to repo the car. He keeps sending me threatening texts about it and generally harassing me about it. I am a single mom (not his kid) who’s working full time and putting myself through paramedic school, I do not have the money to give to him, nor can I afford to lose my mode of transportation. He has always refused to put the car in my name and still refuses to do so.
I have some people saying that since it’s all in his name I have no rights to the car and he can take it at any time and some people saying that since the car has always been in my possession and I have the bank records stating that I have paid for it that he would have to get a court order to take the car away from me. I don’t know what the truth is so i was hoping someone here could give me some advice on how to proceed.

Honestly, I’m just tired of the emotional turmoil and financial manipulation and I just want to have some peace again.

I’m in Tennessee if that matters.

I had asked her why would she say yes previously only to deny me at the last minute. She then said that she didn't not want to argue in front of our son. This is a flimsy excuse because she has a way to contact and could have let me known. And then said that I did not give her a proper notice via text or email and was her right to refuse.

Later in the day, I receive a phone call from my mother saying the doctors office called her, asking questions about me? I should note that I am a middle aged woman, not a child. 

The office told my mother that I had requested a refill of a medication but that I had not been showing up to my appointments (not true, the doctor cancelled on me the last time), and that they needed to know where I was living? 

I’m currently floating in between my doctors state (where my residence is) and out of state to help care for a family member.

I have no previous criminal record aside from a fishing with no license ticket when I was 16. Now I got the assessment done thinking that I would be dismissed or at worse be recommended for level 1 treatment. I have just found out that I have been recommended for level 3....the maximum. This course will be weekly classes for a year and cost over $6000. The reason that I have been recommended for level 3 treatment is my children were present during the dispute with my wife. My question is specific to the wording of the statute in Washington state. The statute (WAC 388-60B-0410) states as follows:
(3) For level three treatment, the program must ensure the program places participants in level three treatment if the program has documented through the assessment, collateral contacts, the participant's legal history and the 'risks, needs and responsivity' form the following: 
     (a) The participant is at an overall high risk for lethality or recidivism;
     (b) the participant had indicated an acute or critical assessment factor as specified in WAC 388-60A-0400(15) and 388-60A-0400(16)......etc

"I was in a minor accident tonight and called the police as the other driver was being a bit aggressive, both with the driving and the standing with a bullshit look on his face. 
Here's the scenario:

I was merging into traffic from an on-ramp, yielding and then merged when a spot opened up. I merged in front of this blue truck. Now I don't know if he took offense for a non-existent slight against him or if he was innocently trying to pass me, but he ended up side-swiping my driver mirror with his passenger mirror. Again, no damage but I was pretty shook and when we pulled over he was being aggressive with me and his 'story' so I called the cops. 
Police officer shows up and gets both our stories. I spoke with the officer first and IDK what the other guy told him as he spoke with us separately but when officer came back to me he accused me of lying-- he said the other dude acusaed me of 'jumping several cars' and that I side swiped him. What was weird is the cop said the dude explained that I was trying to merge right. I told him that can't be true because the on ramp is on the right side of the highway so I was merging left into traffic. 
He wouldn't listen to me and immediately issued me a ticket for failing to yield (which I did). 
When I got the ticket and looked at the summary the officer wrote that the truck was in front of me in the merge lane-- that's not at all what happened. Also, my version of events didn't make it on the ticket, only the other guys even though I was the one that called.

I'm not shocked at the officers behavior-- I've actually never in my life met a nice police officer. But now I'm sweating about this ticket I was written off a lie someone else told, while being accused of lying. How could the officer possibly come to a conclusion about who's lying without being in both cars simultaneously when the accident happened. 

I am absolutely appealing this and going to court. Obviously it's my word against the other driver and the officer. What are my options for an argument in court? What should I focus on? Should I file a complaint against the officer in the meantime or afterwards? Is getting the summary of events wrong on the ticket a clerical error?

"In August, I received a ticket for underage drinking in Wisconsin. The statute that applies is 125.07. I was at a bar at my friend’s university. I walked out and was stopped by cops and asked for my ID. I was mailed a $295 ticket, and I have a court date via Zoom this week. I am not sure how I should plead. Ideally, I would love to have the ticket removed from my record, but I understand it might not be possible. It would also be great if i could get the fine lowered and/or do community service, take a class, etc.

 I called the district attorney’s office, and they said nothing will change about the ticket and I won’t get a deal unless I plead not guilty. However, I have received conflicting advice saying it would be better to plead no contest. My fear over pleading not guilty is that I will be asked why I am pleading that way (not sure if this is how it works, I am completely clueless about all this) and I will explain, but by explaining I will literally be admitting guilt. I was at the bar underage, so I am technically guilty. I am worried that if I plead not guilty and then essentially admit guilt, I will not even have the chance to get my fine to be lowered or anything. I basically just want to say it was a stupid mistake and see if there is potential that anything can be changed, but I don’t want to ruin my chances by pleading the wrong way. I have never gotten so much as a speeding ticket, and it was my first time ever at a bar underage, so I have no idea how any of this will go.

If nothing can be done, it is a good lesson learned, but I want to do everything I can just in case there is a chance! So, is it better to plead in one particular way? If I plead not guilty, will I be asked to explain? And if I do, will my explanation be received as essentially saying I am guilty?

"Hey first time posting on reddit so not sure how this all works but have a legal question/conundrum. I'll keep industry and details relatively vague for privacy reasons but we're located in Oregon. 

  
I'm co-owner of a startup that is in it's very infancy (think 4-5 months old). We just saw our first month of profit and it was minimal but the company/idea has big potential long term, limited competition and is starting to get pretty solid traction without much marketing yet. 

This startup is an S Corp that a friend of mine (39F) and I (40M) started earlier this year and this person has put up more cash than I have, had the correct licensing in place already and more industry knowledge/experience. So a bit of a leg up on me there. My expertise is more backend...HR, People Ops, Hiring, Employee experience etc.   


That being said the partnership agreement that we agreed to verbally says everything will be split 50/50. I say verbally because I have signed the agreement and this person has not yet signed. 

  
A couple months ago they expressed a desire to pursue a personal/sexual relationship with me. Which I am not interested in pursuing and expressed my desire to keep things only professional and at the friend level. There was some light threats and gaslighting on their part followed by saying they wanted to end the business or stop working with me.   


After some time they came back apologizing saying they'd be able to compartmentalize and the business would continue as is.   


Months passed and things seemed fine until this week when I gave them a Christmas/Thank you gift for partnering with me and providing this opportunity...a ""I'm looking forward to doing big things"" type gift. Harmless intentions and a way to show my gratitude to a business partner.   


This triggered them and again they started pushing for a personal dating relationship. I again rejected  but was basically met with the ultimatum of ""since you won't be with me I'm ending this partnership and business"". Threats to remove me from the S Corp paperwork etc.   


The verbiage isn't as cut and dry as I'm making it sound. The ultimatum is obvious based on the situation but it isn't blatantly stated like that. They're also trying to take over my responsibilities (I think in a way to say see look I'm doing everything anyway...""since we're ending this anyway I'll handle \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for you so you don't waste your time on it"".   


No idea what the law allows in these types of situations...do I have legal ground to stay in the S Corp? Push for my 50% as agreed upon and if so for how long (most profit is probably a couple years out? Are contracts binding if only half the parties have signed?   


Plus a slew of other questions I have on this topic. Any help/resources is appreciated.

"I am posting a similar question I asked in r/tax as this may be a better forum to ask the question. I am planning to contact a local lawyer on the matter I think but in the meantime I am seeking advice from people here. The question is regarding common law marriage in Texas and tax filing status for 2023 year. 

We currently meet the status for common law marriage in the state of Texas which is as follows: “Texas’s definition of common law marriage is one where neither of the partners was married, both are 18 or older, they agree to be married, they are living together in Texas, and “represent themselves to others as married.” 

We share bank accounts, credit cards, apartment lease, she is my beneficiary and I am hers for insurance policies, ETC. Next year in 2024 we are having a traditional wedding and having a ceremony and whatnot. We recently got our marriage license last week since we are within 90 days the wedding however it has not been signed yet since we did not have the ceremony. 

She is a full time professional student and I am an engineer and we make around 200k so filing jointly would save a lot. We want to file jointly however I want to know if having the marriage license for our legal marriage for next year is a conflict and would hurt us in the event we were audited and would prevent us from proving we are common law married.

"  So this is for my Mom more than anything. I'm just looking to see if there's anything we can do. I'm writing on mobile so please excuse any weird formatting 

   My Mom dated this guy Kenny from Febuary till late July. He was kinda ok at first but showed his true colors in the last few months they were together, it's a story of it's own.
   The problem is that after they separated he was still driving a KIA that my Mom got so he can drive to and from work while they were together. The agreement was that since he still had possession of it he would make the payments on it, but in October my Mom was told by the dealers that not a single payment was made. She called and messaged Kenny telling him to pay but he kept making excuses till eventually in early November he refused to do anything.
    After fighting with him in this and only getting a single payment from him, my mom decided to just take the KIA back. This part is important; the KIA is by all legality my Mom's. Her name is on all documents and is the only one, Kenny has no claim to it. Mid November we go and take it back, after a fair warning that if he didn't pay the back payment we would take it on at specific date and time. Kenny agreed to pay initially, but closer to the pay date he refused and threatened to call police if my Mom stepped on the property. We got it back with no incident. 
   Now to today, a guy from the dealership came around 1:30pm and repossessed the KIA from the house while my mom was at work. He was respectful then and when my Mom called but said that payments were 105 days out of due. My Mom after getting the KIA did pay some of the back payments but the problem here was Kenny. The only payment that he made, about $300, was never actually payed. The dealer says that in their system the payment was essentially cancelled. Now my Mom has to pay $1,600 to get it back
    We know that Kenny did it on purpose. He's done the same exact thing before with a Sam's card he had that was also in my Mom's name. Is there anything we can do legally to make him pay for anything? We have texts from over the months of the agreement for him to pay, and him admitting that he owes her money. The only way we can get the KIA back right now is IF my Mom can get a personal loan for the money, but she'd have to place her truck as collateral and Kenny has essentially screwed her credit.

"Location is Florida.

11/10 I parked in my small suburb's downtown in a private lot not owned by the city. There was a sign saying in big letters you must pay for parking on nights and weekends. It was Friday afternoon so I didn't see the issue. Flash forward to today 12/19 I receive an invoice for $50 - $30 admin fee and $20 full day parking charge even though I was there less than an hour. It states I was parked there at 257pm but I have time stamped photos that I took at the restaurant that state I took a photo of my food (lol lame I know) at 933am.

I went back this evening to find the sign. There are two signs in the lot presumably identical. This evening one sign was in the middle of the lot. The other was across the lot nowhere near my original destination. The day I parked there one of the signs was actually at the head of the spot I parked in. Once I pulled in the spot my bumper blocked the rest of the sign and the other side of the sign was facing a wall with not much space in between. The photo proof they sent shows this. 

The fine print does state I needed to register my car even though they weren't charging. The fine print also seems to state if you're parking outside the paid times you must be visiting that particular plaza which I was not but the lot touches the building I was going to hence the confusion. 

The sign is approximately 3 feet tall with 2 different sides. On one side, half of the sign says in giant letters PAY BY PLATE, then slightly smaller says NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS. It then has a QR code to scan with the required pay hours. Then it says in even smaller letters all other hours are reserved for that plaza. This is the side that was facing the wall.

The other side has the same giant pay by plate text with nights and weekends with the following fine print underneath in much smaller text. This is the side blocked by my bumper.

1. This lot is being monitored for payment compliance.

2. If you park in this lot without paying or validating via our online system, you will be billed for, and you will pay for, the full day rate, plus admin fees, and your vehicle may also be subject to towing or impoundment

3. In accordance of law 18 USC 2721 the registered license plate may be used to associate unpaid bills with the registered owner (abbreviated without the fluff)

4. You are parking at your own risk. Owner of lot not responsible for damages etc (abbreviated without the fluff)

"I'm in Philadelphia, PA and I'm planning on breaking my lease due to unaddressed habitability concerns and a general culture of hostility that prevents quiet enjoyment of my unit. Some examples:

* The main issue is that the unit has had a huge house centipede problem since before we moved in (about a year and a half ago). We've also had cockroaches and mice in the past, but house centipedes are the main thing. The landlord was paying for pest control at first, but stopped. He then told us that we could continue to have pest control provided we pay for it, but told the pest control company they aren't allowed on his property. Before this, pest control kept telling him that the basement has structural issues and until they're addressed, the pest issue will remain unresolved. The landlord told us in August that they would make repairs to the basement and had everyone move their stored stuff out of the basement to facilitate repairs (he later claimed this was due to insurance not wanting people to store things there). The repairs weren't happening, so we gave them a deadline to make them and informed them that thereafter, we would repair and deduct. The deadline was months ago and the repairs never happened. The contractor that the landlord uses told us he was told not to make the needed repairs because they would be expensive. Meanwhile, we continue to have a house centipede issue.
* When we informed the landlord of our intention to exercise our legal right to repair and deduct to cover the $50 cost of pest control in line with the pest control company's recommendation and that we would of course send him a copy of the receipt, he said via text, ""if you do not pay your rent in full we will file to evict you.""
* The landlord has consistently said that only one particular contractor can make repairs on our unit. In addition to being a bumbling idiot (e.g., he once bumped the stove and left the gas on for hours while our cats were in the unit), he brings his dog to work. The dog bit me. He continued to bring the dog to work. The dog bit my partner badly enough that they needed to go to urgent care (which my partner and their insurance paid for). We informed the landlord and asked him multiple times to ask the contractor not to bring the dog anymore. The contractor continued to bring the dog to work.
* I noticed our kitchen sink was leaking in the basement and informed the landlord; our lease states that we need to inform them of needed repairs and I was worried about the added moisture attracting yet more house centipedes. The contractor eventually came to fix the leak, but he put locks on all the basement doors, blocking our access to what had previously been communal storage space. I heard him tell the property manager that the locks were because ""they keep going down there and bothering me."" (The basement is where the washer and dryer are, so yes, we do go down there often.)

We previously contacted a free tenant service and were told that we have grounds to break the lease due to the habitability issue. I also contacted the Dept of Licenses and Inspections on 9/19, but they're notoriously slow and haven't inspected our unit yet. We informed the landlord of our intention to break the lease, but he has proposed terms that seem more typical of situations where people break their lease for ""unjustified"" reasons—e.g., he's keeping last month's rent and security deposit, telling us to move out later than we proposed (our proposed date gives him 70 days' notice), and telling us our rent payments due are contingent upon his ability to find a new tenant. How do we go about breaking the lease due to habitability concerns in a legally sound way?

"First off, thank you in advance to anyone who can offer some guidance with this situation:

My mother passed away from ovarian cancer back in August 2022. Shortly before passing, she created a will and passed everything down to me. I was named her personal representative and executor in her will. Maybe not executor (I don't know if I saw that term) but I did see the phrase ""personal representative"" in her will. Her house was transferred to me when she passed (Transfer on Death Deed) and everything that didn't have my name on it was able to be recovered via Affidavits for Collection of Personal Property since no probate was necessary due to the amount of her estate. Overall, things went pretty smooth considering everything that goes into the process of when someone passes away.

Fast forward a year and a lawyer reached out to me saying that her law firm can move forward with my mom's Johnson and Johnson lawsuit. I had no idea what she was talking about so I told her my mom passed away. I guess my mom must of wanted to be in the lawsuit against J&amp;J due to her type of cancer and her using their baby powder for most of her life. The lawyer said I could move forward with the case if I wanted to but I would need to open up her estate and get paperwork that says I'm her personal representative. 

My question is - wouldn't giving her my mom's will be enough? If not, how much trouble/money is it to open up her estate (I'm in Minnesota) and what is the extent of this process? I just don't have thousands of dollars to spend on something where there MIGHT be a settlement. I would rather just put everything behind me and move on with my life but if it's not that much trouble to get the paperwork and would only cost a few hundred, I might be game.

"(TLDR: Entered clearly abandoned, but not locked, building on college campus. There were no visible signs saying not to. Was this tresspassing?)

I entered a building on my university campus that appeared to abandoned, condemed, or otherwise in disuse. The building had some interior lights on, the front door was cracked slightly open, and there were no visible signs telling people not to enter. It was obvious it wasn't in use when you looked through the windows, but it was even more obvious on the inside where there was junk, desks, and cracked glass everywhere. I did not enter with the intention of, nor did I commit, any crimes. I was just looking for good places to get photos on campus and got interested when I went past the building. I also notified campus personnel that the building door was open the next day. 

 I know I didn't do anything morally wrong or with ill intentions and I doubt the university would charge me even if I told them I went in.

"Context: 19 M, Maryland, Pulled over twice before 

For a bit more context, I received a warning both times I was pulled over. One was verbal for speed (over 1 year ago)  and the other was written for no front plate (the holding bracket was broken at the time, 6 months ago). No criminal record (if that matters). I fully admit that what I did was stupid, irresponsible., and dangerous.  There was only 1 other car in like a mile stretch ahead of me and I drive this road every day for work/school which is why I was comfortable with my speed at the time. 

I was pulled over last night around 12:40 AM by a state trooper and given a speeding ticket with 2 citations, Exceeding the posted maximum speed limit and driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable speed with my speed being 106 in a 65. In my county, these citations combined carry a $620 fine and 5 points on my license. At this point, I am just not sure what I should do whether that be pay the fines and take the points or request a hearing and see if I can get a lesser fine at least. Being a broke college student I am trying to find a solution that I can better afford and maybe get fewer points.

"Hello Everyone,

I'm seeking advice on a situation I've been facing at work. In the past couple of months, my new manager has threatened to fire me twice. The first instance occurred without any clear reason, and the second was related to an issue brought into the workplace by another employee, which is unrelated to our work.

Some background information:

I am currently employed in a student position at the university I attend. Our recently appointed ""Student Manager"" used to be a fellow student employee and now serves more as a supervisor, while I, along with two others, function more as managers.

About four months ago, when the current manager (let's call them Smith) was promoted, I communicated my expectation of a raise for the position I had been working in for about six months. According to our handbook, employees become eligible for a raise after completing three full months in the position, and this should have taken effect in the last raise period but did not. Therefore, I expected to receive it in the January 2024 raise period.

About one week before Smith got this promotion, someone made a general complaint about our office wait times. This complaint did not mention me, and I was not at fault. However, my former manager mentioned in their exit interview with me that it was not surprising that I was facing backlash for this, and they needed someone to blame, even though, in their honest opinion, this had nothing to do with me. After Smith got promoted, one of the first things they told me was that there was a likelihood I was going to be fired after their meeting with their boss the following day to discuss this issue. I was shocked because I had just been told that it was not my fault, which it wasn't!

Fast forward to about two weeks ago; I was once again told that due to issues outside the office with a coworker I live with, I was ""going to be fired if it wasn't resolved."" Despite a past argument, our interactions in the office have been respectful. We speak to each other when needed, and I don't work directly with them often, so I rarely run into them. In my opinion, everything is fine. However, due to rumors about us started by people who don't even work with us, I am facing backlash while the other coworker is not.

The people starting these rumors don't even work with us. We are all between 19 - 30 years old. We talk, hang out outside of the office, some of us are dating, and some students are dating former students who are now full-time staff. Everyone talks to each other, but there's no need to start rumors.

Fast forward to today, just about an hour ago. I asked Smith if I was going to get my raise, and they responded with ""not this coming raise period, but the next one."" As I mentioned before, in about a month, I will have started my position one year ago, and Smith is telling me I now have to wait seven more months. When I asked why, all they said was, ""remember when they wanted to *finger knife slide across throat gesture* you, that's why,"" and then walked away.

I feel I should mention all of these interactions were not in a like “meeting” setting they were all said during small talk/passing by. I have also not received any other warning or like formal sit down to discuss any of this. But in truth it makes me really uncomfortable and none of the other students get comments like this. 

This situation has to fall under some form of harassment, wage theft, mistreatment, pay disparities despite equal qualifications and experience, and wrongful termination without reason.

"I'm technically a minor and am still in high school. There is a mall across the street from said school, and every student loves going there. This is in Illinois if that makes a difference.

Basically heard the guy yelling after us, but I was trying to get out of there as fast as possible. 

We left the store and were wandering outside when the guy's friends started coming after us yelling ""bro why'd you say that shi, you need to apologize right now"" and I so i explained that my bf would only apologize if he apologized. The guy simply restated his opinion on my looks, and I just said thank you. I was still trying to get away from the as fast as possible, but there are Christmas decoration outside for the holiday spirit, the guys took off some of the GLASS ornaments and threw them at us. They also ripped off sticks from the bushes and were poking us in the backs with it.

 I started recording when we were a bit of a distance away from them. We went into a store as fast as possible, and I was tryna play it off by commenting on how cute the clothes look and looking at them, trying to look for an employee. The 5 guys waddle on in, and began telling my bf to take it outside if he wants to say stuff. They began yelling, and I just said ""girlie pop, calm down"" which really aggravated him and he threw one huge ornament at us, it hit both of our heads and shattered when it hit the ground. The guy left after that because he saw an employee coming over. They asked if i was alright and began to clean up the ornament.

"Hey Everyone, 

**First, I want to say sorry for the long post and thank you if you take the time to read or skim through.** 

I do not own a home so I rent. I am planning on moving in 6 months. As I consider different apartments, homes, townhouses, and etc., I am curious what is the best way to get the actual cost of living in these places. It is very frustrating that a 2-bedroom at Place A could be listed online for $1200 but does not include any of the additional fees they may charge for separately while Place B could be listed for $1400 with some things included. 

For example, right now my rent includes $15 for trash, $20 for Waiver Deposit Fee, $10 for pest control, $15 for Facilities Fee(which I gotta find out what that's about as I don't know of any facilities. lol). That $60 could all be included in a listing for ""$1200"" and another listing for another place may charge all these same things but not include them in the ""$1100"" which will actually be ""$1160"" after they add all those fees. Their application may cost more, higher deposit, maybe other fees as well. 

It's all very deceiving and does not seem to be easy to get information. Even when you spend time on their websites you find they do not have everything listed. 

Using [apartments.com](https://apartments.com), I recently sent out the below custom email which is restricted to 400 characters.. 

*""Hey Rental Team,* 

*I am inquiring about your apartments to get a real estimate of the total cost. I am currently renting at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and plan on moving when my lease ends June 2024. I need at least 2 bedrooms. I have roughly a 760 credit score. As I do my best to prepare, could you please tell me all your fees including the ""hidden fees"" and etc.*  
*Thank you,""*

I have not received any proper replies only information on current specials and links to their websites... LOL It all feels beyond disrespectful. Even if I could get someone on the phone to tell me the cost for some things and how they charge, how do I prevent other things being added prior to lease agreement and avoid someone last minute saying, ""oh, I forgot to mention xyz"" which could completely change my opinion or consideration of a place, ultimately wasting my time as only so many places will be available when I am ready to move. How do I go about this the best way? It seems like these places do not care and its more so a ""prize"" to be accepted to give them money lol People overtime have continuously allowed this kind of behavior/treatment as companies continuously find ways to deceive and misrepresent without facing any consequences. They can charge a facilities fee and an amenity fee and then its our responsibility to decipher their use of terminology. 

So, how do I fight this or at least best prepare myself with close estimates of full cost including things like application fee, move in fee, move out fee, if renters insurance is required, is there a parking fee, monthly maintenance fee, amenity fee, facility fee, internet fee, security deposit, wavier fee, and etc. to infinity and beyond. I have already started reaching out only because I know it can be very time consuming to get this information, see the place, apply, actually move, and etc.

"I am from the Uk. I travelled to the Middle East  for surgery.

Prior to travelling, I checked with the medical secretary whether AMEX was in accepted form of payment at the hospital. She confirmed in writing that it was.

I arrived at the hospital at 2 am. At approximately 2:30 am, an attempt was made by the finance team to charge my AMEX. The payment didn't go through. This was very surprising to me as I had more than sufficient funds, and I had also made a courtesy call the week beforehand to inform AMEX that I would be making a large some foreign transaction.

In the midst of all of this, I was wheeled off for surgery.

After the surgery, whilst I was recovering from general anaesthetic, I was basically labelled a thief for having the surgery without paying. I was also told that I had to get my things and leave because I was using up their resources and I hadn't paid for it.

In as much as I could under the haze of recovery from anaesthesia, I informed them of the situation and that there had been some sort of miscommunication by the medical secretary and that I did have alternative funds, but it wasn't going to be instant as my other credit card had a very low limit on it of approximately 2000 USD and the surgery was 6000 USD. This would mean that I would have to pay 2000 USD and then pay off the balance pay a further 2000 USD… so forth. To complicate matters even further, I had charged 1500 on this credit card at the airport so nothing was going to be instant. And that I was making all accommodation for their admin mishap.

Long story short, I was able to settle the payment in the above manner and it took over 48 hours to fully process because of the bank transfers. It's not the way I do things but I came fully prepared on the information I was given by them. It was their error. However, I was treated like a criminal, a floozy . I was told that they would refuse medical services, i.e. a hospital bed for nonpayment. I had given them my passport and all other details such as residential address in UK.

Apparently, it was my fault, because I should not have gone ahead with the surgery until payment had been fulfilled. I told them that it wasn't my job and it's not for me to interfere with their surgical schedule. This is their job and I am sure if I had said anything it would have been ill-received ie who does she think she is telling us what to do.

It is of note I was travelling to a middle eastern country as a single female late night and I didn't want to carry cash, nor did I want to carry multiple numbers of credit cards, especially as my arrival flight was at 1 am in the morning. I just didn't think it was safe to travel that way. I did make contingency plans, but my contingency was never dependent on them making the most fundamental error of saying, they accepted one form of payment, which they didn't.

However, for future reference - that I had the surgery without payment on Friday  but had not left and was not scheduled to leave until my departing flight on Monday morning - would this be classed as non-payment even though I had said I had sufficient funds but there was going to be a delay in full settlement ?

"Hello, 

This is based in Colorado. 

I live in a condo building and my HOA manages our gas bill, the gas company tech took my personal land line and hooked it to the gas meter to read it remotely. They were not given any authorization by me, or my HOA to use any phone lines. 

This led to my incoming calls for work being shorted out and failing, leading to me losing 3.5 days of wages due to company policy with phone line issues. 

Really just curious if this is something the gas line would be responsible for with my lost wages, and monthyl phone bills I have been paying for the land line. 

Also was not sure if that would fall in to FCC violations or issues without having authorization and comandeering my phone line. 

I am the only person authorized on the phone line, and the only person paying that bill.

"I (37m) have ADHD, depression, and anxiety.  Which I think counts as a disability.  Recently had to cut out extremely toxic family members.  I recently got a new job that starts January 2.  It is in another city about a 5 hour drive away.  So I will need to sell my house, and get a new car, get a new phone number and phone so my family will never be able to contact me.

"My partner was in the hospital receiving treatment for leukemia a couple years back, and a nurse improperly operating one of the machines providing treatment gave her a pulmonary embolism. She survived, and fortunately had very little outside of pain as a result, but had to spend 3 nights in the hospital, and racked up somewhere in the neighborhood of 56k of bills from that stay. (The bills for the hospital stay and treatment from the embolism are also in contention.)  
She retained counsel, but the attorney seems unfamiliar with basic facts of the case when discussing the settlement offer with her. He seemed to be under the impression that she was in the hospital one night at her request, rather than the reality that she was told by hospital staff that she needed to be monitored for 3 days. He was a bit aggressive at pushing the settlement, which was also much lower than they were anticipating when they were pitching her on their services. He seems really unfamiliar with medical jargon altogether.   
It definitely feels like the more experienced litigators with the hospital are taking advantage of a lawyer who doesn't normally work malpractice cases.

"Hi, 

I wanted to inquire about noise complaints. Pretty much downstairs neighbors keep complaining about noise from our unit and 99% of those complaints are from us walking in our own home. Not even stomping. Our relationship isn’t great but at this point there’s not much we can do. Floors got redone and added 1/2 inch of cork. Area rugs added. They keep saying they called police and they knocked on our door but they never have. Just wondering if they can really take any legal action. HOA hasn’t said anything to us either.

For reference we are in a condo and in California. We never play music and rarely have guests. Since they can sometimes hear my 18 lb dog running. I think the flooring is just absolutely terrible. Before the floors got redone they would knock on our floor with a broomstick very aggressively whenever we tried to clean vacuum, even when I sneezed one time LOL. 

Is there anything I can do legally? Or protect myself legally. All advice is welcome legal or not with noise. Thank you!

"I live in New Jersey and basically in October, I had really bad cough and chest pains. After work, I went to Urgent Care and was told I have COVID but since I was saying chest pains, they strongly suggested going to the ER for a chest xray to rule out pulmonary embolism (their exact phrase). I went around 7 pm and despite the nurses knowing I was there for chest pain and possible pulmonary embolism, I was in the waiting room for 5 hours. I was finally put into a room around midnight and was told someone would be monitoring my heart monitor while I waited for the scan. Someone came in to do the X-RAY a little before 1 am. The technician said the scans are uploaded immediately so someone will be in shortly to tell me what the next steps are. It is a little after 6 am, I am still waiting to hear any of my results, I detached my heart monitor hours prior so I could move around, I have been calling for a nurse for every ten minutes for hours because...pulmonary embolism...am I dying?? Finally a nurse comes in and I ask if the results are in because I have been here for well over 8 hours, not eaten anything (which I am diabetic so that's an issue) and I want to leave. She left the room, came back a few minutes later and said there is nothing wrong so I can leave. Yayyy. Fast forward a few months and I am being charged thousands of dollars for ""extended service"" in the ER. Their response is since I was checked in before 12 am and signed out after 12 am, it qualifies as a whole day of being in the ER and the fee includes the treatments I received. They could not offer a breakdown for ""extended service"" because it is a baseline charge apparently. I then received another bill saying I owe money to a different medical company because the physician who oversaw my treatment was not an employee of the hospital but was the medical companies employee working at the hospital. I do not understand how I can be charged for extended stay.  I should have been seen earlier due to the severity of the issue and they should have given my results faster so they can have a bed for the next patient. The whole thing seems to be the hospital wanted to keep me hours longer than needed so they can charge for extended stay. I guess my question is, is there anyway to dispute the extended stay or the physician charge?

"Hello - Throwaway account since I have another account that people in IRL know.

I am host on meet up . I have a small group that does weekly activities for people in the 20's and 30's (although we are open to all ages). I was talking to a friend and they mentioned they would never host since there is lot  of legal liabilities. It made me wonder what those could be. I normally host a happy hour at a local bar and the occasional seasonal event (hiking, painting).

What are my legal responsibilities when it comes to hosting? For example, if someone gets too drunk at the happy hour and they get a DUI or in a flight, would I be responsible?  Everyone buys their own stuff - maybe I will get fries or chips.

"Sorry for the long story, I'll try to make this as short as I can. My daughter's old dentist set up a treatment plan to fill in cavities on her two front teeth. He left prior to the appointment, so new guy comes in. Says he can't she needs crowns/veneers. I balk a bit due to cost and he gives me info for dental school. NOBODY can reach them, not me, not the assistants, not the dentist (allegedly). So I tell the front desk I'll pull out the money from my 401k to cover it, just tell me the copay. Was told 1k, so I get the loan out and set the appointment, paid the copay prior to it. So go in today to get it done. There was no treatment plan set up and everyone is trying to figure out what's going on, miscommunication with office and folks in the back, oh well, mistakes happen. Afterwards I ask since we know what happened, can we just get the treatment plan set up and get her teeth fixed afterwards, basically set a new appointment. Never see the dentist, he refuses to see her or even talk to me and her, says he won't due it because of hygiene. She may not have the best habits but has been brushing, flossing and using the water pick (I watched and made sure). The guy doesn't show his face, and has his assistant try to call the dental school again or find another one in the area. So can't get her in until February.

TL;DR - Selling my dad's (who has alzheimer's) plane as his POA, but it's registered under his LLC and the FAA is making a fuss about me being able to sign as my dad's POA for the bill of sale/transfer of title. They say the LLC is a separate entity so I can't sign, but I would be signing as my dad's representative who is the sole ""member""/owner. What do I do?  


In the past year and a half I have pretty much taken over my dad's entire well-being/affairs as my brother and I discovered last spring that he was effectively cognitively and financially destitute with early dementia being a main driver. We figured stuff out, got him moved closer to us by buying a house and recouped some of his financial loss through selling what property he did have, which I immediately put into an investment saving account that he doesn't have access to (he was spending hundreds of dollars on snake oil, amongst other things). He was a pilot and shortly before all this crescendoed, he had two small planes that he respectively totaled in a crash and punched a hole in the firewall for who knows why, rendering it not airworthy immediately and incredibly dangerous (plane maintenance and alterations are BIG DEALS with the FAA).   
SO, obviously my dad is not flying anymore and I'm not about to trailer and hangar this plane that doesn't fly/that I also have no interest in fixing up. We found a friend of a friend to buy it, but here's my problem; it's registered under my dad's LLC. I have a durable POA which I assumed would allow me to sign for him as his representative on the bill of sale, but the FAA is saying that because an LLC is a separate entity, I can't do that. I'm really confused by this because as my dad would be signing as the sole member FOR the LLC, how does a durable POA not apply here? He not capable of living independently and has continued to decline significantly over the past year and a half, so it feels cagey to have him sign something when he doesn't have the ability to understand what's happening (and this isn't legal as far as I'm aware).

"Hi, all.

I'm hoping someone here can help me discern what my husband and I should do.

Long story short: we bought our home in 2017, and with it came a Werner Company attic ladder S2208 Mark 2. This year, when my husband went upstairs to get our Christmas decorations, one of the hinges popped right off. No one was hurt, but the ladder was unusable. So I went online to find a replacement hinge and info about the company so I could see if maybe it was still under warranty...and found a huge class action lawsuit  had been settled over this ladder and its hinges, which were known to be defective some time ago.

I called the company and was told that a. they didn't manufacture the ladder, and they had bought the company from a family in a bankruptcy sale in 2007 and b. they are offering $50 gift cards to anyone who had that ladder. Okay, fine, I thought. I sent an email as requested.

Today, I get back an email that said:HelloI am including the information that is needed for me to request a gift card for you.  I am sure (*the employee I spoke with on the phone...not sure if names are okay to post here*) explained that there has never been a law suite (*sic*), nor did we ever make this ladder.  Please read the information and reply with the required information.Thank youHave a good Holiday

The OCD in me got stirred, as yes, there was a lawsuit, so I searched for it, so I could correct her and link it (yes, I am that petty) and I found that, yes, it was against their company (not the previous one) and yes, it was settled.

Here's the problem: in the final settlement from 2013 (pdf here: [https://www.classaction.org/media/clemans-v-new-werner-settlement.pdf](https://www.classaction.org/media/clemans-v-new-werner-settlement.pdf)) it states:

""The settlement is binding on all members of the Settlement Class. TheSettlement Class is defined as: all individual persons or entities in the United States whocurrently own a Werner Model S2208 or S2210 steel attic ladder designated as Marks 1, 2, 3 or4 (an attic ladder which was manufactured from September 2003 to September 2005 andcontains one or more cast zinc hinges). Excluded from the Class are the Judge assigned to thismatter and any member of the Judge’s staff and immediate family. As indicated andspecifically defined in the Settlement Agreement, claims for personal injury are specificallyexcluded from the Settlement and are not being released in this litigation. This Class satisfiesthe requirements of Rule 23 and is properly certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) for the purposesof settlement.""

Am I reading this right? I'm a bit confused by the wording here, and before we do anything rash, I need to know: are we part of the ""settlement class"" (In the US? Check. Own this monstrosity? Check. Not the judge or a relative of? Check.) and as such, are we entitled to a replacement ladder (and as such, should we duke it out with them, and, if necessary, contact a lawyer)? Or should we accept the $50 card and take the loss?

These attic ladders aren't cheap, and if we are entitled to a replacement, we don't want to accept a small-ish gift card. Don't want to screw anyone over...just want to be able to get into our attic again!

TL/DR: Defective attic ladder that came with house broke. Was a class action against the company some time ago that was settled. Wording in the settlement wasn't clear to me, and I want to know if we should accept the offer of a $50 gift card or if we are entitled to a replacement.

 I finally got around to sending them back in September and the vendor told me that the time limit had passed and they wouldn't do anything for free anymore, when I asked them to show me where on their website it says there's a time limit for repairs they changed their story to ""We'll talk to the optician"". A couple of days later they told me that the frames don't fit me and that's the problem (something I have never heard of before), and they would either remake the glasses at a discount in new frames or I could refund the frames but not the lenses as they have a no returns policy. 

Their website under warranty says 

All Rx-Safety frames are fully guaranteed against manufacturer defects (material and workmanship) for one year from the date of purchase. This does not cover negligent use of the product (including scratched lenses). Rx-Safety will repair or replace any defective merchandise at no charge.  
\* 100% accurate to tolerances mandated by law or by common practice.

To me glasses that you can't see through are defective but the customer service rep tried to convince me that that only applied to the frames.

I've been arguing with their customer service reps all day now trying to get them to either fix the issue or refund the full amount and they refuse to budge, is there anything else I can do? I live 7 hours away so I'd rather not have to go to court.

"I was in an automobile accident in 2022 and was rear ended. Other party at fault. Went to the ER to get checked out. The other party’s insurance would not pay the hospital and kept dragging their feet. The hospital debt was sent to a collector. Finally, by January 2023 they sent me a check to cover the entire cost $1200. The reason I paid with the check the other party’s auto insurance sent me was because for 6 months, they said they paid the hospital bill which was in fact incorrect. I did not trust them and paid it from the check they sent me.

The debt collector sent a letter and agreed to collect $600 if I paid within 2 weeks. I did. I wrote down the payment, confirmation/receipt number/person I spoke etc everything. (This is with Medicredit)

3 weeks later, a debt for the same original amount, for the same hospital/account number/ and date of service  and hospital costs for $1200 was sent to a different debt collector (NPAS). I called NPAS and they said send over proof where I had within 30 days to dispute it. I did, twice and the first time was within the 30 days. I called again saying it was paid off and once again would only take paper confirmation. I did it again, this time certified mail.

"So...back in April, my family and I moved into this seemingly really nice apartment/townhome complex. There had been some bad reviews but at the time of our move in, a new management company had taken over so we figured the problems people complained about would be gone (which is what the new management company promised). However, within just a couple weeks of us moving in, we quickly realized how shittily things are run around here. There's been A LOT of problems but the major thing has been the mail...

In JULY, some idiot broke into all the mailboxes and we have not been able to receive mail ever since. The management company requested the Post Office to hold all of the residents' mail. However, in October, the post office said they would NO LONGER hold our mail because the complex had not fixed the boxes. 

I made a report to the Better Business Bureau about it as well as the other things management has failed to do and BBB mediated a correspondence between me and the company. Basically, the company says that since they are 3rd party, they don't not have obligations to fix or repair anything around here. Their main purpose is to collect the rent/fees and keep the property clean. And that was it!!! 

So I put in an INDIVIDUAL request to the post office to hold MY mail and the post office is saying they will not honor the request because they've officially cut service to our complex address! So now, we have to pay for a P.O Box. 

This is so ridiculous. And the thing is, we're not getting reimbursed nor is the company deducting rent. They are still charging full rent plus additional bullshit fees for every little thing. I just don't feel like we should pay full rent when we're not getting the full services.

"Not sure this is the right flair but fairly certain this is the right sub. Please correct me if I’m mistaken. My questions are at the end.

I’m not entirely sure exactly who this long winded set of questions should be for, but maybe y’all can help me figure out. To make it simple I will include as little detail as possible, but please do ask any questions that would help you help me.

In 2020 I was sued for libel / slander / defamation in federal court by two people alleging I had helped create and operate a conspiracy to ruin the career of one or both of them. These two people happen to be my adopted uncle and my biological grandfather, but that doesn’t really play a role here from a legal standpoint.

In late 2019 and 2020 my uncle was accused of a few different things. Legally I can’t go into much more detail than saying there were sexual assault allegations involved. One of the things I can say, is that I truthfully came forward with my own story of how my uncle both threatened to kill me when I was a child and physically abused me on two separate instances. I had made several online posts detailing this and that he was facing other allegations. I went into more detail than I am here, and one of the reasons their suit wasn’t immediately thrown out was because I had reposted some things other people were alleging. Throughout the case they made numerous false claims about me, and set up a website to facilitate the spreading of those claims.

Long story short, after a couple years of representing myself pro se, the suit against me was dismissed. I agreed to fulfill an agreement which stipulated a few things that I have done, and also agreed I wouldn’t share or repost anyone else’s allegations against my uncle without the proper legal context. Such as the use of the word “alleged”.

Representing myself may have been quite stupid, from a legal perspective, but being broke it was my only option at the time. Considering many of the decisions throughout the suit were made in my favor, I don’t think I did too bad. 

Since the suit my uncle and his PR team have continued to operate a website and a PR campaign that actively seeks to disparage me and make my uncle look good. The website in particular, contains a few blatantly incorrect statements. They have continued to operate it and update it’s contents regularly. They are also incredibly wealthy and somewhat famous, while I am quite the opposite. I can’t afford fancy lawyers or an entire PR team.

My questions would be:

 Is there any legal avenue I can take to gain repayment for all my time and effort spent defending myself? This would be in regards to the suit that was dismissed, however if they decide to reopen a suit against me it would also apply there. I don’t know if it would be called damages? Or if this is even a thing? Like can I claim my own legal fees? I have spent countless hours fighting claims that the judge determined were inadmissible.

Do I have my own case for a defamation suit for their website and articles that slander me? I’m thinking yes, but I can’t afford a lawyer and my understanding is this would be difficult to handle on my own. I found it was easy to defend myself, but I wouldn’t know where to start as far as initiating a suit and have had no luck finding an affordable solution. For example I’ve contacted a few lawyers who offer representation on a contingency basis, and it hasn’t worked out.

Again I’m happy to provide more details if I can. This is being brought up for me due to some family that continues to harass me about the subject, and their website that still exists. I also am simply not willing to let go of the fact that they got away with wasting so much of my time and energy. It’s a slap in the  face, especially when they are still relatively successful. Am I petty? Sure, but I would still like to hold them accountable.

"So my neighbor across the street has several dogs, many more than our county's limit for one (not that they hardly bother to enforce it), but the issue is their dogs Always get out of their fence from their front yard. They are smaller dogs but they roam the street and chase, bark at, and try to bite people and other dogs. Currently one is in heat and 2 male ""strays"" (one I've seen wandering the general wider area for months but I believe lives up the street somehere) have been coming every day relentlessly. They enter in through a hole in the neighbors iron bar fencing and they go in and out of it, all day, every day. We've talked to the neighbor that owns most of the dogs, she has mental health issues though and is honestly kind of scary, but she always shrugs it off and says she ""tries to keep them in"". While they do stay around the general area when they are home as soon as they're gone for the day the dogs are back outside up and down the street. The other neighbors and I have put up with these neighbors and their dogs for a long time because animal control never does anything anyways.

Except now our mail carrier, which I totally understand, has decided to not deliver mail to our street for the next 2 months. The situation won't be changed in that time though because without something done the dogs will still be there. 

It's extremely common to find loose dogs in the surrounding areas I live in (I'm in California btw) and animal control hardly seems to care. I called 3 days in a row when I first wasn't receiving my mail and these dogs were constantly out. They sent someone 2 times who just drove by and claimed they didn't see anything and there wasn't much they could do. I told them where most of the dogs live, what they look like, when they are usually out, etc. and they basically just treat me like ""Yeah yeah crazy lady we'll get out there eventually.""

They told me over the phone to take photos and videos, which I have plenty of. They told me to even try to catch the dogs myself and keep them/transport them elsewhere so they can pick the dogs up!! Except I have caught a stray dog in the past in the early morning and called multiple times and animal control didn't show up until the Next Afternoon when the dog had already escaped my care overnight after I did the best I could to contain it for hours. So I can't catch 4-5 small to medium sized dogs and hold them until they decide they have time or take them to the shelter myself. 

What are the next steps I should take, and who should I go to about this? The dogs are not skinny/unhealthy looking but they are always looking for water and live outside in absolute filth on top of it all. One of their dogs was hit by a car a couple months ago and when we found the dogs body and told them they could really care less. I'm so upset at these people and the owners of the other 2 male strays that let their dogs roam. I can't even take my own dogs out in our own neighborhood and yet I feel like nothing can/will be done.

"In October, my 2018 chevy colorado with 30k miles on it caught fire (flames coming out of the hood) when I was driving. Of course, I did the responsible thing and pulled over/turned off the ignition and called the fire department.

I had it towed to the closest chevy dealership where they did a tear down inspection and could not determine a cause. GM then sent out their own inspection team and made us wait 2 months for a report that they would not let me read and simply denied my claim stating ""They could not determine that any parts caused the fire based on how they were manufactured"".

The vehicle is worth about 27k KBB and there's about 13k in damage mostly the entire wiring harness needing to be replaced. The dealership has no idea when they might get a new harness but said probably 6+ months. Insurance offered 12k (after the deductible) and the dealership offered to buy it as is for 10k.

At the present, it looks like my only 2 options are to let it sit for upwards of a year and hope that it gets fixed eventually or take a 5k loss (insurance payout + dealer buyout). We've already spent $500 in extra childcare and vehicle rentals trying to deal with only having 1 car while both me and my wife work and have kids in school.

I feel like there's got to be something I can do about this. Cars, especially that low of mileage, don't simply catch on fire when maintained. Insurance will not give me a rental because the car is not actively being worked on.

I'm definitely feeling stupid about turning it off.

"Traveling to work recently, I exceeded the 20 mph speed limit in a school zone, reaching 30 mph. As someone new to the US and with a relatively new driver's license, I'm seeking guidance on how to proceed. The citation offers three options:

  
• Pay the full fine and accept a conviction. This would impact my driving record and potentially raise insurance rates.

• Complete a driver safety course and pay half the fine. This avoids a conviction but leaves the citation on my driving history.

• Opt for deferred disposition. This involves pleading guilty, paying the fine, and fulfilling conditions like a driving course. If complied with, the charge is dismissed. However, non-compliance results in the original charge with potentially harsher penalties.

"Hi everyone ,

I moved out of my apartment October 6,2023 and it is now December 19, 2023 I have not received my security deposit back nor have I received an itemized list. I’m in Wisconsin and in Wisconsin a landlord has 30 days to either send the full security deposit amount back or an itemized list . I have a 30 day notice to the landlord face to face and I also gave a  return address over the phone when moving out. Today is the first time that I reached out to them regarding this issue . I have been given the run around the whole day regarding my security deposit. They are now beyond the state limit for returning the deposit .There should be no reason for them to hold it besides me leaving a few things behind in the apartment . I typed up a letter that I am getting ready to send off regarding suing if they dont comply . Do I have a case ? Also if they send an itemized list stating any damages etc would that still be applicable considering how they’re beyond the state limit of returning the deposit or sending an itemized list ?

"State of Oregon.

**To quickly summarize the event:** We were all at a work holiday party that was organized by the workers, and not the company itself. It took place at a hotel banquet room. Several of my coworkers got hotel rooms for the night. I did not. 

Long story short, one of my male coworkers (married, like 20 years older than I, with kids) had a hotel room that night. He found an excuse to walk me to my car under the guise of ""making sure I get there safe"" but then kissed me really long on the cheek and hugged me squeezing me for a while. He then insisted that I take his hotel key card, saying I could ""come back anytime"", and even once I was in my car, knocked on the window and was trying to give me his key car through the window. Which I declined obviously

Needless to say I am wildly uncomfortable and don't want to work with him again. Free lawyer consult and work management basically saying since it wasn't at work they don't have grounds to likely transfer him to a different facility. 

I think I need to leave because he really creeps me out now and I don't want to see his stupid face again or that he retaliates and tries to slander me or make my life miserable. 

**TLDR**: Coworker made sexual advances and unwelcome touch at non-work sponsored, work party off site and I think my employer basically can't do anything to remove him from my workplace. 

Are there any ""malicious compliance"" things I can do legally to have some leverage or teeth in the game?, like warn the other women about him, or ways that I can try to get him to leave or other consequences for him that are legal? Or contact his wife somehow and warn her? Or any other options that I am not thinking of?

"Location: Colorado

Sorry for the long story, thought detail might help - TLDR at the bottom of it.

Long story  as short as possible: I moved to a small town from Denver a year ago (dont want to say town as its small and dont want to blast the dentist this is about).  Havnt had any big dental work in my life aside from Wisdom teeth being removed and a few cavities here and there.  Moved to the small town and dentists nearby are few and far between.  Ended up going to 1 a year after I moved, he said I needed 6 new cavities which seemed like a lot, so I got a second opinion from one of the only other dentsits in town (she takes my dental insurance, the first guy did not).  She confirmed that I did need 6.  Some were because old ones were going back, some were now.  Keep in mind I've had cavities filled before, and never had any issues afterwards.  So I scheduled and this dentist who took my insurance got them done.  This was on a Thursday.  The following monday I was experiencing significant pain and issues over the weekend so I called and the dentist was out that day, but she saw me next day (tuesday).  She proceeded to kind of brush it off and did some bite adjustment but to me basically seemed like a ""good luck, hopefully it gets better"" kind of visit.  Starting that Thursday (1 week after original fillings), I proceeded to start having horrible mouth pain from the lower left hand side, and this whole Time I had a ""Food pocket"" (Crater in teeth where food got stuck every time I ate on the upper right).  I was taking advil and tylenol every 4 hours alternating and took Oxi to sleep through the night.  Monday I called again, and she was out, but they saw me that Tuesday.  Again she basically shrugged it off as ""bummer, that sucks nothing I can do or did to cause it"", but recommended me to an endodontist (Dental specialist for anyone that might not know) in a bigger town nearby.  I found a endodontist that I had recommended through family instead in Denver.  I got into him 1 day later (Wednesday).  Right off the bat he was horrified by the filling on the top right that was a ""Food pocket"".  There was just a giant gap in the filling causing the whole issue.  For the fillings on the bottom right, since we couldnt pinpoint exactly what tooth it was coming from.  He wanted to hold off on doing any root canals, but did a big bite adjustment that helped a ton, and no longer required me to be taking that much advil/tylenol.  I was luckily able to get into my old dentist in denver that same day who replaced the Horrible filling she had done, and my top-right was good.  However, the bottom left has proceeded to keep being painful.  Eventually the endodontist thought it might be a filling issue, because of the top right and the signs werent quite there exactly for a root canel.  He repalced 1, 1 week ago, and just did the other (didnt have enough time to do both the first time).  He THINKS this will solve the issue but not 100%.  But he did say the fillings the dentist here had done were absolutely abysmal, and turned to dust essentially when he took out the top layer, so that would have definitely caused a lot of this feeling. 

TLDR - Dentist in small town botched fillings causing immense pain for weeks.  Endodontist in Denver and dentist in Denver I believe have fixed all the glaring/big issues, but confirmed they were all caused from the small town dentist. 

**My expected action** \- I'm DEFINITELY going to have my endodontist put together a report of his findings in a professional way, and bring all his bills, as well as my dentist in denver bills who did the corrective fillings, to my dentist in this town.  I believe she should reimburse me for everything she did, and pay for all these bills that have been incurred from her work.  And this might not even be the end as there is a tooth thats still a small issue, but dealing with the bigger stuff first.   I am NOT going to go to the dentist here with bills until we have 100% resolution of the things, so not jumping the  gun.  Asking this as a pre-cursor to get ready assuming this fixes everything big.

**My Question** \- Should I get a lawyer on my side before I go to her with all these bills and have them draft something professional, or is it something that I should handle on my own, and if she refuses to pay for everything, THEN get a lawyer involved?

The total bills for getting my work done from her is \~$500 that I would want her to reimburse.

The total bills from the endodontist + the Denver dentist is \~$2,000.

"tl;dr Neighbor didn't like that we put up a wooden fence so installed a landscape bed right along our fence so she didn't have to look at it. It's also where heavy storm water naturally floods so her landscape bed floods every time there is heavy rain. Threatened to sue us after we had a patio installed claiming that is the cause.

Last year we had a fence installed inside our property line per city guidelines/code and our neighbor has been bitter towards us since since she hates the look of wooden fences. We also decided to install a paver patio because of grading issues along the back foundation wall which caused flooding in our basement. We figured if they have to regrade anyways for a patio we might as well do that. During the installation of the patio our neighbor had a landscape bed with privacy trees put in right along our fence (technically partially across the property line) so she wouldn't have to look at the fence. Part way through the patio installation we got some heavy rain and her landscape bed unfortunately flooded which she blamed on our patio claiming that it was changing the natural flow of water. In actuality the low points in the yards in our neighborhood are on the property line so the water naturally pools there which is exactly where she put her landscape bed. I have pictures of this flooding prior to fence and landscape bed installation. Again before the patio was complete we received some more heavy rain which flooded her landscape bed yet again. She then threatened to sue us unless we did something to fix the water issue again claiming that our patio was the cause. Overall the only change of waterflow we did was fixing the grading issues so it was no longer flowing towards our foundation, and moving the downspouts from 2ft in length to 8ft in length. The end of the patio is probably 30ft from property line, and closest downspout about 5ft. It now flows towards our backyard as expected. In the end she said if we extended the downspout closest to her further than 8ft it would be fine so it was extended to 24ft. She's been nothing but trouble since we moved in so we don't exactly trust her.

"Hello everyone.

I live in an apartment building with 5 units, and I just moved from one unit to another a little over a month ago due to mold issues. Our unit is approximately 400 sq. feet.

I have no control over the heating. When I first moved into the new unit, it was consistently in the 50 degrees Fahrenheit range. For the past few weeks, its been in the mid-70 degrees, which is uncomfortably warm for me. I have no control over the heating, nor do I know who does. There is an old thermostat in the unit, but it does not work, as I have recently set the temperature to 50 degrees with no change. 

I just received my energy bill today and it is extremely more expensive than usual. Our energy bill is typically between $13-$25 for anywhere between 20-100 kWh. However, this most recent bill was $69.28 for 346 kWh. I don’t believe I have changed any of my habits regarding the electricity use.

I have texted the building manager to ask who controls the heat and to see if that’s what I am being charged for, but have yet to receive a response.

I don’t want to be using the heating to the degree that it is being used. If that is what is causing the bill to be so high, do I actually have to pay for it? Or in general, what can I do in this situation?

If he’s not there when we show up for inspection do we have to leave or can we still inspect the outside of the house?

"I travelled to Europe to visit my family over Christmas. I brought my passport with me but for some formalities I also needed my government ID - which I, unfortunately, forgot in the US...

I managed to find a friend who would mail it to me with the most expensive 1-day shipping option. I saw that as my only hope to have it delivered so close to Christmas. Of course the ID did not show up on time and any attempt to use any of the online functions to manage shipping address, leave instructions or change the delivery time failed with cryptic errors... This effectively ruined my holidays as I had to travel to another country to get a new ID and spend most of my holidays doing various organisational stuff... Shipping the ID was my attempt un-fuckup a situation that has cost me close to 1000$ so far and I still may have to change departure flights for my whole family...

Admittedly, this is all my fault and I understand that the delivery times are not guaranteed. Next time I will also reconsider sending anything with a service that has average rating of 1.2 star out of 5 from 30k reviews on trustpilot...

However, to put the cherry on top of the terrible experience the UPS sent me an email that I now should pay 13EUR customs on my (now invalid) goverment ID that is contained in the package. That is after I paid 170EUR to deliver my key from Europe to the US (which didn't come on time and couldn't be used, but I found someone to let them in) and 90$ to send my ID back using a service that doesn't work.

"Hello sorry will be messy and long. I was meant to be traveling from the states to the UK with a pet. The process is a nightmare where i had to involved an agent, vet, broker, carrier, and cargo(somehow separate from carrier, but under the same flightline) . The process was a nightmare but according to everyone by email all paperwork was accounted for and all information was taken care of. 

The issue started when the carrier I been talking to for over 2 weeks comfirmed on multiple emails I required nothing else to travel. All I had to do was show up drop the pet off for her flight and pay the invoice and sign off on her travel. I called the night before to the cargo company asking how early to drop the pet of for her flight. I was told 2 hours. I show up 2.5 hours early. I was told i had missed the flight and she can not board. Then argued that they now only have 2 hours to place her on the flight and i had 6 hours worth of paperwork i needed to fill out. When I gave them the invoice number claiming all paperwork was accounted for with the carrier who told me all i had to do was arrive with the pet and give them the invoice. The cargo company processed to tell me I am missing paperwork claiming the breed of the cat. All official documents i had were signed by the vet and by the USDA verifying the cats breed. They claim that the carrier is responsible i call the carrier who on 2 of the 3 calls claim that the cat was set to board. The 3rd blatently said that its the cargos issue and to solve it with them. Each time cargo refused on behalf of the carrier even while on the phone with the carrier who stated that it was not an issue. It was not till after the flight left did the carrier sent and email of what the cargo might have been talking about. The agent and broker agreed that the paperwork the cargo was requiring is unnecessary redundant and completely unverifiable.

"Hi all. We live in a quadplex owned by private landlords who live in 1 unit, with 3 other units occupied by tenants.

We believe our landlord is violating the Colorado Warranty of Habitability as well as Denver municipal code. I've linked them below:

(not a .gov but an explanation of state laws) [https://www.coloradolegalservices.org/node/342/warranty-habitability#:\~:text=By%20law%2C%20every%20residential%20lease,“fit%20for%20human%20habitation.”](https://www.coloradolegalservices.org/node/342/warranty-habitability#:~:text=By%20law%2C%20every%20residential%20lease,“fit%20for%20human%20habitation.”)

&amp;#x200B;

The first issue is a rodent infestation. We first noticed a mouse in out kitchen on 11/06/2023 and immediately notified the landlord by text. This is the usual method of communication and one they've told us to use. Landlord said he would come by with a mouse trap that night and but did not actually give it to us until 11/08/2023. We did not see any mice for 9 days and then on 11/17/2023 saw 2 mice again. Landlord said to put cheese in the traps and we requested pest control to come address it.

He acknowledged the pest control request and had them come out on 11/22/2023. The pest control technician laid out a few more traps and did nothing else (we were not in the unit at the time). We again saw mice on 12/04/2023 and were told the pest control tech would be coming back on 12/07/2023 which they did and completed the same steps as before: checking the traps and moving them. We were home and were told to keep any food put away as well as dog food which we'd already been careful to do since the initial mouse sighting.

We do not believe this constitutes appropriate extermination. No gaps/holes/entrance points etc were ever blocked or even viewed by pest control. Our understanding of CO law is that we can give a notice to vacate 10-30 days from now provided the landlord does not fully address the issue within 5 business days. We aren't sure if the initial contact about it starts the 5 days or not as it took longer than that for them to get pest control here.

&amp;#x200B;

The second issue is regarding privacy as there is very little sound insulation between units. We understand that some noise is normal and acceptable but based on how much noise we can hear from the unit next to and below us we simply don't feel comfortable being in our own space. Some examples of what we can hear: normal conversations (we can make out every 3rd word or so), tv/movies, yelling (when they fight), the microwave being opened and closed, cooking/stirring sounds, one time an early morning alarm, and worst of all we can literally hear the downstairs neighbors \*shitting in their toilet\* (like hear turds dropping into the water).

We believe this is mostly due to the fact that our unit and the unit below share an HVAC system so all of their sound travels through the vents. We've requested that the landlord address this issue by having sound dampening material put into the HVAC. We've also requested that they add some sort of sound insulation between our unit and theirs (they have the other upstairs unit).

When we moved in we did not realize the extent to which our unit and the one below are connected. We did specifically ask the landlord prior to signing a lease what the noise levels were like between units and were told (paraphrasing): oh it's very quiet, we don't really hear our downstairs neighbor at all, it's quiet. We feel that this was grossly misrepresented to us.

&amp;#x200B;

We've already found several options for us to move into immediately and we need to know how little notice we can legally give. If we can get our deposit back and avoid paying a lease break fee, even better. Also worth noting that we have made several hundred dollars worth of improvements to the unit (with permission of the landlord): had bathroom tile and bathtubs resurfaced at our expense, replaced the kitchen faucet.

Edit to add specific questions we need answered:

How little notice can we give to vacate? 

What steps, if any, are we missing to ensure we follow laws to communicate with the landlord?

Is it reasonable to expect our full deposit back and/or a waived lease break fee in these circumstances?","Denver, Colorado - Help with tenant/landlord laws regarding privacy and warranty of habitability",18mci8h,1703019911.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18mci8h/denver_colorado_help_with_tenantlandlord_laws/,

"I was previously working at a corporate office job for the past few months (resigned now) where my manager would repeatedly ask me to work overtime and tell me to underreport it on my time card so that my time card shows that no overtime was worked. Occasionally he would suggest things like ""I need you to work 6 hours overtime on monday, and I'll let you have 3 hours off on Friday, but you need to report a flat 8 hours of work each day, with zero overtime."" Is this illegal? Are there grounds for a lawsuit for my manager to have said this, or is it only illegal once the action is performed? Additionally, is it illegal from the worker's side to report the time card incorrectly, and for the manager to not pay for the overtime? Or since no overtime, was reported, its technically fine for it to be unpaid?

"Hello,

I live in CA just to start but my landlord of a low unit apartment keeps bothering me and my partner. I have a ring camera and have permission for it and have been documenting a lot.

For context the mother[90] owns said complex and the son [70 ish] lives and ""manages"" the property with his wife. The wife declares herself a landlord tho and that she does the property managing and all. The wife is absolutely the issue. She knows I personally have been through a lot and always wants to tall to me and put her problems on me and says we are ""friends"". I'm at least four decades younger and recently her car broke down while she was dealing with family issues and she proceeded to ask me if she could borrow and use me or my SO car. Sparring the details she is also always yelling and screaming with family and her kids at awful times of night and it's a nightmare sometimes. The anxiety it brings me even when I'm not home is immense. She even let in a repairman that didn't show up when supposed to without asking us. As if that isn't enough me and my SO are working to make our lives and start our family and I hate that she can be like that to us. Our downstairs neighbor has it rough too and had his car repod or something but always asks for rides even tho the bus is RIGHT THERE. He pays them 5 dollars each way. Whenever it's convenient to her she asks us to take him which we recently started to refuse since we have enough stress and life problems. They're daughter who's my age also had a kid recently and is telling me I should get pregnant bc she's on EBT and they give her a lot of benefits and other things which i politely declined saying as though I grew up fucked up and I wish to have a career before a kid.

Is there anything I can do to combat all of this? I don't believe this is how a landlords relationship with tenants should be and I'm unsure of what I can do to make them back off and not put their problems on me and my SO. I'm not necessarily looking for compensation but peace of mind would be a blessing. They're pushy and don't accept no as often as they should and it's overwhelming trying to figure out my life as well as my partners when they push us. He's fed up and so am I especially since they keep asking if we're getting married or this and that. They also accuse us of being rich somehow and I'm over all of it.

I have the videos and a text confession from him.) and now I'm in the review stages with the office of the city attorney. 
We had our separate hearings scheduled for Nov 14th. In the hearing the guy said that they are giving him the benefit of the doubt and that they'll settle it outside of court if possible.

My ex then postponed till December 19th. Which was yesterday. I want to call them for an update but I'm worried what they'll say or that they'll try to make me say something to give them a pass to not take the case seriously.

He also asked me if i think there's something wrong with my ex. I told him yes, i believe he needs mandated counseling to make sure he never does this to someone again. After that he kept bringing it up that I said that. However can they force him to get counseling and make sure that they know why he was sent?

He also recommended strongly that i seek counseling through them and that i seek a restraining order but I'm feeling like his goal is to make it seem like it's all taken care of so they don't have to follow through. 

What I want is to know what I should or shouldn't say in hearings because I want them to prosecute him so that I have credibility that he did what he did. I want accountable for this and also for him slandering me to people so that he could make me look crazy in case I decided to tell anyone.

"Hi, I got into an accident  and while my insurance deemed me not at fault, the other party insurance deemed it my 100% fault. However, after viewing my dashcam, they changed their tune and said 50% my fault. When I submit the damages to them, they denied it and retracted their offer. Now claiming I'm 100 at fault. 

(They did not report the accident to their insurance nor to the rental company) It took my agent and I 3 months to get a hold of them. They actively ignored the calls, emails, voicemails, text messages)

They concluded there is no reason why their driver should be in my lane and because there is no video evidence of him hitting me. It's he said, she said.

Accident: Dual turning lane. Other driver was on inside turn only, while I was on outside turning/straight lane. His lane is a turn only lane, while my lane is turn and go straight. Other driver went straight instead of turning. Video evidence shows me clearly in my lane and using common sense, the accident can only happen if he goes straight.

I have a police report but since police didn't arrive until after the accident happened. The report doesn't help.

Leasing company is terrible for 2 years. We leave, they never returned deposit. We let it go. Good riddance. Got a call last week from a collections agent saying I owe leasing company money. The debt is not on my credit. I don't live in the state anymore so small claims would be expensive and very challenging to travel back and forth. What do?

# The Story

I rented a house from WLC. They did shady stuff frequently, such as send techs to maintenance requests, the tech would say ""it's not broken"" and leave, then it would still be broken (dishwasher, clothes washer, air conditioner). Then they sent a letter telling us rent would be increasing and they asked us to sign a lease. We said we would agree to sign the lease if they would fix the stuff that ""wasn't broken"". They ignored my email. Then they raised the rent on my lease statement anyway. I told them I refuse to pay extra until they fix stuff, they said that wouldn't happen, I said I wanted month-to-month, they agreed and demanded 60 day notice, we started paying the extra amount.

We gave them 60-day notice to end our lease July 31. We had plans to move to a new place and I was going to start school, but then my father got diagnosed with kidney cancer that required surgery on August 1, so we packed up and left in a hurry on July 20 so we could drive across country in time for Aug 1. I promptly emailed the leasing company on July 20 to let them know that we left. I gave them the front door codes and garage code and told them I left the keys on the counter (if it matters, this is also how they handed the home over to us. Here are the codes, keys on the counter). They called me after that and I spoke with a manager who confirmed the codes, took down my forwarding address, and thanked me - very friendly, no problems.

In August I got a bill from the electric company covering August electricity. I emailed WLC to ask them to pay the bill and to confirm that they were getting the electricity in their name. They ignored me, so I called the electric company to remove myself from the electric bill. I continued to email WLC to sort out the electric issue, and I started questioning them about my deposit. In that state, deposits are required by law to be returned within 30 days OR a receipt be sent out for what the deposit was spent on. WLC argued that because I left the home in a hurry, I disrupted their usual process and they still needed to do the move-out inspection. By the time they responded, it was Sept 1, and I responded once more demanding my deposit or a receipt, as they were exceeding 30 days. I pointed out that my email and phone call with them on July 20 gave them 8 business days to handle the inconvenience of my not following their standard procedure. At this point, they've had 41 days to schedule and perform a move-out inspection. WLC did not respond to the email.

Last week, on 12/12/2023, I received a call from a collections company demanding $3000 for property damages on behalf of WLC. I asked Collections where my deposit went and to send me paperwork for this debt. I also asked for proof that WLC tried to contact me. I haven't heard from WLC since the email I sent on Sept 1, 2022. Collections did not know about the deposit and refused to provide documentation. They said WLC sent a bill to me at the address I was renting from them, which makes no sense because how could I have possibly seen that letter? We filed forwarding addresses with USPS and with WLC, so there should be no reason they can't find us. I was starting to think it was a scam.

I logged into my old WLC rent payment portal and found that in fact there is a $3000 charge on my ledger for damages including ""paint and wall repairs"". I was able to get ahold of a customer service rep at WLC and explain the situation. He confirmed that the debt is real and that they sent it to collections. Over the next 3 days of speaking with WLC, he reported that he spoke to the Delinquency manager who ""did not see any discrepancies on the move-out report, so he's checking with Maintenance to see if there are any maintenance charges and to find out where the charges are from,"" but apparently the person who used to be in charge of that no longer works there and they're having trouble tracking down the information, etc. On day 3, WLC still had not provided any sort of documentation or really any assistance at all. I demanded to speak to a supervisor, and I demanded that WLC provide me with a copy of the move-out report, maintenance report, proof of how my deposit was spent, proof that they tried contacting me about debt, proof that the debt was forwarded to Collections, and a mailing address for their company. After a few hours, WLC wrote me back with the phone number to their legal team and said I should contact them if I need further assistance. I called the legal team phone number twice and left a voicemail. I have not heard back yet.

I have a credit score &gt;800. I have a good job and enough money to pay any debt that I *actually* owe, but I won't just give money to anyone who calls, especially when I have $2600 in deposits that are unaccounted for, and especially not to WLC who has an F rating on Better Business Bureau and made my renter life miserable for 2 years. As of right now, the debt is not showing on my credit score. I have contacted 15 different law firms via phone (leaving voicemails) and email, and so far none of them have responded or have responded that they don't deal in landlord issues. I tried to emphasize that I am happy to pay them for their services - I would pay an attorney more than what I ""owe"" WLC, just to see WLC burn. Still, I haven't found someone willing to help.

My theory is that WLC does not have documentation to back up their claim, so they won't put the debt on my credit, and they hired Collector to try to squeeze me for the money. If this theory is correct, I can tell the collections man to stop calling (or block his number) and go on about my business, however I don't like leaving these loose ends.

"So this morning there was a knock at my door a form one. Anyway I was asleep on my couch, I got up to look out the peephole and see a young man standing on my step. I didn't recognize him and don't know who he was so I didn't open the door or say anything. I figured at worse he may just trying to solicit something or could possibly be for the county. I didn't feel like dealing with it and was waiting for him to go away when I heard my lock being played with. I look at the peephole again I see him actually trying to enter my unit the deadbolt unlatches and I open the door before he has a chance to just walk in. I asked him in what the hell he was doing and he said he was with pest control. I was pretty confused because I never got any word about pest control and have never seen them in the 1 and 3 months I been here. He said that management said that someone had requested pest control and I asked him if he tried the unit next door and he said that ""she also said that she didn't request pest control"" and I said yeah I didnt so I don't know. He said ""hmmm that's weird"" as if really didn't have a clue as to what was going on.

so I was confused also and irritated as to why he was knocking on my door if I never requested pest control and why he would just open my door as if he was authorized to do so.

I called the property manager and he acted like it wasn't a big deal and claimed that pest control was doing its 3 month scheduled cleaning. But if your telling pest control I requested a service when I did not I feel that's an issue.

 I asked him how could you just send someone to my apartment without notifying me. I explained to him that I wasn't happy about that because I could have been in the shower or in my bedroom and then happen to ask in on a stranger in my apartment. He stated ""I can enter you apartment anytime I want I don't have to give notices"". In GA it takes that atleast 12 hours notice should be given. This could have been a potentially dangerous situation for either parties because again had I been in the shower or just decided to lay down and not go to the door( which I feel I have the right to not answer) I would have had someone who I didn't know walking in on me. The property manager who is some kinda isrelli or some form of middle eastern made it seem like I didn't have any right or claim for being upset and told me he didn't ""like my tone"" like dude Im a grown man coming to you with a legitimate complaint and I feel have the right to be upset in my tone! Especially when your brushing off my complaint and acting like it doesn't matter. He told me to come to the leasing office (guess he want some confrontation which ihad no issue with cause I at this point I went being irritated to pissed off that he was acting like it wasn't a big deal) He accused me of being s trouble maker and we ended having a few words back and forth in person.

It thinks it pretty disrespectful to just send someone over to my unit without notifying me and the fact I'm being told to different things from the pest control guy and the landlord makes me wonder who's lying.

"Hello, I was wondering if it was legal for landlords to deduct from security deposit charges for carpet cleaning and pet deodorizing ($554.70), state it didn't work and then replace the carpet anyway ($565.99)

Damages were documented prior to signing the lease so they were aware. Eventually, over the span of the two year leasing with them, the carpet got torn up on the other end connecting to the living room so the carpet and pets have caused it to stained, so it reasonably had to be replaced.

"Hello, I desperately need advice on what steps to take next. I feel stuck and as if I am not being listened to.

Summed up, my issue is I need out of the household with my Mother. She is neglectful and puts my sister (F11) and I (F17) in dangerous situations. However, my issue is getting my sister out with me.

I’m aware my opinion will be listened to in court because of my age, but I know my sisters will not.

My family history involving custody is a huge mess, and far too complex and long to explain within this post but I will do my best to give context.

We are happy with my Dad. We are cared for and feel safe and less stressed, previously our Dad was abusive but within the past two years improvements have been made as he lost custody of us and needed to change to get it back.  

My current trouble is that the family therapist is out of country, and a parent coordinator is getting involved when she should not be. She is holding meetings involving me, and taking my Mother’s side. She will not listen to a word I say, and when I have valid proof of neglect she says that the focus is to “move on” and “not be stuck in the past”. She is extremely hypocritical (Ex. says she doesn’t like pictures/recordings, but takes recordings my Mom sends her of our conversations [that i am not aware of, she doesn’t know I found out] seriously and won’t take pictures from me to show proof of what is going on.) She also states my Dad is alienating us when he defends me or gets involved.
 
The parent coordinator says that I am coaching my sister to say she doesn’t want to live with my Mother, and that I am highly manipulative and lie about what goes on (keep in mind, I have PROOF of what I am saying, but it isn’t being taken into account)
I very rarely mention my Mom to my sister, most of the time she comes to ME saying she doesn’t want to live here. I am not coaching her.

So, how do I get us BOTH out? I refuse to leave her behind and alone but this is driving me to the point of suicidal thoughts just to get out and I know that option is even worse. 

We cannot afford a guardian ad litem. 

I have leverage that will get my Mother arrested but I do not want that result. My sister still wants to see her occasionally and I want her to grow up with a mom that isn’t in jail. (It involves giving me nicotine, and other substance, telling people about that just feels wrong.)

Things are progressively getting worse, we need out soon. My Dad has a lawyer, we have a family therapist for when she gets back in a couple of weeks, my sister has a therapist. 

I already have a Google Doc put together filled with texts, images, receipts and things such as attendance

"Hi all, I have an older 1990s Japanese car that only a select few people can work on. For this reason, I drove from central Ohio to around Philadelphia to buy a newly built engine off of “the guy to go to” for these cars when I needed to replace mine. This is an actual well known shop and not just some guy in a garage. After getting home and installing the engine, it started leaking coolant and then spun a rod bearing almost immediately. It was obvious that it hadn’t been built right as he missed many deadlines and rushed to get it complete. When he finally told me to come pick it up, after driving all day and arriving at his shop, the engine was in pieces and I had to wait 7 hours for him to build it while I was there in his lobby. 

 Surprisingly, the guy was helpful after the engine blew and said if I brought the car back to him and the issue was found to be of his doing that he would rebuild the engine and replace it for me. All I had to do was bring him my car. So I took a second 14 hour round trip to drop it off. Long story short, this was in early summer of 2022. It is now almost 2024 and I still don’t have my car back. I have received every excuse under the sun from him, and probably about 10 missed deadlines. I had been super understanding and patient with him until the last month or so when I really started to grill him on when I would get the car back. Even a full engine rebuild and replacement can be done in a week, even 2-3 months would be understandable. 

At this point I have received confirmation that the engine has been removed over the summer, so simply going to get my car from him as is would not work as it is in many pieces. This isn’t my only car so I have transportation, but it is getting to the point where I’m starting to think about how to legally solve this. Being in Ohio and him in Pennsylvania hasn’t made it much easier. He has stayed in communication with me but it’s just never ending excuses.

Of course I said yes put that money back. I then requested the statement of account and found that the next day after my mom passed, my sister had her daughter make out a check my Aunt signed (as signor on the account as she lives in the same city) to her (my sister) directly, sister then cashed it and left the state. She had indicated to me in an earlier email post-confrontation (I have texts) that my mom sent her the check to help pay for a car - which is obviously bullshit. The bank indicated to me that money in the checking account was not part of the estate, my sister knew that and took advantage of my aunt signing a check (it has Bills written in the memo) before directing me to sign a document from the bank closing the account. The bank said because my aunt signed the check there was nothing they could do but seeing as how my sister tried to move money and got caught, you'd think the bank would contact me when the check for $6K was presented by my sister.

"Okay, so I’ve been looking to buy a car and I came across a Facebook post of someone I went to high school with selling one. The car was $1300 so I messaged him because I noticed he said he’s also accepting down payments. I offered a $300 down payment to which he was like yeah cool, send it when you’re ready and I’ll put it on hold for you.. the next day (today) I got paid from work and sent the money on Apple Pay. I then got a message from some number saying “ Apple Pay: You just get a refund of $300 from [redacted] because their Apple minimum is $301 the refunded will be available in your bank account in the next 24 hours sorry for the inconvenience” followed by a link that led nowhere. Obviously a scam so I confronted him about it on messenger to which he kept trying to give me the runaround and ultimately ended up blocking me after I offered to just pay the amount in full, in person..

"Ex girlfriend refuses to give me back my belongings and my dad's tools, says the tools are hers and that I have nothing there.

Hello everyone I'm seeking advice on an extremely stressful situation with my ex girlfriend.   As of yesterday afternoon we have broke up.  With my background with her I decided to enlist the help of her local PD to accompany me over there to retrieve my personal belongings as well as my father's tools that are there from a stair railing project we were working on for her while she was out of town to attend her son's graduation commencement.   For quick backstory we(gf) began painting the house as she wanted to change the scheme up to something fresh.  We got to the railing at the bottom of the stairs and decided to take it out and I was going to install a new modern one with horizontal balusters.  In over my head so I reached out to my dad to help me with the project.  He came over with a lot of his tools.  We only worked on the railing Friday and didn't make much headway.  Saturday I worked 10-630 so I got to her house at 7. My dad was going to meet me there, but apparently he had other things going on so I decided I'll let her know whats up and I'll go back to painting.   Finished all the painting about 2am and went to bed to go back to work the next day(Sunday) She calls me when she got home and was so appreciative of the great job I did with all the painting and the boys bathroom.  Couple hours later she calls again and first words out of her mouth are why is there 3 screwball shooters in the trash.   We did have some of those Thursday night before she left on Friday.   She was adamant she threw them away and the garbage man took them away Friday morning.   I was at a loss and there was no way of proving I didn't buy anything, even with showing her my recent transactions.  She then asks who I had over at her house when she was gone.   She then asks why there's 9 truly cans in the garbage.   I had those Friday and Saturday night while I was painting her house.  She took everything as I didn't do any work, the railing wasn't done, and all I did was sit around and drink the whole weekend in her house.   Says she feels used and disrespected.  Hung up on me and I decided this time I'm not calling back, I'm done chasing.  Flash forward to yesterday (Monday) I reach out to her and things seems fine, but in hindsight they definitely were not.  I was going to pay her rent on Friday but my gut said don't do it she'll break up with you right after she collects the money.  Well guess what, I did send that money,  and right after she got it, just starts railing into me calling me a pussy, a bitch, you're no man, you're not shower worthy, etc just awful awful things.  I hang up, she texts me to say we're done don't ever call me again.  Perfect,  now how do I get all of my stuff back?  With iPhone once you're blocked you can still leave a voice-mail so I left a cordial message asking when would be a convenient time for me to pick up my belongings and my father's tools.  She called back a few hours later saying you don't have anything here, and that the tools there are hers.  After work yesterday I stopped by the PD to speak with an officer about how to proceed with this, as I definitely did not want to go there alone and catch a case with her making false accusations against me.  Three officers rolled over there with me and attempted to make contact at the front door.  Nobody answered of course,  her son was home and called her.  She called me while I was in the presence of the police, the officer requested I put the phone on speaker.  First words out of her were ARE YOU AT MY FUCKING HOUSE?! One of the officers introduced himself and explained they were there with me to retrieve my personal belongings and my father's tools.  She told them I have nothing there and that the tools they saw through the front door are all hers.  After hanging up the officer who spoke to her said this isn't the first time we've been her for this, whether it was ex bfs or contractors.  When he said that it was just another blow to an already horrible day.   The police said it's a civil matter and there's not much they can do now at this point.  I thanked them for their time and service, and went on my way back home. I'm just absolutely devastated as I have basically all my stuff over there, glasses, contacts, all my nice clothes, shoes, jackets, golf clubs, tools, various odds and ends, and to top it off now my father's tools are over there.  I feel so terrible for now involving him in this situation as he needs those tools to do the jobs he works.  My father is filing a civil suit today, can he add me on there,  or do I need to file a separate suit? Is it even worth it to do all this?  My father reached out back to the police later last night and asked if the garbage is free reign for me to go through on garbage day.  The officer gave his blessing as long as I do not go up on the property.  Any help, or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

"Hey all, looking for as much advice on what to do as possible. This pertains to my Sister (S), and her STBX (D). 

To give as much backstory as possible:

1. D is military, and due to that, S has raised their two children (2.5F, 7months M) pretty much on her own. She and their oldest child lived with him in NC where he was stationed, but moved back with us in TX after he drunkenly attacked her while she was heavily pregnant with their second child (He was not arrested for this offence and was sent to the military base instead).
2. The few times that D was here, he didn't take care of the children, and left that to the children's maternal grandmother (our mother). All this to say that he never bonded with the youngest child, and barely took care of the oldest child even when he was around.
3. When D was supposed to drive down to our home when their second child was born, he instead got extremely drunk and totaled his vehicle. This is not the first time that he has driven drunk, and he has also done so when the children were in the car.
4. S had enough when D began to cheat on her with multiple women. He refused to give her back her things unless she drove back up to NC with the children. She did so, and while there, he drove drunk with both her and the children in the car, and after an hour of berating her, she snapped, spilt out the beer on his clothes, and slapped him. This lead to her being arrested. In that time, D lied to law enforcement, committed perjury, and filed a false order of protection against her on the children's behalf along with himself. This was later thrown out as it was proven to be incorrect (he didn't even get the children's genders correct on the official notarized document), and instead a different protective order was set against both of them, so that neither were allowed to be near each other, unless it had to do with the children, or with a police escort. 
5. The military has been told about all of his illegal activities, but we don't know if they just don't care, or if there is an internal investigation going on. 

I believe that should be all the relevant backstory to this ordeal. What we are dealing with now:

1. S filed a temporary custody order, to which D was supposed to show up with the children, but he refused to drive down, and didn't show up. Because of this, we were awarded full custody of the children. Because we are in TX and D is in NC, we had to wait for all the paperwork to process before we could schedule a court date over there for the exchange.
2. D texted S multiple times saying that he would never give her the children, and a custody order won't force him to give them back. He no longer has any custody over them.
3. D is hiding out at his unknown girlfriends home, and is switching between that place and his own apartment. We don't know if it's because they can't find him, or they just don't care, but the local police are unable to serve him. The Fayetteville police are known for corruption and no doubt have a bias towards military personnel, so we are under the belief that they don't care enough to keep trying, but this might also be our personal bias against them for how many times they've failed to protect S from D. When S was there for the original court date, she was told that because he wasn't properly served, he wasn't forced to be there. The judge said they would go to his work place, but the second court date has come and passed, and he was never served. 
4. S wants to get the children before Christmas so they can have a happy Christmas instead of being hidden away. D is holding the children for ransom and refuses to let them come for Christmas unless S signs a notarized document saying she won't go for full custody, which no doubt came from his lawyer who probably doesn't believe that there is anything he can do after all the bullshit he's done to get any sort of custody.
5. S wants to go over there to get the children because she has court ordered custody, but the police refuse to help her, and said they would arrest her instead because of the original protective order.

My question is, what can we do? We want to get the children back, but the ransom isn't something that we are willing to do, as it will only harm the children further if D is allowed to be anywhere near them, and after this, we don't trust him to not kidnap them and disappear with them forever. Is there anything we can do to get the kids back? Or is our only option to wait until they find his hiding place and serve him if they are even trying to do that?","Got a custody order, other parent avoiding law enforcement to not be served, and local police won't help getting the children back.

"I need help! I live in Florida and a few months ago I was in a bad car crash. A person driving their mother’s car took a red light at a high speed and hit me.

I’m a paralegal but not super well-versed in landlord-tenant law. My boyfriend and I just moved into a nice apartment complex. It started off as really quiet but now we are woken up at several hours of the night every single night.

It’s a large neighborhood but with smaller unit buildings. There’s a first and second level and a door on either side of the building to enter and exit. People slam these at all hours. The neighbor below us repeatedly bangs on shit at like 6am every morning. Her boyfriend bangs on the sliding glass door right under our bed every night at midnight. Music blasting across the hall.

father has been getting scammed constantly- has lost over 100k due to scams. I took him to the Dr and he was diagnosed with dementia. He has no assets and only gets social security.

"There is a lot of background to this story, but to make a long story short, my car had water intrusion that affected many of the internal electrical components. After filing a comprehensive claim with my insurance, the insurance opted to pay for repairs rather than totaling the car.

After all the repairs were completed, the dealership (where I did the repairs) discovered that the odometer was reset and they have been unable to retrieve the original mileage from the computer. Now the dealership is telling me that Mazda isn't letting them release the vehicle to me unless they know what the mileage was so they can put it on a sticker on the car. The problem is that I don't have any recent service/proof that independently verifies the mileage. I do all my own oil changes and my car hasn't been in a shop in 3 years before this. The best proof I offered so far was a screenshot from my personal Carfax account where I track my DIY maintenance that shows an oil change in May 2023 with a specific mileage. I also sent them the receipts for the items I purchased to do my oil change in May, but that only helps prove I did an oil change, not what the mileage was. I was planning on going over to the dealership to talk with them in person today, but if they say my proof is insufficient, what options do I have?

What would be the next steps? Does my insurance need to get involved again? They already paid over $10,000 to the dealership to the electrical repair work. Is this enough of an issue to just total the vehicle for legal reasons, even though it is completely functional/operational after the repair minus the reset odometer?

Hi everyone. I moved out of my wealthy baby daddies home(never married).  I regret having a child with him, but here we are. My 3 year old son is a great boy, but it’s tough out here financially in CA. I work as a substitute teacher and live in my own 2bd 1ba federal section 8 housing apt and so far “share” (not on paper) 50/50 custody of our son. The problem is… baby dad somehow weaseled his way back in. I need tires, and some child support and he swoops right in. He is a narcissist so everything is always transactional and he always pushes for his way (especially with sex favors). i’m sad to admit i willingly had sex with him for tires under the guise of “hanging out.” It’s such an effed situation. 
I’ve already paid a lawyer to handle the 50/50 custody situation, but I can’t go to trial! i have no more extra money. And of course he knows a wealthy lawyer. I love being away from this guy. he just stresses me out. He is starting to want a BJ or sex every time we hang out with our son and i don’t want it! He makes my skin crawl. I kinda want to die, but my son is such a sweetie full of innocent happiness it’s precious, even tho he’s a pain in the @$$ lol. I’m on antidepressants to cope, and i want to move out of state.

"Hello, I'm not well versed with contracts or business matters, but recently purchased a very small business in a service industry. In this industry, it is incredibly important to have customer records, consents, customer provided documents, etc.

The business I purchased was originally considered a part of another business, which is currently still in operation at a different location under the original owner — the assets I purchased were essentially cut out of the other business and sold to me. These businesses always had separate names and locations, to make things clear, but what I purchased was technically considered part of the other business until the sale.

I signed a bill of sale entitled ""exhibit a"" which listed physical equipment, appliances, and tools that were being sold to me. For simplicity &amp; anonymity's sake, let's say that the value of these items had I purchased them brand new would have been about $10k. However, as part of the overall contract I signed, I paid ""$20k"" for the items listed in Exhibit A, as well as ""the inventory of the business"" and ""all transferable licenses, permits, consents, and approvals, if any."" These things are collectively referred to as the business's ""Assets"".

Where I believe the sellers damned themselves here is with the language of ""inventory of the business"" which *may* include customer data depending on who you ask, but they certainly damned themselves in listing ""consents and approvals"" because there were consent forms that were included amongst the customer files according to previous employees, and I even still have the blank consent forms. According to the former employees, all customer files (including names, phone numbers, etc) were included in a file box that was apparently removed from the premises during the sale of the business.

There are also these passages later in the contract that I believe may prove a breach of some kind: ""The Seller's business shall be conducted only in the ordinary course and consistent with past practices"" and then ""The Seller shall not dispose of, encumber, assign, or mortgage any of the Assets"". With the consent forms being explicitly mentioned as an Asset and having been either disposed of or withheld from me, I believe that alone proves a breach of contract, but since I'm not a lawyer I really don't know.

I'm just curious if there's any action I could take that would have any worthwhile result? The success of my business relies on customers returning for service (and being informed that the business has re-opened) and with the customer information not being transferred over not only makes it near impossible for me to function at anything but a loss, it means I paid nearly double the value of the equipment that I actually received because I agreed to the price under the assumption that I would be receiving access to the business's customers along with it.

"So a little backstory - I was involved in a car accident a few months ago, and I have done all the usual as it was not my fault - got an attorney, went through phyiscal therapy, have been documenting all costs of appointments and follow up and such to the best of my ability. PT recently cleared me to attend chiropractor care and resume my gym workouts along with home exercises from the PT regime, so I went to the local chiro to see what they would say/if they could add anything to my treatment plan going forward.

I forgot I had seen them a week before the accident, and my records indicate that the spots that need to be adjusted are consistently the same - including yesterday when compared to the earlier visit a week before the car accident - same vertebrae subluxation and tenderness, and also had notes that I have said I've had back and neck pain since high school.

This chiro also does not take insurance, so for the treatment plan I was given it's a minimum $300+ out of pocket in a visit package - but if the visit before the accident will end up hurting my case I'm not sure I should continue seeking treatment through them, even if I likely could get costs reimbursed by the settlement.

Is it possible that a) the car accident could have aggrevated an already weakened/prone to pain neck/back as stated in my intake before the accident, b) strengthening and recovery through PT helped somewhat while I was only doing that (no chiro while in PT), and c) because chiro care was not consistent it's showing the same results as my intake despite months of PT?

Basically, due to chiro records being the same pre and post accident, do you think it could jeopardize my chances of a settlement? I'd be happy if it at minimum were enough to cover co pays and missed work hours, but if my team wants to fight I'll take whatever they can get me.

"Hi, I’m a musician who has been having a very unfortunate problem in protecting their rights to a song that has already been released. I had written a full set of original lyrics, a vocal melody for these lyrics, and backing vocal harmonies as well. I had been working on a release for this song, as part of a collaboration with another musician. They had written an instrumental beat for the song. Their friend mixed and mastered the song.

This collaborator was a friend for 2 years, before we started working together to release this song. We had been working amicably and slowly for 3 years, as we both have other jobs, but closer to the planned release date (which we had decided together to delay a few times). I had a series of family emergencies come up right before the release. Suddenly, we couldn't delay anymore, they didn't want to, and it was at this time when this other musician assumed a lot of control over the song, against my wishes, they just did this without me being present virtually, as we would screen share whenever we collaborated, we live in two different states pretty far away from each other b— the release date, the promotion, the merchandise, and most critically, the royalties and credits for the song. They are the sole account holder for how royalties are distributed, it is unclear to me if they even did this in such a way where I could receive royalties at all. And they had credited themselves as the sole writer of the music, while only crediting me for my lyrics. Their friend who mixed and mastered the song doesn't even have a 1% credit on the song. The vocal melodies and harmonies were all made by myself and myself alone, I have dated recordings and texts with this other musician to back this up. They also had shipped a bunch of merchandise to my address, and they said this was for me to give to my family and friends (they asked me how many copies of this CD I would need and they gave me 5 extra, amounting to 30 total). Now, they’ve been hassling me for months in text about, “Hey, have you made any sales?” while I was still in the midst of a family emergency. I'm really disgusted that they were unclear in their intention in sending me merch, and never told me they expected me to sell this on my own accord, when it was meant to be sold and distributed through Shopify. When I expressed that I don't have the space in my life to be finding physical stores to sell our merch in and that my family emergency needs to come first, they then questioned if I was really me, on the other end of the phone, and accused me of having a stolen identity when I couldn't hop on a phone call with them on a whim and asked them to email me since I'm so swamped with needing to figure things and stay safe. I'm really confused as to why someone I thought was my friend, is now acting like a complete scammer, and pressuring me onto the phone with threats.🤨 They then sexually harassed me via text when they didn't get to talk to me right away. When I called it out they said it was ""strictly platonic"". I just want to end this relationship and get the credit I deserve.

Between the error in the credits, the lack of transparency in the release, and other problems with their personal behavior, I have been quite concerned. Their actions are not only feeling unprofessional, but exploitative and unsafe, and I want to sever all contact with them immediately. My problem, though, is that now that this song has been released with this other musician credited as the “sole writer of the music”, I don’t know what my rights are as a musician to perform or record the lyrics and vocals for this song, in new contexts.

I want to ask r/legaladvice, What are my options for being able to protect my rights in performing and recording the lyrics and vocals of the song, while still cutting all contact with this other musician or affiliated party? They told me I need to be paid by Zelle or check and remain in contact with them if I want my shares, I don't want to do that, I already have songs published under my name and I gave them the information necessary so my shares would go directly to me, this was completely ignored by my collaborator, who claimed they were confused and made a mistake. But the weird pressures to immediately speak on the phone and sell our merch in person, started to really paint a picture for me, that this person is a liar. I want to avoid as many legal battles as I can. I would really like to pay for a copyright registration, for my parts of the song (where I could credit myself alone). I’m not exactly sure how that would work, in this unusual context where the song is already released. I also plan to tell this musician everything about how I feel, how they did not give proper credits, how they haven’t been transparent in their actions, how they’re exhibiting the behavior of a loan shark, and how I never want to work or speak with them again. I have this all outlined for them in a 30 page document, ready to send to them, but I want to sort everything out on my end before sending this.

Thanks for any insight you can offer, happy to clarify some details.

TL;DR: Want to protect my rights to record and perform lyrics and vocal melody for a song that I had released with a collaborator, who took advantage of me while I was going through multiple family emergencies, and released the song without properly crediting me for my part as a co-writer of the music. They have also exhibited disturbing behavior (loan shark practices and sexual harassment) that make it unsafe to remain in any further contact with this person.

"Is a contract without a price, nor estimate, nor fee structure, nor any specification of what the amount to be paid will be, still a valid contract?

Is the threat of losing lawful status for a foreign national, loss of two years of salary, loss of the privilege to live with my wife, etc. if one does not sign a contract enough to constitute duress? For example, I never would have accepted to pay an unspecified amount if it weren’t for the threat of losing those things.


Context: I am an international student in the US with F1 status. My alma mater, located in Indiana, is the only entity allowed to provide me with an updated Form I-20  (“Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status”) required for me to apply for the STEM OPT extension. Without the STEM OPT extension, I would have had to terminate my contract with my current employer in Texas two years earlier than planned, I would have had to move out of the US to avoid the loss of lawful status, and I would not longer have been able to live in Texas with my wife who has a job in Texas. In order to get a new Form I-20, I signed a contract with my alma mater agreeing to pay an undisclosed amount, with no estimate nor fee structure disclosed. This worried me, so I asked what the amount would be in writing and the answer was no more clear in terms of amount that would be requested, nor fee structure or anything like that.

"Hi all, longtime lurker, first time poster. Posting on a new account to keep things anonymous. Hoping to get some advice on our next steps in this situation.

My fiancé and I just got back to Texas from Mexico. We were on a guided jet ski tour around the bay with a bunch of our friends as well as two other skiers and the trip guides. One of the other trip attendees who we didn't know was being very reckless on their jet ski, had already been reprimanded once, and was continuing not to follow instructions/guidelines. Long story short, they lost control of their jet ski and crashed into us very hard. Most of my injuries are supercial, though I'm in a decent amount of pain and do plan to get a physical exam and consult my doctor. My fiancé was riding on the back and took the blunt of the hit, sustaining injuries to her left arm and leg. Bad enough that it required an ER visit, X-rays to make sure nothing was broken and no internal bleeding, and getting fitted for a leg brace and arm sling. The ER doc cleared her to leave but said she needs to see an ortho and get a CT scan asap when we're back in USA because she may have torn a ligament or something like that. 

We got the name and email address of the at-fault individual from the tour company, though didn't have the forethought to get photos of their driver's licenses or anything in addition prior to them leaving. We will have no issue getting statements from witnesses as we have multiple friends and the tour guides who can corroborate that they were at fault. The at-fault individual had purchased a liability insurance waiver from the guide company, which states it will cover up to $1000 towards our medical expenses. However, if my fiancé's medical bills exceed that, we've realized we may need to somehow sue this person for medical damages. 

My fiancé's profession is physical/manual in nature and she has already notified her manager that she will be on medical leave for the next week at least, as her injuries to her arm and leg make her unable to do her job.

In the best case, our out of pocket medical expenses will be below $1000 (she has medical insurance so will only be paying deductible and some small % of the bill I hope). Also in the best case, she doesn't have anything torn or require any surgeries, and is able to get back to work in a couple weeks. But in the worst case, she may end up with hefty medical bills to pay as well as being out of work and on short term / long term disability. In that case, is sueing for damages to the at-fault individual an option? I'm also a bit worried about how to track this person down if that's the case, but I'm hopeful we can get more information (an address at minimum) from the tour company if needed. I'm posting this to seek any advice on what, if any, additional steps we should take here.

"HELP PLEASE 🥺 My friends Gramma was leasing a place in a trailer park (not sure of association rules) but then passed in November. My friend has stayed behind but was not offered a lease by the landlord. Landlord is the owner of property.

Land lord accepted a partial payment of $400 for Dec but friend is short $300 still... The landlord stopped over last night and told my friend she to be out before she gets back from vacation on December 29th and since she isn't on a lease she has no recourse. She also said her landlord said her family are all judges and police officers in that same county so there's nothing friend can do (could this be intimidation or threat?)

"Hi all - my daughter is turning 18 this month, which would normally make me eligible to begin to terminate child support responsibilities. I did some brief research online and saw that in Texas, the parent is responsible for paying support when the child turns 18 or finishes high school, whichever comes *later*. 

Issue is that in this case my daughter’s mother really dropped the ball one year and had a ton of personal issues and drama. This caused her to fail to take my daughter to school due to neglect or just plain lack of caring. Important to note that I live two hours away and obviously would not be able to take her on those days that her mother failed to. 

That was about 5-6 years ago and now my daughter doesn’t graduate until 2025 instead of 2024. Would I have any ground to stand on as far as getting child support terminated after she turns eighteen based off these facts and circumstances?

"Hey everybody,  my old leasing office mistakenly pulled out 2 grand from my bank account after I had moved out.  I put a stop payment to it at my bank, and the money was taken out but my bank just gave me back the money at 10 am the next morning.

I specifically told the leasing manager that I had stopped the payment and asked what I should do, remove the stop payment or what do we do moving forward?  

She replied that accounting couldn't reverse the payment so they'll send me a check (which also has my security deposit in it.)

The check they sent me is for 1750, not 2 grand, plus my 750 security deposit, so some of the money technically is mine in that check...but I'm also worried about repercussions from this company because they're basically slumlords.  

Also, one of the leasing employees had asked me for my housing assistance case manager's info a few days later (i have a housing choice voucher), which I gave to him amd asked why, but he never responded back.

Yesterday, as part of final settlement, landlord deducted additional $1400 for that stain claiming that they would have to replace the whole floor for which the quote is ~$2200 and they would charge 65% of it against us as the entryway is ~65% of the total area.

Hey Everyone!

tl;dr at bottom

I’m in Northern California (small town) helping a family member get hooked up to city sewer currently and am hoping to get some outside perspective on whether or not we’re getting screwed, and if so, what the best path forward would be. 

My family member is on a fixed income and took a loan from a friend to secure $22,000 needed for a plumbing company to get us tied in to the city sewer. We signed the contract and sent them the initial draw ($2k+)so we’re sorta locked in. 

After reaching out to the city to apply for the sewer connection, they quoted us $8,000+ for a sewer lateral fee. This fee was not covered by the initial contract, as confirmed by the PM and after reading the contract, and will have to be paid to the city separately, bringing the sewer connection total to over $30k after all work is completed, and we haven’t even started. We can roll it in to their property taxes, but being in a fixed income, this will be a huge strain. They will likely just borrow the money (zero interest loan from friend) and pay it outright.

It seems wild that this possibility of an additional $8k wasn’t discussed before we signed the contract, but here we are. 

tl;dr - We’re paying close to $30k to connect to a sewer from septic. Initial quote from plumber was $22k, but the city unexpectedly wants $8k to connect. Additional $8k was not covered by contract. We’re about 80 feet to the road on a main street. I guess the questions are: 

1. Has anyone connected to city sewer? If so, how much did it cost?

2. If we are getting screwed (going to ask for a few other quotes just to make sure), what are our options for pulling out of the contract?",Sewer Fee-asco,18m73vh,1703006300.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18m73vh/sewer_feeasco/,
"Sorry if this isn't allowed, as this is my first post here.

My wife (F24) and I (M25) live in Fairfax, VA. We signed a two-year lease to live in a luxury apartment complex in a nice area back in June, and we've had a relatively nice experience thus far. We are both lucky enough to work from home more often than not, but we both have to go into the office from time to time.

This is where the problem occurs.

There's a tenant across the hall who I've had enough of – he has increasingly verbally harassed my wife and has begun to act in a vulgar manner towards her while I'm not present. From the smell alone, he is constantly high (our building has a zero-tolerance no smoking policy) and will not leave his apartment in the afternoon when I'm home. However, when my wife leaves for in-person meetings, the tenant will be waiting to speak with her. He's gone from just saying ""hi"" in passing to cat-calling her as she walks to the garage. Today, things escalated to sexual harassment when he asked her to suck his dick. 

Unfortunately, we have no recordings or evidence of this harassment, as it's at sporadic times.

Since this has escalated from an annoyance to blatant harassment, I'm going to speak with the leasing department once I get home from work, but I'm concerned that they will not provide a sufficient solution; what steps can/should I take to stop this?

Constant loud barking and aggression: They're left outside 24/7, barking incessantly at anything that moves, including me when I mow the lawn (I have to carry pepper spray now). This makes enjoying my own property impossible.

Zero regard for animal welfare: They're exposed to all weather conditions, rain or shine, with no proper shelter or shade.

My wife is terrified of all dogs, and encountering these aggressive animals would probably cause her to pass out. I can't even have my HVAC or pest control perform regular maintenance due to concerns for their safety.

I feel like I’m not even allowed to go into my own backyard anymore as it would agitate the neighbor's dog. I'm at a crossroads and don't know what to do next. What are my options for protecting myself, my wife, and my property? Should I contact animal control? The police? Should I involve a lawyer? I have video and photo evidence to back up my claims to the relevant authority.

Sister in law (50f) moved out of an abusive relationship in 2014 and moved into a house with the financial assistance of my father in law(70s) who now is in a care facility due to dementia and has basically zero financial resources to spare.

This was brought to light as part of the initial stages of setting me up as Power of Attorney 


He bought the house and helped (up to this summer) with not only the ""landlord"" expenses but also just about every other expense she had from simple stuff like school fees for her kids to furnishings, utilities, etc (including expensive phone plans for her and her kids).

I can understand a couple of years to ""get back on her feet"" but rent free for 8+ years and receiving other support (best guess around $20k/year) and refusing to consider opportunities to repay even some of the funds seems like elder abuse.","Elder Abuse - Sister in Law ""Getting back on her feet"" for 8+ years Rent Free",18m6f4t,1703004576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18m6f4t/elder_abuse_sister_in_law_getting_back_on_her/,
"28(f), divorced mother of 2. On December 13th I gave my employer my 3 week notice due to being offered a higher paying job. I was on maternity leave from November 11th-December 18th, my employer was well aware of my leave. 

I worked as a targeted case manager and had about 36 clients. My employer demanded that I hand over all of my files the next day, without explanation that she had fired me. I asked if I had been fired for giving my notice and she said “we took your resignation effective immediately”. When I started this job, I signed a clause stating that I would not work for another case management company or do case management for up to 2 years. At the time, I didn’t understand what I was signing and still don’t to be honest. The job I accepted works with the clients we provided case management for BUT it is a  residential/day service provider and I will be in management. I let my employer know this, several times.

"(Located in Northern Utah) Okay, so basically what the title says. Fiancée started getting calls from his mom's property management company a couple weeks ago asking when he intended on coming in to co-sign on his mother's next lease. He said he didn't intend to, and that was that. Or so we thought. He did co-sign for her first lease, but when she asked him to sign the next one (2 years ago now), we told her no. She told us another family member was going to sign, and that was the last we heard of it. 

Because he co-signed on the first lease, he had an account on the property management companies website. We logged in to check and see what was going on. There was no new lease listed on the website, and no outstanding balance owed. We then checked her last 2 leases and saw that she had fraudulently signed Fiancée's name (via DocuSign) on both of them. 

As such we called the local police department filed a report for fraud. We elected not to press charges and were given a case number. We attempted to call the property management company a handful of times, reaching a front desk a couple of times. After not receiving a call back from the property manager for the past week, we typed up a basic letter stating the leases for dates a-b and b-c were fraudulent, as Fiancée did not sign either lease. Including the police case number and contact information for us, sending it via certified mail. It is set to arrive today. 

Is there anything else we need to do to protect ourselves from any legal recourse? The most recent lease is set to expire at the end of December, and she has been given an order to vacate by property management.

"I coach my daughters youth basketball team in southwest Ohio.  The schools do not directly run the youth leagues, but go through a for profit company to handle scheduling, refs, tournaments… my question is following our last game during handshakes an assistant from the other team called me a bitch for asking the refs to make calls for blatant fouls.  When I turned around and asked what’s your problem, he walked into me and grabbed me by the hoodie I was wearing.  Our schools AD and my assistant coach were very near and pulled him to the side before anything could escalate further.  I kept my distance moved my team away from the area and did not engage after the fact.  This kind of caught me off guard being I did not conversate with the other teams coaches throughout the game, and never directly engaged any of them in any manner to include looks.  

At first I was going to let it go and just continue on to the next week, but as I thought about it more I could not let it go unreported to the league.  While I didn’t engage there is nothing saying the next person he does this to will.  Also I am 6’ 1” 220lbs 40yr old retired military, the next person may be a an elderly grand parent or person of a stature that cannot withstand his unprovoked aggression so it needed addressed. Fast forward 2 days after report to league they suspended me and him, the reason they gave for my suspension was talking to the refs about making player safety foul calls during the game.  Mind you I was never issued a warning or a technical foul from the referees. Additionally our schools AD was at the scorers table beside me for the duration of the game and witnessed all of this. The league never contacted me about the incident directly, and claimed to our youth sports coordinator there was video evidence but they refused to provide proof for their review internally.  

All of this is said to ask can the league be held accountable for reprisal for suspending me because I reported bad conduct on the others teams coach.  I am not an expert, but I do know without coaches there are no teams so even though I don’t work for the league my vol services is what allows them to make money.  Would this fall in line with whistleblower protections, or is there another avenue I should pursue?  

If it just effected me I would set the 2 games and carry on, but in this league if you are suspended so is your child.  My daughter lives for basketball so her missing 2 games because of this is the thing that irks me the most.  The school was pretty much told to shut up we made our decision, after they protested the suspension.

"Hello,

     So this past weekend I matched with someone on a dating app. This woman portrayed herself to be a 19yo female. I am a 27yo male and had a cordial conversation with her on the app. She then sent me her phone number and asked me to message her on there. Some pics were exchanged and I asked her if she wanted to hookup and have some fun. I also asked beforehand if we could video chat so I could make sure this was a legit person. No responses to my request and eventually radio silence. So I continue about my night. The next morning I received a call from a detective informing me that a criminal complaint had been filed against me from the parents of a 15yo girl. He then connected the father and I on a phone call and he proceeds to explain to me that, that night she had taken her mother's car to try and come see me and ended up causing damages and the mother takes the girls phone and sees the correspondence that we had. The father then says that we can come to an agreement and put this past us and I agreed to pay $1000 towards the damages because I genuinely felt terrible that this situation had happened. They are now asking me to pay half of the $4000 so called damages to the vehicle. I have not seen any images or anything regarding that part of the incident. I had no knowledge what so ever that the woman I was talking to was a 15yo girl until the next morning when i received the call from the detective. I whole heartedly believed the conversation we were having was between to consenting adults. 

I have no idea what to do in this situation and I am genuinely terrified. The only thing I said in regards to us hooking up was a simple ""come over"". I believed this to be a woman very capable of making her own decisions on weather or not to meet. 

I had just spoken to both the mother and the father a few minutes ago and had tried to explain to them that I had no idea that this was thier daughter. The mother says that even though that may be the case, I had enticed to come to me and these are the results of her actions. The father continued with, that he believes me and that's why he told the detective that we can handle this in house. 

I believe I done everything in my power to hold myself accountable.

I’m an independent contractor. My employer lent me a laptop to use to do everything for his company.

One night, the laptop was stolen out of the trunk of my car. I filed a police report and he spent half the day tracking the laptop to a seedy area of town.

It’s been proven stolen.

He is asking me to pay for the laptop citing that since it was in my care and I was responsible for it, it’s my fault.

I am pretty sure that since it’s the business laptop that he neglected to insure, that he can write it off as a theft loss.

His CPA say as he can only write if 25%

I can’t write this off at all on my taxes since it is not my property or a business expense, just money coming out of my pocket.

"Hello, I could really use some good advice from anyone who's been through this or is familiar with this, I realize much of this will come down to having conversations with our attorney to decide what's right for my family, but I 'm just looking to get my ducks in a row as of now...

My (32M) father (63M) was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. I currently reside in New York, but we jointly own a home together in North Carolina - which when he passes, will transfer directly to me through rights of survivorship as I am his only child. He has a partner (62F) whom he has been with on and off for about 15 years now after my mother passed away. Originally, when he was looking at our home in NC, he intended to put her on the deed with him as it was his hope that they would live there together for their retirement. However, she got cold feet during the search process which led to me being included on the deed of the home. 

Before the escalation of his illness, he had expressed some interest in potentially letting her live in the home if something were to happen to him. I disagreed with this idea given the fact that she had the opportunity to have her name deeded first, but backed out, and also given the nature of their relationship being on and off throughout its time. We have revisited this conversation in the last few weeks upon learning of his illness progressing to terminal, which led me to contact our attorney. He instructed us that the best thing to do would be to provide her with a life estate, that will permit her to live in the home after he passes until her death. My father said that she would need to be responsible for all bills accrued while staying in the home - taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc. If she would not be able to cover the bills, then I understand that I would need to take legal action to have her removed from the home (which I highly doubt would need to happen, but... anything is possible right?). 

I guess I am looking for advice as for what should be done in this situation, as in should he address this in a will or trust, and should he include in the instructions that only his partner would be  permitted to live in the home? My two biggest worries are 1) she has a daughter (18F) whom I imagine would move with her, but I don't want the daughter trying to stake a claim in this many years later if her mother passes (I'm not familiar with NC law, so I'm not sure if this could be a potential situation I would face), and 2) if his partner starts dating someone new and decides to move them into our home.  

I will admit, I have not been on board with this idea from the beginning, simply because I would essentially be waiting for his partner to transition in order to move on from the house. I have been contemplating on keeping the home and possibly moving my own family into it, but this would be tough as I have a state job here in NY, as well as other property here that I need to worry about.  Another option would be to sell the home in NC and being done with it entirely. But, given the nature of his illness and the love I have for him, I do want to honor his wishes the best that I can. In a perfect world, I understand that I could simply sell her the home and everybody wins. But with the housing market being what it is now, I know that she would not be able to afford the value of the home. Again, I realize that the best thing would probably be to speak more with our attorney, but I guess I just wanted to reach out to this community here as this process has been very tough to cope with myself. Any input from you all would be appreciated very much. ","Parent wishes to grant a life estate to his partner, for a home that we own together?

"I'm seeking advice on what options I might have for a claim against a private clinic that focuses on fertility treatment. The private clinic is owned and operated by two nurses who work with your external OBGYN.

Basically, the private fertility clinic told me that one of my test results wasn't a concern (even though it turns out it was) and proceeded with fertility treatment anyway costing me $4,000 and a two month delay in diagnosis and receipt of proper treatment. The condition tied to this test result causes infertility...

Do I have any options here for recouping the financial losses resulting from their errors?

I requested that they pay back the $4k due to their errors. They stated the OBGYN made the decision on testing and have refused to pay back any portion.

More info:

Throughout the process, I never had direct contact with my OBGYN regarding anything fertility related. Everything was handled by the nurses who were in communication with my OBGYN, regarding testing and results. All payments were charged by and paid to the private clinic. My OBGYN never billed or received money from me (at least not directly).

Further, I was never given a timeline for retesting the initial high result (it's a test that has to be done twice to confirm and diagnose). I was told we'd retest ""at a later time."" The only reason I even got tested a second time and finally got diagnosed was because one of the nurses happened to see in my chart that we were supposed to retest.

Later discussion with two reproductive endocrinologists confirmed that this test is typically redone in two weeks (not two months) and that they would advised not proceeding with fertility treatment until that testing had been done and treatment had brought my level down to normal range (given that the condition causes infertility).","Health clinic caused delay in diagnosis and treatment, costing me $4k in the process.

"I recently received a violation from code enforcement due to excessive vegetative growth within my yard.

Evidence was provided of a slightly overgrown lawn (nothing crazy, I had to leave the country for a bit and mowed it on return). The evidence however did not showcase a measurement of the lawn, or proof that over 1/3rd of the lawn is overgrown. I am looking to get this dismissed but was just denied by the code enforcement division.

\---

The following is the exact violation:

Violation: CGO Section 9-304(a) - GRASS, LANDSCAPING AND LOT MAINTENANCE  
(a) Standards for mowing lots and weed control.  
(1) The following conditions are prohibited on any property zoned or used for residential purposes:  
a. The accumulation of rank growth of weeds, grass, invasive species, trees, plants or undergrowth in the condition that may  
serve to communicate fire or serve as a breeding place or harbor insects, rodents, snakes, vermin or other pests.  
b. Any property upon which over one-third of the vegetative area is allowed to exceed 12 inches in height above the ground. The  
height of vegetative matter shall be measured with a ruler or tape measure from grade level.  
(2) Any real property within the city with an area greater than 25 acres that is currently agriculture-exempt at the tax  
assessor's office, or platted conservation areas are not required to comply with vegetation height limits contained herein.

\---

The reason for denial being that I was in violation of 1.a and 1.b was not applicable.

My interpretation of the code is that 1.b is serving as a measure of effectiveness for the issue described in 1.a, as without 1.b there is no objective measurement for part a and a violation would be issued for any length of lawn. This was quickly dismissed as not mattering.

Is the manager truly correct for this matter? If he isn't what is my options for a path forward? The fine associated is roughly 50 USD.

"I'm in Colorado

Basically, my roommate (who is also the property manager) and I got into an argument the other day that started off as a friendly conversation and escalated to him being enraged. I lived with him at our previous house too and everything was great, and I chose him as a roommate for that place. When that lease was up, he got us the new place because his boss owns this house, and he gave us a discount. In our conversation the other day we were simply comparing our old house to our new house and I said I felt there are pros and cons to both houses. By no means did I mean that the old house was better than the new house. Anyway, he blew up into a fit of rage, yelling that i'm ungrateful and need to have some respect for him (roommate/property manager) because he's in charge and can get me off the lease whenever he wants. I have never seen him act this way and I was honestly so confused because he has been treating me like a friend for the past year and a half. He's been offering me favors (which I usually decline because I don't want to inconvenience him) and been nothing but friendly to me. I have brought up some concerns about the cleanliness of the house and he said by me doing that, I'm being disrespectful because I'm not acknowledging how lucky I am to be living at this house. I feel like I was supposed to be walking on eggshells in our house this entire time to make him feel that I'm thankful and I had no idea.

My Father-in-law is at the hospital and not doing well, he may not make it to Christmas. My wife (his daughter) and I moved in with him roughly 3 years ago to help take care of him after his 3rd wife passed away. Since then, *to my knowledge*, he never went through any sort of process to draft a new will or make any changes to an existing one, with his most recent one being written in 2017. Now he is hospitalized and uncommunicative, and his children from a previous marriage have turned up. Knowing what I have heard about them from my Father-in-law, they are going to do everything they can to take what he leaves behind, including the home my wife and I now live in. Is there anything that can be done at this point to prevent this, should he pass away? Are there any pro-active steps we should be taking?

Although never given a specific reason, I believe someone made false accusations against me, and my new manager decided to get rid of me; I was not given a PIP, warning, etc, and they claimed an investigation occurred yet they rewoked my access to company servers, chats, emails, etc within minutes of telling me they would start an investigation.

However I request my employee documents, invoking California labor code §1198.5, which gives employees rights to see their ""personall records"". They eventually sent everything (paycheck statements, my (positive) performance reviews, and employment contracts, but nothing at all related to my termination or the investigation into it. I responded requesting them, and HR told me they considered that an internal document. I requested it again, but they never responded.

I would like to see that investigation, accusation, whatever they have to get an understanding of what happened, for closure and personal improvement reasons. Do I have a reasonable case for breaching California labor law, and does this somehow supercede the seperation agreement I signed?

"Located in Michigan for all of this.   
I am the fiancé of a wonderful man(Superhero), who had an even more wonderful grandfather(Pop-pop)  who passed within the last (now 21) days. Sadly, my fiancé's father(Goffer) is the exact opposite of these 2. He suffers from severe alcoholism - but was the only human capable of being physically located with Pop-pop as he slipped into the later stages of dementia. After 8 years of care-taking Goffer no longer has that responsibility. However, there's some legal complications with this that require me to explain some more backstory:

Goffer and Pop-pop caught a severe case of pneumonia at the time of the pandemic. This was due to the severity of the condition of Pop-pop's estate. Luckily, Superhero and I were able to get ahold of APS and get full guardianship AND conservatorship transferred to Superhero. 

A side property was listed for sale, and sold, Superhero has no idea if this sale was finalized prior to or after Pop-pop's death. However, Superhero was never involved in this process. As the conservator should they have been? Is this a legal sale?

Pop-pop's pension was bought out for a large lump sum that was estimated to be equal to the amount that would've been given to him for the next 8 years. (Pop-pop was alive for this, but again the dementia means he was not capable of understanding this). Superhero was never involved in this process, should they have been? Is this legal?

Pop-pop passed inside his home, and a coroner took his remains (with permission of Goffer). As the guardian/conservator, is Superhero responsible for submitting the death certificate? If so, what are the possible repercussions for not submitting it within a certain time frame? (We literally didn't know this could be our responsibility)

Superhero, and all other family members outside of Goffer claim to never have seen the written will. Goffer has decided that coping with this death through copious amounts of alcohol making reaching Goffer about any of the required documents is impossible.

For the 8 years that Goffer was in the care taker role he didn't have work. He transferred money out of Pop-pop's accounts to care for the both of them. As far as Superhero and I are aware, because no death certificate has been submitted these accounts are still open and Goffer still has access to them. As the conservator is there a responsibility for Superhero to contact Pop-pop's bank, and what would we need to ensure the accounts are frozen appropriately? Any and ALL advice is appreciated as being in our 20's means we have no prior experiences with these circumstances.",Guardianship/Conservatorship after Death,18m4vkq,1703000620.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18m4vkq/guardianshipconservatorship_after_death/,

Mary has her own bedroom, she is going to community college via NJ and federal grants, and has no support from her biological family.  Mary is on Medicaid.  She has no job, assets, or income - just her clothes and donated furniture.

Mary has a diagnosis of autism and ADHD.  She has accommodations for her classes but her case worker and student disability office didn't really do anything else to get her services for autism.  Sandy and I are working with Mary to help her explore what options are available and to request them.  One of those possible services is SSI.  

I asked in /r/socialsecurity about what we could expect in the process.  Someone mentioned that Sandy should charge Mary rent since free room and board may qualify as financial support, rendering her ineligible for SSI.  Sandy has a solid career and a good job, and she does not charge Mary anything, but the idea of SSI helping cover cost of living does help Sandy a bit.  

Should Sandy be drawing up a formal lease agreement before an SSI application goes in?  If so, how should they handle accumulating unpaid rent while the SSI application processes?

My grandfather, who is not long for this world, does not have any assets except for his home which he took out a reverse mortgage back when he owned/operated a nonprofit. When he passes the bank or mortgage company will own the house. Since my grandmother passed away in 2018, the majority of cleaning has been done by my aunt (his daughter) who moved in but she works full time. 
The huge problem started when my uncle(his son), who suffers from undiagnosed mental illnesses including hoarding, started bringing in car parts. They tried kicking him out multiple times including changing the locks but my grandfather will ultimately allow him to live there. 
My family recently discovered that my uncle has filled the entire garage and attic with said car parts and does not have any plan on how to get rid of them. His adhd and schizophrenia hold him back from keeping a job or making any money whatsoever but again are undiagnosed mental illnesses. 

My main question is can the company that will own my grandfather’s home come after his kids for liability of cleaning the home for resale. 

My mother (his daughter) has been paying the taxes for a few years in order for them to stay in that house. 

The house could also be condemned if seen by authorities or the Hoa so this problem could escalate for sure. Should we try to clean this house of car parts before his passing, which will aggregate my crazy uncle to the point of hostility?

My family has been cleaning the home (mainly just my grandparents stuff) on weekends but the main main issue is the amount of car parts hoarded by my uncle. 

Should we consider having my uncle committed or something? His pride won’t allow him to admit he has any mental illness even if he had the money to seek help. 

We are focused on making my grandfather comfortable during his remaining days but I think more drastic action might be necessary before things get much worse.

My partner has been working at the same company for about 8 months now, and he recently noticed a large amount being taken from his most recent check labeled “Voluntary Deductions”. We did some research and discovered this is for things like opt-in company healthcare, retirement, etc. None of these things are offered at his job, nor was he ever asked if he wanted to participate in any sort of program such as this. He has never signed anything relating to this, and the YTD amount that has been taken out under this category is more than has been taken out for income tax! 

We have tried to research how to go about getting this money back/if he can get it back. Information is somewhat limited for this specific situation where he has no reason for his wages to be garnished (and even if so wouldn’t that be listed differently on pay stub?) 

So, I guess I’m basically asking what the best way to go about this. Should he directly approach employer first in order to see if they would just give him a check for that amount, or could that cause problems down the road legally? Small claims? And if he reports them and gets fired for it, would he have a case to sue for wrongful termination?

"Virginia- Driver not listed on policy- won't cover damages  
I came back to my car in a parking garage and found it damaged. I obtained the footage and filed a police report. After finding them, I finally got the insurance information (National General).

"Since August of 2022 I was working remote in Louisiana for an employer based in Pennsylvania. I always had direct deposit and in April of 2023 they added the paychex app which allowed me to see all of my stubs and withholdings. I noticed that I had been paying federal and income tax to PA instead of Louisiana - as well as unemployment. All of this reflects on mu actual pay stubs but not in the system. They told me that had messed it up, switched it over, and that I would receive a refund of that money I paid to another state - which I still have not received. I ended up moving to Pennsylvania at the beginning of December but 3 days before I left to drive across the country, I received a call saying that they could no longer afford to pay me and my position was being terminated. My last day was December 3rd and I moved December 6th. I tried applying for unemployment to hold me over until I was settled into my new home. I worked in Louisiana so I tried that first, they only have wages reported after April of 2023 (when they switched their mistake back). I was then told to try PA since that's where the business is located and it turns out PA has no wages at all reported for me. I'm missing 8 months of wages in the system and even though I've sent both states my pay stubs, I keep getting the run around. On top of all this, my former employer sent me a Termination notice yesterday stating ""job abandonment"" quoting me as logging off all the work systems - which I did say, but only after I was already laid off. It seems that this employer is trying to do everything they can to make sure I don't get unemployment and the missing wages is honestly just sketchy to me.

Worked remote in LA for business in PA 
They screwed up my taxes when hired.

"I guess when a property is listed under foreclosure it’s publically available, as the place I am living in has received calls, occasional mail, and even buyers in person requesting to buy the house. 

It is a two-family home. A real estate person(for lack of a better term) came to the property yesterday to the front door and rang the bell but no one was home at the moment. Coincidentally(because there are security cameras on the property so we see what went on), the tenants of this property were arriving at the moment and they asked what they were there for/if they could be of help and they’d relay the message to the owners. 

This guy basically tells the tenant that the property is under foreclosure and is looking to buy it. My question is, was he legally allowed to do that? We’ve had occasions in the past where people knock on our door and ask for the **owner** of the property and if they are not available, then they cannot discuss any matters. 

This guy just discloses the fact out in the open that the property is under foreclosure to someone that (IMO) has nothing to do with it. Now, I could see having this knowledge how the tenants could potentially leave. Is this not some form of sabotage or something related? For the record the tenant was unaware that the property was under foreclosure. This real estate person has now put in jeopardy the tenants stay.

"Hello all. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to pursue getting a refund/chargeback/ legal avenues for a company located in a Florida mall that scammed my grandmother. It was on a vacation trip there, so going to the mall in person is not much of an option. I have reported them to the BBB, the National elder fraud hotline, and the fraud department of the FTC. Thank you for any and all suggestions. 


My grandmother, age 77, suffers from cognitive decline, memory loss, and disorientation/confusion. She was at the mall with my cousin when they were targeted by the makeup/skincare sales people working the kiosks in the hallway. The sales woman harassed her, brought more sales women over, and all in all convinced her to buy a product that was extremely over inflated in cost. All in all, she bought a product totaling $500. 

With this purchase, they promised her a free beauty consultation. So they walked her and my cousin back to a second location (store front) in a different area of the mall. When they got to this second location, there were more sales people, waiting outside. They told my cousin that he wasn’t allowed in, therefore, isolating my grandma (who is at risk for these sorts of scams) and placing her in an extremely vulnerable position. As they have her in a back room, they start performing the treatment and start bringing her paperwork to sign buying everything they are using. She is upside down (laying on a table) at this point and they forcefully coerced her into  giving her credit card to purchase the products. They used fear, deception, and high pressure sales tactics (ie. we will call security on you if you don’t pay this amount). This time, totaling over $5,000. My grandmother had no idea what she was buying, didn’t have her glasses with her (she has very bad eyesight), and had no family with her to explain what was going on or what she was signing. This company has many reviews with the BBB, and Google reviews in which people have their elderly family members suffer through these same crimes. They have refused a refund based on their illegitimate paperwork that my grandmother was forcefully made to sign under duress.

What are our options here? The credit card company claims that a chargeback isn’t possible because of her signature on the purchases. Will filing with any federal agencies get her her money back? The police were no help when we called them for advise

Edit - thanks everyone for the helpful insight, thoughts and suggestions. Really appreciate it and will be looking into these avenues. Regardless of my cousin, granny and her finances, the most absurd thing to me is that a business can repeatedly do this to elderly people over and over again in a physical location in a mall, and basically nothing can be done about it. Even though they’re scamming elderly people out of thousands of dollars. They get people to sign paperwork before they leave because they know they’re running a scam and they can cover their ass. And it’s just allowed to happen.

Unfortunately, the handbook was very vague as to what the school had the authority to give suspensions over. However, I did find that the school had violated its own handbook on two accounts with how they went about the suspension. 

The handbook stated that I was to be given a chance to appeal, which I wasn't. It also stated that the Paster of the church was to be notified with details. I haven't had a chance to ask him since I read this in the handbook, but judging by that he asked me what had happened because he was told a little bit by the Parochial priest who I had talked to immediately after the punishment was handed out, who I assume didn't have the authority to overturn it, even though he took my side with everything that what the school had done was wrong.

Since crypto transactions are all public, I can see the tokens in my wallet on a block explorer (https://etherscan.io/), so I know that the transfer worked and the tokens are still there.

Hello!

On  last Summer, my husband and I decided to book  a ticket for us and our 2 kids ( 4 passengers) to travel from Chattanooga, TN to Algeria. We  used Skyscanner and found a good deal on Budget Air, usually non-refundable, we booked it on April 30, 2023. They emailed us the ticket confirmation. The travel ticket was for June 3rd. We waited a few days for them to withdraw the money from my husband's bank, but they didn't. Since this was our first time booking with Budgetair, and  since they didn't take the money ($5,500) from the bank, we thought they might have cancelled it because they did cancel a previous booking the same week. While we were waiting,  we read some reviews  about Budgetair-I know we should have done this before booking with them - a lot of bad reviews popped about this agency's scams and customers complaints/issues, we thought we need to book elsewhere to avoid any problem with them, as long as they didn't charge us yet. You guys can check their website,  the only contact they have is a chat robot and their emails all look like automatic emails not real persons talking with us. They have no reliable form of communication, no phone number to call at all. So we started thinking we should rebook with another more reliable but affordable airline agency. 

After 8 days of searching for other flight deals, we found one with One travel and booked it. FYI,  we used it years ago without any issue. The One travel ticket price was a bit higher, we used my debit card this time and my account was charged rightaway($5,800). We used my debit because we didn't have sufficient  funds in my husband's bank. One travel called us and confirmed everything, they have all possible contact info on their website in case we have an issue. So we thought we're ok and didn't bother to cancel the Budget Air ticket, also they cancel with $50 for each passenger and we are 4.

After feeling some relief that we finally booked a ticket to Algeria for a good deal (because it's really expensive on Summer  for a family of 4) , the next day , to our surprise, my husband noticed his bank was charged $5,500 by Lufthansa to pay for the ticket we booked 8 days ago with Budget Air. 

We were in a total shock because we were stuck with two tickets from : Chattanooga, TN to Algeria:

First one depart on June 3rd booked with Budget air: $5,500 (we didn't use this ticket to travel)

Second one depart on June 6th booked with  One travel: $5,800  ( we did use this ticket to travel.)

My husband filed a claim with his bank, and after a few days, they replied that they are unable to pay him back, because Lufthansa is authorized to take the money. We didn't know that the airline takes the money not the agency.  We contacted Lufthansa to seek a possible cancellation and refund, but unfortunately, they said they can't help us and we need to contact the agency Budget Air. 

We contacted Budget Air through their chat bot and email, the only same response they had is that they can't refund because thd ticket is nonrefundable according to the airline policy.

As a low income household, we use our savings to travel to our home so we can visit our relatives, we feel, desperate, helpless and so disappointed. 

We don't know what to do, if we can do another claim, with who? 
Any advice will be much appreciated!

"Hello, random and probably silly post for some of you, but i am very annoyed and upset.

My spouse and I have friends who foster stray cat rescues. We recently found a stray and took him in and wanted him to have a friend so he is not lonely for the few hours a day we are away at work. So we tell them we are interested in their cat and they notify their organization. The organization then says “they need to apply after the new year because incoming applications have been paused”. The date applications were stopping is 12/15/2023-1/4/2023. But they acknowledged we were interested. We had a successful meet and greet with the foster cat and our cat too. Then, the 16th, they found out they were doing an adoption fair and advertised the cat we wanted. That being the case we applied online and paid the fee to secure our position further. Now today we have been notified that they are choosing a different applicant to go with. This other applicant applied after us, they have never met the cat during a meet n greet. 

So, overall, the question is, can i use any legal options to “convince” them to reconsider? Because this has been emotionally upsetting for us and our cat.",Pet Rescue Organization is being shady,18m2r8m,1702994993.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18m2r8m/pet_rescue_organization_is_being_shady/,

"   This is in Washington state in Snohomish county. Our parenting plan states ""The picking up parent - The parent who is about to start parenting time with the children must arrange to have the children picked up."" It also says ""Pickup location: As decided"". I was never happy with our decided upon location but my ex threw a huge fit so I gave in and we decided to meet half way(ish) when exchanging the kids. This wouldn't be a big deal to me if we didn't live 2+ hours apart. I told her I would like to follow the parenting plan and have the picking up parent come get the kids at or near the others house. She told me if I wasn't at our previously decided upon location she would get an emergency order forcing me to bring the kids to her because it was previously decided upon. So, Im wondering, are changes in writing but not on the actual plan mandatory? Things are getting heated (with much more than this) and I would very much like to more closely follow the official plan but Im afraid she would take me to court and I would end up needing to pay for her legal costs.

   If I am required to continue with the previously decided location, how can I get this fixed at this point? Do I need to pay for arbitration or take her to court? This is only one example of this ""decided upon"" language she is threatening legal action over. Another one is that I told her I would pay her child support a few days earlier than required and now she says if I pay on the date on the parenting plan she will open a contempt case.

  I don't have a lot of extra money to fight her in court (more than her though) and Im scared that trying to stick to our parenting plan would leave me completely broke.

"Hello Reddit, 
This is my first post, and boy I have gotten myself into a little bit of a pickle. Also sorry if it’s a little long. 

So, several years ago in 2019, I made the bold decision to get married. I don’t have any excuses for the decision, other than being young and excessively dumb, but it was a hasty marriage to say the least. We’ll call my former (currently legal) husband John. 

John (at the time 23) and I (at the time 22) met on a PlayStation game awhile back, and he was from the UK, and I am an American (VA  to be specific). I had just gotten out of a pretty traumatic relationship, so maybe my thinking was not as clear as it should have been. 

Well anyways, John and I only visited each other a whopping total of 3 times in each others countries before we decided to get married. To the surprise of literally nobody, it was a horrible idea. John didn’t work, and I ended up supporting him 100% financially. We never lived in the same country together officially, just extended visits. 

So here I was, sending 90% of my money to this dude I spontaneously got married to because reasons. He was clearly not looking for employment and it didn’t take long for me to realize that I’d f’d up, and I called things off between us. 

Well here comes the tricky part. After him and I “separated”, we blocked each other, etc. and fast forward to present day, and a few phones later, I have no contact information, or idea of how to find him. He has an incredibly generic name, literally along the lines of John Smith generic. 

I was really hoping anybody could maybe help shed some legal light, or at the very least point me in the right direction. I was hoping I’d be able to file without the help of a lawyer, because John and I have no shared assets, and no liquid assets of note.  The only hard part is I don’t know where he is, nor do I have any contact information for him anymore. What should I do?

"37(M) Texas, my daughter recently has been feeling very down about her situation at her mother’s house which is her primary home.  She’s not a bad kid at all, she’s just a middle schooler who’s recently getting into small disciplinary situations at school, mostly emails or calls from teachers of her talking during class or looking at her phone etc.  Her mother recently threatened her that if she kept up such behavior she would send her to live with me, this to me seemed like it really put her emotions on edge (my daughters).

"I’m wondering if nonrefundable deposits are legal in this sense. I enrolled my child in care at an in-home daycare about a month ago. She’s not scheduled to start care until April 2024. The provider required the first 4 weeks of tuition as a deposit, totaling $800.

I decided not to go forward with this provider recently, as her sick policy is too strict and will wind up seeing my child out of care too often for very minor colds, etc. When I contacted the provider, she refused to refund any in the deposit and cited one sentence in an awkwardly written contract. (For what it’s worth, the contract had numerous typos and non sequiturs; her response to which was that she’d make sure I’d be given a new copy in April).

Is that legal? I get not refunding part of the deposit, but I feel like she’s just making money here, and like I’m being coerced into staying with this provider in order to not lose the $800.

I’m not familiar with any legality surrounding nonrefundable deposits, but this seems outrageous considering she’s done nothing for me, has lost no revenue, and quite literally provided no service outside of “holding a spot” for my child 5 months from now. I’m sure she has time to find another family in that span of time, given the childcare crisis in my area. There were, according to her, three other families vying for that spot (which admittedly pressured us into making a decision quickly).

Can she deny a return of any part of my deposit even though she’s incurred no loss?

3 days later they contact me saying it won’t start, it’s blowing every fuse, and that it has death wobble at 45mph. 
These issues were NEVER a part of the vehicle at all, so I have no clue where they pulled this from.

Sorry for the rambling. To get to the point, they want me to refund the deposit and to take my now broken vehicle back. In the contract I had them read SEVERAL times it states that in the event of cancellation, no refunds will be issued, and that the vehicle is sold as-is. So now D is trying to take advantage of the 90 day payment grace period I gave them, and says I won’t get the vehicle back until day 90.

"Location: Florida

  
I am a teacher, trying to help a student. I probably won't be able to answer every question, but I will certainly answer what I can.  
My student was arrested over the weekend for simple assault. I believe child abuse is at play here. I'm not saying he's completely innocent, but it's a factor in this situation. FTR, yes, I'm a mandated reporter. Yes, I have already made that report. My student was the one arrested. He says he disclosed abuse to the police at the time of arrest. He says they didn't say much and didn't seem to care, as his guardian was the one who called the police.   
He was processed and released. I'm assuming since the charge is pretty minor, he was released on his own recognizance because I'm fairly certain being a minor and based on our economic area, he cannot pay his own bail and I know his mom didn't pay it for him.   
Upon his release he was told by the police to show up at his court date, which he does plan to do. I asked him if he had contacted his court appointed attorney yet and he said the police didn't mention anything about that. I helped him find the number for public defenders our county and he called. He was told that he needed to appear at his arraignment and he would be assigned a court appointed attorney at that time. I've done a little research and it appears that at his arraignment he will enter a plea, guilty or not guilty.   
Here are some questions I have: If he enters a guilty plea, does he still get a court appointed attorney? Does he have to enter a not guilty plea in order to qualify for public defender services? According to what I've read online, he is entitled to bring an attorney with him to his arraignment, but since he can't afford one, is he basically out of options? I see people post in the sub over and over again that you can't afford not to have a lawyer, but for him this isn't a case of having different priorities and/or not wanting to spend the money, it's a case of he literally does not have the money and his family will not help him. I know people without lawyers usually end up getting screwed. I've also seen where people end up taking bad deals at arraignments since they don't know their rights and this is usually because they don't have a lawyer.

Not totally sure where this fits flair-wise, I didn't see any obvious fit.

My significant other got hit head-on by a wrong-way driver, and the police called a private tow company to remove the car while they were taken away by ambulance.  At this point that's all the information we have, expecting police report to be accessible soon I hope.

Our vehicles are registered our own separate names based on who paid for it and is primary driver, but jointly insured with both our vehicles on the same policy and both of us as insured drivers on all our vehicles, and we live under the same roof.  Unsure if this plays into anything.

We went to try and collect personal belongings and get pictures of the damage as part of opening insurance claims, but ran into some really strange rules from the private tow lot.  Has anyone heard of this before?

* They only wanted to allow the registered owner to visit the vehicle...took much debate since she was just released from the ER trauma center and isn't really in a condition to be crawling and contorting to retrieve belongings from a severely damaged vehicle.  Asked if then their staff could help with carrying stuff or reaching things but they didn't want to do that either.  Eventually they caved after pointing out we may need another ambulance if they force the person who just got out of the ER trauma unit to contort around and lift/carry all their belongings from where they dropped the car out to where we could park while retrieving stuff (while not severely injured, as in still able to carefully walk, but in pain and on very heavy meds that affect balance and judgment).  This couldn't wait as literally everything was still in the car including their computer, tablets, etc and phone got lost during the hospital stay making it very hard to get anywhere or communicate at all.
* They prohibited taking ANY photos of the damaged vehicle (which I know our insurance would require uploading photos of damage as part of opening a claim, still working to get the offender's information as that was handled by police while she was taken away by ambulance, unsure if their insurance will want us to provide pictures like ours normally does).
* They prohibited taking our license plates, which as I understand we will need them to be able to transfer them to the replacement vehicle and/or [might be required to surrender to DMV](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/vehicles/license-plates/surrender).  The tow lot seems to consider plates ""part of the car"" since they screw onto the car, and are therefore not allowed to be removed.  I expect we will want to have the same vanity plates issued to the replacement vehicle one way or another, no idea how to deal with that.

This seems so strange...I've only dealt with one other major crash in VA and they had no issue with us taking our plates, and gathering photos of the damage for insurance, or having someone assist the injured vehicle owner with their needs.

And I guess also at this point any other anything that would be good or useful to think about given the whole mess...","Car crash, tow company police used is having strange restrictions?",18m0ky1,1702988380.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18m0ky1/car_crash_tow_company_police_used_is_having/,

Cross posted in multiple forums because I wasn’t sure which one was the most appropriate. Edited for typos. 

Background: 

- I’m a single chronically-ill disabled female in my late 40’s. Live in Tennessee. I’ve been on disability pay only for 13 years, but have had help from family and a former fiancé. I’ve always paid my bills on time, but an unexpected family death,  the ending of my relationship, the and other sudden losses almost all at once left me with my disability check only, which doesn’t even cover rent and utilities. And over $35k in credit card and unsecured loan debt. None have gone to collections yet, but I assume that will happen soon. 

- I own a car that’s worth about 5k to 6k maybe  (it’s actually in need of repair right now so It’s just sitting there). My mom is helping with rent/utilities any month she can , but I don’t know how long she can do that. 

- I’m on a life estate deed with my mom (house is in Georgia) because my parents wanted to ensure I could sell the house and move somewhere with better medical care and not be homeless since my disabilities are permanent. Dad passed away and now it’s just mom and I on the deed. 

- My plan was to file for bankruptcy and then start the VERY difficult process of trying to work a job for the first time in 13 years under Disability guidelines while also tending to my medical care. I have a lot of fear of my Disability benefits being ripped away, but my only chance of survival is to eventually make enough money to support myself on my own with a job. This in and of itself is highly stressful because I don’t know if it’s doable with my health. 

- I’ve already gotten several notices that I will be sued very soon, and after looking these creditors up online they are not bluffing.

- As soon as my financial situation crashed, actually when I saw it coming a few weeks ahead, I reached out to attorneys immediately  to get in front of this before it got out of control. It’s been 3 months now, and as of today I’ve talked to 7 attorneys (a lot for our area) and gotten conflicting “guidance.” 

- The one resounding thing they had in common is they won’t take me on as a client. The other is that none of them were comfortable with the fact that I’m on a life estate deed of my mother’s house. I told them I’m willing to give this house up in a bankruptcy because mom will almost 100% likely need to be in a nursing home soon and Medicaid will just take the house regardless for Estate Recovery when she passes away (she is not in great health). I’ve verified this with Medicaid and an estate attorney. 

— Attorney 1 is the exception to attorneys that would not help me - he offered Chapter 7 right away, but he was rushed in our consult and had a LOT of ""I don't know"" answers. It made me feel very uneasy. He just wanted his down payment and bam, he was off the phone.

— Attorney 2 refused to take me on because he said I “couldn’t even afford his payment plan” without even asking me if I could, and hung up on me. 

— Attorney 3 was from the free legal aid clinic in our area. He said I don’t meet their qualifications, which are: I have to have already been sued and have a judgment against me, and that I have wages from working that can be garnished. I told him I was getting ready to start working and that I know I will be sued soon, but he nonchalantly said it didn’t matter. He also said they’re very backlogged with cases. 

— Attorney 4, just from my name and phone number, had already looked up the house on Zillow when we had our consult (freaked me out a little) and knew when the deed was transferred and guessed an appraisal amount (it’s about 100k off). She advised to file Chapter 13, but said because of the house I would have to pay the value of that house in my repayment plan, which brought the guesstimate of the monthly payment to be 3/4 of my disability check. I asked about chapter 7 and she stated she would not be willing to do that because the Trustee can have the house sold and make my mom homeless (that’s not how it works; they can only sell my share of future interest; they cannot displace her). 

— Attorney 5 said he would not help me because of the house; again I explained I don’t care about the house at this point and it’s likely a lost cause due to Medicaid Estate Recovery, which he stated he knew nothing about. He said that was stupid of me not to care about it and told me to find another attorney. 

— Attorney 6 quoted $3500 for a Chapter 7, well above anyone else’s quote, and did not do payment plans. This is not doable for me, and he didn’t even listen long enough to get a good feel for what’s best with all the facts. 

— Attorney 7 said don’t pay anything to creditors or collectors and just ignore everything because I’m “judgment proof.” No I’m not, I’ve got that house hanging  over my head for now, a car, and very soon working wages, and also income from my mom which is not untouchable by creditors. 

The house was supposed to be a great gift for my literal survival, but it’s ended up being a curse. I can’t sign my name off of it, even though my mom offered, because all attorneys said that was bankruptcy fraud.

Other than that, I have zero guidance on what to do. I'm not one to sit around and wait for disaster. I just research endlessly online and get a million conflicting guidelines on how to contact creditors. If I should contact them, when, ignore things, don't ignore, etc. Some say better settle now than later, others disagree. And on and on and on.
Not to mention, settle with what? I have no money.

I'm so rattled by conflicting guidance and live in constant fear and panic. If anyone can help point me in a certain direction that makes sense or if I've gotten wrong Info please let me know. My life is on hold right now and it's absolutely miserable. I'm not trying to NOT pay my bills. I just can't.

"I'm a 42-year-old female with BiPolar disorder and Agoraphobia. 4 months ago my case manager convinced me that living on my own wasn't working (I was extremely depressed and I hadn't left the house other than for doctors' appointments in months) so she said that I should try living in a group home for the mentally ill and recommended one to me. The group home I ended up going to was terrible. They yell at the residents all the time and are verbally abusive towards us, and in my specific case, they have started insisting on watching me shower to make sure I'm bathing, even though I take a shower every day. The meals are terrible, the food is always burnt or otherwise inedible. They threatened to call my mother (who is not my legal guardian or anything just my emergency contact) if I keep 'misbehaving'. All in all, it's a terrible situation. I posted about this on r/disability and someone suggested that I post here so I'm copy-pasting my replies from that post as they contain more information.

I'm pretty worried that they've caught on to me taking pictures and such because today they threatened me with calling my Mom.

"Hello all. I’ve been on property now starting into my second month. I have to say the process was pretty challenging, and have to touch base as I’m unsure of some things. 

When I toured the rental options, and chose an option that I was told was the same size as another with better in apartment options (AC, upgraded, etc) but people were moving out soon and I couldn’t see it now. So I accommodated and looked at what was available. Following that initial look and choosing the space, I found that communication ceased and was non existent from then on. Questions regarding onboarding, process and expectations were never responded to, and no communication at all was given until 3 days before moving in. In which none of my questions were answered or touched on.

3 days following that, I had figured things out for myself through trial and error. Now my move in day was here and I was only looking forward, with utilities set up, mail and packages on their way, furniture deliveries and move in truck inbound. When coming in to go over contracts I asked to take a moment to look at the apartment as I hadn’t seen it still and found that very odd I was never offered to. Upon going to the space I found it was not the same and substantially smaller than what I looked at.

With that new information and everything prepped and on its way, only an hour out, I began to panic, flooded with confusion. I was now left with one option of looking at what else was available in that moment and attempting to find another space. Seeing that most of the options I had looked at a month ago were now gone I wasn’t left with much as options. So I chose (not what I wanted at all)  in order to make it all work, still very confused on how or why this would happen like this. 

After changing all of my utilities, redirecting packages, being hounded by the movers and delivery drivers to meet them while I’m trying to finalize paperwork, my key being lost, then my key not working for the first 2 weeks, no instruction or assistance, and just running around like a chicken with its head cut off, very unnecessarily so. On top of that the space I moved into was not ready to be moved into. It had a lot of issues, broken everything, very dirty, needed a lot of work. I worked through/around it and got everything moved in. I was then informed while finalizing things in the office when finished that parking in this new area is a bit tough. I didn’t know what that exactly meant as the area I looked at initially had plenty of street parking inside the neighborhood. I quickly found that this area has just over 20 parking spaces and all others are an extra cost. Again, information that should’ve been communicated anytime earlier.

So now Ive realized quickly that my bedroom is next to the elevator. Since I had no time and a very bad situation I was forced into I didn’t notice at the time of scrambling in, but this elevator has what I can only imagine as a generator that runs just shy of 24/7 behind my wall. It sounds very much like a leaf blower or small motor going nonstop, vibrating my brain into mush. I’ve tried sleeping with earplugs and my noise canceling headphones which it penetrates through both. Currently I’m starting to feel a pressure in my ears and finding them buzzing whenever I leave the space. With that said I feel it may be causing hearing damage which I want nothing to do with.

As of now I’ve put in a request for maintenance to take a look if possible and if something can be done, but still no reply. I’ll stop by the office again and see if I can find a solution there as well. If not I need to speak to someone about the situation as I haven’t slept a single night through and am in a terrible state because of it. I need a solution to this and any insight is much appreciated.

TDLR:

Bought a phone. Was non functional so got replacement. Replacement had faults. Sent it for repair, it was not fixed. Sent for repair again, took a month when it should have taken 10 days max. Still not fixed. Now being asked to send it for repair for a third time. I feel like I'm being played and i just want a refund. How do i go about this?

Full:

Hi all, sorry in advance for any mistakes I'm just incredibly frustrated at the moment.

I ordered an android phone on the 17th of September for ~ £400 and received it on the 19th . i bought it from the official company store. After i set my phone up there was a notification stating that i would need to restart the phone for an update, so i did this and the device became stuck in a restart loop. Basically it would restart and when the phone turned on again the touchscreen wouldn't work and 5 seconds later it would restart again. Clearly there was something wrong with the phone and i was able to get a replacement quite quickly with no hassle. Very happy with this.

When i got the replacement i noticed the videos and , occasionally, the display itself were very pixelated. From my research i gathered the phone had something called 'black crush' and colour banding. I initially ignored this as i was busy but after 2 weeks it became unbearable and i realised that i shouldn't have to put up with this, especially as it was a new phone.

After contacting customer service i was told that i was out of the 14 day period that i was able to get a full refund but i could instead post the phone and get it repaired for free. I was fine with this, i just wanted a fault-free phone. I also liked everything else about the phone. So after submitting for repair i waited around a week and a half for it to finished. Once i got my phone back i realised nothing had been fixed, the display issue was still unbearably apparent. I received a paper detailing the faults they'd found and the the steps taken to repair them. Apparently they repaired the display issue and even repaired an overheating issue

Obviously i was upset about this so i called explaining and they apologised and suggested i send it for postal repair again and they said they'd closely monitor it. I was still upset but still sent it anyway. This time the repair took around a month when it should have taken max 10 days. I complained and they apologised and said they'd give me a watch for my troubles. Fine. After the repair was complete, the report said they'd repaired the display issue and also a overheating issue (again?). I get the phone back and everything is exactly the same, nothing is fixed.

So i called again, pissed beyond belief adamant about getting a full refund. They said they'd escalate the issue and email me the next steps today. Well today i get an email saying after careful consideration they're advising me to post for repair AGAIN.

At this point i feel like I'm just being tossed around. Its been more than 2 and a half months since i originally purchased the phone. The warranty states that the phone should be replaced or repaired if its faulty and this is for 24 months. Since my phone has now been replaced and repaired (twice!) with no success is there a way to get a refund. I feel completely helpless and stuck and just want to be done with this phone.

Thanks

I have been getting stalked and harassed for almost a month now and I don’t know what to do.

I’m 16 and I feel so helpless. The stalker knows where I live and my phone number which makes me even more scared since I’m afraid that one day they will break in. I haven’t told anyone about this except my mum, but she said that it’s my own fault for being so vulnerable and week. I feel like I don’t have enough evidence for it to be addressed to the police so it’s like I’m meant to sit here and do nothing. I can’t react to whatever they’re doing and I can’t even fight back because then it’s ‘my fault’. 

I know that I can block them from my phone number but then how am I going to document everything they’ve done to me? And I’m scared that if things escalate, I can’t even escape since they know the exact apartment building I’m in.

-3x headsets ( 2x Earbuds + 1 wireless headset )
-2 dogs that have been living with the person for a month ish but I paid the breeders ( have texts/emails and withdrawal receipts from the ATM ) the vet and the insurances. 
-A car that I kept but the person broken something on it ( minor repair/200$ ).

Money that I lend :
-About 2000$ that never came back

Gifts for Christmas:
-Gaming chair ( 1300 )
-Tattoo ( 600 )
-Kids ( ex's kids that I will never see ever again... ) ( 500 )

I skip the gas and the rest I guess I have no legal return If it was a ***gift*** I think?

Question is, is there anything I can get back from that? 

I caught the person using my car and the money I was giving her to sleep left and right... in my car... with my money...after only 2 months. I spent so much by trying to help her. I feel gross out. Anyways,I want some legal justice. I am definitely filling for a restraining order ( I am scared if I get back the dogs, she will probably ask one of thosd guys to intimade me or worse ).

"It’s a little more complicated than that. I called my property manager on October 30th and told them November would be my last month with the complex. I’m on a month to month lease and I was told that was fine and I’d just be charged any days I stayed in December. I have none of this in writing. 

I had asked the property manager what the process was and she said she would get back to me with paperwork. I moved out by the 17th of November. 

On November 23rd my property manager calls me and asks if I had found a new place to live yet, I no longer lived here and had a uhaul out front that she definitely saw multiple times. I said I did and I must not have made myself clear that this was my last month. She said it they normally require 30 days notice in writing but she felt bad and would just write me a 30 days notice. She did and we both signed it. It is the normal 30 day notice document, it has “30 DAY NOTICE” on top and states my last day is November 30th and it’s signed November 24th.  

I reminded her that we had already talked about this but decided to just let it go, no harm no foul.

"Hello,

Context: I have mediation this week with a former employer for unpaid wages (which is documented). If insufficient, it will go to small claims. The majority of my claim is penalty pay provided by ORS 652.150. The rest of the suit is court/serving costs and alleged time-clock fraud. The company was notified of the missed wages before I terminated and nothing was done to remedy the situation. Oregon BOLI is a disaster so it has gone to court. It has been over a year with OR BOLI.

I am in a debate with my father on our positions regarding (ORS 652.140) (5) (Payment of wages on termination of unemployment), which states, ""***This section does not apply to employment for which a collective bargaining agreement otherwise provides for the payment of wages upon termination of employment***"".

The company I worked for has a contract with a collective bargaining agreement, which agrees to pay out wages at terminations by the ""next week"". It's been a lot longer than that. Oregon law also provides all wages payable on the last day of employment (in giving notice &gt;48 hours), so the time difference isn't drastic.

My collective bargaining agreement has a clause for the payment of wages upon termination and in the same period of OR law. 

Is the bolded subsection still within the law and valid as an exemption, or could it be enforced by a judge or jury? My argument is that it isn't valid as they have a valid collective bargaining agreement with a timeline - my father strongly disagrees, as any company with a Union could make a contract to set a date and simply avoid penalty pay altogether.

My Questions:

1. Does ""providing for the payment of wages"" within the agreement also involve proper payment to the employee? If not, are they subject to penalty pay under ORS 652.150?
2. Based on what is seen here, what is your best advice for mediation? I know I could settle for less and get it over with but this clause within the ORS is concerning. 
3. Does this clause jeopardize my situation in court and should mediation be brought to fruition?

"FYI, I'm crosslisting this with r/landlord

As the title goes, I'm a landlord of an apartment unit in a rowhouse in Philly. Water is leaking from the ceiling, so I contacted my insurance company and hired a technician. They checked my unit and upstairs and determined that it's caused by dishwasher upstairs. They started to dry the apartment out by using the machine, but the machine is extremely loud that my apartment is uninhabitable. So my tenant booked a hotel and is staying there.

Here are some relevant info: 

1. landlords in our building didn't hire a management company as a HoA, so they can't help in this situation.

2. Tenant doesn't seem to have renter's insurance, which would normally cover the hotel fee (I asked her and I haven't heard back). I didn't require her to get a renter's insurance.

Who should pay for hotel (my hunch is that the landlord upstairs would be responsible because the problem is caused by his unit), and are there laws that stipulate this? Also, would I have to refund the portion of rent that corresponds to the period she stayed in the hotel? Thank you!

"Bit of context: Posting it for a friend who doesn't use Reddit. This happened in Arizona.




In April 2023, I got involved in a car accident. It happened when leaving a crossroad: The car in front of me stopped suddenly after both of us started moving, and because of that I hit the rear bumper. 

The mom and two kids that were in the car were okay, we talked for a while and exchanged information, despite the bumper being damaged we carried our way.

...


Fast forward to today, I receive a call from my insurance, saying that they received a claim against me, saying that the car was totaled and the letter said ""As you know, my clients were injured in an automobile accident that required necessary and reasonable medical care"" including a medical bill of over $60,000 with items such as ""Custom Pain Management"" and ""Innovative Injury Solutions"".

These claims feel absurd to me, as it was a low-speed collision, even more so considering the time that has passed since it. I am currently unemployed and this is a really stressful situation. Do they have a case against me?

"Hi all I need some advice, In Seattle, WA, I bought 2 walmart gift cards through an online company, I got the card # and pin # for both and I had used up some on one of them at my local walmart. Well one day I decided to buy some grceries online and have them delivered because I wasn’t feeling well. So I go online and create a new account and an order, it was for about $185. I then attached both my gift cards to the account because on only had $105 left on it and the other one, still had it’s full $200.  
I placed the order and immediately I get an email saying that my order was cancelled for “return violations” and that my money would be refunded to my account. This seemed really dumb to me because for 1 it was a brand new account and for 2 I had only used the gift card 2 times and both times it was for groceries, never returned any of the items I bought ever.  
I figured it was just some technical glitch and since they said they were refunding my cards I didn’t think anything of it, well it wasn’t until a couple weeks later that I went to my local walmart to get groceries, I loaded up my cart and got into line and at the cashier I presented my cards and she tells me they have nothing on them, not even that she tells me they aren’t even active at all in the system she couldn’t even see the history of the card. I was livid and had to go get money to be able to pay for the groceries and I held up the line forever.  
So I got home and immediately called walmart, their cust service is SO bad, I was shuffled around to different departments for 2 hours on that first call, eventually I got disconnected, eventually I got ahold of someone who then sent me an email asking for proof of my purchase of the gift cards. I had bought these cards ONLINE, through the bitpay extension in chrome, the ONLY proof of purchase you get is the card sent to you, so I took a screenshot of the open extension showing the card # and pin for both cards, and I also took a picture of one of the reciepts from when I had used the card before. I then get a email back saying “this is not enough”  
I emailed them back telling them this is ALL I HAD! I called again and spent another 2 hours on the phone until I got so discouraged I gave up, I called again a day later and I got to one lady who told me I had to file a police report because their “security division” had TAKEN THE MONEY OFF MY CARDS AND CANCELLED THEM!!! These were legit cards I bought legally and they had never been reported stolen and they knew that I had already contacted them telling them they mistakenly cancelled my cards!  
I am just absolutely blown away by this, They expect me, a lifelong customer to file a police report to get the money that they took from me!!! The 6 hours I’d already spent on the phone wasn’t enough of a hassle they want me to contact a police dept!!!   
So yesterday I filed an online report with my local police department but I have no faith this will get anything done, The police have so much better things to do than deal with a walmart gift card dispute I feel so stupid even doing it. I’m so upset.  
I’m a disabled person living off of $1000 a month, that $305 was groceries for a entire month for me this is a very big loss for me. Can someone give me some advice? I cannot afford a lawyer or something to sue them, even if I could it’s only $305 I’m sure a lawyer would be thousands.

I’m in CA, is there a way I can file my own divorce and still get custody of my kids since she has not worked for 12 years and has no way of supporting them herself?

After a fight, that she decided to call the cops on me, I think the only move left is file for divorce. We’ve been married for almost 12yrs and have two kids (6&amp;10). And unsurprisingly the cops sided with her even when she was the one deciding to leave the house. I have been the whole provider for the entire time we’ve been married and she has been the one making all the important decisions from vaccines to education and religion. I have been through therapy and been made aware  by my therapist that she has been mentally and emotionally abusing me, but in her story I’m the unstable and abusing one.

She’s an avid feminist, because of previous experience and traumas, but all those things have nothing to do with me. She’s been ok with me up to the point where I want to ask for equality or when I ask for respect. At that point the feminist, individuality and empowerment kicks in and I’m crushed, shut down and ridiculed into me asking for forgiveness and me offering ways to work on the relationship. Alas me going to therapy but not her. Never her

Anyway, I’m just trying to offer perspective. After she called the cops on me tonight, the cops sided with her and ignored my rights and let her take the kids to her mom’s. After such humiliation (not event taking into consideration all the times she’s made ME apologizing for her wrongdoing and trying to make things work). I think we’re at the end of the road. Not because of me, but because her feminism (she rather burn the family, kids, relationship and anything else, before admitting she made a mistake) I need to file for divorce.

She hasn’t worked for 12 years, she has no way to support our kids and I do not have spare money to hire a lawyer.

"A friend of mine lives in a gated apartment complex in a slightly sketchy area of Houston. 

Tonight, they heard what they described as a “shootout” outside their second story apartment. A few minutes later, they noticed a hole through their window blinds in their bedroom, and blind and glass fragments all over the room. The “exit” hole was in the adjoining bathroom wall. No bullet has been found so it’s presumably in the wall. 

Police were called, a report was made, no suspects were detained to their knowledge. Multiple units (total number unconfirmed) were hit, with no injuries (presumably, since no ambulances were called). 

My friend understandably is ready to break their lease on this apartment and get the hell out. Do they have grounds to terminate? My research (which has been limited to google) is telling me no, but it’s also extremely unlikely that the shots were fired outside of the complex (due to the location of my friend’s unit and the window that was shot), so wouldn’t that be a safety liability of the complex?

"TL;DR: I'm taking a furniture store to small claims court in CT. I'm fairly certain I will win and they will refuse to pay. I want to understand better how to petition for a writ of financial execution (bank levy). 

As far as I understand it, I file the paperwork with the court, pay the fee upfront and it gets added to the bill the defendant owes along with post judgement interest. I then take that to a state marshall, but how do they know which bank to levy? Am I supposed to tell them where to go? And then what happens?

In March, I purchased a kids bedroom set from a local furniture store for ~$1400. When they sold it to me they assured me my order was in inventory. The next day they changed the story so that it was only partially available. Then they tried to push me to accept a lesser quality set. I refused to accept anything other than my full and complete order and they claimed it just needed more time. I asked for a refund and they refuse because they claim its a special order. Well after months with no bedroom set in sight, I filed a suit in small claims court. 

I looked up the store on my states Small Claims Court search site and saw 9 other lawsuits for similar reasons since 2021 (not delivering as promised, not refunding money). The store has lost 7 of 9 cases and the other 2 cases are still pending judgement, one bc the plaintiff needs a Portuguese interpreter, and the other has a hearing scheduled 4 days from now. So far the plaintiffs in the 7 lost cases have all had to file for a writ of execution (bank levy). Only one unrelated lawsuit has a satisfaction of judgement that I can see using the state civil court case lookup site. There is a copy of a check made out to the plaintiff in that case, I suppose this is the kind of info I give the state Marshall that serves the writ?

She got the guys info and insurance and cops showed up and took the guy away. Took my gf to the hospital to get checked out and we are now realizing she hasn’t paid her car insurance.

We also noticed she got a letter in the mail from AAA saying her bill was due and she has not been insured since December 9 but if she pays her bill by December 24 they’ll give her a lapse in coverage.

"So I am a rideshare driver in South Carolina. I was driving two passengers and was hit by another vehicle. My car was totaled and all three of us went to the hospital.

The other driver was at fault and they had no insurance. I already got paid for my totaled car through Ubers insurance (Minus $2,500 deductible). 

I've since finished all my doctor appointments and physical therapy etc. I still have damage to my eye but have been told by my lawyer I am already maxed out on potential money.

Like I saidI already have an attorney, but I want a second opinion on what they are telling me as it doesn't sound right and i have been told different by other attorneys as well.

My attorney is telling me that all Uber has to do is match my insurance coverage. I have minimum coverage and no underinsured coverage so my lawyer is saying the most we can get is $50,000, AND that is the aggregate amount so my two passengers will be competing for that money as well.

I have been told by other attorneys that anytime you physically have passengers in the car, Uber keeps coverage of $1,000,000 for uninsured/underinsured motorists. That's also what I have seen on various websites online.

Does anyone know which is which in South Carolina??? I find it really hard to believe that if I was killed by an uninsured driver while driving for with passengers for Uber, all my family would ever be able to get would be a maximum of $50k???

"For context I live in Iowa and a few years ago I was inherited a house from my dad in New Mexico. Only a few months after I inherited it (while I was still mourning) I did a dumb thing and signed my waiver of accounting and let my late father’s “best friend”( lets call him R) take over the estate. Mind you he stated he would rent it out and would pay me what the tenants were paying him along with help with the mortgage. While there are tenants there renting, I have not seen a dime from him. Also any “proof” he gives me about the mortgage is incomplete at best. Oh and did I mention I inherited this house in 2020, this has been going on for three years! 

I already talked to a lawyer and he was able to talk to R’s lawyer where they made a settlement. The settlement states R will put the house back in my name but I stop asking questions and for documents about the house (i.e. accounting and such). I don’t like this but it seems if I don’t take the settlement I will have to pay both my and R’s legal fees. Due it being too expensive I would have to accept the settlement. However the plan is to sue for legal fees and whatever I can find about the accounting and the mortgage on my own.

My question is how hard is it to sue someone in NM when you’re in IA. Mind you the house is in NM and so is him. Also keep in mind I’m thinking about moving there too, so I don’t know if I should move there first then sue or sue and then move.",How hard is it to sue someone in NM when you live in IA,18lurwl,1702965387.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18lurwl/how_hard_is_it_to_sue_someone_in_nm_when_you_live/,

"Hello,

Is there a minimum driving speed for NJ highways? I commute and drive to many places, but unfortunately my car is messed up, and I can't afford to fix it right now. With the car problem in mind, I try my hardest not to go over 50mph as high speeds aggravate the problem. In highways like the parkway, I put my hazard lights on and drive at 45-50mph on the right lane of the highway (on sections where the speed limit is 55mph).

I read somewhere that the minimum speed for the turnpike is 35mph, and I'm planning on taking the turnpike more often soon. I also read that impeding the flow of traffic is breaking the law, but I'm not sure if that applies to me if I'm driving with hazard lights on the far right lane.

Basically, I'm just asking if I'm breaking the law by going 45-50mph with my hazard lights on on the far right lane of highways. Am I legally allowed to drive 45 mph on highways with a speed limit of 65mph if I keep right?

Thank you.

EDIT: I suppose that I thought of this, but I use my hazard lights as I'm just a complete nuisance driving at a snails pace where the flow of traffic is 80mph. (Yeah sure, everyones speeding since the limit is 55mph on the section of parkway I'm in but still). I know that it is legally allowed in New Jersey to drive with my hazards on, but I looked online and it seems to be really frowned upon?

Later, she discovered the same oven, along with other appliances, in the parking lot trash. To avoid further fines and out of embarrassment, she took it in the car and went to the city landfill to dipose it of it herself.

"I used to work for this company for about 9 months as a subcontractor. I did piece work for them with signed contracts from both sides. We had agreed on prices and the work was completed on my side 100% as always. Everything was going good but the CEO started paying me late as well as with other subcontractors. This caused the subcontractors to get together and protest against him because he wasn't paying them on time. I didn't participate in the protest nor did I have anything to do with it. I got a call later that I was terminated for not letting them know about the protest which again I didn't know about. So now that I have been terminated, this company doesnt want to pay my outstanding balance of around $12,000. The second reason why he doesnt want to pay me is because around March I borrowed their company truck and accidentally hit the truck with their towing trailer. I notified the CEO right away and he told me thanks for being honest for letting him know. Months flew by and he kept telling me not to worry about it. I was insured and so was his vehicle. Now that I have been terminated, he wants to deduct $4,500 from the truck damages from my $12,000. I told him I thought he went through his insurance but he didn't. He wants me to agree to the 4500 or else he wont pay me anything. I tried with a few lawyers but they are expensive. I see this out of retaliation, he is scamming me from my work, he wants me to pay for the full truck damages when its his truck, his insurance. Can anyone help me on what to do.

Several bystanders gave statements and one even followed the men but the officer made no real attempt to catch them and took a month to file the police report which had many errors and made no mention of the phone and only had one witness named.

I even said that a screen shot electronically would work for me. 2. That if I removed the cap to the furnace that only the basement would get heated and not the upstairs. 

Now they are wanting to rewrite the lease to include all the new fees, in the pursuit of fairness. However, what can I demand legally in regards to payment of utilities/trash/water?

I have never consented to making a sex tape with him, so most likely he filmed it when I was drunk and at my most vulnerable state. He said if I leave him, he will post it on the internet and share it with my family, friends, and job.  
  
I'm wondering if I can take any legal action against him because a crime has been committed; he took a video of me without my knowledge, and he's also blackmailing me to stay in the relationship which is another crime, I think.

"I'm in a situation where I've always had health issues, but it declined considerably after contracting Covid. After Covid, I kept trying to work (software development) and went 100% remote, but my health continued to decline, to the point where I was regularly having to work from bed, and unable to focus well enough to do my job, and basically all outside activities except necessary ones like an occasional grocery store trip, doctors appointments, and short social visits of &lt;2 hours (coffee shop discussion, mostly) but any of the latter left me crashed for the rest of the day, and often the next. I was diagnosed with ME/CFS, POTS, MCAS, and CCI. After consulting with my doctor, I applied for short-term disability with Prudential. It was initially approved, but I could tell that there was some pushback after a few months, and at the start of month 4, the denied it as ""not medically supported"". 

Since then, I got a 2-Day CPET test, a tilt table test, and MRIs showing CCI at the behest of my doctors for objective results, as well as disability letters from both my doctor, my physical therapist, and the facility that performed the 2-Day CPET test. I also contacted a lawyer, who sent in a letter to them asking for what information that they had on file, what information they needed, and how to apply for LTD. This was at the end of October, and Prudential has not responded. I have until January to request an appeal, and my lawyer doesn't want to do anything until he gets their response, but it looks to me that Prudential does not intend to respond, hoping that either no appeal request is made, or one is made but with insufficient information. To make things even more stressful, the lawyer does not appear to be reading the emails that I send him, or even listen to what I saw on a phone call, with 90% of what he says being boiler plate information. Obviously, I am freaking out.

I have less than a month until the appeal request needs to be made, my lawyer is doing nothing, and Prudential not disclosing the information that my lawyer needs.

"I was recently in an accident with an SUV (mind you am I am in a sedan), basically I was trying to turn left since my lane essentially came to a stop and the speed limit on this road is like 40 so I didn't realize how fast the cars would be coming at me since I was stopped. I hit her passenger side right door, and wrecked up my left bumper.

I pulled over and exchanged info with her, and she seemed not too bothered, more understanding than mad. She even asked me if I was a student at her sons high school, to which I replied no. My point is she was not shaken up, nor was she senile either. She was maybe in her mid 40s- early 50s.

A little while later I get a call saying she checked into a doctor for shoulder pain and this is now an injury claim from a normal claim. I have a suspicion that she's not actually injured, and when I texted her asking if she was alright, she said that she is going to see a chiropractor since her shoulder was initially fine. I completely understand the need for this service if this was anything but a minor accident. I mean she was in an SUV, and I was in a ford fusion. I was perfectly fine afterwards, and so were the other 2 passengers, one of which wasn't even wearing a seatbelt (didn't know till afterwards.)

What are your thoughts? I'm not saying she's lying, but I just find it hard to believe that she really sustained injuries like that (assuming she wore a seatbelt.)  


  
edit: we both have the same insurance company, which makes me feel like our insurance is less likely to ""investigate"" whether she's really injured and will just ask us to pay (we already met out deductible so it'll just make our premium go up more than it already will be going up from this accident.)","Was in a minor car accident, other party claims they need to see a chiropractor.

"Sports Med Legal Question

I have an odd discussion topic here, and I’m curious if anyone else has an experience similar at all.

I partially tore my ACL back in January of this year. No idea either. I was on my school’s cheer team, and we were warming up right before a game when a flyer fell on my knee and my knee subluxated. It hurt like a bitch. Sports med said they thought there was a chance it was  a meniscus tear, but they only gave me an X-Ray and since I was improving with PT, they never gave me an MRI. They just said it was a knee subluxation. Looking back I should’ve pushed it more, but I just figured they probably know what they’re doing, so I continued with my rehab. I did about 8 weeks of rehab with sports med and was continuing on pretty normal, just trying not to push my knee. During my rehab, my knee tweaked about a month after my original injury as I was climbing into a boat. It was sore and hurt for a few days, but then my rehab helped it again.

Fast forward to June, my knee is definitely feeling better, so I assume it was just a subluxation and it’s better now. I was playing beach volleyball with my friends when my knee tweaked out. It hurt similarly to on the boat. Again, sore for a few days. A few days after that, I was out with my friends and I was leaning backwards and my knee gave out and I fell. Later that night, I started getting extreme shooting pains all the way from my kneecap down to my feet. Hurt SO bad for HOURS nonstop. My dad takes me to an orthopedic, and they do an MRI. Turns out, my ACL is completely torn through, but the doctor said it looked like an old tear. We concluded what probably happened was I partially tore it back in January, and then fully tore it in June. I might’ve been tearing it slightly the two times I tweaked it before the full tear, who knows!

Long story short, my dad was livid with sports med and considered taking legal action. He calmed down, and I do not want to cause anything, but some people I have talked to recommend we should and they mishandled it. I ended up not participating in cheer the following year due to the injury, so I haven’t been to sports med since the spring. When I inquired about sports med covering my surgery, there was an issue that I haven’t technically seen them since April, so they may not be able to cover it. The semester ended at the end of April, and even though I evidently initially tore it in January and was working with sports med, it was an outside doctor that told me I should get surgery when I further injured it months later in June.

If anyone has any advice or perspectives on this, I am open to everything! I don’t have a pressing wish to sue my school’s sports med lol, but I’m just curious as to what people think.


TLDR: I partially tore my ACL in January and my school’s sports med never gave me an MRI. I then fully tore it in June not knowing I ever originally tore it because sports med never went through all the steps to conclude if I did so. People have told me I should seek legal action or at least try to get them to cover the surgery/PT, but I am very unsure of the legality of things.",Sports Med not properly diagnosing my ACL injury,18lrucn,1702956011.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18lrucn/sports_med_not_properly_diagnosing_my_acl_injury/,

The problem is that I set up Autopay for it in February 2023. Apparently autopay hadn't gone through since April, but I had no idea. They send me monthly statements via email,  but nothing out of that to communicate missed payments, like any other organization usually does. I never looked at my statements because I didn't know anything was out of the norm (like I do with all my other bills, like electric or gas). They claim they sent me a final written notice via the mail in October, but I never received it. I asked for proof and they just pushed it back on me saying they don't have proof I never received the letter. They sent me to collections and are charging me $900 in fees (the HOA and late fees) plus $600 in attorney fees because it went to collections). I told them I had no problem paying the HOA fees and even the late fees for missing the statements, but I am trying to fight them on the attorney fees. It feels like a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, because I never received any notice whatsoever outside my monthly statements. I'm not a lawyer so maybe I'm wrong but either way, I'm just trying to see if I have any legal grounds to push back on the attorney fees at all.

I was getting stuff out the boot of my friends car in the allocated spot next to their house and a car rolled downhill down the road towards us.

The first hit was when the car hit the back of my left leg, it trapped my leg between it and the bumper of my friends car. I managed to get out easily and the shock of what happened meant I couldn’t feel any pain but I was limping without realising.

"Hi... I'm making this post cause I'm a) in shock and b) genuinely don't know what to do.

I bought a used 2012 Buick Verano in late August, and it was driving fine until December. In December, I noticed it sounded a bit loud, and about 2 days ago it started rocking when I was braked at a stop sign. The only time it had any performance difficulties was when it was fully braked at a stop sign or stop light. 

I took it in to a mechanic today and they called me very puzzled. When I got there, they pulled out the dipstick and showed me that there was not even a single drop of oil on it. While the car has 166,000 miles on it, it is not even close to due for an oil change. It should not have burned through that much oil in 4 months, and I have not noticed any leaks. 

I've driven it probably 2,000 miles since I bought it in August, 300 since it started sounding weird, and 80 or 90 since it started that rocking motion. I asked my mechanics if they think it would be permanently damaged, and they said they didn't know for certain but were very surprised that the engine has not locked up yet. 

Is this something I could litigate the dealer who I bought the car from? ",Car with no oil,18nz7ky,1703197808.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nz7ky/car_with_no_oil/,
"My partner is currently working for a small, family-owned retail business in Seattle, Washington. There was a verbal agreement with the business owner to have a something of a ""trial period"" for her first month of employment where she will be paid $20 an hour. There was no contract or employment paperwork of any kind. That month came and went, and my partner asked for an update because she wanted health insurance. She was told that all of that would be officially processed come December, which would be her three-month mark at the job. 
It's now mid-December and she confronted her employer on it again. Her employer then said there was paperwork that had to be done and it'd be better to wait until January to become an official employee because it'd be a new enrollment period for health insurance. Her employer also said she's been ""processing"" things for her employment, which is a vague statement that sounds more like a stalling tactic. As of now, my partner still has not received any paperwork. 
Her paychecks are inordinately large for the amount of hours she has been working, so we suspect that there are no taxes being deducted and that this employment is under-the-table so her employer can avoid paying taxes. I've received advice to have her get her taxes prepared by a professional, to contact an employment attorney, and to report the employer to various state institutions. Her immediate supervisor is the owner's daughter, who has expressed her frustration at the situation and said she has previously had issues with her mother ""messing up"" tax-related matters that have affected her in the past. She also said her mother is extremely secretive on the business practices.

My partner likes her job a lot. It's the first job she's had that hasn't been terrible. She's fond of the coworkers and she's fond of her boss, the owner's daughter. She has few interactions with the owner and only wants to work above board so she can continue doing what she likes without facing legal repercussions. I'm interested in knowing if she is liable for anything if this income isn't being taxed. She plans on declaring her income at the end of the year and has kept all the checks she has received. If this all did work out and she became an official employee, would there be any repercussions she could face?

Additional information
- There is nothing in writing declaring her an employee, what her pay is, or if this job is under the table or not. The closest thing may be texts to her supervisor asking when she's going to get insurance
- The company is almost certainly small, under 50 people
- Her employer has not threatened any kind of retaliation
- Her hours are tracked in a notebook or some piece of paper where employees write down their clock-in and clock-out times
- Her paychecks are all physical checks, entirely handwritten (around biweekly, they aren't particularly consistent...)
- She is not looking to be paid under-the-table and is unaware what the legal status of her work is now. She assumed that the business owner would take care of things throughout this, but there is no indication that the owner has done anything now
- She is a U.S. citizen who is legally authorized to work
- This is all my understanding of the situation. She has not reviewed this post at the time of writing.
- She just texted me 3 minutes ago to say she got a $500 Christmas bonus and feels bad now (because nothing can ever be simple black-and-white)
- We are both in our early 20s.

"I really need some legal advice. I'm from a very small town and I feel like there is no guidance on how I should handle a situation.

  
Background: From 2012-2015 I was in an abusive relationship. I left my abuser and meet my husband. We have been together for 7 years now and married for 4 years. We have two small children together. I had a lot of guilt that I never went to the police about my abuser and I found out he was still abusing women. I found this out at the end of 2018 going on to 2019. I thought I had been coping very well with all the things I went through with my abuser. I was truly happy in life and felt as if I moved on from the entire situation. But after I found that out that my abuser was abusing other women I started to have terrible PTSD. I started counseling. I did a podcast in 2020 about my experience with domestic violence. This podcast did not state his name and it was a local podcast.

  
Fast forward to January of 2023. My abusers current girlfriend reached out and asked if she could talk to me because she was going through a lot. I did not know this girl, but I wanted to talk with her because I felt it was important to be there for her despite not knowing her. I know how lonely it can be when you are in the situation and pushed all your closest friends away from embarrassment. She we talked for almost an hour and she stated that my abuser had paid the host of the podcast $1000 to delete the podcast. This podcast was aired for 3 years! I was absolutely enraged and I made a Facebook status to vent my rage. I did not say the hosts name or my abusers name. A police officer then call me and states that I can delete the Facebook status or my abuser is going to sue me for defamation. I stated that my abuser is literally wanted in Canada for an assault charge because he put me in the hospital and then fled the country after he was released from jail and that he silenced me before but he won't do it again. The next day the police show up to my work and serve me a Protection Order of Abuse. My abuser went to the courts and stated that he fears for his life and that I have been threatening his life. My Facebook status was not threatening, it stated ""it's a shame that I had the courage to share my story and the host of the podcast accepted $1000 FROM MY ABUSER and deleted my voice"" something along the lines of that. I had not spoken to my abuser in almost 8 years. Then I receive charges in the mail for stalking and harassing my abuser. I hired a lawyer and the lawyer got in touch with the General Attorney. We eventually all meet together (me, my lawyer, the general attorney, and the police officer) and I told my story. The general attorney dropped my case but this was all after 3-4 months of stress, anxiety, and fearing for MY LIFE. The police officer who charged me had NEVER interviewed me, despite knowing that it was a domestic violence case. Despite knowing that my abuser was WANTED in Canada for assaulting me. I just feel this was all very wrong and unjust. I need some guidance to see if I have a civil case.

I am in Florida. 

To be clear I know for a fact that I have not signed a non-compete.

My current company (company 1) has a contract with the company hiring me (company 2) where we collaborate with them on a couple projects. Company  2 is ending this contract and hiring me since I have experience working on these projects.

"Dad died, I inherited his small apartment in California.

The building manager is also a broker. He was the dual broker that represented me and my tenant. 

He told me everything checked out, no evictions, no bankruptcies, no arrests, etc. 

They stopped making payments 2 months ago and I just served them a 3 day or quit notice.

After doing some research, going through court documents, etc...I found that the tenant has been evicted FIVE TIMES. They've also declared bankruptcy twice (once under the wife's name, once under the husband's name).

So obviously I got scammed and now I just started the very long, painful, and expensive process of eviction in California. 

My question is this: Did the broker have any sort of fiduciary (I guess?) responsibility to tell me about the evictions/bankruptcies? He straight up lied to my face as well, so he didn't just withhold information from me, he actively lied/misled me.

"We are in conflict with our neighbor for various reasons, one of them being that she is our community gossip and has told multiple people that my husband abuses us and we neglect our children. None of this is true. They've even tried to find ways to get us evicted to no avail. If anything, they are the ones who should not be living here because they do not abide by the rules of the community. 

  
Anyway, the neighbor has a friend who is a social worker. She told the social worker friend about two things that had happened in their house over the last year. The social worker, who does not have a mandate to report anything outside of their professional work, goes and reports what her friend told her as if she were the one in the situation. Mind you, we stopped letting our 5-year-old son go to their house at the end of September/beginning of October due to their sons bullying our child. The situations in the report were grossly exaggerated, out of context, and happened months ago. Also, the reporter wasn't there for any of the situations. We and the neighbors had a conversation when each situation happened and then talked to our kids about it with all parties present. The one situation where my son pulled down his pants in front of his friends was resolved immediately and all of the kids were talked to because they are boys and like to get naked. Their youngest boy still goes out onto the balcony without any clothing or underwear/pullup. 

   
I feel like because we are not speaking to each other anymore, and she continues to talk about us in a negative light to whoever will listen, she decided to tell her friend about the incidents, after we reported them for housing violations in mid-October, in order to get someone other than her to report us for child neglect because she's already tried to report us in the past and everything was unfounded. They tried to say our kid leaves our house without permission and that he is a sexual deviant. He's 5! These current allegations were unfounded as well when we were assessed. 

  
Aside from getting new neighbors at this time, is there something/anything that we can do? The social worker listened to her friend and is trying to be supportive, however, if you know your friend is in conflict with their neighbor and then tells you their 5-year-old is a sexual deviant and comes over to the house too much, what would you do? Are we able to go after our neighbor for harassment and defamation? Can we report the social worker friend for a conflict of interest? We are in VA.

They didn’t have one in stock in the color and trim level I wanted, but assured me they had one scheduled to arrived yesterday, on the 20th of this month.

"Hi,

I just moved into a new multi-story apartment as a tenant, and a week into moving in, my wife accidentally used the wrong type of soap-detergent for the diswasher and suds/water leaked out from the diswasher. The affected area is aroudn The flooring was engineered hardwood, meaning that water doesn't naturally dryout. 

I immediately notified the  homeowners, and they took charge from there, instructing me to buy industrial fans and to dry it out. After one day, they immediately contacted a remediation company and told me to put in a claim to renters insurance, noting that it was my fault (for using the wrong dishsoap).

The remediation company came the next day, measured the damaged area (which is like a 3 by 3 ft. area) using a water meter, and negotiated with the homeowners for a total max bill of \~$7.3K, after claiming that the floorboards need to be ripped out and dried (which myself and potentially my insurance is covering) The bill includes things such as removing the diswasher, equipment rentals (\~$3K) HEPA vacuuming ($600), etc.

Now the weirdest thing is, when I tried to talk with the guy from the remediation company, he refused to talk to me, because apparently company policy. I've contacted the owners, and the owner said ""yeah apparently it's company policy but you can talk to us and we'll ask them any questions you have.""

The crew is now in my house, creating a containment zone to rip off the floorboards. One of the members have fortuantely told me that apparently it is NOT company policy when it comes to not talking with tenants, and that it is the owner that likely requested to company not to talk to me. 

Apparently if they do happen to discover mold in the floorboards, it's going to be a big issue. Are the owners trying to screw me somehow?

"I’m going to preface this by saying I’m not even sure if I want to pursue damages for anything, I’m just curious what my options are. I also don't know if this is lawyer territory or small claims territory.

On Oct 17, I was driving my 2017 F150 to pick up my SO’s kids from their grandparent’s house when a car failed to stop at a stop sign and proceeded into my lane; I was unable to stop in time, nor avoid the accident by swerving off to the side, and my LF corner collided with their LR corner. I have a dashcam that corroborates this, as well as the driver behind me gave witness statement. 

I reside in (and the accident occured in) WA, the other driver is from BC, Canada.  Police arrived on scene, took my information and my account of what happened, and did the same for the other party. I provided the officer with dashcam footage when he returned my documents, at which point he explained that the other party had tried to blame me, claiming I was speeding (to which he questioned why they proceeded from a stop sign, knowing I was speeding), then changed to claiming I didn't have my headlights on (Canadian born truck, I'm not able to turn off the headlights; AND it was in the middle of the day), and finally changed to ""maybe I just didn't see him"". Officer found them at fault, issued them tickets for inattentive driving (or similar) and failure to stop at a stop sign.

The exchange of information provided by the officer contained their insurance policy information. My insurance policy does not have coverage for a rental vehicle, so I reached out to the other party's insurance provider to seek compensation for a rental truck. At that point, they told me that the other party, despite providing something (expired policy, whatever it was; they also verbally told me verbatim that they DO have auto insurance currently, as well as traveller's insurance if that's important), did NOT have coverage on the incident date. My insurance is now footing the bill for my truck's repair via uninsured motorist coverage, but the expense to tow my vehicle AND not having my truck for 2 months (and counting) w/o rental coverage is not recoverable from my own policy. 

So now comes my questions: What can I do about the lack of insurance coverage on their part, despite verbally telling me they did, as well as providing something to the officer showing they ""did"" (again, may have been an expired card, with a statement of ""oh, I left my current one at home""). Can the responding agency retroactively issue a citation for that, and how would I go about that? Secondly, can I sue the other driver for the tow expense and loss of use of my vehicle for the duration that it was waiting to go to the shop/in the shop? How would I determine the value of that claim (pricing out an equivalent 1/2 ton pickup for a period of 2 months comes to ~$5500)? And finally, is it even worth it?

Staff resources etc. Early this year they had to issue an ERTE (or a state sponsored sort of Social Security reduction of pay)  to some of our key roles in management including myself. However this does not include a foreign employee eg. me. So a written agreement was done for a 20% reduction for the first 6 months of 2023 to be paid back in December of this year (about $10K).

Though already in the works it began to drag out to painful levels over the last 6 months and in between they had to continue the ERTE, but from what I could see from US unemployment it seemed if I was going to be reimbursed, I didn't qualify for claiming a reduction of pay benefit (I could be wrong?).

"A couple of months ago I moved into an  apartment in St. Paul MN. The day I moved in I noticed a strong fragrance smell that I had not smelled when I did the tour. I suffer from chronic (nearly daily) migraines, and fragrance is one of the worst triggers for me.

I spoke with the management that day, and asked if there was anything that could be done about it. Got the brush off. Over the next couple weeks I sent a couple more emails (one with a note from my neurologist), and talked to office staff again. This resulted in one small air fragrance unit being removed from the hallway on the floor where I live.

However, there are several public spaces on the 1st floor that are supposed to be open for all residents to use, as well as an elevator which all still have air freshener.

2 weeks ago I sent both an email to the building manager, and a letter to the management company formally requesting (in accordance with ADA and HUD regulations) that they stop using air freshener and any fragrance in the public spaces and the elevator that are not specifically used for disinfection or cleaning. I requested that they respond within 2 weeks/10 business days.

Since then the only communication I have had is an email and follow-up conversation where the building manager asked for my neurologist's contact information so he could give it to the corporate legal department (I provided it). This was 9 days ago.

"TLDR: A public utility company is trying to charge me with a $300+ past due balance of a previous tenant, in the previous apartment I lived in, however I was never informed of the past due balance being transferred to me till I saw it on my bill 3 months after setting up my utilities account. I refused to pay the balance and 2 years later after moving out of the apartment and canceling services, I received a collections notice for that same balance from a collections company collecting on behalf of the public utility company. Now I don’t know what to do and I need suggestions on what to do from here to get the collections removed and to have the utilities company remove the balance from my account because it is not mine. The past due balance belongs to the previous tenant who didn’t pay their utility bill before I moved into that apartment. 

Full Story: So back in March of 2021, I moved out of my college dorm and into an apartment that was not far from campus. The rooms in the apartment were leased individually, not as a whole unit, so  my apartment mates and I each had our own lease agreement. When I moved in, I was taking over the remaining lease of the previous tenant who had previously occupied my room. Shortly after moving in I was asked by my apartment mates if I could take over the utilities account for the apartment since the previous tenant was in charge of it and they were already paying other utilities like gas and Wifi, which we split all bill totals evenly amongst ourselves of course. I agreed and soon after opened my first-ever utilities account with, for the sake of confidentiality, I’ll call the company Rside Public Utilities. When I called to set up my account and start utilities, I was told I’d pay a sign-up fee of $20 and a deposit of $100 which would be on my first bill. There was NO mention or notification that there was a past-due balance already associated with the apartment address when I signed up. 3 months go by and I’m paying the utilities on time each month, then all of a sudden in June the utility bill is $300+ more than what it has usually been in the past 3 months. I checked with my apartment mates to ask if they’ve been using utilities more and they claim they didn’t, which I believed bc one of my apartment mates was big on keeping the lights off if we weren’t occupying the space like our living room or kitchen. I then looked at the bill again and noticed the $300+ balance was listed under past due, and I knew that was incorrect because I made sure my utility bill was paid on time each month ( I even have the bank statement charges and previous bills to prove it). So I went ahead and contacted the utilities company to figure out where this past due charge came from. After contacting them, I then found out that the balance was transferred over from the previous account owner who was listed under my apartment, which was the previous tenant whose room I took over. It turned out that she was never paying the utility bill and the balance kept adding up, and now that I was the new owner listed under our apartment address, for some reason, Rside Public Utilities transferred that balance over to me, even though I didn’t owe anything because I had been paying my balance on time since opening my account 3 months prior. For days I kept calling them to try and figure this out and to get the $300+ balance removed from my account because IT WASN’T MY DEBT AND I DIDN’T OWE IT. Mind you, I was NEVER informed of the past due balance before/while opening my account, otherwise I never would have opened an account or would have taken action sooner. Each time I tried to call Rside Public Utilities, I kept getting transferred from one person to another, being told that they couldn’t remove the balance and that I had to pay it. After trying for a few days, I told them that I was not going to pay that balance and that it was not mine to begin with. Looking back I wished I got some of this communication documented via email or mail instead of over the phone, but I was 19 and didn’t know any better on how to handle a situation like this. After that, I kept on paying what my apartment mates and I OWED and ignored the past due balance on my bill till the end of my lease when I moved out at the end of August. I paid my last utility bill for that specific apartment in October bc the period was August-Sept for the last bill. I contacted Rside Public Utilities to schedule a turn-off of service for that apartment, to which they tried to let me know I still had the past due balance and I again told them I wasn’t paying it because it wasn’t my balance but the previous tenant which they failed to collect from. When I turned off the service, I was hoping that the past due balance would just transfer over to the next tenant who opened an account for that apartment like it did to me and someone else would worry about it. After a few months, I checked my utility account and noticed that the balance was reduced by $100 because they had used my $100 deposit towards the $300+ balance. I continued to ignore the balance hoping the utilities company would realize I was serious about not paying the balance and that they were charging the wrong person. (Again looking back not the best idea and I could have handled it better but I was 19, didn’t know better and honestly was tired of going back and forth with the utilities reps over the phone and getting nowhere). Fast forward 2 years later, this past August of 2023 I got an email from a collections company stating I owe a balance to Rside Public Utilities. To be honest I had forgotten about the balance so I didn’t realize they had kept the balance on my account 2 years later. I was now outraged that they had sent my account to a collections company, negatively affecting my credit. I tried to look into what I could do but just the thought of trying to fight this again was overwhelming and I didn’t know where to start. I tried filing a complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission but when I called they said they deal with private utility companies, not public ones. I thought about taking the utility company to small claims court and suing, but it seems like that might be an overreaction, plus the thought of going through the process is overwhelming and I certainly don’t have the funds for it. I just don’t know what to do or where to begin to correct this whole situation and now my credit has been affected because of a debt that isn’t even mine to begin with. So please if there are any suggestions on what I should do or the plan of action I should take it would be greatly appreciated!!!

"I think what I went through was severely mishandled. Someone I used to work with and their associates neglected me unjustifiably when I was in a severe mental state and tried to distance themselves with the police by spinning a bunch of lies about our personal history through a string of cases. They all had like a personal grudge with me, and i was innocent and silent and they took full advantage of that along with my severe mental state. This spilled into another case. Their neglect caused me to get involved with these other people not related to us in a seperate case, but the subject connecting them was avoided. When i forced the subject, my alternate defender said we could go to trial instead of diversion but you risk a jury. Also, my defender doesnt want to facilitate the discussion at all. When I tried to, they threatened to make me incompetent despite my court doctor's approval.

My point is is the alternate public defender won't tell me why I got an alternate defender. There is no other witness, nobody in these cases that would be represented by my alternate defender. So my defender said ""for example, it can be a witness."" The only freaking witness can only be one of those diabolical people indirectly involved from an inactive case they are referring to to accuse me of criminal behavior motive from a pattern.

 Why was it handled this way? I speculate the ""invisible"" person made up a bunch of excuses like i sexually assualted them, which is a lie, but is clearly written in multiple reports to get to the police and court to make then distanced as much as possible. Dont get me started on how petty and ridiculous it is they told the police these false things, all so they could please their trashy friends and boss, all connected. My private attorney before my alternate defender was also horrible and seems like he was swayed by all the lying. My previous private attorney, for 4 cases, there was no phone conversation or underlining documents, nothing to facilitate discussion/arguing against these horrible lies that made me look like scum I was not even aware about until it was way too late. It wasn't until I got an alternate defender that things were underlined for me and there were finally phone discussions. I had no idea it was an ""alternate"" situation due to retaining my private attorney until near the end.

So what can I do to get back at this person for deliberately lying about me to the police to ruin my life so they could laugh about it with their boss s and friends and get high. People say go civil, but I don't want to do that. I tried reporting to the police and district attorney and my past private attorney, but to no avail, nothing worked as far as I know.

The judge on my active case tried to put majority of blame on me which is wrong, because this is about people refusing to communicate with me for unjustified reasons, causing me to get in trouble with my severe mental state. They tried to guilt trip me and distract me, separating these people from my case intentionally which is wrong. I think my only option was to go to trial and risk a jury, but I chickened out and am getting a letter from my therapist to go with diversion. So what's the deal with this alternate defender thing?

Myself and my fiancé would both like to change our full legal names. We also intend to get married. I read online that family attorneys handle marriage topics. We’d like to know what would be the better way to go about this process. We have 3 options:

Originally she was going to keep the dog since she was the one who wanted the dog in the first place. However, my boyfriend really loved the dog and his ex agreed to somewhat share custody of her. So they did this for a awhile but now his ex has decided to go work a province away, she left the dog with us for three months and now she’s back for the off season of her job for 3 months and is planning to leave the dog in our care for 9 months when she goes back to work, without paying us anything. She’s requesting that we regularly send her pictures and videos of the dog so we would be in communications the whole time. After that she’s planning to just take the dog back and move away with it forever. I think this is absolutely ridiculous and I don’t know why she’s treating us like free dog sitters if we’re not entitled to the dog in any way.

"Location: Brooklyn, NY

About 2 years ago, a close friend of mine with a large house offered to let me and my partner store some of our stuff in her garage as well as use a room in her basement as an art studio. She says she isn't using the space and is happy to help.  We offer to pay her for storing our stuff and she declines (multiple times). We pay for a new doorknob/lock on the basement space and install it so we can come and go without bothering her. This was all fine until about a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

A year into the arrangement, she rescues an aggressive dog and now says we can't come over until he's trained.  She did make an exception once during these initial months of the dog's presence where I worked on a painting in the basement for an afternoon.  She continues to cancel social plans as well as our planned visits to the basement ""studio"".

&amp;#x200B;

Six months later she barely responds to texts or calls.  Her son has suddenly moved out because ""he is sickl of \[her\] shit"" and is living in a homeless shelter just to be out of her reach.  Now I am becoming a little concerned but trying to maintain trust in my longtime friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months ago she completely stopped responding to any attempt to reach her on phone or social media.  I've kept sending texts checking in and cute memes on Instagram and she doesn't even open them.  Then we buy a house and are moving.  I text her about it saying that I would ideally love to hang out if you're up for it, but if not, we can just grab our stuff and get out of your way.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the day before the moving truck arrives.  We decide to go to her house in the evening (she's a night owl) and just go see if our stuff is still in the basement and just grab it.  The back gate was stuck (not unusual) so I climbed over to find there is a padlock on the gate that was never there before.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point my ""friend"" lets her aggressive dog out encouraging him to attack me and is screaming obscenities and accusations of cheating and lying and manipulating her.  I immediately leave back over the gate and go around front to knock and try and figure out wtf has happened to cause this sudden flip in my friend.  She never does open the door and continues to scream accusations and obscenities at us.  Her neighbor at one point comes out and asks if we need help and casually mentions that she (my friend) has been having screaming matches with their other neighbor lately. It;s beginning to become apparent my friend is suffering some sort of mental health crisis (has long history)

She threatens to call cops.  We tell her she should because we aren't doing anything wrong.  Cops show up and are completely useless.  They tell us she wants us to come back in a week at 3pm and that they can't do anything because ""it's a civil matter"". After leaving she sends multiple walls of text to me and my partner that includes the statement she's ""keeping my plants as payment"".  Rather than engage I agreed to the date and declined my plants as payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow is the 22nd and today she texts and rescheduled  to the 23rd as well as more abusive language and accusations.  At this point, I'm not holding my breath that she follows through.  I just  want my stuff. I don't care about punishing her or damages.

"Pretty much what the title says. I live in Georgia and understand that there is no minimum requirement for notification unless it's specified on the lease. On the lease it states that the landlord or any of his agents are required to give 6 hours notice before entry into the apartment. There's an exterminator that he has come and spray bugs every month, but due to the fact I have cats HE said he wouldn't be coming out anymore. The next month came around and while I was in bed I heard a knock on my door that I didn't answer because I wasn't expecting anyone. He unlocked my door and came in. I went out, told him I thought he wasn't coming anymore and he said ""well I changed my mind to check for roaches."" There are no roaches in this building, there is 0 reason to believe there is. I haven't seen any and definitely would have reported it if I did. I told him this and he quickly left. Now this month he knocks on the door again and tries to come in again even after informing him that he is required to give me notice of at least 6 hours according to the lease. He called my landlord and now my landlord tried to send me an intimidating message about forcing me to move and to just let him into the apartment. He also complained about the one time he was in the apartment while I was at work and I hadn't gotten the chance to clean(10 hour shifts, and I live alone with 3 cats). He said there was kitty litter everywhere and it smelled like cat crap. I feel like I'm being targeted for having cats even though the lease states that I am allowed to have cats.

"Hello everyone. I am posting this on behalf of a family member. 

This family member took out student loans to an amount of around ~$15000 to finish their college education. Upon finishing in spring of 2020, they paid off the rest of the loan to the loan provider. Everything went through and we got confirmation that the loan was paid in full. It was a relief to be debt free and we thought that that would be the end of it. 

This family member applied for the student loan forgiveness plan when Biden went into office and it was approved and they received a check in the mail in the amount of $10000. This was before the supreme court ruling and whatnot afterwards that stopped the loan forgiveness. The check was issued by the IRS and we thought that we had gotten lucky with the loan forgiveness. 

Just last week, the student loan provider reinstated $10000 in loans for this family member, stating that it was due by the end of December 2023, after which interest would begin to accrue. We were confused and upset so we called them up and they just kept talking about how there was a loophole and since the loan forgiveness was overruled, we would have to return the money.

We'd like advice on the legality of the entire situation. We were told that we had paid off the loans in full (between us and the loan provider). The IRS refunded us. How can the loan provider come back and say that the loans were not paid? Any clarity would help because coming up with $10000 in 2 weeks is not easy.

"Hi, curious about the best way to approach this situation. Last week I was at a restaurant and alerted my server, who took note on the ticket, that I have a nut allergy. We ordered a dish that normally had pesto and it came without it, which made me feel that it was communicated accurately. 

Shortly after this, another appetizer came out and I took a bite and immediately started feeling my lips and throat swell. It turns out the dish was basically made entirely of cashews and at that point I knew I was in trouble. My lips continued to swell, my throat felt tight, and I got violently ill on the way to the hospital. I was treated for anaphylaxis, the reaction returned 2 hours later, and so I was kept overnight to be monitored. I unfortunately didn't have my epi pen on me, which I know is a huge mistake on my part but I wasn't planning on eating a face full of cashews that night. 

Meanwhile, the day after, the owner called and emailed me to apologize, invite me back to his restaurant to make up for it (????) and also said that the allergy **was** written on the ticket, and that my reaction was due to ""their neglect"". 

I emailed the owner back and let him know of my experience, that I decline his invitation back, and if he wanted to provide a more meaningful gesture, he could pay for my $300 copay. I luckily have very good insurance. This was over a week ago and there has been no response.

She said we get one day per month we work, which doesn't add up to 60 anyway because we work 9 months of the year and are required to be on campus for 7 hours and 15 minutes a day ( we generally work more but thats another story.)

"Hi,

I want to start a website/business with the name and logo from a company that shutdown a few years ago. The industry of the new company will be the same as the old one. The old trademarks are all dead now. 

- Is this legal?
- Is there a difference (legally) between using name and logo?
- Do I have to register them as my own trademarks before I use them?
- Can I register them as my own trademarks?

"Hello everyone,

My wife and I are getting ready to sign a lease at a new place. The landlord has seemed great so far, though she just sent us a lease which includes a stipulation which states that no pets are allowed in the home, though we’d spoken about our cat moving in as well. The landlord, via text to me, when pointing out the discrepancy, says to sign the lease anyhow and she’ll send over an addendum.

Is this fine to do, on account of the fact that I have a text conversation with her where she says this was a mistake and she’ll be sending an addendum for this?","Landlord made a mistake on our lease, says to sign anyhow and they’ll send an addendum.",18nw1mc,1703189396.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nw1mc/landlord_made_a_mistake_on_our_lease_says_to_sign/,
"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Background:

Spouse hasn't worked in 5+ years, gambling and drug addiction. Filed for a self-ban from casino in the past, that has since expired. Married 15 years. Single joint account where only my wage is being deposited. I pay all the expenses (rent, bills, childcare). I don't have access to 2 of his personal credit cards, that are being billed from the joint account.

I would like to take steps to 1. Secure the joint funds and prevent them from spending 2. Prepare evidence that can help my case during divorce, if this is how it plays out.

Current plan:

1. Move most of the joint funds to a personal account. Leave a certain amount in the joint account, for a financial cushion for him to support the transition, if he decides to move out. All regular expenses will be continued to be paid by me from the new personal account.
2. Put most of the transfered funds in a Savings account, and only use the amount necessary for day-to-day operation. Keep receipts for everything. Not make any big purchases.
3. Ask him to find a job and move out. If he agrees to play along, support any child-related or living-related expenses incurring (reimburse based on receipts)
4. I understand that he can file for separation and divorce and eventually funds will be split, but I want to protect myself in the process

Questions:

1. How much funds should I leave in the joint account to be ""reasonable"" or to not look bad in court if/when the time comes?
2. What evidence should I gather on his activities, before the big change is live, to support any future legal proceedings, to help my case? For example, can I request documentation for his self-ban from casino from the state, and will that help my case? How can I prove his drug use?
3. Any other steps that I can take to better prepare for the escalation that's coming from his side, surely?

"My family had a house fire in 2018. Our insurance company was screwing us over and doing a poor job at handling the situation. We ended up hiring another contracting company to handle the house. This contracting company ended up being scam artists. They gutted our home and placed all our things in storage. They asked the insurance company for an exuberant amount of money. They didn't do any work in the house besides removing all of our stuff and some smoke and dry cleaning. The insurance company refused to pay what they were asking. My dad had signed a contract stating that whatever the insurance company refused to pay we would have to pay it. We refused to pay them for work they didnt do, and the amount they were asking for was extremely high. They ended up suing S and putting a lien on our belongings they kept in storage. This process has taken so long that our belongings were held hostage for 5 years. The contractors had offered to settle with us for $50000. We couldn't get our checks from the insurance company reissued in time so we had to go to trial. My parents lost the case and the verdict was that we owe the contractors $167,000 (most of which comes from storage fees). We are devastated and worried they'll put a lien on our home.

"This is my first time ever posting about this, and even though my case is closed, I never really speak about it to anyone because what I experienced sounds crazy and as if I made it up, but I wanted to know from a lawyers perspective or anyone with experience with criminal law if my case was bullshitted by my state’s judicial system. I’m 22(F), I’m of mixed race but I would mostly identify as black.

About almost 2 years ago, I became acquainted with this girl. She was homeless and sleeping in her car, she was alone and having trouble with her relationship, and her family turned away from her. I felt pity for her and in a way, I empathized with her because I knew what she was going through so I took it upon myself to help her. I spent over $1000 paying for a hotel for her to have a place to stay, I fed her, I comforted her, I made sure that she had everything she needed included giving her one of my cellphones that I owned so she would have people to call, and put her on my cell phone service until she was able to get a job.

I don’t want to make this post too long with irrelevant details, but long story short, I found out why she was in a horrible situation. She completely alienated everyone around her making it seem like they were bad people when in reality, it was her. She manipulated me a lot and lied to me. She had deep psychological issues.

After we weren’t on good terms shortly after, she refused to give back my cell phone. I didn’t have her location or anything, and I couldn’t say that she stole it because I technically gave it to her willingly. So all I could do was report the phone as stolen to my service provider and have it blacklisted to where she can’t receive service on it even if she tried to go to another service provider.

A couple of days later, I get off of work. I’m at a drive-thru ATM depositing my money, and all I hear is a car slam on breaks, and suddenly a man who I didn’t recognize came out from behind the ATM with a gun to my face. I completely froze. I thought that I was being robbed but the man said nothing to me. He tried to pull the trigger but the gun jammed and he kept slamming his gun against the ATM to unjam it. I quickly pulled off and he signaled to someone who was in the car, ran to the car, and they started chasing after me while shooting at my car aiming at me. I was on the phone with the operator trying to stay in the same area so the police could find me and the car eventually decided to stop chasing me. 

Police arrived and examined everything, and then they came to the conclusion that this wasn’t a robbery and that I was being targeted and asked who did I piss off. I told them no one until I thought really hard and thought about the girl. I gave them her name.

She ended up turning herself in when she found out the police were looking for her.

The police were able to track the man down to his work place and they asked him if he could consent to search his vehicle, the man agreed and police found multiple bullets that matched the bullets that damaged my car, bullet proof vests, and guns. He was arrested.

The man confessed to everything. He said that it was the girl’s idea, he didn’t know me, that they’ve been watching my social media and etc., and that they waited until I got off of work and followed me, that he felt intimidated by her so he felt pressured to do what he did and that I was a threat that needed to be taken out.

The girl did not confess to anything and asked to speak to a lawyer. She had a retained one.

They were both charged with x2 aggravated assault, x2 parties to a crime, criminal attempt for malice and felony murder. 6 charges
altogether.

They were both sent to jail and they were denied bond multiple times.

About 2 months go, I received a call with an update for my case. 

They told me that they both got 20 years and that they took a plea deal.

Instead of 6 charges, the man was just charged with x2 aggravated assault and the girl was only charged with 1 aggravated assault charge. I also saw that there were multiple ADA’s and lawyers that were taken/withdrew from the case.

The man has 20 years, 10 years to serve.

The girl has 20 years, 2 years to serve.

They are in prison now since their case has came to a close.

They told me that the time that she has been in jail has credited towards her served time and that she will be released in a couple of months with 18 years probation. It sent me into an absolute panic because this girl is crazy. 

I told them this made no sense and that it was unfair. I provided the police with multiple screenshots of her harassing me and threatening me. There was already a police report filed in the past but they told me that they couldn’t do anything because she technically hasn’t done anything to me yet. Police found records of her and the man communicating. She was stalking me and my friends social media accounts. She was the one who came up with the whole plan to unalive me.

 they told me that since she was only driving the car and that the man was the one who did the shooting, she would get more leniency and that she only admitted to driving the car.

It should be noted that she already had a domestic violence charge active on a pending case and had to go to court for it and in order to avoid jail, she agreed to go to anger management classes and that she won’t get a felony or be in possession of a weapon and she broke her agreement. I asked them what happened to the record of her other case, and they said there was no record of her having that even though I legit saw it on the court website and they kept trying to make the point to me that she has “18 years of probation” and that if she did anything, she will have to serve the rest of her years in prison.

I had a friend who was on probation and he got away with a lot of stuff so I know probation doesn’t even mean shit like that especially when you will have access to social media again.

She was also requesting to video chat me a couple of times while she was in jail awaiting a close to the case.

I have no idea what to do, they are trying to say that my case was fair but I feel like it wasn’t and that she got off too easy. I don’t know what to do. I know that she doesn’t have a place of her own either so she’ll probably have to live with her parents but the gag of it is that her parents live down the street from me… they live in a suburban neighborhood but where I live is in a secluded area so its very easy to get away with harming someone with no witnesses.

"I am in Texas.  I am in a rented apartment.

A few months ago the door on my oven split in half.  The outer panel came unscrewed from the inner panel, and it caused the 400 degree inner panel to slam shut into my arm.  I ended up with a sizable second degree burn on my arm.

I put in a ticket with management to get my oven repaired.  The came out and 'fixed' it by replacing the screws and screwing the inner and outer panels back together.  Evidently the receptacle that the screws were screwed into was stripped, and it wasn't really fixed in any meaningful way.

"MOPAR Ecodiesel - New Engine, Dealer Installed - 3 yr/100,000 miles warranty

When should the warranty begin for something like a new engine that is ordered and installed by a dealer?  Does it begin at the time the dealer orders the engine?  Or does it begin at the time the customer is notified that the work is complete, vehicle is ready for pick up?

One date make it advantageous to the dealer/manufacturer, another date makes it advantageous to the consumer.

\-----------------

If you are curious about the details, continue reading:

Brief Overview:  
October 2020 - Engine seized, vehicle under extended warranty - this is a known problem with these engines

Warranty approves repair, dealer orders new engine

November 25, 2020 - customer notified that the vehicle is ready for pick up; customer picks up vehicle same day

Between November 25, 2020 - July 2023 - vehicle continued to experience the exact same issues that is believed to be the cause of the original engine failing - over fueling, exhaust sensors failing, cause of failure - bearings failed.  During this time period, the vehicle had continuously been in for the fueling issue, but dealer couldn't duplicate when it happens, thus had no fix.

By July 2023, the new exhaust system (DEF and all) that was installed around the time of the new engine, had a sensor go bad.  Still issues with over fueling.  I am asked how this could happen, so I research and discovered details deep in the service manual that it is likely that the over fueling caused the sensor to fail.  But the over fueling was also most likely due to the injectors **NOT** being programmed into the ECM at the time the new engine was installed.  The ECM has no way of automatically calibrating the injectors.

This information was brought to the servicing dealers attention and the mechanic looked into it and found that the injectors were not programmed.  So 2.5 years of an engine running that was never calibrated correctly per manufacturer specifications.

The dealer ended up rectifying the situation by replacing the failing sensor and programmed the injectors into the ECM at no charge.

July - November 2023, the vehicle no longer experiences the over fueling issue.  By November 11th, traveling on the highway, the engine shut down.  No warning, no indications something was wrong and a catastrophic failure was about to happen.

Vehicle is towed to the nearest dealer (not associated with the original dealer that installed the engine).  By the beginning of December, dealer starts work on the vehicle, by mid-December the dealer determined the engine was seized due to bearing failure.  Bearing failure was also the cause of the previous engine seizing.

"Got crashed into by an aggressive couple

Got in an accident last night

On mobile, sorry for formatting and length.


Gonna start this off by saying I thought my car insurance was coming out of my account with autopay but I guess I didn’t select that option and never received a call or email from my insurance (Obviously that’s my fault not trying to place blame or something just want everyone to know I’m not the type to knowingly drive with no insurance). So anyways this is a 4 way intersection with 4 lanes each way separated into two lanes. The left lane you can take a sharp left or slight left, and the right lane you can take a slight left or go straight. I was in the right lane before I got to the intersection, and my turn arrow was still green as I was approaching the crosswalk. I merged into the right lane since it was clear, and as soon as the two front tires were past the crosswalk and into the intersection, the light turned yellow and then to red as I was about 1/2 the way through my turn. When I was 3/4 of the way through my turn the guy in the oncoming lane had a green light and just went straight like he wasn’t paying attention, I tried to turn further left and slammed on the breaks to create a glancing blow but it seemed like he never pressed his brakes and hit the right front light/bumper. He gets out of his car immediately screaming at me about how it’s his girls new car and how we crashed into him and the witness behind him was like “I saw he had a green light” which I don’t doubt because when I recreated what happened by driving through the intersection this morning I was able to look back at the same time I slammed on the breaks and saw that the light had already changed to green while I was completing my turn. Anyways, I live in a big city so they police took forever to come and during that time waiting, his girlfriend and two of her friends showed up, started screaming at the witness saying “WHO HIT MY CAR” and her boyfriend had to tell her it was me who did it, and knowing it’s best not to say anything until police arrive especially because it seemed like he may have been recording me at one point while he was yelling. When she saw me get into my car to lock myself in, she grabbed the door so I couldn’t close it (she was heavy set and bigger than me) and was screaming at me still about the car and yelled “are you trying to get your ass beat?” her boyfriend had to pull her away from the car. The witness saw all the threats and aggression but I don’t know if any of that matters. His car was newer and had insurance so I’m hoping he has the black box thing that shows what he did leading up to the crash. I didn’t receive a ticket at the scene and the police didn’t say anything after taking my statement. I’m contacting a lawyer I’ve used in a previous accident, but I’m just looking for other people’s perspective on this and if I could be found at fault. It wasn’t a very serious accident, my car is still driveable just needs a new hood and right headlight. His car wouldn’t start to my knowledge, and he wasn’t injured.

"Hi all, I (21F) have been working at a restaurant as a bartender for about 5 months now. At about 2 months in, I was realizing that my paychecks were all coming out to even/rounded numbers, and I just felt like my checks were small considering how much I was working and how much I was getting tipped. I asked my manager about this, and we learned that the tip pool was off on the system that the bartenders use in my restaurant. So basically, I was only getting my tip-out, the small percentage of tips that I was getting out of the server’s tips for the night (i.e., if a server has a large table that orders a lot of drinks, I would get a percentage of their tips since I made the drinks). I was not getting any of the card tips that were left for me when someone sat down and ordered at the bar. This is where a majority of my money should’ve been coming from. 
They have since turned the tip pool back on, so I am now receiving all of my tips. But when we initially realized what happened, I was told to expect it to take about a month to be back paid for all of my lost tips. Well, this happened in late September, and I still have not received any of the money. I have asked my manager multiple times about what the status is, and I have never been given a straight answer — they keep telling me that the “company is very overwhelmed by the whole situation” and “they are unsure of when I should expect my payment”. 
There is a good amount of money that I missed out on. I just want to know what I can do to be sure that I get my tips before I leave this god awful job. Thanks in advance

"Background: I work at a nonprofit Medical Research company attached to a military hospital. I'm a non-compensated government employee for access permissions but my pay comes from the nonprofit.

The confusion: For the past year, there has been confusion surrounding the topic of lunch breaks. The employee handbook we use says that employees are ""entitled"" to a 30 minute lunch per 8 hours worked. This to me implies that the lunch is optional. I do not eat much through the day and can fit my food into one of my 15 minute breaks easily. This has been the standard practice for my coworkers for the years that they have worked for the nonprofit.

This past year, we've been told that the 30 minute lunch is in fact NOT optional and that we are required by Missouri law to clock out for the 30 minutes. It was my understanding that Missouri law required that the employer make a lunch AVAILABLE as an option to the employer.

My team has continued to not take lunches and instead work the 8 straight hours each day and plan on continuing to do so until the issue is clarified.

Does anyone know the nuances of these laws? Specific cited examples or precendents would be greatly appreciated.

Small edit for clarification:
The root of this question is not about a meal break being offered, but if I can refuse to take one without getting myself or my company in trouble.
From the company's perspective, I understand their fear of being audited and seeing no one get meal breaks and I don't want them dinged for that.

We went to the dealership on Saturday and signed the contract to buy a used Sienna and trade in our Pilot. You have to wait until the next business day to receive Massachusetts plates, we have lived here before so no surprise there.

On Monday morning, they told us to have the Sienna insured and replaced by the Pilot. We completed that but they said they didnt get verification from insurance company, so pick up Tuesday. Annoying, but ok.

Tuesday comes and they advised they are having problems receiving plates since the Pilot is reigstered in Florida. They are tyring to get it resolved.

Wednesday asked for an update,  they had, no update to give us and we advised them we are leaving the state on Thursday so it has to be resolved by then because we are gone for Holiday for two weeks.

"I don’t know if I should be posting this, honestly. I need the legal help but this just happened. I’m sorry if this is disjoined as well, I’m no story teller.

We own two horses, both beautiful boys. We rent the right to use a neighbors property to store them and they love it, it’s a wonderful amount of room for them. We’ve had our issues, mainly with them trying to press the fence to reach grass on the other side but that’s not the main issue.

Several years ago, someone decided he needed a road through our property (the people we rent from as well as our personal property) with assurances that “we would barely know they were there. Since then, the property above us has expanded drastically and there are about ten or so people past us. 


This slightly bisected Neighbors land. I think it’s called an easement because the road goes fully through Neighbors property as well as our own. 

There are two gates they have to open and close to keep the horses and Neighbors cows from entering their property or running onto the highway. 

They have repetitively left the gate opened. No, not the safer one where our livestock would be safe on their property- the one to the highway. Because of this, one of our horses has run off several times and could have been killed, injured, or hurt someone. They absolutely refuse to open three gates to get to their property and (though I loath to use this word) are too lazy to put down one of the many cattle guards they have already purchased and have all the resources to place. 

They’ve gone to talk to Neighbor about adding fence across the part of the easement where livestock can reach the fence but I think it’s more likely they are slandering us and blaming us for being bad horse owners or that we’re being unreasonably angry about them letting our horses out. 

I don’t know what to do here. They keep recklessly releasing our horses and it could get us sued. Do we have any legal way to cover this? Whether it be adding our own fence against their wishes or anything else?",Neighbors keep letting our horses out,18nuab9,1703184897.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nuab9/neighbors_keep_letting_our_horses_out/,
"I'm looking for help on finding options in the Dallas area for a complicated situation my family is experiencing. There's several things going on, so I'll provide some background, then the specific areas I'm looking to find resources for.

Background:My grandmother(Gran) is very old(87) and declining in health. Gran is the sole provider and caretaker of my severely autistic half-brother(Bro, 21, somewhat verbal, can do basic things, cannot work, can be violent, often has stomach issues). My mother(MD) also lives with Gran and Bro, but their relationship is extremely tense, and MD does not support them in any way and has suspected drug and alcohol abuse. MD is the only one who can drive, but frequently gets into wrecks. These haven't been ruled as due to alcohol or drugs, so it's likely from mental illness. Gran is lucid, but is in denial and does not believe in mental illness, so she will not seek help on her own.

It's a bad situation all around and they are all very depressed. The situation is slowly escalating to a worse state. I do reach out once a month to talk with Gran and check in, order groceries, and contact aunts(2-both well off and mostly checked out) to help. However, from past trauma, I do keep my distance and am not willing to get more directly involved. I'm a total trash person, as I'm not willing to become a caretaker or send large amounts of money. I do want to do what I can, but am not willing to provide direct support or take on responsibility. Ultimately the core issue is MD being volatile and stabilizing care for Bro after Gran passes.

Other details:

\- MD has untreated bi-polar disorder or schizophrenia and cannot work. She is also a hoarder and is slowly destroying the house, which is in disrepair. MD has been arrested for threatening to kill Gran, but Gran dropped charge and MD says it was a misunderstanding.

\- They are all isolated and do not have much contact with the outside world.

\- Gran does not ask for help and cannot use the internet. She is pathologically passive and tries to do everything (like hard manual labor) herself. She is the ultimate pushover and will not take a stand or take any proactive measures to help herself. She does really love Bro and wants him to be supported.

\- Bro cannot complete administrative tasks, but can verbally communicate. He cannot live alone, however.

\- MD cannot be reasoned with, but mostly keeps to herself, except for when episodes occur and she becomes extremely paranoid.

\- None of us have any money for in-patient treatment or elder care. I cannot bankroll anything and I live 5+ hrs away. I have 2 aunts who should be doing something, as they're both well-off, but they are seemingly unwilling to become more involved as well and provide minimal support at present.

\- Gran has a will where her assets will be split between her 3 daughters (MD included), and she will leave her house to Bro. Bro will have no income, and if he sells the house, he must split the proceeds with an extreme number of cousins. I've explained that this is not going to work out, and I recommended she should leave everything to Bro(I asked not to be included in will, and anything for me should go to trust for Bro.)

note: I do not live with my family and am LC with Gran, NC with MD for my own sanity, so moving in with them is not an option for me. I am not willing to become a direct caretaker or have power of attorney or anything like that. I have decided this after years of agony. I've informed them that I will not be a caretaker for MD or Bro after Gran passes, and to not rely on me financially (I don't make enough to support myself, much less them).

I'd like to find a way to help sign them up to get access to programs or resources that could help them help themselves.

So, I'm looking for what resources I can find for the following:

1. Government assistance options for mother, brother, and grandmother. None can find this information on their own and likely cannot complete the application process on their own.
2. How to get my mother into treatment (she will not do this on her own and it will need to be involuntary)
3. get support for my grandmother(she has a doctor come out to check on her every few weeks, has funds from previous assets, owns house, gets SS check, but so lifelines otherwise)
4. Ways to sign my brother up for group living or support for when my grandmother is no longer able to care for him.
5. Not looking for donations or anything like that, just trying to find the programs and resources that exist and might be able to help this situation.

Please let me know if there's a better subreddit for this. I've looked around and this seems like the most relevant space for what I'm looking for. I appreciate any insight, resource, advice, as I feel very helpless and obviously have a lot of guilt for not providing direct support.

"Sorry for long post ahead of time. Don't know where else to turn... Father passed away earlier this year, didn't find out until a month later because we were estranged because he was an abusive piece of shit. Unfortunately, his will was not done correctly and the Executor named was unable to fulfill duties in the state where he lived. A distant friend of his hired a lawyer before my brother and I were even notified and we only found out after filing a missing person report and dragging the information out of this lady's asshole lawyer. We had to hire our own lawyer to file a petition to become Executors as my brother and I are his only family and thought that's what we had to do. The lady withdrew from the case almost immediately and we dealt with months of work settling his financial mess, getting him cremated, paying all his late bills and mortgage, cleaning and clearing his house to sell... A monumental amount of work. That lady friend did nothing but apparently cause problems. Fast forward to the day before everyone usually leaves for Christmas vacation (today) I get an email from out lawyer stating the other attorney wants $12,000! He lists a ton of bullshit charges that logically and mathematically do not make sense BUT in the attached information includes an email from his office to the office of my attorney trying to settle these fees without filing with the court. That was sent to her once on November 13th and again on the 20th. She responded to neither and I had no idea it even happened. She's just now letting us know that they filed their charges with the court and will be charging us if she has to fight his obscene overcharge. I am already burnt out from this entire process of setting things for my dad and now this? I'm seriously ready to eat a bullet. It's not like there's a ton of money out of this situation either so why the fuck are they trying to drain EVERYTHING when we did literally ALL the work? What should I do? Do I fight this bastard lawyer's charges or let it go and pay out the ass when I've already accepted countless other fucked up injustices throughout this entire cluster fuck? Might end up with less money than the lawyers are getting paid! My dad was a piece of shit and this lawyer dude is making it out like his kids abandoned him. It was actually the other way around and it's infuriating to see otherwise. This entire situation from the very beginning has been nothing but stress and fighting to get anything done. Doing ALL the work, hoping it's finally over only to get hit with this shit. I'm not lying when I say I'm ready to end it. This is the most fucked up, greed ridden situation I've ever been thrust into. I never would have gotten involved if I knew I'd just be fucked in the end. My lawyer sucks and so does this other one. She sends me this email right before Christmas letting me know that all the charges this other lady who wasn't even involved accrued, the estate has to pay for. But she knew about this back in November and didn't say shit. And doesn't get back to me! She sucks at communicating with clients and other lawyers apparently. So how do I come out of this?

"Long story short, halfway through my lease my landlord decided to change the requirements for my renters insurance, and had the nerve to start charging me a forced insurance fee for not being in compliance with their new requirements. According to the actual wording in my lease, no one can change the lease unless everyone agrees to it, so strike one for them?

The initial fee came because my insurance expiration date was coming up, but it was over a month away. The renewal documents weren't even available yet, and they didn't give me a date to have the renewal submitted by. So I thought as long as I have it done before they expiration date, then it's all good.

After submitting the proof of renewal, they said that my insurance is not in compliance with what that require, but they didn't tell me what was wrong. According to my lease, everything was covered. They continued to charge me the fee.

They said that a specific address for the landlord had to be on the policy (not stated in my lease) and that my wife and son needed to be specifically named on my policy (also not stated in my lease), even though my insurance contract included all relatives that lived with me.

Here we are, five months after all of this started, with $80 in fees being charged to my account (that I have refused to pay) and they still have not removed the fees, even though I have made all of the changes they required, and I have asked them to multiple times.

"My roommate decided less than 2 months after signing our 2024-25 lease that he wanted to break his lease so he can move elsewhere and get a dog. He wants to break both our current lease and the 2024-25 one. This is uncharted territory for me.

He's talked to management and they're letting him out without penalty if he finds a replacement. The only place he's found won't let him be on two leases at once, and will check with our management to verify he's off. He hasn't found anyone who is remotely suitable so far.

One of my concerns is that he's changed his mind several times now on how important the dog is to him. He signed the lease with no pets and I was clear about the situation. He asked management a month later, they said no. He told me he'd decided to wait to get a dog for a couple years and even re-signed the lease. Then, in November, the above news. So, my concern would be that he might change his mind again after a new lease is signed with someone else and cause a new headache. I'm wondering how I could approach that. Is a roommate agreement with one roommate leaving early a thing? Would I want to get a notary or just a witness (maybe 2 witnesses, with each of us picking one)? I just feel like legal documents don't mean anything to him and want to protect myself. Leaving before the lease was up is not something we'd discussed previously.

We are jointly and severally liable. The new person would be jointly and severally liable, too, so obviously, I'm not going to sign with any rando the current roommate comes across just to let him off the lease. (Sublets are prohibited by our lease.)

My understanding is that the leases remain in effect unless we *both* decide to break them (or I sign with someone else), and I am not interested in moving. Do I have that correct? 

Speaking of which...can I offer to let him buy me out? Is that a thing? I'd probably present this as a compromise, I'll take over responsibility for finding a roommate for 2024-25, and let you off both leases (finishing up the current 2023-24 lease by myself, if management lets me), but you have to pay me the amount of rent per month you're leaving early. Is that something people can do when they're joint tenants and one wants to leave early?

I plan to consult with the campus tenant resources (am a grad student), but I don't know what's open over break. He thinks he will be able to move to a new place March or April 1, which to me is unrealistic at this point.

I was told I could pass naturally or have a D&amp;C to do tests on my baby girl and then be able to keep her ashes. My 3 other miscarriages happened so early, I was happy to have this opportunity to finally get answers. 

Procedure was beginning of November. Had a follow up 2 weeks later but the results from the chromosome and other tests weren’t back yet. My doctor even said “usually when it takes this long, that means they found something so we might have answers”

I immediately called my doctors office and asked for an explanation, they told me the person who was responsible for labeling and processing didn’t do their job. Not only do I not get answers that are life changing for me, how do I even know I have my babies ashes if it was never labeled?

"tl;dr I run a small business inside a mall. The mall manager says if I open on 12/25 or 1/1, she'll call the cops because the mall is closed to the public. My lease doesn't have any clause saying I can't be open and/or operate my business on any particular day during the year. Does she have any legal standing to call the police or even police when I can or can't be open based on their facility being open or closed?

Full Background:

My location is located literally just inside the east entrance (about maybe 6' from the interior entrance door). I emailed the mall manager this:""Hi Hannah,I just wanted to let you know that I will be open on 12/24 and possibly 12/25 from 9 -10:30am. I'll likely enter between 8 and 8:30am and leave by 11ish. I will not unlock the east entrance doors but instead instruct my members to come to that door and signal us to allow them entry. They will be then guided to the nearest entrance to our establishment. Only me or another designated person will allow another entry in this way. This way we only have our members and those we are familiar with entering the building and can control who is present.Currently I do plan to completely close for 12/31 and 1/1. I may come and do some cleaning and other normal stuff but if anything changes with this plan, I'll notify you first.I hope this will suffice for keeping the security risk to a minimum so you and other LSM members can enjoy their holiday without the obligation to be at LSM.Happy and warm holidays!""

I sent this notice because we were open over Thanksgiving and they (the mall management) took issue with it then.My business is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school (a martial arts school), and it is quite common in our field to be open on these days for a few hours; people are typically off work and home and available to come to a class or open mat. The mall manager has informed me that the mall itself will be closed to the public on 12/25 and 1/1 by sending this response to my email: ""I appreciate the notice but it’s not up for debate that we will be closed on the 25th and the 1st. This still poses several security concerns for the mall in other aspects as I’ve previously mentioned. I will not be coming in on Monday, I will just call the authorities.""

Nothing in my lease says I can only be open or operate my business on particular days. Does the Mall Manager have any legal founding for this?

\------------------EDIT----------------  
Just after initially posting this, I received this email:  
""If you insist, I will have you sign a waiver that you are responsible for the security of the mall if you choose to be open.  
Let me know what you decide.

"I (31F) have a severely disabled brother (28M) who has the capabilities of a toddler and needs 24/7 care. When I was in my early 20s my parents had me sign papers so I would be his guardian if anything happened to them. I did not think much of signing the papers - the event of them passing away seemed so far in the future. And signing the papers was not presented to me as a choice anyway, it was just something that needed to happen. It sounds stupid now that I did not ask more questions and blindly agreed to take care of a child for the rest of my life, but that is beside the point, I already signed the papers.

My question is: what did I agree to?

Now, a decade later, my parents are in poor health and could realistically pass in the next 5-10 years or sooner, who can know. I have lived on the opposite side of the country ever since college, leading a non-traditional lifestyle of seasonal work, frequent travel and pretty low income. (Yay for the field of environmental conservation!) I am not equipped practically, financially, mentally or emotionally to take care of another person, let alone one with special needs. Maybe I should be more responsible than I am at my age, but this is how I am and I don't see a problem with it. I lead a happy, healthy, independent life, I have enough money to survive, and I have a meaningful career. My parents always encouraged me to live the free and fulfilling life that I have, given that my childhood was difficult with my sibling's situation.

Yes, my parents plan to make living arrangements for him (tho it has not happened yet) and his financial situation will apparently sustain him for the rest of his life. But I know that my parents *want* me to move him to a home in whatever state I am living in (and move him again and again every time I move), visit him weekly or more, take him to the doctor, etc. I don't see how this would be possible unless I drastically change my lifestyle and give up everything that I have worked for and enjoy doing. What are my legal responsibilities as a guardian? Of course I will make sure he is in a good home that provides the level of care he needs, I DO love my brother, but I can't imagine being more involved than that without it wearing me into the grave.

I have tried talking to my parents about this, but they are so outraged at the thought that I wouldn't give up my life for my brother that I literally fear they will have a heart attack if I try bringing up the topic again.

Edit: Comments so far have made me realize I don't actually know what I signed, I was under the impression it was papers for guardianship, but sounds like it's not that simple. I am sure I can ask my parents for a copy of the document without causing problems and I will do that soon.",I signed guardianship papers for my disabled brother without knowing what I was agreeing to,18nstex,1703181076.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nstex/i_signed_guardianship_papers_for_my_disabled/,
"I’ve lived in a rental property for years, and for most of this time everytime it rains, part of the basement gets standing water. There have been half assed attempts at solving the problem and eventually they just bought us a dehumidifier that we run around the clock. There is one corner of the basement that still never gets dry. They’ve known about it for years and I have emails proving that.

First of all, yes I should have moved out of this house years ago, but they never raised the rent in all this time and it’s in a great part of town with a big yard so I’ve just kind of accepted this annoying issue. 

I had a daughter two years ago and she’s developed asthma-like issues and we found out she’s has a mold allergy, so now I feel like a shit mom for raising her in a place that has mold. It has been so stressful. I was never bothered by it or had any health issues so I didn’t think much of it. Anyway, I pushed and they are FINALLY fixing the water issue and then will hire mold remediation company to deal with the issues, but part of me feels like they’re only doing it now bc they are afraid we might sue them. 

I have email receipts from 2016, 2018, and beyond of notifying them about the water damage and them saying they were going to fix it by installing a sump pump, which hasn’t happened (until literally right now)

This letter is written to advise you of a conflict that may arise during the pendency of the court actions of which the two of you are involved in (Redacted) County Courts.

Specifically, (My Ex) is now charged in a criminal felony case wherein (My Name) is the alleged victim alleging theft of property from her home and violation of a protective order. (My Name) is seeking representation in relation to a family court case involving her minor child, school attendance of that child, and her failure to appear before that court.

My understanding is that you wish for me to represent you both in each of these actions described above. In doing so, I must advise you of the possible conflict, and obtain your waiver and consent to represent you both in this litigation.

An attorney has a duty of loyalty that is paramount to representing each client. When I undertake to represent two persons, there could come a time when a conflict arises such that giving advice to one of you may conflict with the interest of the other. While these two cases do not directly involve the each of you, nonetheless, possibilities for conflict exist as I may learn things during each of your representation that could be used against the other during the course of these matters. For instance, if (My Name) confides things to me in the course of her family court case that would injure her character, or her credibility, I could then use that in the defense of (My Ex) wherein she is the alleged victim. This is just one instancewherein a conflict could exist, there could be other instances as well wherein my duty of loyalty could be compromised.

In order for me to represent the two of you in this action, I need you to acknowledge that you understand the nature of the conflict, and that you waive any objection to said conflict, and that you consent to me representing the both of you under the facts as set out herein.

I understand that the two of you are aligned in your position at this moment, and do not expect that to change, and that you do not expect to actually be adverse in these cases. However, ethically, I am obligated to disclose this information and obtain your consent.

Should you desire to discuss this further, or to obtain additional advice, or to obtain separate counsel, please inform me. Otherwise, please review the waiver herewith below, and consent to my representation of the two of you.

I look forward to assisting your further in these matters should you desire.


We, (My Ex), and (My Name), both parties to court actions in (Redacted) County Courts have read the foregoing letter advising of the conflict. We understand and acknowledge that we understand the nature of possible conflict in these actions, and after consideration of the nature of the conflict, persist in our desire to have The Law Office of (Attorney Name) represent both of our interests in these actions. We both, after consideration waive any conflict in the representation of our interests in these matters, and consent to (Attorney) representing both of our interests in these matters despite the possibility of said conflict. We have taken all of the necessary time to consider this waiver and consent of the conflict, and have taken all of the time we need to ascertain any information required to consider this waiver and conflict, and state that we have been fully advised and have no further questions, or desire no further advice as it relates to this conflict.

I went to the apartment with my mother,sister, and freind to help me move my stuff out of the apartment, only to be greeted with my stuff placed outside in trash bags and my wife refusing to open the door. 

My freind decided to call the police behind my back by claiming to be myself whose name is on the lease and say that I needed a unit to come to help me enter the apartment.

"hey everyone. i guess i'm just posting for advice or anyone's opinion on what happened recently. a couple months ago, my neighbor starting for some ac company and he has a work van that he brings to his house and parks in the street. only the van is parking facing the wrong way (so it's technically illegally parked) and the van is always parked in front of my driveway. it isn't fully blocking the driveway and my dad and I can still leave our house; it's just incredibly hard and we both have almost hit it on multiple occasions. yesterday when i was leaving my driveway, i hit my gas petal a little to hard and ran into the van. i immediately drove forward and called my dad to tell him what happened. then i parked back in my driveway and got out of my car. someone told my neighbor what happened so he was out there. i go over and apologize and he says it's no big deal and asks if i'm ok and i say yes. because it's a company van, he called his boss and then tells me that police will be here soon to file a report. i look at my car and his van and the damage is not bad at all. my car has a broken taillight and a big dent; on his van, there was some gray pannelling around the botten that fell off. i was facetiming my dad at this point and he was on his way home from work. the police came about 20 minutes later, one officer talking to both of us and getting out information and ask us our role in what happened. they went into their car to make the report for about 10 minutes. one officer brings my information back, gets my email and phone number, and tell me the report will be sent out within 10 days. i ask if he needs to talk to my dad about the insurance or the car for anything and he says no. then i tell him my dad will be here in a minute or two and if it's ok if he asks some questions. the officer says it's fine and then goes to talk to the other guy. my dad gets here and goes up to the officer. he introduces himself and then says ""honestly i knew this was going to happen eventually just because the van is always blocking my driveway. i'm just wondering if the location of the van and where it's parked will matter at all, because it is technically blocking my driveway"". the officer says ""well it's not a narrow road so there's plently of room"". my dad says ""i know theres room, but it's still difficult and sometimes impossible to get out without running over the curb or grass. imagine trying to get my truck out. not to mention the van is blocking my son's basketball hoop and is preventing him and his friends from really using it"". the officer says ""i get that it's hard but her car is smaller that the truck. if it was the truck, it would be different but it was a smaller car so it doesn't matter"". my dad then asks ""does it matter that the van is technically illegally parked because it's facing the wrong way. becuase last time i checked that side of the road doesn't drive that way"". the officer doesn't really have an answer and said ""it will all the in the report so if there's any questions you can contact us afterwards"". my dad then says ""ok that's fine. please don't think i'm trying to get out of anything; we hit the car, i'm not trying to deny it. i'm just asking the questions that i think should be asked based on experience from my job (my dad has some friends in the sheriffs department in the city next to us as he used to work with them a lot as a mechanic at a shop that delt with a lot of cars from accidents). they finish talking and he comes back over to me to check in my lights are working and what he'll have to do to fix my car. my dad goes back over to talk to my neighbor and the officer tells him that i'm not getting a ticket, just the insurance will be charged as a non moving incident. my dad comes back to me and tell me that. when i asked my dad is the insurance will go up, he laughed and said no because he paid in full at the beginning of the year. he's calling the insurance to let them know; he also said he's asking his friends from the sheriffs their opinion on it. i completely understand i am in the wrong and i should have been more careful. i just want to know other's opinion on what happened. like should i have gotten a ticket or was my neighbor in the wrong at all. just opinions or comments would be hellful because i'm still shaken up a tad.",should i have gotten a ticket,18nrk92,1703177817.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nrk92/should_i_have_gotten_a_ticket/,
"I was just at a Walmart today. I frequently shop there about once a week or at least once every other week. Well when shopping someone with a visible disability comes running up to me asking if I have a problem with them shopping in the store? I said no I do not? They were pretty agitated and came running up like something I never seen before. I walked out of the aisle and they kept following me so I started walking for the exit. Which then the person proceeds to tell an employee that is the person right there right over there... 

I was not sure what was happening and was pretty upset in the moment so I just walked out the store real fast and left to go back home. I guess my only thought is the person mistaken thought I was someone that maybe gave them hard time or laughed at them? 

My only concern now is that I left is there anything I should worry about? I should have stayed but I was so upset I just left.

"I recently purchased a bmw from F&amp;A car sales a local dealership. I put a total of 3000$ down payment because that’s what they said the bank requested. I signed the agreements and finalized the loan through a local bank. A few days later the car just up and died on me on the freeway I was like wth is going on turns out it was a bad fuel pump. That was a red flag because the dealership told me the car was serviced and checked. I took it to bmw got the part fixed. 
Fast forward to September I’m talking to the bank about the car financed they want to know miles insurance ect ect they get all of that. End of September the dealership calls me and says I need to bring my payment to them.. I was wondering why the bank didn’t call me but the dealership did. No questions asked I went there to make the payment. 
               During the month of October I ran into an emergency and was away for a while I come back to find out that my car was towed. Im like wth I check my phone because I have an Apple AirTag inside the vehicle so I can find out where it is. ( located at the dealership). I was confused as to why it was there I only missed one payment and they just took the car? Why did the dealership have it why not the bank who financed the car all these questions were running in my head. I went to the dealer to make my missed payment they said that it was repossessed and that the report guys had it. ( I knew the car was there because I can see it on my gps). They told me that I would have to finance it through a different bank to get it back I was like huh? Why can’t I just make up my missed payments and get it? Why hasn’t the bank notified me of the repossession and how to get it back. I left the dealer and called the bank they asked for my information and they looked it up. According to them the car wasn’t even financed and I wasn’t even in their system. That was a huge red flag because I had multiple conversations with the bank with the finalization of the loan. And on my contract it stated that specific bank financed it. I went to the dealership one night when it was closed to visit my car I checked in the glove box where I put the contract and it was Missing! I have no idea why they would take my copy of the contract but they did. At this point I have no clue as to how to either get my money back because I put 1/3 down payment on the car or just to get the car back in general.

"I have had a whole mess of an ongoing disability discrimination case for the last 2 years with my employer. I work for state government. I finally settled mostly the accommodation issues, without resolve for the laws broken or ongoing discrimination. I'm fine with that, can only fight so much before exhausting myself.

My current issue, two days before returning with agreed accommodations from a forcibly extra extended medical leave, I get a call asking about drug use saying I self reported a marijuana problem. Come to find out there was one sentence in my medical documentation for accommodation that mentioned previous medicinal marijuna use. (Secondary issue of hipaa violation of doctors submitting far more than consenting for proof of diagnosis/reason for accommodation). They searched back in documents submitted 3 months prior to now claim this. I was required to pass a drug test to return from leave now (further extending it), passed (only by 'online help'). Returned to my job to be subjected to 6 random drug tests per year for the next two years. First random test they gave I didn't have a clean system or the stuff on hand to pass. So I dropped dirty for weed. I'm now currently awaiting the results and what happens from here. Certain I'm either forced into a 30 day rehad on unpaid leave, that I pay for, or to resign if unwilling. 

I'd like to know if any of this was legal to begin with.

"Hi all,

I live in a condominium that is under an HOA with a property management company. I've read my agreement and it states that any exterior maintenance is the responsibility of the HOA.

The actual issue is that each condo has a balcony, or an exterior back deck depending on the unit. My particular unit's balcony was constructed over a decade ago with non-pressure treated wood. (I have no idea why. When I bought it it was already half rotted.) 

At this point the lumber is literally falling apart. Over the last year, I have documented entire spindles rotting and falling off into the front parking area in front of my condo. We're talking big chunks of wood with rusty nails falling down into the common area where my neighbors kid's play. Not to mention my partner and I do not feel comfortable stepping out onto the balcony itself in such a state.

I've had multiple communications with both my HOA president and the property management company explaining that this is a danger and asking for plans or written commitment to have them evaluated or repaired. All the responses have been non commital, saying they need time to evaluate. But it's been more than a year. The final straw for me has come as at the start of the month the HOA sent out an email saying they'll be raising our dues by a whopping 35%. I immediately replied asking if this meant they'd be allocating funds to repairing the decks and balconies and asking for a detailed ledger. To my dismay, they replied that they were not committing to that and needed more time to evaluate. I received a copy of the budget, and while a standard 10% is being sent to our reserve, there is no indication what we intend to use the reserve for.

At this point I believe it may be reasonable to argue legally that the HOA is being negligent in their duty to maintain the exterior of our homes (The balconys and decks are specifically referenced as included.) I have the emails dating back to last spring showing me bringing it to their attentions as well as pictures of the damage, falling rotted lumber/rusty nails. And of course, the dillapatated balcony itself.

What would be my best course of action? Part of me is tempted to just have my own deck repaired and then sue the HOA for the cost. But that seems like it may be the more difficult/risky path to take. But I also worry simply threatening legal action won't spur them to action as well. Is there perhaps an inspection agency I could contact to evaluate the structural safety to strengthen my case?

"TL;DR quit my job with a large company. It was a WFH gig. They mailed me a box and a label and I sent it back. Company has been mailing me letters stating they didn’t receive it and I don’t know what else to do. 

Ok buckle up y’all lol. So I quit my WFH job reallll quick. It was ruining my mental health so bad. I was doing collections for a large company if that says anything. 

Anyway, after I quit they sent me a box and a return label. On 12/5 my fiancé dropped it off to FedEx and they handled it from there. A couple days after that, I got a letter in the mail from the company that I need to send my equipment back. I figured it wasn’t enough time for them to receive it, scan it in etc so I disregarded it and moved on with my life. 

Fast forward to today. I get another letter in the mail saying they still haven’t received my equipment and I need to send it back and if they don’t hear from me within 5 days then they are referring this to their security team.

After that I was officially fed up with their games and I made a phone call to them. Was transferred about 3-4 times for what I thought would be a simple fix or misunderstanding. Silly me. 

I sat on the phone and wasted my time with these people for a hot minute. Before we ended the call, I emailed them pictures of the proof that it was sent. A picture of the FedEx receipt, proof of delivery via the tracking number and a copy of the letter they mailed to me. Then they say the asset team will contact me (couldn’t tell me when) and they will investigate this further. Oh, she also couldn’t tell me why they would bother contacting me since they have all the proof in front of them anyway. 

Bottom line - I don’t know what to do. This company has caused me so much stress and frustration. I am tired of communicating with them. IF they even do follow up with me again, what more can I even say? I gave them all of the info I have. Verbally and through pictures. I have nothing else. The equipment has left my hands as of 12/5, it was delivered and signed for so it’s the company’s problem at this point. I did what my responsibility was. Am I wrong?

If anyone has advice or any suggestions then please let me know. I’m just so stressed out and fed up with this company sitting here and trying to pull whatever they are trying to pull with me.

"Hello, it's my first time on Reddit, and I was hoping for some legal advice. I've been working at a company for about a year and a half, and since the time I've started, I've experienced numerous microaggressions: from customers, which I don't expect I can do anything about, but I have also faced several microaggressions from other staff. I've tried joining the DEI committee, creating and facilitating trainings to help grow awareness, and these problems persist. Additionally since the time I've started, I've also made at least three official complaints, all concerning the same people. While HR and my bosses have said that the actions and complaints have been addressed, these same people commit the same acts of discrimination against myself and one of the other people of colour who works here (there are 4 total in an organization of 32, and the turnover for people of colour is extremely high). 

All that is to say that the last straw came about two weeks ago when a White coworker (with less experience and who has been employed for a month or so) was picked for an opportunity I had been preparing for for months. I asked my boss why, as a Black woman, I have to work ten times as hard as my White counterparts for a fraction of the opportunities. He responded with, ""That's how the cards lay."" (Even though he holds the cards.) So I quit, and my boss has not spoken to me since. 

My question is this, all employees (who are not fired) receive an exit interview. Usually, HR will reach out to them, but they have been entirely silent. I reached out to my managers and HR to ask if an exit interview will be had, but I have received no word from HR. How should I take this?

Moreover, I also wanted a copy of the official complaints I have filed against other employees regarding racial discrimination. I was told that they count as investigative reports and are, therefore, confidential. Is this true? How should I proceed?

"Hello,

I am in Texas if that matter.

I have my fence being done by a contractor, he finished 80% of the fence, I paid him for those sections but cannot continue because the materials didn't come in yet, it took 2 weeks for them to arrive. While waiting, I had a family emergency in another states and have to leave for 4 days (This maybe important for later).

The materials arrive, and I contacted him to come to finish the rest of the fence and put on the door. I even took my time to put the door together before he comes, so the rest of the job will take less than a day to finish.

Issues arises when he keep saying he will come Tomorrow, but never showed up. His excuses so far are, he is moving into a new apartment, he had to wait for us to come home from our emergency trips so we have to wait for him, he has another contracting job out of town, he had a fight with his wife, and so on.

I received an email from Google support (Which Gmail sorted into my spam folder) saying that my Google Play balance would be escheated to the US government if I do not confirm my activity, and that the only ways to do this are to put more money on the account or spend some of the money currently on the account. 

I don't plan on doing either, as it's less than $0.50 on the account, but it seemed wrong to me that this could happen, so I got curious.

Firstly, can a company really, legally, escheat a balance to a country that the customer is not in, and has never interacted with the company in, theoretically leaving the customer with no way to reclaim the balance?

Secondly, most resources that I found online said that the company needs to make a reasonable effort to contact the customer before escheating the balance. Is this requirement backed up by the law, and does Google's requirement that I send them more money or spend my balance meet that standard? 

I don't know the laws affecting this situation, but it seems wrong to me that a company could consider an attempt to contact a customer that requires the customer to pay the company or remove a company's liabilities to be a reasonable attempt to contact the customer.","Google wants to escheat my Google Play balance to another country's government, and says the only way to avoid it is to give them money or spend my balance",18nqpzz,1703175546.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nqpzz/google_wants_to_escheat_my_google_play_balance_to/,

"I live in Michigan, USA and my son (7) was seen at a local urgent care for chest pain and possible pneumonia. Chest x-rays were taken and a nasal swab sent for testing. We were told the swab results would only take 24hrs. The x-rays were take a couple hours after the urgent care visit at another facility. The imaging facility said they would have the results sent to the urgent care in an hour because pneumonia is serious. I call the urgent care a couple hours after the images were taken because I still hadn’t heard anything. They said they had not received the results. By now the imagine center was closed so we had to wait till morning. I call the imaging center first thing in the morning asking for them to send the results to the dr, and they say they sent the results to the ordering physician an hour after the x-rays were taken. 

I called the urgent care back asking for the results of the X-rays that were sent yesterday. They tell me they’re too busy to check right now and they’ll call me back in an hour. I end up calling the imaging center back asking if they could give me the results directly. They guided me in creating an online patient portal where I could review the results. The results concluded pneumonia was in the upper right quadrant of my son’s lungs. So, I call the urgent care back, (because it was over an hour and they still hadn’t called me back) I told them the results of the x-ray, and asked for next steps. They said they would have a dr review the results and they would call me back. We waited 2 more hours and heard nothing so I drive to the urgent care to talk to them in person. They tell me they’re really busy (only one family in the lobby),  I told them that’s fine and that I’ll wait until the physician has time to look at the results. The receptionist returns and tells me the results show pneumonia. I tell her I already knew the result and wanted to know what the next step was for my son. The receptionist said they still need to wait on the swab results before proceeding and that they should be in sometime that afternoon. 

I wait until the afternoon and call the urgent care back. They say they still haven’t gotten the results and so I ask what time the results usually come in. The receptionist responds with “I don’t know, I’m not a Doctor.” So, I bring my son to another urgent care and they are in shock the first urgent care would send my son home without treatment especially after receiving x-ray confirmation of possible pneumonia. We were prescribed antibiotics and home within the hour.

This morning (48hrs after the first urgent care visit) I get a call from the first urgent care saying they have the results of my sons x-rays and want to put him on antibiotics until the nasal swab (still not in) comes back. At this point we were done with that facility and just said ok and thank you until they hung up. They assured us they would call when the nasal swab results come in and may have to adjust the antibiotics based on the results. We call the pharmacy they sent the prescription to and canceled the order as we already had antibiotics from the other urgent care. I feel that they forgot they gave me the x-ray results the previous day because it wasn’t the physician who reviewed them but the receptionist and the receptionist just wanted me out of the building. I went in because it’s easier to blow someone off over the phone than in person and I knew my son needed antibiotics based on his symptoms otherwise he would have to be hospitalized and I wanted to avoid that at all costs.

So on to the question: do I have a case for medical malpractice? The second urgent care said my son should not have been sent home from day one without antibiotics. My son had a 102/103 (Fahrenheit) fever for 5 days and pain in his chest. All the information was communicated to the attending physician. I think the receptionist lied that the physician had seen the X-ray results and the physician only just got around to looking at them today and was playing catchup.

I know witness testimony is the worst to rely on, but I’m a digital forensic examiner and know there are artifacts on a computer to tell when emails were opened and read, as well as call logs to say when I called and security cameras (they have a ring system in the office and it would have audio) to back up my story of what I was told in house that the X-ray said there was possible pneumonia.

"I was recently in a small claims case in WV Magistrate Court trying to recover some money from an online sale. The case was dismissed after the magistrate requested more information from the other party and they submitted screenshots of payment a few days later. 

After the decision, I requested the evidence submitted by the other party, and noticed artifacts from the screenshots which strongly suggested the images were altered. I filed a motion to set aside the original judgment based on not being made aware of and not having the opportunity to review the evidence prior to the decision and also pointed out the details where text and alignment did not match. I also provided communication with the payment company where they stated they have no record of the transaction. 

At the hearing, the judge focused on one item I briefly mentioned as suspicious, but I was wrong about. I wasn’t able to verify because the bank would not answer any general questions related to transaction numbers without me being an account holder. The bulk of my argument pointing out image irregularities was brushed off as me nitpicking alignment issues and it looks different because of some other text. The other part where the payment timeline and our conversation not matching up was ignored.  Essentially, the magistrate treated it as though the other party made a payment “in good faith” but was victim to hackers. He went on to talk about how he watched something on TV about how hackers can do some crazy things. He made a decision to dismiss the motion. 

Before the hearing was over, I asked if I could request the other party share a transaction number so I could see where it went. The magistrate stated the other party is not required to, but he would strongly recommend it. They said they would send it the magistrate assistant, who would then send me the information. About 5 days later they sent another screenshot, and metadata shows it coming from software that can be used to edit photos. Of course also I followed up with the payment company and found the transaction number does not match up with the screenshot. 

So at this point I can appeal the decision, but I’m not sure if it will lead to anything. I’m not familiar with law in any way, so I don’t know what a judge will review or if they will even look at what I submitted for the motion to set aside judgment. Can I even get the other party to reproduce the evidence in court (login to their account and find the transaction in front of a judge)? I am fine with losing out on the money if it means there’s a chance to show that the guy submitted falsified evidence to the court. It now feels like a moral issue letting someone think they can do something like this so casually.

I live in Illinois and in February of this year we had a company come out to put in solar panels so that we can be a little more green while also saving some money.  Due to an issue with the installation the panels were not actually functioning until August. During this time we paid $312 a month (May to August) for the loan on the panels. The installation company was generous and paid us back for those payments. Now we are in December and my application says we are producing solar but we are not seeing any benefits from it. We are producing more than we are using but our power company says they do now show solar on our property (even though a technician came out in August to certify it).  Now it’s a back and forth between the installation company and the power company about where the issue is at. At this point we are paying both a power bill and the loan for the panels.

"Advice on evicting a hoarder.

My mom is trying to evict her mentally ill mom. For sanitary reasons as well as emotional reasons.  We are trying to figure out the best way to approach this. We live in Las Vegas in a 2 bedrooom.(Rent)
My grandmas sleeps by the kitchen and living room.
 So her area is in the open. 

 She smells bad
 She Shits and pees on her  bed and doesn’t clean it up
 She refuses to let anyone clean it up she refuses to shower 
she hasn’t showered in… years.
 My mom has bought things to help her shower  and she has still refused to shower 
She hoards trash in her closet.  There are stains all over her walls.
 When we try to clean her area
 She gets defensive and screams at the top of her lungs like a bat out of hell. She will poke her chest out and get in our faces. 
She has even made death threats which is uncomfortable knowing she once tried to stab a man in his sleep according to my moms “father”. 

  She has left trash outside of our neighbors door. We’ve received multiple complaints about it
. Our neighbors have brought the trash back to us.
 Our neighbors have threatened to have the police called on us. 
she’s been caught on camera by the neighbor. 
Once  neighbors even  have broke into our home because they chased her down after catching her leaving trash at their door It’s not only affecting us…
 it affecting the people around us and bringing negative attention to our door. 

She has gone into our rooms and stolen items out of our rooms. Christian my younger brother has caught her in the act. I have caught her on my own as well. And when told not to go into our moms room she still went in there. We have no control over her.

  You might say. Have we tried to get her help. She constantly his throwing her pills away and scattering them on the ground.  She isn’t taking her pills. And she’s done this for years. We know she’s  not on her pills because they are on the ground. Our neighbors caught her throwing her pills in the trash bags she leaves out.  She once even put her pills in our drinks! Luckily we caught it. It’s ALWAYS something new with this lady.  

This lady lied on my moms “dad”.(DNA Test, that’s another story). And said he raped my mom and  didn’t when she was a kid. The judge wouldn’t listen to my mom. This traumatized my mom. And I don’t know why she would let this women in her life after such things let alone her kids it fucking kills me.  The system is weird and tacky. My moms story has made me lose all faith that a judge will help us…  
The plan… 
My mom decided not to accept my grandmas rent and say she’s not on the lease. That’s her plan to evict her. But I feel like that’s a cheap way of trying to get her out. We totally should be able to get her out with all the above…but that’s just my opinion leading me to ask.

 What does a lawyer think or anyone who knows a bit about law think.
 The eviction takes place the 26th and if she doesn’t leave we need a court date. Is what I’m told.

"Hi guys,

From the UK. My sister paid for a dog training service totalling £900 upfront (£200 deposit) for 10 training sessions and 2 pack walks. However, she has recently been very unhappy with the service. She has only had 1 training session thus far after 3 weeks and the other 2 sessions have been last minute cancellations. I know this has not been going on for a long time but the expectation has been to have a training session once a week or every other week and this has not been the case. She even tried to book in for a session last wednesday and did not get a response until monday at 5am for a training slot on the day for 1pm (clearly not enough time). As she has tried to continue with the training method the dog trainer provided, it has led to some redirecting (biting) from the dog back at her and once she stopped correcting, he has stopped biting her. This situation occurred 2 days before one of the cancelled training session so was meant to have been discussed then but at this point she is not very confident in working with this trainer anymore. We have sent him a message asking to get the refund of the £700 and he has since called us saying that he would not provide a refund willy nilly and would like to get an oppurtunity to do another training session for free looking at the redirecting our dog did as he can't believe that to be the case unless he sees it himself but my sister does not feel comfortable working with him anymore.

The payment was made on credit card so she has been thinking of disputing this payment with the bank.

Just hoping to get some advice guys, can he refuse to refund us our money back. Is it best to take this free training session despite being uncomfortable working with him again and what kind of steps should we follow with this situation?

"Throw away because I've posted pretty specific info about where I live on my main.

I live in an older home that has both a gas furnace (heats the whole house) and electric baseboards in every room minus the bathrooms.

I also have a dog that likes to go outside every 37.2 seconds and im not allowed to put in a dog door. Rather than deal with that song and dance, I leave my backdoor open during the day so she can go to the backyard whenever she wants.

I dont want to pay to heat the whole house with a door open, i prefer things on the cooler side (i love wearing wool socks 24/), and I live in a place where the weather is pretty mild. According to my thermostat, the interior of my house never dips below 58 in the unheated areas. Instead of the furnace, i use the baseboards in the rooms that matter to me (bedroom and office). I'd rather not burn all my stuff so I'm careful about not placing anything too close and I don't have carpets. When it has gotten very cold (we had a large snow even last year), I do close the backdoor and turn on all the baseboards- but this doesn't happen often.

Everything else in the house is electric so I do not have a gas account. 

My landlord recently found out and is upset. I showed proof that we are not in danger of pipes freezing and asked if this was an issue of it needing to be run periodically otherwise it would break down. He said he was trying to save me money/he wanted that account active and told me to start an account (but again for my specific situation this won't save me money). 

My lease makes no mention of what specific utilities need to be opened and only says that the utilities must be put in my name. I don't want to open a gas account and pay monthly fees for something that won't be used. 

Am I required to open said account like my landlord wants?

"I’m freaked out and hurt, but beyond that not sure what to do or if I should file something regarding this first.

I (24F) have a guy friend and i was staying at his house. We were drinking, there was some petting on his end, I pressed it further and was met with participation and encouragement. At every turn.

We grinded, I got him off, and then rolled over to which he had his hands down my pants FIRST and then i reciprocated with mine down his. We didn’t have penetrative sex because he asked to stop, because he has a partner (they are polyamorous and I figured it was worked out until this point) and wanted to make sure it was okay before “doing it” more than we had. I immediately stopped, we talked more, pleasantly, and went to bed with him cuddling me.

Fun pillow talk before during and after. And the kicker is I asked for consent verbally and was told clearly and consciously, “yes.” 

Now…. Fun night of drunk sex with a friend, I’m expecting an angry text from the polyamorous girlfriend of the picture because apparently, she was upset that it happened the next morning, and that was the only indication of something negative I ever had. So imagine my surprise when I call friend later and my friend is saying that he was asleep, I came onto him while he was asleep and shoved my hand down his pants, and that’s when he shut it down, with zero reciprocation.

We were both drunk, I was a little more intoxicated admittedly, but I know for a fact that he was awake and capable of making decisions and speaking the entire time. I asked for consent and got a yes, and everything was met with active participation.

The next morning I call him, he’s crying, and saying that he never consented and doesn’t remember anything. But he consented physically and verbally, and performed acts on me without prompt, and never once did I threaten or pressure him. 

I’ve been raped while drunk before. It isn’t fun, and I’m heartbroken that if even if what happened was okay, my friend thinks I did something that terrible to him, or is at least saying it to his partner and friends. I’m hurt over the rest of the situation too - But beyond that, I’m afraid for what the hell this means legally. 

I can give a detailed account of what I remember, but I don’t have physical evidence here. We didn’t actually have penetrative sex so I can’t prove any intercourse happened. At the end of the day the only real evidence is hearsay. But what the hell do I do?? 

I’ve kept an account of everything going on and all the messages exchanged, and every time I look at what exactly happened, everything I remember stays consistent and checks out. No matter how many times i replay it in my head I know I’m not imagining things or lying. But I know how serious these accusations are and I’m scared, especially because I’m starting a new job soon.

Is there some sort of legal precaution I can take to safeguard myself against something would a formal accusation be made??

Just now I got a text from him asking if I took the cat when I moved. I haven't responded.

It's been two years since I left. From what I understand, the cat is mine, and he either gifted/abandoned her to me. If he wanted to take me to small claims for her would he have a case?

"Writing this for my neighbor who doesn’t use technology. 

My neighbor (68f) was the common area housekeeper for our apartment building in a crowded area downtown with a lot of homeless activity and vandalism. For over a year, she was the ONLY hired staff on site. Other workers from other properties would come and work in the office. 5 months ago, a property manager got hired. The property manager never liked her because residents had gotten used to speaking to the housekeeper regarding issues and felt she was stepping on toes. 

She started to give her more work than she ever had, criticizing her publicly and asking her if her health/mental health were getting in the way of her doing her job. She and other visiting staff were bullying her, harassing her and would even stalk her by listening to her apartment door when she was on the phone(she has a lot of videos of them doing stuff like this)

She got to a mental breakdown where she quit. They threw away her belongings in the office without notice, refuse her rent from being paid online (although everyone else is able to pay like that) and now she has no work. 

We’re in CO. Any legal advice to recoup the loss in her belongings and hopefully for her loss in income is greatly appreciated.

"I moved into a home in Nassau county Long Island near queens. If you know Queens and the area I am in, some of the homes are very close together where the driveway on the side of the house leads to a detached garage.

In some cases the neighbors driveway is right against the house so there is no barrier in between the neighbor and one wall of the other neighbors home.

In my area it was common for the neighbors (in the 1910’s -1930’s) to swap a portion of the land in the backyard near the end of the driveway and detached garage so the neighbor with the driveway has access to the space at the end of the home to allow more space for their driveway making it wider (mainly so they can pull their car in.)

One side of my house is like this so my neighbor is right against my house but the other side, those neighbors already swapped back to the standard property line.

When I was buying the home we had the neighbor sign a Propery Line Agreement where they agreed that this was my property even though I currently do not have access to it, in order to avoid them claiming possession of it.

Now what I want to know is what are my options in taking it back and building a fence so he cannot have his garbage leaning against my house.

Even without the garbage I want a fence there to give me some space so I do not hear them so much along that wall and from my bedroom.

My first thought is to tell them I need to have the basement windows egressed in order to have my brother in law live in the basement apartment that we are building. I will build a fence during that time since it will be dangerous to have a hole from my property accessible to them. I would gladly give them the space back in my backyard which goes along their detached garage.

I have added a few pictures which show what’s going on. Any advice will be appreciated and how I can go about this without ruffling too many feathers.

So, a really good friend of mine is an EMT in New York. He was really injured on the job when his own ambulance ran over his foot, severely damaging it to the point where it's practically unusable and his partner was a witness to the whole ordeal (which they refused to take in court). Unfortunately, his case ended up going to trial against the government. They apparently said they couldn't get the doctor to prove he was injured because they couldn't figure out if it was causal or consequential, even though he practically doesn't have a foot at this point (it's still there, he just can no longer use it) so he ended up losing his case and now owes thousands of dollars which he cannot afford. He is planning on re-suing and honestly, I have 0 knowledge of law whatsoever so I was wondering if anyone knew what he should do in order to help his case or win, because he is going in for an appeal.

"My apartment has been a shit show since day one. It was a renovated building. When I toured the apartments, they were still under construction, but I signed a lease for June 1st. Well, June 1st came and went. There was minimal communication from the apartment company, I had to chase the manager down to figure out what day I could move in and where I could move my stuff if needed. my lease ended June 30th, so I brought my stuff over to storage at the building and moved into a hotel for a week before they let me move in. (they covered). i should have backed out then, since they technically broke the lease, but my previous landlords had already rented out my apartment and I couldn't stay.

Since then, it's been a nightmare. Our phase of the building was ""done"" - but it was so far from done it's insane. They've been constantly working on stuff, in, around, up, and down. Trucks every day driving right by my window that interfere with my meetings since they're so loud. ""the parking lot will be paved!!"" but it's a mud pit due to the bad water management (more on this in a bit). There's also not enough parking and we keep getting told we need to park away from the building so they can park the construction trucks there. I'm so thankful I have a jeep, I've literally gone offroading on roads better than our parking lot. They put new windows in a few weeks back - I still am looking at 2x4s and insulation around those windows weeks later since they weren't fully ready to install. None of the amenities (still listed on their site) are available and won't be until another year or so. parts of my wall were simply just not painted when I moved in, there are holes in my floor that go to the basement, full of running water so my room is musty smelling unless I run a purifier 24/7. Some people have had mold problems multiple times.

FF to today, a few days ago the culvert in the basement failed and it flooded, completely. As tenants we don't have access to the basement, but I'm on the first floor. None of my stuff is ruined yet, but I'm on day 3 with no power and living in a hotel (and hoping the pipes don't freeze). In talking to a couple folks who I know that did some of the electrical work in the building, this level of flooding has happened before, badly, and they were just relying on the existing stuff (which already failed) to keep us dry. All the food I just bought for christmas is spoiled. I'm reaching out to new places now to see if I can move apartments, but with the things mentioned, do I have legal grounds to ask to break my lease with no penalty and receive my full security deposit back?

"Location: Me = Pennsylvania / Employer = New Jersey

Back on December 1, the employer I worked for eliminated my department and terminated my employment. The separation agreement they are asking me to sign contains what I believe to be a very fair and reasonable severance. And the terms and conditions in the agreement seem fairly boilerplate. (I am a contract/procurement manager so while I am not a lawyer by any means, I have read enough contracts over my career to know what looks right)

Here's my issue: One of the benefits my company provided was tuition reimbursement. I am currently taking classes and my latest semester just ended. Nothing was mentioned about reimbursing me for the current semester's tuition in the separation agreement. Upon reading the agreement, I sent an e-mail to my contact in the company's HR department who is responsible for transitioning me out. I asked about the tuition reimbursement as well as a handful of less important questions. He got back to me almost immediately and answered everything except the question about tuition reimbursement, saying he would need to look into it. Since then, he's gone radio silent. I've followed up twice and still no response. 

I have until Jan. 15th to sign the separation agreement. The tuition reimbursement would be just a few thousand dollars and I feel stuck between making a major issue over it, or to let it go since the overall severance was im my opinion very fair. 

So my questions are:

1) Do I have a legal leg to stand on in terms of demanding the tuition reimbursement?

2) If I engage an attorney and push this, what are the chances I could lose the entire severance?

I had headbutted him and gave myself a bloody nose in doing so, but the cops were called by neighbors that heard us and I had told my boyfriend to leave and he ended up doing so. Anyways, the cops ended up arresting and even though I DID NOT WANT TO PRESS CHARGES, the state has decided to anyways and my boyfriend was advised the best thing to do would just be to plead guilty to felony charges. I had told the prosecutor, the judge and everyone else I needed to tell that I literally started the fight and I gave myself the bloody nose and he shouldn't be being charged while I'm literally able to walk away without any trouble. 

They continued with the charges and he ended up just pleading guilty to a felony domestic battery. We had a no contact order and I very stupidly and selfishly pushed for us to be try and be secretive about it so that we could be together considering everytime I tried to get the order removed it was just denied by the judge. We ended up getting caught together and he went to jail for the night but was released, but now I'm so terrified he's going to get the maximum punishment which is 7 years.

"Im a student and was trying to buy my first car, this local dealer that is a manager at Chevrolet dealership told me that he also sell cars that he buys from auctions. And since on his profile he has many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try, because I’m moving to a new home, I’m looking for a job and idk how much I would make to be able to afford a loan. 

He sold me a 2012 car, he promised me that it was in good condition, perfect he said, that it just passed the inspection in CT. 
The car looked fine, but I’m no mechanic and couldn’t take one with me to look at it, again, I stupidly trusted the guy. 

I paid him and drove the car for 50min, when I got home I texted the guy saying that the engine and the AWD lights went off, he said that it was an easy fix, probably it was related to the gas lid and we needed to buy a new piece. I also noted that one of the headlights weren’t working, also an easy fix. 

I took the car to my trusted mechanic and he said that the car is a piece of junk, all rusted, suspension would need to be changed, there’s an oil leak, the car need to be balanced and the amount that I will pay to fix it, would be way more than what I paid for the car. 

I reached out to the dealer and he only says that the car is in perfect state and that  my mechanic is trying to take money from me. The mechanic even made a video showing how shitty and rusted the car is. 

When I signed the contract, it stated that I agree to buy the car as it is, but of course I didn’t know about the current problems and we had text convos were he said that the car was in great, and even saying that it was revised and no serious problems, but literally this car is not safe to drive. 

Now, one big problem is… 
This guy used his friend (who’s also a dealer and have an used car dealership in NJ) to sign the contract and get the authorization to sell it. I paid the guy via Venmo, he used his gf account I guess. 
I know he works at a Chevrolet dealership and I was thinking about taking him to small claims. I don’t even know who am I suppose to sue, and if I even have any chance to win. 
I need a car ASAP and I can’t believe that I just lost all of my savings.

"Our company was recently taken over by another. We knew we're getting screwed but we were promised certain things. We were promised we would get to keep our hour paid lunches. We were given a slightly pay increase to help cover the increase in benefits, etc.

The way the pay weeks worked out, we will only get one full paycheck in December. So we were already not happy about that, with it being the holidays. However, when we got our pay checks today, they were short. Mine was short because they did not pay for my lunches. I don't even take a full lunch most days. I should have had 84 hours on my check but I only had 74. So they screwed me on 10 hours of regular time and then 4 hours of overtime. 

I am currently on vacation. I was off yesterday. However yesterday my boss staged a walk out and all of my coworkers walked out on the job. Corporate flew in, they're having a meeting today that I'll be attending via FaceTime (since I live an hour away and didn't arrange childcare since I was supposed to be on vacation). But that's a whole other thing. 

We had a big group chat to keep us informed and when I woke up this morning everyone was complaining about the checks being wrong. So I looked at my pay stub and screenshotted it to explain what different parts were for my coworkers. 

There is a section under ""earnings"" that says ER cost of medical, dental, etc. and my coworkers misunderstood what it meant. I explained that it was the employer cost of medical, basically the portion THEY pay for our medical insurance. Then down below under deductions is what WE pay. Some thought they took too much out for medical but that was incorrect. 

I pointed out the hours listed on the pay stub and that it was wrong. Which was right next to my hourly rate.

Then my boss sent a long msg, which she said ""I'm going to step in and say you are not supposed to be discussing your pays with eachother"". 

I said, ""(her name), I love you, but we are legally allowed to discuss our pays.""

Because this has been something I've been fighting for years!! They've been saying that for years. And I've been saying that they can't legally stop us for years. 

Then she said ""no your not, (my name). You had the rate in your screenshot. Thats not permitted anywhere."" 

I didn't say anything back cuz I'm pretty sure she is very wrong. As far as I know it's MY info and if I want to share it I can? At least up til last month,  I was the lowest paid person in my position (8 yrs experience WITH THAT COMPANY, I was there since 2015, there were 3 other people doing same job, some for less time, making more than me) so it's not even like I'm making tons more money than everyone else. We are below the average salary in my state.

Edit to add, the conversation between me and my boss took place in text msg, in a group chat with me and all my coworkers.  

Edit to add again: so we had that meeting with corporate, a lot of promises for change, and they are fixing our short paychecks (they shorted me 10 regular hours and 4 OT hours). My boss (from above) told us she is resigning. Not the first time she's said this but she seems serious.

Looking for advice for a really shit situation I’m in right now.. I hope this is the best sub for this. 

Yesterday I took my truck to get an oil change. This is the third time I’ve taken it to this location in the 7 months that I’ve owned my truck. My truck has about 119k/2026/2.7 Ecoboost on it and I’ve never had even a tiny issue with it before. 

During the oil change the mechanics working on my truck seemed very off. I saw them dropping tools in the hood, they couldn’t find something, and they kept walking away to the back for short amounts of time. (unsure if that has anything to do with this) 

While they were filling up my oil they filled to 6 Quartz and nothing was showing on the stick.  They troubleshot the issue for a bit and couldn’t figure out why. They ended up putting more and more oil until it showed on the stick. They had me start the truck and rev the engine eventually where I immediately got reading for low oil pressure and heard awful rattling. That was the last time my truck started. After that when tried the engine was locked. There was a click and the engine will not turn over. They worked on it for about 2 hours trying to figure it out until they had it towed to a real mechanic. He told me my engine is finished from that. 

Has anyone had this happen before? Right now I’m waiting for the mechanic to send me his pictures and logs so it could be pin pointed on the shop hopefully.

"UPDATE: I am finally one step closer to receiving my settlement funds. As it turns out, my mom found the paperwork from the original court case and they spelled my last name wrong. Sure enough, I test it out on the website to check unclaimed funds and what do you know, I pulled it up. Perhaps that’s why the bank couldn’t put the money into an account nor cash it for me all these years ago? Right now I am in a waiting game to hear back from unclaimed funds on what steps I should take next. I’ll update this post again if I get stuck along the way but if everything goes well, I’ll delete my post!


Sorry about the format, I’m on mobile! I also apologize if anything is unclear, it’s been 5 years so some of the details are fuzzy. I’ll try to remember what I can.

When I was a minor, I was in a car accident that required hospitalization. I don’t remember the amount anymore that was settled for but I do remember the attorney required that we go to a specific bank franchise to officially open an account after I had turned 18. I think the attorney had connections with this bank and that’s why we were supposed to go there. I remember my mom taking me when I turned 18 to that bank and the bank gave us two options, either add the funds into an account with them, or take cash. I tried to take cash but was unable to do so, I believe I still needed something from the court. I was unsure what document they were asking me to ask for at the time, and my mom shrugged it off and told me it was my responsibility now, so I never ended up going to the court.

Fast forward to today, I saw something about unclaimed funds and wondered if my settlement money ended up there, but I didn’t see anything. So does that mean that money is still out there? And if so, what steps should I take now, if I can take any steps, to access this money? I’ve asked my mom if she kept any of the paperwork and she told me she would try and find it but we’ve moved around 3 or 4 times since we initially tried to access these funds so I’m not very hopeful.

"*Please don’t ask me to find another daycare. I am working on that option. I am here for legal advice ONLY* 

Based in Massachusetts. My son is 2 years old and has been going to this daycare since he was 7 months old. 

The daycare has always had some complaints about him in every stage of his growth. When he started crawling, they complained that he is always crawling to the teachers and tugging at them to be picked up/give him attention. 

When he was between 1 and 2 years old they complained he started biting friends and teachers that got resolved when we bought a book “no biting” and he immediately stopped. 

Now he is 2 and third complain is he is hitting friends and when he is upset, he is inconsolable and is a danger to himself and others around him. 

We met with Early Intervention to asses behavioral issues and they said it’s normal toddler behavior. When we showed them the type of msgs we get from daycare regularly asking us to pick him up because he is throwing a tantrum, EI said daycare sounds like they are targeting him. Last week after 2 consecutive days of tantrum they msged saying if his behavior is not fixed in 2 weeks they will terminate him. We do not see this behavior at home. He is not aggressive at all. 

Yesterday at parent-teacher meeting, they said to keep him home because the teacher’s nervous system needs a break from my child. It broke my heart. They have videos of him crying at nap time but it’s just normal toddler behavior. I am so disappointed and hurt at their comments that I am worried they are going to treat him poorly when I send him back there and I don’t have a backup that can care for him when my husband and I are at work.

"About a year ago, I went on Instagram and I had received a message from an unknown account with pictures of my former dance teacher photoshopped into porn. I felt so disgusted and violated and basically spent the rest of the night in tears. I ended up calling my sister who was still close with my dance teacher, and she filled me in on the whole story: this had been going on for about a year. Usually it would be a bunch of girls from the dance group added to a group chat called (Name of Dance Group) Sluts/Whores and sent pictures like the ones I received along with a message about how my dance teacher likes it in bed, etc. Occasionally, however, it would be a photoshopped picture of another girl in the group sometimes with cum on it or a video of someone rubbing one out to the picture. Sometimes they would even comment on one of the girls' posts. Every time it would be a new account name and the account would disappear pretty quick after dealing it's damage. When my sister told me some of the fake names this person has used, I recognized one of them as a Facebook account that had sent me a picture some months back that I didn't open because I figured it was a dick pic or something (which might have been less disturbing than the truth). 

Since this original incident, I have been added to a few such group chats. Every time it happens I report the account, screenshot the group chat (aside from the first time, the pictures have been censored by Instagram so only the account names, recipients, and vulgar messages appear in the screenshot), and warn the recipients not to open the messages. But I really want to be able to do more than this. My sister has gone to the police a few times, but no investigation has moved forward. I have a screenshot that shows the name of a friend who was a minor at the time, so I think that could help my case even though I think I warned her in time to not look at the group chat. I'm thinking about escalating it to the FBI since I know that they have a cyber crimes division, but I would love some advice.

What bothers me the most is that this person is probably someone that I know and might have been friends with at some point. The pictures they have used are ones that only the people in our dance group should be able to access. For this reason, I almost don't want to find out who is doing it because I like to think the best of people, but the safety of me and my girls is most important to me. Thankfully, we haven't received any threats or bribes. This person is obviously getting off on just sending the messages, which is sick, but makes it less of a threat. The messages also come pretty infrequently, so it is easy to forget about them and move on with life, but I don't want that to stop me from action.

"Hi all, just looking for some legal advice here. Based in Sarasota County, Florida.  
  
My current situation is splitting rent for a house with my mom (39F) and my younger sister Chloe (19F above), as we are the three people listed on the lease. My mom and sister both have their boyfriends living here too, who are \~36 and 30 years old respectively. We were all living in my grandmother's house before moving here at the beginning of October. We had moved due to my grandmother's rapidly declining health putting her in a nursing home, followed by my Aunt and Uncle's house, and her desire to sell the house as the value had gone up.  
  
My sister has a long history of attempts on her life, which has caused her to be Baker Acted several times. One of these times, back in April of this year, she brought home a guy from her stay at the mental hospital. His name is Charles, and he's 30 years old with a multitude of domestic abuse convictions, along with a hit and run and forgery. The entire time they've known each other, he's failed to maintain any form of a job for long at all, and generally can't find work due to his record. He's also not allowed to have a license, as he still has unpaid court fees from his hit and run. On top of this, he already has kids who were removed from him, and he got my sister three months pregnant, which ended very recently in a miscarriage caused by another overdose attempt.  
  
Chloe has discussed her desire to leave him numerous times with my mom, but for some reason keeps getting sucked back into being obsessed with him.  
  
The first night he came home, along with several instances afterward, he has threatened my life and wellbeing, but he has yet to directly harm me. Within the last week, he decided to lash out with another string of threats, along with beating on my door and stating that if he saw me again he was going to beat the shit out of me and my cats. I ended up calling the cops on him this time, and feel like I've just kicked a hornet's nest as they refused to do anything since he didn't directly harm me. The same night, he tried to get into a fight with my mom and her boyfriend, and he ended up calling the cops on himself for some reason.  
  
In the meantime, I have gotten myself some pepper spray, and I set up two Wyze cameras (one in the living room, one in my bedroom) in case he tries anything towards me or my cats.  
  
As far as the next steps, the police did recommend that I look into an Unlawful Detainer, as there is no agreement, written or oral, for him to pay rent here, and I don't believe he has any legal right to maintain residence. With my sister being on the lease, will this complicate matters? Mom has agreed to file the Unlawful Detainer with me, so does it come down to a simple majority? I'm happy to answer any additional questions, just trying to make sure I have a leg to stand on here.

"Hi if anyone can help, I’d really appreciate it. A little over a week ago my sister died in a motorcycle accident. This has been one of the hardest times in my life and made only worse by the worst man on planet earth. My sister got married about a week after her 18th birthday to a man 12 years older than her. She was a grooming victim and stayed with him for the safety of her daughter. This year he was extremely verbally abusive to her and constantly accosted and attacked her. He made fun of her weight, goals, everything he could to bring her down. They lived in North Carolina, there’s a law here than spouses must be separated ated for a year before they can legally divorce. In September they mutually agreed to legally separate. After the separation he was at his most nasty calling her every awful name under the sun and intentionally having her come to his place to “catch” him sleeping with another woman. When she passed he was a douche about it to everyone and was doing everything he could to play the sad widow card. However he demanded her phone and laptop from my other sister that was her roommate. We gave it up because he said he needed it for passwords for some legal stuff. Instead he snooped through all of her apps and messages. He saw that she was taking to someone else after the separation and now he’s calling her a whore and saying she cheated on him. He came to my sister’s place and said that he has the right to all of her things and he’s not letting anyone else have anything. He said everything from her clothes to her stethoscope (she was a nurse). The whole time he’s yelling at my sister and calling my deceased sister a piece of shit. He said in the past that anything left at their old house he would burn. My sister has so many people that love and care for her. So many people that want any sort of memento of her life.

"My siblings and I received a probate court summons via mail in relation to our father’s trust. Included with the probate summons were the facts of the matter from my stepmother’s lawyer. One of the facts I do not agree with involving a car loan agreement between my father, wife, and myself. We consulted with a lawyer and were told that if we wished to be represented it would likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars as they had experience with my stepmothers legal team and knew they liked to have long battles in court. We decided that legal representation was out of the question for that amount of money. I appeared before the judge on the summoned court date and the judge asked “Do you object?” I intrepreted this to mean if I objected to the items listed in the summons and I said “Yes.”  The judge then said that because I have not formally filed my objection she would grant me additional time to do so and another court date to appear in a few months. I believe she said that if no formal objection is filed with the court then the matter would proceed.

Here are a few excerpts from my cities probate court section;

“If an interested party appears in person or by counsel when a petition is called for hearing and declares a desire to file a written objection or contest, the court may continue the hearing with the understanding that if an objection or contest is not actually on file at the new hearing date, the hearing will proceed.”

“A person with standing may appear and object orally at the first hearing on any matter before the Probate Court.
Thereafter objections, including grounds of opposition, to any petition or other pleading filed in Probate Court must be set forth in writing, filed and served either as required by statute or, in the absence of specific statutory requirements, by 4:30 pm at least three full court days before the next scheduled hearing date on the petition or pleading, e.g., for a court hearing on Wednesday, the objections must be filed by 4:30 p.m. the preceding Thursday. If written objections have not been filed in accordance with this rule, the court may decide the matter pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 7.801 as if no objection had been made. In any event, written objections may not thereafter be made without leave of court by the party orally objecting.”

My question is, did I unknowingly contest my father’s trust? There is verbiage in my father’s trust that states once you contest the trust you are essentially written out and receive nothing.

Am I okay as long as I do not file a written objection with the court? The verbiage makes it seem like nothing is official unless filed and if nothing is filed the matter proceeds as if there are no objections on file.

Wife is a non citizen living in the USA. Does not have citizenship 
We have 1 child. Child has birthright citizenship 
I am a usa citizen 

We started to file for a greencard, we are on step 3 of that process. The i130 and the request for green card is payed for the paper work for the request is filed out but not sent yet in yet. 

We literally constantly fight, she is some times violent towards me. She also will threaten me with things like burning our house down, harming family members. ect ect she's never actually hurt anyone besides herself. 

I want to file for a divorce, my problems are 1. I have nowhere to go because she has ruined every relationship I have ever had with friends and my family.

 2. I really really don't wanna leave my child with her because she's basically insane. 

3. I would like custody of our son but I highly doubt I will get it because he is young and she is the mother and I am a man and that seems to be how the courts see things

4. I really don't have the money to pay a lawyer who's gonna drag this out just to charge me by the hour 

5. Staying at home during this process would be probably suicide I don't even like sleeping around her when she's awake. 

6. I have no evidence of any wrong doing or legal advantage that I could use to get the police involved 

7. Therapy, medication, ect is not an option she refuses it all and it just causes a massive argument. 

8. Sticking it out is a waste of time I have been trying to do so and I have wasted 6 years of my life already.

I was then forced to take medication for adhd from preschool to middleschool. In full honesty, I just wanted to leave it alone, but it feels like shes forcing my hand to do something.

"I'm looking for advice on what to do here.  
  
(1) I received a letter in the post last Friday 17 December. This was a registered letter that I did not sign for (I'm assuming the postman did, but I don't know for sure - also, I don't know the postman and have never asked him to do this).  
  
(2) The letter is a summons to court for an alleged parking offence that occurred in September 2023 - parking on a Grass Margin. I was parked in the area and on the date outlined in the letter. To be honest I did not know I was parking illegally. I also didn't meet or was approached by any garda. There was no ticket on the car when I returned. It was on a grass verge on a Regional Road in the countryside near a beach. There were no double-yellow lines or 'no-parking' signs where I parked, and I wasn't blocking any part of the road. There is no footpath here either. But the area is known for a lot of parking-related issues, and people parking illegally etc. especially during the summer months and hot days.  
  
(3) The court date is for 12 March 2024, but I have the option to pay the €160 fine, no later than 7 days beforehand, which means I wouldn't need to attend court. And this would all just go away.  
  
From the Garda website: A total of 56 days is permitted by law for the payment of a fixed charge. The initial period of 28 days from the date of the Fixed Charge Notice allows for payment at the fixed charge amount. A further period of 28 days is permitted to accept payment at the fixed charge amount plus 50% of the fixed charge amount. After 56 days, payment cannot be accepted under any circumstances.  
  
  
  
I did not receive any other notification, apart from the summons. I don't really want to go to court, as I need to take a day off work and it's a bit of hassle, but on principle, I would rather go and explain above to the Court Clerk/Judge.

Odd, but I chatted with a representative, all in writing, and they stated that her plan, under no circumstances, covers that treatment.

I looked at the evidence of coverage, the big Ole book they send in the mail and is online that explains what her specific plan covers. And lo, it states it is covered. 

The rep said I'll need to file an appeal. The website allows the insured to look up providers in the area that takes their plan and are sorted by treatment. There are plenty of local providers that specialize in this treatment and accept that plan. I asked the rep this and they said, and I quote, ""the information on the website is misleading.""

"This is in Oregon, USA

In early November I had to take an exes cat to the emergency vet. She did not have the money at the time ( we are both students)  so I agreed to pay for the visit with the expectation she would eventually pay me back since I had just enough in savings to cover the cost which totaled to just under $1300  (I do not have this in writing since I assumed the relationship would not be ending so soon)

I found out two weeks later she had been cheating on me for six months and called the relationship off. Before doing this I reminded her of the amount she owed me, and asked that it be repaid. She has since blocked my number and has been refusing to see me in any capacity.

I am wondering if this is worth the hassle of taking her to small claims court. I have the itemized bill from the vet showing that I paid for the services, pictures that the cat was hers, but no formal agreement for repayment. Is this enough to get anything actually done in small claims? Or should I just cut my losses and start the new year by just putting this all behind me?

"This scenario seems risky due to the numerous ways in which a conflicts of interest could develop. The attorney would be required to defend the citizen against the state from charges which resulted from an investigation conducted by detectives and officers of the same union he is both contracted to defend in other cases and has worked with personally during his time (18+ years) as a police officer in the same county.

&amp;#x200B;

If it were a perfect world, we would be able to trust the attorney to represent the client to the best of their ability no matter which side of the fence they operate on in any particular case; In that same perfect world, there would be no risk to the reputation of such an attorney working to discredit the work of the same officers his legal career has been established defending. The world is not perfect or fair, though, and putting our trust in the wrong people can have serious consequences. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put it differently, should someone trust the attorney who's career depends on his ability to defend the officers who's careers depend on their ability to gather evidence for the attorneys who prosecute on behalf of the people of the state that is now charging the private citizen with a crime investigated by the aforementioned officers the attorney typically represents. The private citizen's outcome could come down to a scenario in which the best possible defense is to discredit those officers and detectives who gathered the evidence. The result is the attorney defending Officer A's integrity and character after he beats an unarmed elderly black woman to death in one instance, yet finds himself in a position where questioning Officer A's training or honesty is the best line of defense; in that order, the attorney would be contradicting his earlier statements and reversing it would harm future professional relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it likely an attorney would risk compromising his reputation defending officers by defending a regular citizen, just because it would be the right thing to do ethically? Is it likely that the best option would be to under-represent the regular citizen by not taking the route forcing him to discredit his client pool? Wouldn't the most ethical option, and possible the only ethical option, be to refuse to take the regular citizen's case? Would you trust this attorney to choose you over one of his law enforcement buddies?

"Hi all,

My father passed away a few months ago and we are not sure how to handle this situation. We have a lawyer, but they seem to make the situation more complicated each time we approach them.

My father lived in Illinois, and all the assets below are located there. He had a will leaving everything to me and my two brothers. He was divorced. I am named the executor of the will, and there is no dispute, we just want to get this over with. He had a few bank accounts totalling around 150K, a house in a land trust, and a car he was still paying for. We also have a few checks written out to his estate for a toal of 5k (credit card points and refund on some payments).

The lawyer took the will to the probate court, and the land trust was taken care of by them as well. We got the money from the bank accounts due to us being the beneficiaries. This leaves us with the car and the checks. Together they are worth no more than 20k.

What we can't understand:
1. Does the small estate affidavit apply in this case? If so, can we use it to transfer the car to one of us?

2. Is there a way to get the checks written out to his estate without going through the probate process?

3. Do we have to go through the probate process by law? If so, how do we do it? I was told we need to pay 400 to set up a court date for the probate, is this true?

"for the last year, I've been having ongoing issues with one of my team members (let's call him Jay). in part, it was because I was missing a few items for production (I'm a pastry chef), which I can completely understand him being frustrated about, but he never came directly to me with the issue because he felt that was not his responsibility. and it's not, but that's still no need to run to my manager (let's call her Betty)  about it.

this continues on for some time, with some weeks better than others, but now Jay's going to Betty about my behavior not being great (I embrace our mission and values, and take care to make sure everyone feels welcomed and included). Betty believes him, because why should she not? she's been getting complaints from him about me before and they were true (for the most part). 

around the time all this started last year, Jay started dating an ""older woman, with grey hair."" and while that normally would be fine, one of my peers is an ""older woman with grey hair."" Since she (let's call her Anna) and I are on the same level, we don't have manager status but we're acting managers. we don't have access to payroll or partner hours or anything like that. so the two of them dating would be fine.

fast forward, Anna put a post on Instagram story, of them at a house party, with the caption ""that's my man 💕"" AFTER she got the promotion to manager TLA. at that point, they can no longer date, but everyone I work with are such great liars that they're getting away with it.

while these two have been dating, my job has gotten much harder because I'm trying to do my job, while being bullied by multiple partners (Jay, Anna indirectly, and at least 5 others). I've brought it up to our management team, and they have done nothing about it. 

everyone assumes I was the one who told HR about Anna and Jay. and while that IS true, they don't have any concrete proof for it. so they're all going to disrespect me and ignore me and bully me until I give up information.

this past weekend, I had a direct quote from a partner who bullied me. I emailed the situation to Betty and our HR rep. 

Betty and I had a conversation about it, and her response was ""why do you think they're bullying you? why do you think they go to Jay for answers and not you?"" but when I asked her to give me examples of reasons why the partners don't trust me, she pulls the confidentiality card (even though I'm not asking for names, I'm asking for what's being said). 

our HR rep doesn't seem to be doing much (or anything at all) in regards to the situation.

"My(32f) fiances(39m) ex(43f) has full custody of their children (5m, and 8f). After 6 months,  they were supposed to revisit the custody agreement.   He asked to, she refused. For about a year as we were relocating and our lives were too unstable to manage partial custody, we entertained her having sole custody, even though she made it very difficult and gave us no privacy with the kids to talk.  She had a baby 3 months ago with her new boyfriend (that she moved in with her kids without mentioning it to my fiance,  and had the kids tell my fiance that he was their ""imaginary friend"" for months)Then she seriously began to censor the kids and limit interactions with their dad. We now have a 3br with ample room for the kids and have expressed interest in having them come stay with us on weekends.  She adamantly refused, going so far as to file false harassment charges against my fiance to prevent us from having them over. She dropped the charges (they were totally bogus) but the judge told her and my fiance to come to a reasonable custody agreement.
The next day, this is what she texts my fiance:

""Going forward as of November. Since we don't currently have any kind of schedule this will be the one we use. Calls will be Monday at 6pm  Wednesday at 6pm and a zoom call Friday at 7pm. The kids don't want to talk every night and this way we have consistency for their sake. They will know when you will call and when we will see you. You may not make plans with the kids. Don't tell them they will be sleeping at your house or you will be picking them up from school. This messes with their emotional wellbeing. We will meet up every 3rd Saturday of each month for a supervised visitation.  If you can't make the visit we will not reschedule we will see you the following month. Same with phone calls if you miss the 6pm on school nights we will not reschedule. The zoom call can be rescheduled for a later time since it is not a school night. It can also be moved to Saturday night if need be. Just give me a heads up on that.  If there is a concert for the kids at school I will let you know the date so you can attend. All visits going forward will be with only you, not [me] No uninvited guests allowed. This way we have a set schedule we both have to abide by and then accusations aren't thrown around unnecessarily.  Please only text me if it has to do with the call or visit. Please confirm that you have recieved this text. I will also email you a copy. Thanks.""


This ""agreement"" she made up 100% herself,  and when asked to discuss, she refused to negotiate.
It limits my fiances ability to see his kids about 200% more than it already is.
She also banned me from going to these visits (in public places) because she accused me of being disrespectful.  (I asked one time why my fiance couldn't see his kids, since then,  she said I'm ""not allowed"" to go to visits. The kids love me. They ask how I'm doing and miss me. On zoom calls they always try to include me; it's very sweet. They're the best. 

Since then, his ex wife has gotten confident and disregards my fiance as often as she pleases. She grounded the kids for a week because they were allegedly reasonable for 8 ducks that died in their care (the kids told him this). When my fiance asked his ex about it, she refused to tell him anything about what happened or why they were being punished, and told the kids not to talk about it.  At the end of the week of them being grounded, we were supposed to meet the kids an hour away at a library between her house and ours (they live 1.5 hours away). When hits ex wife showed up and saw that I was there, she ripped the kids away before my fiance could even see them.  (He hasn't seen them in over 2 months because last month he had a seizure and was in the hospital on the 3rd Saturday.)


Now she's trying to make the kids resent their dad in any way possible. She gave them their technology back and put a movie that the kids both wanted to watch. She then forced her son to take his scheduled zoom call with my fiance, but allowed their daughter to continue watching the movie in the other room. His son said he wanted to watch the movie and asked why he had to take the call and his sister didnt. He said ""it's just not fair! It's not fair! This is just like when...."" and my fiances ex cut him off (I'm assuming he was talking about how she punished them for me being there for my fiances visit with them)

The cop went very easy and I was given terms saying, if I did not commit another crime, all charges would be dropped. The charge I’m looking at for this is assault fourth-degree misdemeanor. In that timeframe a few months later, I got a DUI leaving a state fair with my girlfriend and “fucking hate to admit this but what happened happened have changed my ways in the last 2 years” my infant son in the car. This caused a revocation on this charge so Im going to have to admit guilty and accept the assault 4. They will not give me any jail time or anything other than the fines I already need to pay.

while waiting to get sentenced, i had no conditions about smoking weed so i was able to do so and i am a chronic heavy smoker. (it is legal in canada) 

now that i’ve been sentenced my conditions changed and now i’m not allowed to smoke weed without prescription. 

i can get one fairly quickly but i’m worried that in the meantime they will drug test me for weed.

in my conditions it specifically says i will be drug tested for alcohol and controlled substances.

it also says that i can not take any intoxicating substances.

i heard from my lawyer that i’m fine to smoke because they won’t urine test for thc because he told me that it’s not a considered controlled substance and they will only be testing for alcohol and the list of controlled substances, he explained to me that i just can’t get super high and act intoxicated (i have a high tolerance so i don’t act any different when i smoke) 

i don’t want to take the risk because i met with my new probation officer today and he told me that weed is considered a controlled substance… which means i could get tested for it.

i stopped smoking and im waiting for a prescription. but im scared now because i JUST got my conditions changed this week and i’ve been a heavy daily smoker for years now. 

i did some research and it says that weed can stay in your system and be detected in a urine test for up to 30 days or more if you’re a heavy smoker. 

so im worried if i get drug tested it will show i smoked weed even though i’ve stopped to wait for my prescription. 

what do i do and is my lawyer right or is my probation officer right ? 

hopefully i can get prescribed soon! i will not be smoking lol ! just stressing over this.",i am on house arrest need legal advice about conditions and smoking weed in canada,18nie19,1703147891.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18nie19/i_am_on_house_arrest_need_legal_advice_about/,

"TW: Child Ab*se

Good day,

I would just like some help on how to go about this. My mother currently helps out her friend with a private day care service in someone’s home which is paid by the government in CA. From what was explained to me, it depends on the family background. And if they meet the criteria then each child is covered on the hourly rate of the day care.

Recently they have taken a new child (3 yr). The grandparents of said child have accused my mother of m*lesting the child and so forth. Prior to this incident they had also accused she fed them soap. These are all serious allegations.

I tried to call her to ask for more details but she said she will call me back tomorrow.

I am worried about her and she fears that the police will take her away. 

I know this is all BS and I want nothing more than for this to be cleared. And its stopping every bone in my body to just hop on a plane and whoop these grandparents up tbh. 

Please any advice will help in order to protect and maybe even guide her. I am already trying to find legal representation if worst comes to worst.

"I work as a software engineer in the Netherlands, and my employer is a contractor that sends employees to different clients.  
A few weeks ago I came back from sick leave because of a medical treatment that I took.  
About two weeks later, a new software engineer joined the team and began training with the rest of us. Two more weeks after that he came to the client's location for the same time.  
One day before his arrival, I was informed that I will no longer be part of this team, which is why I suspect that he came as my replacement to begin with.  
On the talk I had with the manager who decided to drop me from the team, I asked for concrete feedback on what is the reason for the decision.  
The manager's answer was that I didn't fulfill the expectations.  
I gave examples for the work I've done for the team, providing my contribution, and backed everything with numbers.  
The manager said that the quality of my solutions was too low for what was expected of me, and that was the end of this talk.  
To the best of my knowledge, I did not get any negative feedback prior to my treatment.  
This premature termination of my role in the team gave me a huge problem and hurt my position in the company where I work.   
This is why I explore legal options on being compensated for damages due to wrongful termination of my work, and I feel that I should act as soon as possible right after it happened (correct me if I'm wrong).  
My questions:  
1. Do I have basis to start legal procedure?  
2. Should I write to the HR department of this client that I believe this termination of my role was wrongful? If yes, could you give me guidelines on how it should be done?  
3. Is there any information that I should add and maybe missed?

I would love for someone with some California tax law acumen to give some insight into this!

I work for a corporate event planning company, and we help source groups with different products/services they might be interested in to enhance their events. I generally work on the operations side and only manage the event AFTER it’s been sold/contracted, but it’s been a busy season and today I had to personally reach out to one of our long-standing suppliers for a quote to add a service to an upcoming program. 

The client’s ask is for a sommelier, a person to come to our event and speak with expertise on the wine that is already bought and will be served regardless of them being there, and will be provided by the venue. This expert does not need to bring anything but themself, their knowledge, and a hospitable attitude, everything else is being provided. 

This vendor’s proposal shows a hefty fee of $600 for the 3-hour service window for 1 Somm, which said fee didn’t shock me- however I was surprised that on top of that fee there is a 20% coordination fee, transportation fees, a parking fee, AND California State tax. 

You can’t tax services in California, right? I looked into it and went down a rabbit-hole of whether a company might have Nexus or not, but ultimately I don’t think it should matter. No tangible product is being provided by this person.

"Hi, all.

My friend (who is not insured) was involved in a motor vehicle accident last week, where a car exiting a shopping plaza (the entrance/exit has traffic lights, as well as pedestrian crossing lights) hit my friend as she was crossing the entrance/exit whilst riding on the sidewalk with the pedestrian light lit up (her right of way). The driver stayed and provided insurance info to cops.

At the ER, they did all sorts of imaging and tests. She’s fine, except for a gnarly scar she has from a pretty big cut she got on her lower leg, and some bruises.

We don’t know the total of her ER expenses, since it’s only been about a week and she hasn’t been mailed any bills. The driver’s insurance was to pay said expenses.

However, she learned today that insurance of the driver cannot cover the entire expense, because they don’t have such an extensive policy. She’s afraid she will have to pay the remaining balance herself, which she finds very unfair. The lawyer she’s obtained has told her that the best thing she can do is accept the terms the insurance has offered stating that she accepts the expenses that can be covered by the driver’s insurance, and that she cannot pursue legal action against the driver. She was advised by the lawyer that suing the driver would not amount to much because the driver is “poor”, and cannot possibly find a way to pay the expenses either. Lawyer told her that the best bet is to sign the terms, and to then go to the hospital to somehow plead her case that she herself cannot afford to pay the expenses.

Mind you, she’s lost time at her jobs (she has multiple part time jobs) but she’s not wealthy by any stretch. She’s also a poor person working to provide for her kids.

Is there anything else here that can be done for her? This happened in Florida. I don’t know if there are any programs or charities that can help out in cases like this?

"I received my next week's schedule for work, and I am frustrated to say the least. I've been scheduled to work all day on Christmas despite saying on two different occasions that I cannot work holidays. I've interviewed for this job twice (I quit last year due to issues with my schedule, guess that's happening again) and during the interview they make a point to ask you if you can work holidays, which on both occasions I've said I cannot. 

I've already brought up this issue with management and they say I'm still responsible for this shift unless I get it covered, good luck doing that for a shift on Christmas. Not only is this an issue with working a holiday, but I can't even work Sundays or Mondays (Christmas is on Monday). 

How availability/schedules works with my job is through an app where when you first start that job you select what days and hours you can work, and said hours must be approved by management. So they have scheduled me a day of the week that we have had a mutual agreement that I can't be scheduled for.

The excuse management gave me was that I didn't read through our weekly communications where the scheduling manager had put that we should email them about our availability for Christmas day. I did indeed read this, but I assumed that after telling their hiring manager that I cannot do holidays TWICE that they would have gotten the message.

I bring this issue here because they have told me that I could be fired for missing such a big day.

"US employment law question, for context.  Also on mobile, so apologies for any wonky formatting.  

Last year, I accepted an interim-to-possible-permanent leadership role with my employer of 6+ years.  My offer letter specifically stated that I would return to my exact prior role at the same salary plus any raises earned, etc.  There was no mention of “or equivalent position/pay grade” or anything to suggest I wouldn’t get my old job back if the leadership role wasn’t made permanent.  

I found out roughly 9 months into the interim role that my prior role had been eliminated, but I remained hopeful that the interim role would become permanent.  Unfortunately, it didn’t due to staffing needs at the time, and I was returned to my old department in a job-grade-equivalent role that I HATE.  I am currently on a leave of absence as a result of this whole mess, and the fact that this new role is triggering some mental health issues that prevent me from doing the job effectively.

I wasn’t given any other options; I was just told essentially “this is what’s happening” (though the details changed several times in the span of a few weeks).  It’s my understanding that my company offers severance in the event of a non-comparable job offer, but I would be hard-pressed to meet that definition as the roles require similar skill sets; the biggest difference is that my new role is customer-facing and my old one was not (which was something I especially enjoyed about it).

I don’t particularly want to leave the company because I’ve accrued a number of benefits during my time there (generous paid time off, vested in the pension plan, etc.) but I hold a LOT of resentment toward my former/current department for not abiding by the terms of my offer letter.  The only “out” I can see is that the letter states the interim role is not to exceed 12 months, and I was in it for about 14; that said, my prior role had already been eliminated before I reached the 12 month mark.

Do I have any leverage or possible recourse here?  I have mixed feelings about actually getting my old role back (I pursued the interim role because of issues with my former manager), but I would gladly take that over what I’m doing now.  I just can’t shake the feeling that I got screwed and this isn’t right, no matter how much I try to convince myself that it probably wasn’t personal and it was just a “business decision”.  There are other factors impacting my feelings on the matter, but these are the facts that I would consider potentially actionable.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"For context, I live in New York and I recently moved into a new unit apartment out of many that were being renovated to be put on the market. My apartment was advertised as having a private outdoor space, and so of course it was a very attractive feature that me and my roommate wanted. At the time, the unit they showed me was an identical layout of the one I would be getting but just in the next door building because it was still being renovated and building the outdoor space. 

I signed the lease and was set to move in a month after. They promised that the back door space would be done by move in, but it wasn’t. That wasn’t a big deal to me since I wasn’t in a rush to use it. It probably was finished being built a month after my move in. 

However, I have one particular problem with the outdoor space. I have no locks on my “private” outdoor space. It’s basically a tall door/fence that anyone can push in and essentially enter. Now the similar units next to mine have locks, but mine does not. The problem with this is that my lockless gate leads to a small alleyway to the apartment’s trash area, so it is a high traffic area. If people were curious enough to walk over to the fence, and push it, no one would be stopping them. 

I had one particular incident where I was doing work in the living room home alone, and I spotted some random person who I assume got curious as to what that door led to, and went into my backyard. Once our eyes met, the person looked shocked and quickly left. I don’t think this person had bad intentions, but it definitely spooked me. 

I brought it up to the apartment super and he essentially said to call management. He told me that no one was supposed to go back there and that I should just install a camera, and if anyone went back there, then to just call him and he will take care of it. 

I ended up calling management and they basically gave me a bullshit answer of “just put a sign that says private property” or that they weren’t allowed to put locks because it is a fire hazard?? Also that one of the electrical boxes within my patio has all the internet access and that the Internet technicians need easy access to it every time someone moves in and gets internet. 

All of this, I’m sure you could imagine is very confusing to me, which is why I haven’t even started putting outdoor furniture in that space. Who knows if someone is going to come and steal my furniture when I’m away because nothing is really stopping them. 


Is this even legal? I’m not particularly trying to sue them, but I just want to be able to push management enough to where they will add a simple lock on the fence.

"Pretty much what the title says. I’ve had this insurance company for 6 months or so, and before we even switched companies at work I’ve been in touch with them trying to get the ball rolling on prior authorization for a prescription I’m willing to pay full price for out of pocket. The problem is, even when my doctor writes it for ‘brand only,’ the pharmacy says they can’t sell it to me out of pocket because of my insurance. When I go to my insurance, they say that I need prior authorization from them to fill it (which I repeatedly try to get - they say they’ve issued - only for them to say they didn’t grant a few months later). They’re legitimately preventing me from getting access to the prescription I’m willing to pay 100% for, telling me they’ve got it taken care of for next time and it won’t happen again - and worst of all - have switched to mail order recently and now send the wrong prescription to me literally within DAYS of confirming in recorded calls (I record them all just like they do) only to say “once it’s been sent there’s nothing we can do.”

WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS!? It’s NUTS. I’ve been on the phone (as of today) 17 hours with them and it just keeps repeating. When I try to tell them what they said to me on a recorded call days before they tell me that I’m mistaken for a different reason every time but they can’t speak to the last time I talked to someone because they don’t keep records of their calls (or prior authorization requests for that matter) - and that they don’t take any sort of communication in writing whatsoever (no emails, no complaints online - they’ve got nothing they say) and all correspondence has to be held by phone. 

I feel like they are legitimately frauding me right now. I’m paying the highest premium for that purpose only (getting the better version of the prescription) yet they stonewall me out of paying for it out of pocket and continually send me the wrong thing (to save money it appears) knowing good and well that it’s wrong.

"Around a month ago a man in my school started talking with my girlfriend’s friend at her lunch table. He likes my girlfriend’s friend and she does not like him back. Many times he has stated to her that if he looked at the kid she likes and he looks back at him one more time he would quote cum in his ass and face. He also many times has said he would fight him for her. He is aware they I am my girlfriends boyfriend as he asked her and this is confirmed by her friend next to her hearing it. One day he stuck his finger up my ass on their stairs where their is no cameras but my gf and friend both saw it and even texted the other girl that they saw it happen. I didn’t do anything about it. One day he came to my lunch table Infront of all my friends and said quote your gfs one ass cheek is so fat it’s the size of my head. I was pissed but I just pretended to laugh it off. Many times my gf has stated be is creepy and she doesn’t like when he’s near him especially with what he has said to me about her. This is the important part. Walking to math class with my gf on my right he followed me and whispered in my ear damn look at her ass or somthing very close. I immediately threw a punch at him and at the time I had my plastic water bottle in my hand. My fist definitely landed on him hard but so did the bottle. I told him not to say that shit again and walked into my class. A minute or so later he comes in yelling at me and gets in my face saying all sorts of horrible things. My teacher tried to get him to leave and he said things like who tf are you you old ass man etc. they needed 2 deans to get him to leave while I calmly left with the other. I’m charged with fifth degree assault for using a metal water bottle to hit him. It wasn’t metal one and it was more so my fist because I squeezed the bottle to form one. Btw the bottle is just a plastic Gatorade bottle. He has a concussion. He claims he never knew she was my gf but told him and her fried also was there to confrirm that. He claims that he was talking about the girl Infront of me and not my gf. As if that makes it any better? Theirs some other lies he’s saying but the question I have is I was many times touched by him sexually. (Fingering my ass in school on the stairs, grabbing my chest in school because I’m a pretty strong guy, hugging me at a gym without me at all hugging him back. He’s made many sexual claims about my freind and my gf. The issue is theirs no cameras in the stairs so only have my 3 friend as testimony and I do have my entire table about what he said about my gfs one ass cheek. I feel I was simply defending my gf or the girl they he claims he was talking about . He didn’t deny talking about her ass yet. I also feel he threatened my friend by offering to fight for his almost gf. Do I have a case to counter sue for sexual assault or harassment . Or to get my 5th degree assault charge dropped??

"My ex and finalized our divorce just before the pandemic shut everything down. During our marriage, I carried health, dental, and prescription insurance for us and our child. In our stipulation, I was to maintain coverage for myself and our child and he was to pick up coverage through his job (his job actually offers better coverage than mine at a slightly higher premium, though any premium would be higher than the no premium he was paying when I carried the insurance). 

I sent in the paperwork just before the official shutdown and assumed that was that. I got one explanation of benefits from my ex using my insurance at his doctor, but it was definitely before I sent in paperwork to remove him from my insurance. 

Yesterday I received a statement from my prescription coverage regarding a recent prescription for my ex. It appears he used my insurance to cover it. I tried calling to get more information but the person on the phone said they couldn’t give me any information due to privacy laws.

"**TL;DR:**

I was living in a moldy Nashville apartment with constant water damage and intrusion, the landlord failed to fix the issue, the mold issue got so bad that I got sick (still am, now facing sinus surgery) and had to hire a mold professional to prove how bad the issue was to my landlord via lab results. They broke my lease but they caused me harm, ruined a bunch of my belongings, didn't give me a habitable place to live without water intrusion, ignored building codes, and overall put me through hell. I'm looking for legal advice as all of the legal firms I have asked to help in Nashville have completely shut me down and said they don't take mold cases.

What are my legal options? Why won't anyone take my case?

**Edit**: I was living in the apartment for more than 6 months. Realized I didn't mention that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Full post:**

Hello,

As the title says, I'm looking for some legal advice or guidance regarding a mold issue that has compromised my health and belongings.

I moved to Nashville back in May and shortly after moving into the apartment, I noticed the wall and ceiling were leaking significantly when it rained. There was water pooling along the baseboards of the exterior wall. I reported this to the landlord and also expressed concerns about water damage and mold, they did some caulking outside but refused to do anything to dry things out like dehu and brushed off my concerns about mold.

Their caulking did not work, next time it rained it was the same story. I reached out again and this time was brushed off for multiple weeks until they just randomly closed my ticket and said a waterproofing company came to fix the issue (I work from home and I'm fairly certain this did not actually happen, but I could be mistaken.)

Next time it rained, the issue was still there. Around this time, I started to get very persistent head colds and sinus infections that just wouldn't go away and some really gross stuff coming out of my sinuses, headaches, bloody noses, etc. No prior history of sinus issues or allergies, etc. I go to the doctor and get antibiotics. Nothing improves. This goes on for a couple more months while I continue to be ignored by my landlord and they continue to close tickets out without action.

Eventually at a follow-up doctor visit, we get to talking and I mentioned the water leaking I had been dealing with and how I had expressed concerns about mold. The doctor suggested hiring a mold professional to come check my place out, so I did. The mold professional deemed the apartment unsafe for human habitation, found multiple types of mold in large quantities in the air, behind the walls, all throughout my AC unit and closet as well as behind my dishwasher. The lab reports came back that multiple of the types could produce mycotoxins and upon sharing his results with my apartment complex, they allowed me to break my lease with no fees.

Unfortunately, the mold professional advised me in both his report and via the phone that a lot of my belongings should not be kept due to mold spores and the types of mold he found in the lab reports. So there were many things I lose, some of very high value.

My question is, how can I pursue legal action in this situation? Since leaving there, I have been diagnosed with fungal sinusitis and am being told that surgery and anti fungal medications are likely my only option. I'm still working with my doctors on this.

I have reached out to more than 5 legal firms here in Nashville / Tennessee and I am unable to find a single lawyer willing to take my case. I have been directly harmed by the negligence of my landlord and the apartment complex, I have been sick for months, and now I am facing surgery in order to hopefully get my health back.

I was not given a habitable place to live, and I am fairly certain that building codes were being completely ignored by them allowing the water intrusion to continue for the entire time I lived there. I am also fairly certain that they were aware of the issue before even letting me rent the unit, as one of the maintenance team members disclosed to me that a new roof had to be put on the building a few years ago due to a tornado. I also know that I wasn't the only person there having moisture and mold issues, as I made multiple friends while there.

Can anyone help me find a lawyer that can take this case, or help me understand why I'm having trouble doing so? What are my options? Sorry for the long post. I appreciate any advice.

"Location: Phoenix, Arizona

As a present to my Wife I got her car “chrome deleted” and added a black vinyl wrap to the roof by a local vinyl wrap shop. This sub won’t allow attachments but I posted in another sub earlier today and nearly everyone agrees the work is not professional, most comments are like “looks like a first timer”, after the holidays I plan to take it to another local shop for their opinion.

When I went for the estimate he quoted me $1,600 for the work, we had discussed what I wanted before the estimate through Yelp where I sent detailed pictures and a description, so the in person estimate was just to confirm the details. After the estimate I paid an $800 deposit and booked my appointment.

The day of my appointment the owner has me go over the work to be performed again, then when I mentioned the roof rails and roof wrap he said “that’s definitely not part of this $1,600 job, let’s go look at the estimate on my computer I’ll show you it wasn’t included”. So we go inside and the estimate lists the chrome delete and roof rails, but not the roof wrap, I chopped that up to a misunderstanding and he agreed to discount the roof wrap. The final price was $2,530. He warned that the roof rails may not be able to be fully wrapped but they’ll do their best. I would have normally walked away because this felt like a bait and switch but it was my wife’s Birthday, our wedding anniversary and Christmas so I didn’t have time to find someone else.

The job was supposed to take 1 day but took 3 because the owner wanted to give his employees time to make it “perfect” but I was okay with the delay. Unfortunately because of the delay I couldn’t be there to pick up the car so my wife picked it up and thought it looked good because she’s not familiar with a good wrap job.

So I call him and say I’m dissatisfied with the work, there’s nicks in a few places, the wrap is not tucked well into body lines, there’s visible seams, and some places are not even fully adhered to the car. He basically says it’s as good as anyone will ever get it and that I should be thankful for the deal he gave me.

I’m not expecting all the money back, but I don’t believe I should be paying for the roof wrap because it’s poorly done and will need to be fixed. The only documentation I have is the original estimate and final receipt, he never updated the receipt to include the roof wrap, but he did update the price.

If he doesn’t agree to fix the poor work or refund the roof portion ($930), can I take him to small claims court?

"(Utah) I am wondering if this case of malpractice is worth pursuing legally.  I have an issue with chronic back pain and in pursuit of getting a proper diagnosis, I went in for X-rays for a leg length study.  The radiologist reported in summary said I have a 2cm discrepancy, but after doing the math from the measurements provided in the report, it absolutely didn't add up to the total given.  The radiologist had the length of the femurs as 45.8 on the right and 46.5 on the left, then the tibias as 35.7 on the right and 36.0 on the left, then he reports a leg length of 88 on the right and 90 on the left.  Actual math of those numbers would total to 81.5 on the right and 82.5 on the left.  I contacted the radiology department and they refused to look at it.  I then contacted the patient advocate line at the hospital to ask for the images to be looked at again, they decided to contact the doctor's office that ordered the X-rays.  The doctor's office said they would look into it.  Weeks later the doctor's office called and said that they remeasured and that the measurements were correct, but they couldn't find a surgeon to correct the discrepancy.  I found a surgeon with a quick Google and set an appointment with him at a different hospital.  I took the image disk and report to the surgeon and he informed me that the discrepancy is half of what was in the report.  I have been walking on a heel lift since April that I didn't need, and I suspect the increase in pain that I have experienced lately is because of that.

"Hi everyone, 
I (33F) am in the early days of pregnancy with my boyfriend (35M)s child. He has two kids from previous relationships and currently pays what I believe to be a very low amount of child support because it’s based off his income (which is low for our state). We’re in the US in MA. There’s a lot of background so please be patient with me.

We’re discussing getting engaged, I already pick up a TON of slack financially for him as I make more. Right now I pay all of the rent, utilities, my car, my insurance, and any other odds and ends bills. He pays his car and his child support and will toss me $10-30 when he has it. 

I recently sold my house and will be buying again over the summer. He obviously wants to come with me. However, I do not want to be obligated to buy a massive house to accommodate his other children + my child + an office as I work from home 100% of the time and I have gym equipment. He wants me to provide bedrooms for both of his children which is going to be wildly expensive on only my income and his children are only with him on weekends.

My questions are as follows:
1. I would be the only person listed on the house as he has nothing to contribute financially. Am I at risk if I allow him to move in (unmarried) financially or legally?
2. If we did get married how do I protect my income and assets from his baby mothers? I need to ensure child support does not increase and that I am not obligated to provide for the other children 

I’m mainly worried that this is going to absolutely ruin me financially and I have to worry about my own unborn baby.

Let me know if this makes sense, I do have a lawyer that I’m going to be meeting with but with the holidays it’s going to be a bit before I hear from him 

Thank you!

EDIT #1:
If I break ties with him but want to keep the baby what leg do I have to stand on for full custody? When my child is with him I’ll have zero control and that terrifies me, I don’t want them alone with his family especially before they can talk and tell me if something happens.

I struggle quite a bit with severe depression and anxiety. I had an ESA before for roughly 4 years. She was a small dog who unfortunately passed away last year. I’m finally feeling steady enough to look into getting another as I found her to be so incredibly helpful. This time, I am looking into getting a cat. My therapist gave me the ESA letter that most of my other landlords had requested and I sent it to my leasing office. They responded that they needed my provider to fill out some paperwork that they would then send to their lawyer for determination. My therapist just sent me a copy of the paperwork they sent over and it’s asking for some very personal information. It seems like an interrogation form, asking my therapist if I qualify as a disabled person and when I started treatment with them/ how long I have been treated by them and what the ESA would be treating/what I struggle with. I feel a bit violated and creeped out. Is this legal for my leasing company to do? I’ve never had ANY other apartment need such personal information before regarding my ESA.

"Hello, 

I’ve been WFH for about 6 months now with a marketing agency. The channel we use to talk to one of our biggest clients is WhatsApp. However, this client says some really gross and sometimes sexual things in the group chat and at this point I’m wondering if I could have a suit on my hands. 

Aside from the client, my boss has been extremely hostile at times. Sending very rude and cruel messages, sometimes over things that were HIS fault. After he’ll wait until the next day and then act as if nothing happened. 

Another employee has mentioned both things, and when it’s about the client the boss/owner of my company says “oh he’s not being serious it’s just how he is” and dismisses the concerns. He joins in on the “jokes” sometimes too which just shows his professionalism. 

It’s a very small company, just the owner, an admin, a creative director, and me (busdev) however I was told on Monday I’ll be laid off at the end of the year. I’m unsure if this is because of me calling out some of the behavior or not. Oh well. On top of that, my boss claimed he’d give me as much work as possible before the end of the year so I could make money, and it’s now been over a week of radio silence. He’s given me no work, no hours, so no pay. However I don’t want to apply for unemployment yet because I’m afraid if I don’t wait until the actual “layoff” he’ll claim that I quit.

"(USA, near a large city)

I was just at the checkout and there was an older man standing nearby who looked like he had a dark clump of hair on the front-left corner of his bald head. As I got closer to the register, I was horrified to see that it was actually an entire section of his skull and brain that was missing and it was dark, dried blood that had covered that area. 

I immediately walked over to customer service and very strongly asked them what was going on (because no one seemed to be doing anything about it). In a fairly casual tone, he said that the man had been in before.

I, again very strongly, told him that he needs to be taken to a hospital and the customer service associate said there was nothing they could do. 

He also said that another man had been in with an open wound on his leg that was bleeding.

He said that corporate policy said they couldn’t do anything about it for fear of being sued. He said that if they rejected medical treatment then there was nothing that could be done. 

Pretty awful. Not even sure how someone missing part of their brain could consent or reject, but I don’t know enough medically to be able to say for sure. 

I hope he gets treatment. That was like something from a war movie.

"Pretty much title.

I work front desk at a hotel/resort near me. 2 weeks ago, HR sent out an email and we had documents posted by our time clocks, reminding us to clock out when we take a meal break and it said that if we didn't clock out 30 minutes would be deducted automatically for every 8 hours worked.

Usually we have only 1 person staffed at our front desk, when I usually eat my meals I have to stand at a counter in the back office, take a bite or 2, swallow and run back out to the desk to make sure no one is there. Rinse and repeat until my meal is done. Usually takes me about 12-15 minutes and I do not clock out. We are not allowed to eat at the desk. I asked my manager about it today and what we needed to do for our breaks and she said ""just do what you've been doing, take a couple bites in the back and walk back out front to the desk"". I then asked her if I could take a full 30 minute break since it was being deducted and I was told that we ""did not have the staff to take full 30 minute breaks"" and that ""we can't leave the desk unattended"". 

My question is, is this legal? I'm in Georgia, and from reading labor laws it's not legal at all, but I could be interpreting the law wrong. If this isn't legal, what can I do and who can I report them to?

"My Great Grandfather had a small house built in 2007, with the intention of it going to my sister and I when he passed. As we were under the legal age to own property at that time, my G-Grandfather had the property put into a Life Estate with my mother as the Grantee, and my sister and I listed as remaindermen. My G-Grandfather died in 2011. Had previously been homeless, and moved into the property around that time. 

A short time later, my parents were listed in a lawsuit, so my Grandfather (G-Grandfather's son) had his attorney speak to my mother, and they transferred the Life Estate from my Mother's name into my Grandfather's name, still with myself and my sister listed as Remaindermen. 

Ever since my Grandfather was made holder of the Life Estate, he started trying to have us removed from the property. Within days of being made holder, he came to where were we living on the property and told us, ""I need to move the white trash out of here and get someone decent in."" We refused to move out (again- no money- we would be homeless), and for years, my grandfather would file demonstrably false reports against us through animal control, code enforcement, etc.

In 2018, 7 years after having moved into the property, we left- due in large part to harassment from my grandfather, as well as a neighbor who was stalking us (we obtained a restraining order after providing evidence in court of her intention to kill our entire family; my grandfather wrote testimony on her behalf that we were making everything up).

My Grandfather died earlier this year, in 2023. We never heard from the executor of his estate or probate. My sister and I currently live out-of-state; around a month ago, my sister was able to take time off work to fly back to GA, obtain my Grandfather's death certificate, and attempt to claim her share of the property, as held in the life state. 

As it turns out, in 2018 (after we moved), my grandfather put the property into a Joint Tenancy with Survivorship with his wife. Based on what I read, this is another form of trust that prevents property from being willed upon one's death, without permission from the co-owners.

I was of legal age to own property in 2018. My grandfather never contacted me regarding the Life Estate, nor the Joint Tenancy. The Joint Tenancy was also filed with a different attorney than the Life State. The online court records list my Great-Grandfather (who died in 2011) as being the Grantee to my Grandfather in the Joint Tenancy in 2018.

I will be seeking the advice of a Probate Attorney ASAP, but at the moment, I'm trying to understand all of the pieces, and what my role is in this case.

"Hi all,

Trying to navigate a tough situation. Earlier this year, my biological Dad passed away, leaving me with my only parent being my Step-mom. She has been my Step-Mom since I was 2 years old, but I was never formally adopted. The details are somewhat unclear, but there was a legal custody dispute when I was very young, and they ruled in favor of my dad (My biological mom was a heavy drug user and unfit to be a parent). 

This week, my step-mom passed away. Both my Dad and Step-mom were very young and both of them passing in the same calendar year is a shock, and due to their relatively young age, neither of them had a will.

To make things somewhat more complicated, my step-mom has 2 biological sons (step brothers of mine) who I interact with on rare occasion. 

Without the will, we are unsure what can even be done or where to start. We are trying to do this in the most fair way possible, but even early conversations have led to ""you're a step child, you're not owed anything"" which of course stings on an emotional level, but may be true/fair from a legal perspective.

However, my armchair legal Googling suggests that in California, where my stepmom lives, that I may be entitled to their estate even has a stepchild.

I am trying to understand what is possible now, so that I can help move forward with any estate/funeral/etc. proceedings as emotionally composed as possible.

"I am in the beginning stages of what will be a long and arduous fight against my current employer (who happens to be an extended family member) and another manager (related to my employer) for bullying and harassment. All of the issues I have been navigating started after a non work-related event that was completely separate of myself (I had nothing to do with the particular event), but because of my relation to the person that my employer is now going to war with, I just ended up being collateral damage and have been wrongfully punished at work. 


Out of all of the things they have done since the “event” (barred me from entering the office and then acted as if I had requested to work remotely despite having written proof they told me I was not allowed on the property, all other staff receiving a holiday bonus except myself, trying to make it seem like I work less than 40 hours a week on my ROE despite being a salaried manager and causing issues with medical EI, saying I am not owed vacation despite my last pay slip saying exactly how much vacation I am still owed, etc), the worst has been the constant barrage of emails and text messages requesting I send over all of the documents I have made over the years to my co-manager. These are documents  I have spent the last two years making in order to essentially do my job and stay organized before this other manager came on board; when I came on as a manager, I had no guidance or aids to assist me in maintaining records and employee documents.

"Hi All,

Located in Massachusetts, US and really need some help for my dad’s situation. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this as I don’t know where else to turn. He’s my last living parent. 

This summer, my dad had a spinal tap and full knee replacement surgery here in Massachusetts. Within 1-2 hours post operation, he unexpectedly lost 100% of his hearing in 1 ear and 60% in the other. When he reported this, numerous doctors at the hospital (ENTs, anesthesiologists, knee surgeon and more) all came to see him and could not explain the cause. All they said was, “it was a successful surgery, hopefully your hearing comes back.” Since then, (5 months later) my dad has been told by doctors his hearing will not return. 

He has contacted 3-4 lawyers to pursue a case against the hospital (to cover hearing aides and other potential solutions in the future) but every single one has turned down his case. They have responded, it’s too difficult to prove he had any hearing before this and will not pursue a case

My main question: Is this how medical cases in law go? You need to be able to fully prove your health prior to fighting that it was impacted by a hospital?

I wanted to keep this concise, but can share more details if needed/relevant. Thanks for your help and happy holidays y’all.

"California Worker’s Rights Advice!   
I have been working at a small restaurant for 2.5 years. I have always been a model employee, I barely take time off, I always pick up shifts, I’ve never needed to be disciplined, etc. I was promoted to a shift lead about 6 months ago and I also now run the social media for the business.   
This last week I was exposed to carbon monoxide and started experiencing pretty bad headaches this past Sunday (12/17) while at work. I continued to work as I didn’t know why this was happening but took an extra break. On Wednesday I discovered that carbon monoxide was the source and took a day off for my ER visit. I’m fine now except I obviously have some residual side effects and a continuous headache.   
Here is the legal part. Today I was at work and stated to my boss that I didn’t feel very good and thought I was experiencing some residual side effects. When my other coworker arrived I took the opportunity to work on a chalkboard sign for our patio because it was a less strenuous activity. He asked me to go out and buss tables and I said that the other people on shift were taking care of that and that I was working on this project since I didn’t feel good. He asked me to go buss the tables again and I complied. After bussing several rounds of dishes and feeling quite bad I started to tear up. When he noticed this he told me to go home. I said I didn’t need to go home, I just wanted to finish my project that my manager had asked me to complete. He again told me to go home and then went back to his kitchen work. I retreated to the office to call my manager about the situation and returned to the floor when I heard the phone ringing. When he saw me he said “I told you to go home” and I said that I would once my manager arrived to relieve me of my shift. He said he was the boss and he was telling me to go home. I said that I didn’t need to and he couldn’t just make me go home when I’m doing my job. He basically said I was being disrespectful and to not talk back and that I needed to leave immediately in a very aggressive tone. I grabbed my stuff, clocked out, and as I went out the door he said that I “needed to change my attitude.” My manager informed me that he wants to write me up for my behavior (she is on my side though.)   
I want to quit this job soon anyways but on my own terms and once I have secured other employment. What kinds of rights do I have in this situation? Can he really write me up for something like this?

"Hello there, 

My company has been doing attendance prizes for random days for the past month. If you clocked in for the day you entered the contest for that particular day of one was happening.

So I recently won a prize at work. I signed a form stating I will not try to return or exchange it at any of my company's stores.

About 2 weeks later I noticed my paycheck was short.
I inquired with our local HR about it.
On Monday because our local HR was not in office, I contacted our corporate HR.
They had told our local HR to do a manual pay request and submit it.
The following day somebody else from HR told me the money was taken out due to tax for the prize I won.

Later on in the week I was pulled aside to speak to our building leader.
He advised me that I would not be getting any money back due to it being in the rules of the contest.
Now mind you at no point did my employer give the employees the rules of the contest including at the time of picking up our prize.

When I asked for a copy they handed me if sheet of paper only for reading and not for taking. I asked if I could have a copy sent to my work email or printed out for me and I was told no.

Eventually I was able to find the template they used on our companies internal SOP. The template is a very basic sweepstakes terms and conditions that allows management to fill in the blink based on the prizes.

What the template said is by entering the contest we agreed to the rules of the contest.

Now my question is because whenever we clocked in we are entering the contest. By the rules of the contest, we are technically agreeing to the rules by clocking in.

Are they able to enforce the rules of a contest they never told participants about?",(GA) Won prize at work for attendance,18ovq7c,1703299315.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18ovq7c/ga_won_prize_at_work_for_attendance/,

I immediately called her up and the firm took up my case. However ever since then, things have been a disaster. It took them 8 months to create the final draft of the charge of discrimination that was then submitted to the EEOC. When I send them emails to ask them questions about my case, they sometimes take a week to reply and after their reply doesn't answer my original question. The final draft was 20 rambling pages detailing experiences at my employer but as the defendant's lawyer correctly pointed out in their rebuttal, there is no actual actual discrimination is listed in those 20 pages. I have sent more incriminating experiences but my lawyer did not include them in the EEOC charge. When I suggested to my lawyer that my EEOC charge should be better, she said ""they're just associates at the EEOC, we don't need to be that detailed"".

I am now more mad and frustrated at my lawyer than I am at my former employer and I would like to take my case to another law firm. But my lawyer says my current bill is $7000 for 14 hours of work which she has expected to be covered by a settlement.

I signed the form months ago. Have continued to ask him to sign. He comes up with excuses or ignores me. Now I’m concerned it’s the end of the year and if we don’t get this form in soon the IRS could change our tax status which would impact the company and me.

"My defender goes back and forth with me. It is frustrating and makes me lose faith in them. One day they say this can work, then all of a sudden it doesn't work. Makes me lose trust in them. Now they said today they are gone and won't be available until my next hearing date. So that's one reason I am coming on here to ask for advice.

I told my defender my family and I and the psychiatrist all decided to not go further with medications because they don't do anything for me and I am completely normal and will never relapse. Upon hearing this, my defender just flips and wants to send me to mental health court, which means I would have to fly across the country because they wouldn't be allowed to appear for me anymore according to what they said. Aren't they supposed to have me evaluated before they make any decision about my competency before sending me to mental health court. My defender is not a doctor, and they even admitted that as well. Why are they being such a hard-ass with me? I don't understand why they don't recommend a doctor or someone to evaluate me. I explained everything I went through with them, but they don't acknowledge it. 

So far, they had a court doctor evaluate me and question me. This made the judge consider me a strong contender for mental health diversion. I spoke to another private attorney about this, and they said there are supposed to be 2 evaluations, 1 for competency, and 1 for how your case relates to your mental condition. I was only given 1 evaluation which seemed like both evaluations at the same time. My defender told me the court doctor thought i was incompetent even though I did well in our session. I know I answered EVERY question about the court, my case, my charges perfectly. despite that, my defender that time never sent me to mental health court and continued appearing for me, which confused me and made me uncomfortable. I don't completely trust my defender. I answered all the competency questions perfectly. I know what everyone's role in the court. I know what charges are on me. Yet, my defender wants to mess me up still and is saying I am going to end up going to mental health court and have to fly over to California, all because I am trying to make the case I am not taking meds, when I explained to them that i do NOT need them. I explained how the psychosis I went through was psychological and a temporary long episode. I made permanent progress and don't relapse/revert back. My defender hung up on me when I was trying to make them understand. 

They are also getting misled by other things that transpired like my mother trying to 5150 me. So my mother was the guardian of my hospital stay from the 5150 hold. In california, they interviewed me so they didn't 5150 me and verified I did not meet the criteria for a 5150, all written down in a document. In Florida where it happened with my misunderstanding mother, they just whisk you away to the hospital and don't listen to anything you say. It was also an ex parte order my mother created with people she conspired with. I even explained this to my defender while I was in the hospital, and now they are acting ike they forgot it. My only recourse is getting a letter from my mother to explain the events and why I shouldn't have been hospitalized by an ex parte order. My defender also said I need to get a letter from a therapist, but they are scaring me into thinking the D.A. will not accept my treatment plan of doing therapy once a week. I want to fight them because they are trying to ruin my life for something non-serious, the premilinary hearing was completely bogus, I got bailed out and proved everything wrong and I am not a dangerous individual.

"Hi, I’m not really sure how to start this. I (19ftm) have been at this job for about 5 months or so, working as a Host and a server. The general manager is my mother, and my only way to get to work because I do not have a license as I don’t have a vehicle. I’m saying this because I cannot leave my job it is my only way of income currently. 

So we got two assistant managers two months ago (or so) and one of our assistant managers, C, has been causing a few problems. She has called out constantly and just hasn’t shown up to work, she complains a lot and brings everyone into her life problems. Recently she has become the only household member bringing in money, and has asked for more hours but still doesn’t come in. Well when she doesn’t come in, my driver/gm/mother A has to stay after so I have to stay after. I’ve worked more due to her so I don’t like her that much but I’ve always been polite to her and helped her with her son in finding binders and such.

Well recently she’s called out so many times that she’s gotten two write ups, both that have had A speaking to her for two hours and explaining why she was written up, twice. Now we all thought she’d call out Sunday but she didn’t. Now after a two hour conversation (around 1 o’clock) C comes out crying and trying to hold it in. I’m polite to her cause while I know what’s going on I’m not going to  by to treat her differently.

This was all Sunday, now Wednesday when I come in for work our big boss J sends an email saying that both me and A got bad reviews. I’m here thinking “okay I know I wasn’t the best but what?” And then I read the review and it’s all complete bullshit, nothing that I can remember happening but that’s just my point of view. Another review says that both me and A were extremely rude around 1. I was cut at 12:30 and didn’t accept more tables. A was in a meeting the entire time, and then another review similar to that. So while I’m working that day (and trying not to have a panic attack) A and B (another assistant manager) look at these reviews and believe that C did them. Work ends, and A tells me what they were thinking, and so I decide to look at the review that attacked me, I copy the name and search C’s friend list and find the exact name and a familiar picture. We have the proof and send it off to the big boss and he says there’s nothing we can do.

I don’t feel safe even working tomorrow, she’s trying to get rid of my only means of stability and my way to pay for college, when A confronted C she actually giggled and said that she can’t control what her friends do. I’m terrified to work tomorrow because what if I get fired over nothing? Is there anything I can do with HR or something? I’m in KY if that’s important.

Part of me is just hurt that C had all these people just misgender me and attack me for no reason. I’m not the reason she’s about to be fired nor have I ever started something.

"My 15 year old is one of the victims of a pending lewd/lascivious battery case. We live near an Air Force base and I had heard that the perpetrator was arrested on base, so I suspected he was active duty. However this has not officially been confirmed. 

Yesterday I received an email from my child’s vice principal stating that she had been contacted by a federal agent with the Air Force office of special investigations (OSI) trying to reach me “in regards to a current case pertaining to” my child. VP stated that she obviously couldn’t give out my or my child’s information, but could pass the agent’s info on to me, which she did. 

I emailed the agent stating:

“I received an email from my child’s school principal stating that you had contacted her trying to make contact with my child (name). I wanted to go ahead and reach out to you to see what this is regarding. 

While e-mail is preferred, I can also be reached via phone at **********.

I’m not sure if I need to disclose this or not, but my younger child and I are currently USAF dependents pending my divorce. (15yo), however, is not a dependent as I adopted them as a single-parent adoption. 

Thanks.”

Today I received a response thanking me for reaching out and stating “I would prefer to talk on the phone due to the sensitivity of the matter.” And giving me her duty cell number. 


Here’s the thing. I know that it is a sensitive matter, and I’m sure that her emails can probably be reviewed under FOIA or something. However I tend to be a little bit paranoid (due to being raised by a diagnosed narcissist whose favorite technique was gaslighting) about my words being twisted and I prefer to have things in writing for that very reason. Additionally, my youngest (5) is home schooled so I never really have an opportunity to have that type of conversation verbally. 

I also find it weird that this agent reached out through my child’s school. I have no idea how she knew which school my child attended, and I think it would have been more appropriate to reach out through the victims advocate or ADA?

Anyway. Do I HAVE to oblige this request to speak over the phone? Am I within my rights to insist on written communication? Would insisting on that written communication have the potential to cause harm to my child?

With being a dependent and what I know about OSI, I feel like this pretty well confirms that the perpetrator is active duty.

"TL;DR

* Moved out of an apartment in Seattle on Sept 2021
* Apartment accidentally charged me extra rent
* We called in a few times to get it removed, said “it would be done”
* It just recently got sent to collections and now it’s on our credit report. Called collections and asked for debt validation, very not helpful
* Not sure what to do at this point to get it off. I feel “bullied” to just pay off the extra rent

&amp;#x200B;

Rented an apartment in Seattle and moved out Sept 2021. The apartment building charged me extra rent because it was automated billing and I guess they forgot to terminate it on a certain day.

No biggie I thought.

Started getting emails about a past due balance. Called in 3 times, apartment kept saying “we’ll get it fixed”. Unfortunately I didn’t get written documentation.

Never got fixed. Went to collections.

Collections is a giant pain. I gave them proof and they’re trying to do everything to get me to pay. For example, I sent an email notice to move out in 2021 and the apartment building acknowledged via email. But collections is like “We need to see a written, signed letter. Email doesn’t work, even though apartment acknowledged”. Insanely frustrating. They see all the evidence, they just choose to nitpick every small thing to try to get us to pay.

Tried calling the apartment. They said “its out of our hands now, go talk to collections”.

Asked for debt validation. They showed us the apartment's ledger. Ledger is correct except for extra charge. We have proof that we moved out before that. But debt collectors won't accept our proof and is still demanding full payment. How do we even get them to ""accept"" our proof?!

It’s affecting our credit and we got notification the collections notified the credit agencies. At this point, it feels like our only option is to pay the extra rent and get this taken off since all the nitpick evidence is hard to get but that would suck (and unfair).

"I'm hoping this is the right place to ask, I'm just trying to gather some information about where the law stands on zero hours contracts cancelling shifts late notice.

I work in a gastro pub in the UK, and I have found it very difficult to get the kind of hours I was verbally promised at my interview, even through the Christmas season. There have been many occasions that shifts have been cancelled minutes before they are due to start, and this has caused at least 3 staff members to leave in the 3 months I've worked there. It is also very common for my shifts to be ended early, and I am told to go home an hour or 2 before I'm due to finis. 

What worries me the most is a recent event, where I arrived at work ready for a 6 hour shift, only to be sent home an hour later. 2 hours later I was asked to come back into work, and an hour after I arrived back I was again sent home. This seems to me to be pushing the boundaries of what 'short notice cancellation' entails, and many managers agree. The pub actually has a member of staff who sits in an office and watches the bar staff via CCTV, observing who is busy and who is not. If somebody has a few seconds where they're not working or they're simply waiting for customers to arrive, this 'big brother' kind of figure will demand that induction to be sent home.

   This is in Washington state in Snohomish county. Our parenting plan states ""The picking up parent - The parent who is about to start parenting time with the children must arrange to have the children picked up."" It also says ""Pickup location: As decided"". I was never happy with our decided upon location but my ex threw a huge fit so I gave in and we decided to meet half way(ish) when exchanging the kids. This wouldn't be a big deal to me if we didn't live 2+ hours apart. I told her I would like to follow the parenting plan and have the picking up parent come get the kids at or near the others house. She told me if I wasn't at our previously decided upon location she would get an emergency order forcing me to bring the kids to her because it was previously decided upon. So, Im wondering, are changes in writing but not on the actual plan mandatory? Things are getting heated (with much more than this) and I would very much like to more closely follow the official plan but Im afraid she would take me to court and I would end up needing to pay for her legal costs.

   If I am required to continue with the previously decided location, how can I get this fixed at this point? Do I need to pay for arbitration or take her to court? This is only one example of this ""decided upon"" language she is threatening legal action over.

"I am a Southern California homeowner who had a solar panel installation completed a year ago. I am seeking some general advice regarding the performance of the system and potential legal avenues.  
I entered into a contract with the solar installer in August 2022, specifying a system that was supposed to generate 15,060 kWh of electricity annually. The installation was completed in December 2022. However, after a full year of operation, it has become apparent that the system is not producing anywhere near the expected amount of power.  
I specified the 15,060 kWh to the sales agent (who is also my roofing contractor) and he sent it to the owner of a one-man solar installation company for the price quote. I agreed to their price based on the expected production estimate. The installation agreement outlined the system's capacity, but I noticed a discrepancy with the equipment provided upon completion. Despite expressing my concerns to the installer, the issue was dismissed, and the system's performance has fallen significantly short, producing only 6,800 kWh in the first year. That's less than half what I had expected. As a result, I incurred unexpected fees of approximately $1,500 from my electric utility company.  
I paid $27,000 for the installation and am considering legal action to address the performance shortfall, either through an upgrade to the system or a refund. I have documentation, including text messages, supporting my concerns.  
I would appreciate any general insights or advice from the community on whether I may have a valid legal case and potential courses of action.

"Hey there,

I wanted to share my recent experience and seek some advice on behalf of my ex-boyfriend. Last night, we had a heated argument that resulted in some physical marks on both him and me. In an effort to deescalate the situation, I decided to call the local police department. However, to my surprise, they had probable cause to arrest him on suspicion of domestic violence. They did not check him for scratches, bruises or marks, but saw mine and made their case.

Fast forward to today, I received a call from the prosecutor handling the case. To protect my boyfriend's future career and job prospects, I decided not to press charges. As a result, he was released from jail this afternoon. It's important to note that he has not been officially charged with a crime, but the arrest itself might have repercussions for his future endeavors.

In my quest to rectify the situation, I reached out to my local police department for guidance. They mentioned that it is possible to have an arrest removed from his record. They advised me to contact the arresting officer and request that they include additional information in the arrest report that would reflect positively on my ex-boyfriend's character. After that, they suggested getting into contact with the state police to solve the issue. Unfortunately, due to the holidays, I won't be able to reach out until Tuesday.

Now, here's where I need advice. Has anyone been through a similar situation? What steps did you take to help clear your partner's (or your own) record? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated.

I experienced a hit-n-run some months back around 1am at night. I was patiently waiting in the left lane at a red light when a Ford pickup side-swept my entire right side, leaving my bumper hanging and my right mirror completely gone. In a moment of quick thinking, I turned my wheel to the right and slammed on the gas to catch up to the evading driver while honking my horn, which only made him speed up. I managed to pull my phone out and capture a live photo of the license plate.

Subsequently, I reported the incident to the police. I  waited in my car for approx 25 minutes before reaching out to their non-emergency line for an update. Much to my surprise, I was informed that nobody had been dispatched. Determined, I used the GPS to find the nearest police station and headed over there. Upon making a report, they informed me that someone from their detective unit would follow up with me. Yet again, to my surprise, no follow-up occurred. Frustrated by the lack of progress, I contacted the police after a week for an update. The officer mentioned they weren't able to get in contact with dude and that his car doesn't have insurance. 

I questioned their method of contact— do they pull up to their house, call them, etc.? The officer shared that they typically send a letter to the house and if they don't get a response there's not much they can do from there. In their unseriousness, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I requested he give me the person's info, hoping for a name and contact. He provided me with far more than I needed-- name, address, dob, etc. I did a google search of his name and found that he had quite a compilation of records under his belt, including a DWI.

I refrained from informing my insurance about the situation to avoid any possible increase. Upon receiving an estimate for my car’s damages, I took proactive measures by crafting a letter and personally delivering it to both addresses that were on his file, amounting to a 1.5 hour total drive. I included my father’s contact info in the letter since he didn't want me dealing with the guy directly. The letter basically said pay for the damages or we going to court and I’m filing criminal charges, which was quite nice and compromising of me considering the act he committed is an automatic felony. He ended up reaching out to my dad, initially denying culpability but eventually admitting fault and my dad allowed him to do a payment plan since he couldn’t pay all at once. He only ended up making the first payment of $750 before disappearing (estimate I gave him was around 2k). Opting for a more cost-effective solution, I had my car repaired at a budget-friendly body shop for a fraction of the cost. Questioning my dad about the outstanding balance, his advice was to let it go, emphasizing the potential futility of legal action given the individual's assumed lack of substantial assets and insurance. I didn’t want to let it go. I went on a high-speed chase, basically worked for free as a UPS delivery driver, and now have mad anxiety every time I drive in the city. My father discouraged my idea of taking the issue to court, deeming it a potentially wasteful expense. 

Apologies for the lengthy message 😅 Do yall think I should let it go and let him be a free criminal on the streets, or should I pursue legal action and press charges? I am unfamiliar with this process and hesitant to invest in a lawyer without assurance of substantial returns. Any insights from those with experience would be highly appreciated.

"Hello Reddit community,  
I'm facing a challenging situation with a recent car purchase attempt and could use some advice. The process involved a third-party car website and an out-of-state dealership, leading to several complications:  
\* **Initial Process:** I found a car I liked on a third-party car website and went through their process. I was actually approved for a loan through this website, not just pre-approved, and this approval (with one credit inquiry) was sent to the dealership.  
\* **Dealership Interaction:** The dealership in another state confirmed my order and asked for my paystubs for verification and asked me to provide insurance on the vehicle.  
\* **Communication Breakdown:** After providing my paystubs, communication with the dealership became sparse. I reached out to the third-party website for assistance. They provided the dealership's contact info and confirmed that the purchase should proceed through them.  
\* **Loan Processing and Delay:** Contacting the dealership, I was informed about slow loan processing times. The financing company told me they were waiting for a contract from the dealership and needed to conduct an welcome interview with me.  
\* **Original Car No Longer Available:** After my credit was already impacted and I had bought new auto insurance, the dealership revealed that the car I was approved for had unfixable issues and wouldn't be sold (So why was the car on the lot / posted online for sale?). I was told to find another car in the same price range and they will just swap out the VIN and send the contact to my finance company.   
\* **Unauthorized Credit Inquiries:** My credit report shows several inquiries from different banks, made without my permission. The dealership appears to have run a credit application without my consent.  
\* **New Deal and Its Problems:** The dealership offered a new deal as a remedy, but it involved a different contract, a shorter loan term, and an extra down payment.  
\* **Current Challenges:** I’m now trying to get a refund from my auto insurance company, as I never completed the car purchase. The multiple unauthorized credit inquiries have affected my credit score and could complicate any future car purchases from other dealerships.  
I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation, particularly the unauthorized credit inquiries and the dealership's misleading actions. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What steps can I take to address these issues? Lawyer, mediation, etc?  
Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

"I am located in Utah USA, and was recently in a car accident. I was traveling straight through an intersection on a green light, when a car made a left-hand turn in front of me (also on a green light, but not a protected left). I slammed on my brakes but was unable to stop in time. No one was injured. At the time of impact I was likely traveling between 10-20 mph as my car was not totaled. Estimated repair cost is $3500. Point of impact on my car was passenger side front, and point of impact on their vehicle was passenger side by the back wheel.

I filed a claim with their insurance company, and got it back today as their driver being 90% liable and me as 10% liable. 

They stated that ""the point of impact on both vehicles indicates the there should have been enough time to slow down as stated in the recording. The damages to the other parties vehicle are at the tail end of the vehicle, which indicates, we failed to maintain a proper look out and attempt to take evasive action at the last min.""

I did state in the recording that I did not swerve and was unsure if there was someone in my blind spot (there were two lanes on my side of the road and I was in the rightmost) so it may have been possible to swerve out of the way by swerving into the left-hand lane had I had time to think about it enough to make that decision and if I was sure there wasn't someone in my blind spot.

I was traveling 40-45 mph in a 45 mph speed zone. I also stated that although I saw their car from a distance, they were just another car on the road until they started to turn in front of me at which point I immediately slammed on my brakes.

I guess my question is, does this seem accurate/fair? I am aware that there is a last clear chance doctrine, but the other driver failed to yield to oncoming traffic, and I did brake as soon as possible.

 I don't see how impact point proves anything about how quickly I braked after seeing them start their turn, and it seems ridiculous to expect someone to always be aware of what's in their blind spot in case they have to swerve, as well as make that split-second decision.

Once again, reiterating, I did not swerve, but I did brake as much as possible but was unable to avoid the accident that way.

"Located in Northern California. My bathroom light has a fan with a vent attached to it up in the ceiling because our bathrooms have no windows. Little context, the fans are very old. Ive lived there for 10+ years and can’t remember a time they were ever replaced or cleaned. One late night after my shower i kept my bathroom light was on while i ran around the house (therefore the annoying fan was also on). While downstairs, the fire alarm went off which i assumed was just the batteries going bad. As i walk upstairs i see black smoke and ash coming from my room!! I look inside and see flames coming from the ceiling where the vent of the fan is!! The fire department comes, puts the fire out, and tells us the fire was a result of a short in the circuit of the fan. The majority of the damage is my bathroom, it’s completely unusable and my bed, clothes, etc in my room is covered in soot and ash from the fire. 

My mom and i spend that night at our house because we cant just pick up our lives and go to a hotel. We slept downstairs in the living room with all the windows open to try and help the smell of electrical fire that is strong upstairs. When my landlords wake up they let us know that they will go through their insurance to get everything repaired and they waive a month’s worth of rent and will cover the costs of a Hotel. The next day, the smell is lingering throughout the house so we go to a hotel. We come home after 2 days. 

It is now 5 days after it happened and a fire inspector (im assuming through their insurance) comes to investigate and take pictures. I talk to him for a little bit and he’s very nice and tells me that these older fans are notorious for catching on fire and that the newer ones have a safety mechanism to stop them from catching on fire. The landlords and owners of the property thought my mom and i were still in a hotel so they thought no one would be home. I’m home and long story short, i hear the building manager/owner (i have no idea what his title is because I’ve never met or seen him before in my life) LYING to the fire investigator telling him that the tenants (which would be me) left the light on 24/7 and that caused the fire (NOT TRUE WHY WOULD I LEAVE A LIGHT ON 24/7 WHEN I PAY PG&amp;E). I also hear him tell the fire investigator that the fans are cleaned ever year and they are replaced regularly (NOT TRUE). The owner realizes im standing behind him when the fire investigator asks when is the last time the fan has been replaced. The owner responds with “im not sure” and looks at me to answer so I say, “they’ve never been replaced”. The owner does not look very happy with my answer.

 I ask the owner if insurance will take care of my clothes that are now covered in soot after i just did laundry and my big bed frame that is entirely made out of velvet and covered in soot. The owner tells me they will cover the costs for me to wash my clothes in the coin operated washers and dryers, the fire investigator butts in and says thats not going to help (apparently soot isnt so easy to remove and clean). 

Also a random detail but the only other shower in our apartment in my moms room isnt functional due to drain damage from the fire. After not being so happy with my honesty with the fire investigator, the landlord calls my mom at work to let her know the apartment is not safe to stay in (the fire investigator did not say that) and that we need to go to a hotel and they will cover the costs but we need to sign something first.

I didn’t understand the severity of eviction and didn’t realize that it would end up on my records. I did not attend the eviction hearing because like I mentioned, I was out of the country, and they did not notify me of it because I was “not party to it”. Stupidly, I accidentally missed the Zoom court date for the damages hearing and so did the subleasee, so there was a default judgement. No one was actually evicted at all, but there was an agreement that the subleasee would have to move out. I had to pay $1,300 in damages and paid this immediately. The effect of all of this is that an eviction shows up on my record, and I’ve been denied several apartments because of this. Is there anything I can do?

Okay, I know this sub is really insensitive to people with mental health problems and doesn't care when people make mistakes and likes to rub it in and morally grandstand, but please, seriously, save it for someone who deserves it. I'm not hurting anyone and had I had actual parents, and actually been raised, I would not be here asking for help. and I am taking responsibility, I am not saying this is not my fault. I did it but it still shouldn't have been able to have happened in the first place.

So when I was 15/16 my mom got on disability and got a lump sum for being a doctor for 15-20 years and having to retire due to migraines + other stuff. She either k1lled herself or OD'd in front of me when I was 16. After that my dad let a girl who had graduated HS and was over 18 and was very obviously a.busive, controlling and a predator move in and he left me there with her and my more a.busive brother and a credit card with a $20k limit.

After our mom died we got like $900k in a one time lump sum and I had $20k or so in savings and I just wasn't thinking. You have to understand the mind of a person who is dealing with all this and on top of that, doesn't have parents around and was not taught financial literacy. or anything adult or skill related at all really, including how to drive a car or apply for jobs/college/etc. so I wouldn't spend like thousands a month , but would on shit I shouldn't have and shit for the girl. Like $70 make up pallets. It was ridiculous.

At the age of 20 I developed severe schizophrenia and alcohol/drug a.ddiction and at this point was clearly in mania and psychosis and straight up should have been sat down and given an intervention and hospitalized. I tried to talk to him about everything and how the nazis were coming to take me on the ship with the aliens, how I was seeing dead people skinned alive talking to me, etc. and not only did he not care, HE LEFT ME WITH THE CREDIT CARD AND $20K CAR.

To tell you how extreme this got, one time I had a near fatal OD where I stopped breathing and instead of taking me to the hospital, he just sat next to me and as soon as I could walk, gave me the car keys and left, without asking anything, and seemingly annoyed. Peachy 😊

So of course I continued spending on stupid shit, being fully blown delusional and paranoid with COVID started, and then the next year totaled the car in a DUI where I was on 3 different drugs and was going to a place that it turned out didn't exist in real life to see a person that didn't exist either.

Look, I know this is my fault and I did a lot of stupid shit, but if I were a parent in this situation I would remove the girl from the home, remove the credit card from the child, take away the car keys, and get them hospitalized/help and actually be home and not out with girls 3 months after my kids' mom just died.

This situation was completely and entirely preventable and it never should have gotten to this.

I'm 24 years old now and on SSDI for schizophrenia/bipolar etc. and haven't been working or in school since my psychotic break. My dad is now in SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS of credit card debt over 12, *12* credit cards. I only used one with a max of $20k, but I don't know in the years between ages 16 and 21 how much has been paid off and let boil up to the top again. I have no understanding of how you can let yourself get in $70k of CC debt, this is something that I feel most people would immediately put a stop to and try to remedy at like $20k at an absolute extreme max.

Turns out he wasn't even looking at statements and over the past 10 years racked up $1k on a Spotify account that wasn't being used at all, and that's part of all of this. :)

I'm just trying to figure out what I can do here, like if I can call the CC company and have debt transfered to me or something? Because at this point he is talking about selling the house and I don't know if I will be able to survive that, literally.

And that lump sump is probably at less than half of what it was, and it was supposed to last me and my brother our lifetimes. Not once, once, ever, did he sit us down and explain to us how these things work, take us to a bank/financial advisor, etc. he just gave us credit cards and fucked off. Turns out he had spent $1k in a single month sending money to women and that's just one example of his financial incompetence.

I would love any advice because I have panic attacks every morning when I wake up and realize I'm 24 years old and in severe debt already. Also, no, I am not spoiled. If you don't teach your kid how to drive a single time, give them keys to your dead wife's $20k car and allow them to drive when they're drunk/high/overdosed every day and telling you they think they're talking to Hitler and dead people, it's not spoiling your child, it's being extremely neglectful.

also my dad must have taken.. I don't know, I stopped counting at $10k of my money in my accounts without even mentioning it, so there's that to be put into account

My child (9M) was choked on the playground by another student (10M). Other students had to pull the boy of off my son. My son had no visible marks but was shaken up by this. The school didn’t call me and I only found out when my son got home. The kids told their teachers and nothing was done so I went to the principal. I was told it would be handled. The boy got 1 day of sitting in the office and that was it. I don’t feel the school handled this properly at all. I also went to the local PD and filed a complaint so that it was on file in case anything else happened in school or out of school. I was then told they would take the report but even if it happened again nothing could be done because he’s 10 and doesn’t know what he was doing and was probably just amped up playing football.

"Sister died. BF with daughter lives there. That's great, no problems with that.

Late sister owned house outright.  There was no estate planning and we can't afford probate to straighten everything out. Honestly, we will probably get to it in a few years since we have other time sinks and financial obligations.  We don't have $5k - $10k for an attorney right now.

Ideally the property would go to parents with permission from them to let BF raise daughter there but for him to pay taxes and upkeep. This is in PA.

My questions is:

Who is on the hook if there is an injury on the property?  There is no insurance on it and I don't think I can insure property for an incomplete estate of a dead person.

"Sorry, but this will be a long one. if you have time, it's worth it

  
So i was contacted on whatsapp by a random number some night, saying they're from a phantom company, yatta yatta. If i want to make a quick buck, just reply with my age and email. all i needed to do was to like a TikTok video every 30 minutes or so, and get some money for that. being bored, i wanted to see how far can they take this scam and what it involves. so there i created a new Gmail address, subscribed to 3-4 newsletters to make the inbox look legit, gave the girl a fake age of 24, and the email. Then we continued the conversation on telegram.

  
Once i added her on telegram, she added me to a group with lots of other people, and a few admins. They were posting screenshots of ""received salaries"", and a tiktok link every 30 minutes. All i needed to do was to like the video, take a screenshot and send it to this girl. I had nothing better to do, so i set a timer to go off every 30 minutes, liked a few videos, and at the end of the day (around 8), she asked for an account number to wire me the money. I had a spare bank account with almost nothing in it (not even a pack of gum's worth), and just gave her the number.  
To my surprise, money actually got into my account, all the links were clean, no email or bank details were stolen. Hell yeah!

  
Mind you they were all very professional in their work. always talked nicely, never rushed me, never demanded my own money, never requested access to my bank or anything like that.  
I continued to do this the next day, starting at 8 in the morning. At noon i made about 80 in total. They told me to wire the 80 i made to an account, they gave me a link, and said to make an account there. It was a website made to look like a trading/investing app. It looked horrible, very scooby-doo like. I used my fake email and a random password i will never remember. In that account appeared a balance of 80. They instructed me to invest in BTC, leave it for 180 seconds, and withdraw. And so i did. Surprisingly, at the end of all that i made almost 150. Some more investing took place throughout the day (i did not put any of my money, just the money from them), and made about 350 in total. Pulled the money into my personal, ""safe"" account, and started fresh.

&amp;#x200B;

The third day, the girl i was ""working"" with, transferred me to another girl, saying i could no longer work TikTok, but they have a better offer, kind of like a promotion. I needed to handle transactions. at this point i was balls deep into this scheme, so i just went with it. Being a broke ass student, i needed the money. So all kinds of people were transferring money into my bank account, and i needed to transfer it forward to a dude (not giving names). It was all fine. at the end of the day they gave me my ""salary"". FREAKING 500!

  
At this point, i made enough for about a month, and i kinda wanted to stop. But my dumb mind wanted to see if this could go any further. A week later, now in the present, i got promoted again. They made me register on Binance, and give them access to my Binance account so they can supervise. They give me money (huge sums between 1K and 5K), tell me to invest in USDT, and they withdraw it when they want to their accounts. At the end they give me a comission. Now i'm making like 1,5K per day.

  
Now i'm scared. This is a lot of unregistered, potentially dangerous and surely illegal and undeclared money. It went from beer money to making my monthly allowance in a day. They want me to open a new bank account, to another bank to not raise suspicion (i think I'm stopping here). They are smart, but they are smart until the first slip. I'm scared that my banks will notice some of this shit and ask a few questions. Should i continue to work for 3-4 more days and ghost them? I want to make some money, but this is WAY too much. I'm completely happy with 50 a day, 2K a day is overkill. You guys got some advice? Could i maybe continue this ""safely""?","Caught up in a scheme. Made money, wanna bail.

"Hi, my husband and I are trying to help a friend with setting up doctor appointments, paying medical bills, and reviewing medical history to help with future decisions. Our friend is capable of answering questions and doing some of the tasks needed, but recently had a stroke and needs support. We usually pick him up and have him give verbal consent for us to participate, but we are looking for a form or document that would allow us to do this on his behalf. He is fully in support of this so we can schedule doctor’s visits, follow up on his pending disability and SSI claim, and be given information in the event of another hospital visit where decisions need to be made.

I know we can get a medical proxy and/or POA for cases where he is incapacitated, but is there a legal form that would also allow us to do things like make calls to local primary care physicians and specialists to find out who would take his insurance and schedule appointments on his behalf? Ideally we would also be able to ask questions and talk about his treatment plan with the doctor to help ensure he’s following his care plan. Does a form like this exist? 

For context: we can’t afford a lawyer to help because our friend is out of work and we’re doing what we can to help ensure his rent and other bills are paid while we wait the 3-6 months for social security and disability benefits to make a decision and start paying those bills.

Every month, we’d get delinquency letters stating if our rent was not paid within the month, we’d be evicted. I’ve had to scramble to borrow money to meet this date, and she’s always paid me back eventually.

I made a deal with our landlord, and I they let me pay down my agreed upon half without her. However, now there is still a couple thousand left on our ledger.

I finally called them and they told me I either had to pay the amount or submit a dispute through their website.  The person on the phone told me I have to submit to them pictures of my license plate and a copy of my vehicle registration to even start the dispute.

I spoke with Risk and HR, Risk says that it is complicated since it is off work, but since work aggravated my pain I could qualify for workers comp, the thing is, I spoke with HR and they said that what Risk said it is not true, since I was off the clock when I got injured, but again it got worse for performing work. I work in California in retail and I believe this is important to let you guys know since different states have different laws. I can’t work, HR told me if I would work today and I said no since my doctor told me I have to rest (showed them doctors note) they said they will support me with accommodations as stated by the doctor but even after they read the note they said that if I would work today and I said no and they said ok, and that I would not be penalized for calling out since they got a doctors note, but again now I have no sick time, can’t work and I’m injured, what can I do, I’m so stressed about this.",Injured myself at work site,18or5gd,1703285413.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18or5gd/injured_myself_at_work_site/,

"Today I (30F) was served at my place of work by two officers who let me know that my ex (29M) had filed a petition to obtain a PFA against me. In his petition he recounts a few separate incidents that he claims took place during the course of our four year relationship. These incidents include me allegedly throwing a wine glass on the floor and it breaking, me breaking a television, and he also claims that I said I was going to bring back sexual partners to our home and “force” him to listen to our encounters. I’d like to be clear that during our time together we both have never caused physical harm to one another, so this order of protection was a hurtful surprise to say the least. During this breakup we both have said nasty things because hurt feelings are clearly there. I’m not worried about the protection order going into effect because again,  I have never physical threatened him with violence and since our breakup which took place back in the summer, we both have been living in the home that we share. I’d also like to note that I am not originally from the area. I have no family to run to, but our home is 15 minutes away from his parents whom he has a great relationship with. So if he truly felt like he was in danger there is a solution there for him. We own a home together and it’s clear that this is a tactic to get a “leg up” on the impending battle that will take place over the shared space. Both of our names are on the deed of the home so legally this is the only way he could force me out. I let him know that I would be happy to leave the residence once I am paid half of the homes value since this is shared property.

"To try to summmarize, my husband is half Korean and half Japanese. His birth mom is korean and birth dad Japanese. My husband lived in Japan with his biological parents until he was 5, when he and his sister (3) were adopted by their moms sister and her husband in America because their birth father was abusive and didn’t want to work, their mom COULDNT work because she isn’t Japanese, and they were so poor that they often could not afford to eat. My husband and sister in law adjusted well to living in America and grew up calling their aunt and uncle mom and dad. They have never known their birth father, but keep in touchh with their birth mother though now referring to her as their aunt. Their birth mom and adopted mom (sisters) are extremely close.

My husband’s birth mom would often come to visit her family in America every few years. About ten years ago, she was here visiting and Japan was hit by a big tsunami. Because of this, she over stayed her travel visa (not sure by how long) and had it taken away opined return to japan. She has not been back since.

My oldest sister in law went to japan in October to try to help her aunt get her visa back. She’s still there, and they had an appointment with immigration. Immigration was apparently very judgmental against this single Korean woman living in Japan, and they told her they thought if she was allowed to travel to America, she would never return to japan, and because of that, Japanese immigration told her she would NEVER be allowed back out of Japan, I think the only exception would be marriage.

I don’t know much about immigration, but that doesn’t sound right. She has tonssss of family in America who are offering for her to live with them. Her 3 children are here, and she now has 2 grandchildren and another on the way that she has never met, and never WILL meet unless we go to japan.

What my husband want to know is if she would be allowed here if we could “sponsor” her in some way? Apparently my husband’s adoptive parents and their oldest sons family were all “rejected” despite having good incomes and stable homes.

"I have a few questionsr regarding a trust. I understand I need to get a lawyer that specializes in trust/ will/estate to help. I've reached out to some but most do not do free consultations and am waiting to hear back from the ones that do. Any help is appreciated.

Property is under a trust with a couple beneficiaries...Located in California.

  
1.  Who can view a trust?  
2. Can additional members be added to an existing trust?  
3. Is a lawyer required to notify all beneficiaries when a trust is distributed? If so, how many days do they have to contact them?  
4. Can a lawyer refuse to show beneficiaries the trust documents?  
5. Is a lawyer required to give copies of the trust to the owner and beneficiaries of the trust?  
6. Can a beneficiary be dropped from the trust? (Being voted out by other beneficiaries, whether voluntary or involuntary).  
7. Can trust terms be modified? (By the beneficiaries)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How big of a screw up if the trust lawyer do not contact the beneficiaries after the individual has passed away?

"I will be skewing/leaving out minor details (count of children, etc...) bc the ex could be looking. I am writing on behalf of this person who needs help/advice.  

I currently do not have child custody due to life endangering events from my ex. My ex-has filed that against me during our long drawn out divorce, and I went through a long series of events mandated by my ex to the courts to get to this point. He has contacted my friends, exes, current partners, family members of friends, etc... all to get me kicked out of my house, fired from work, and loose everyone I love and love me. Issue is, everything is phone call and he won't take calls if recorded or any paper trail. No one wants to say anything and deal with his after-math harassment. 

It has been years since seeing my kids. He is movie horror narci.. has a strong personality about himself...

The court has finally approved reunification therapy, and so I pay the therapist down payment and wait for the ex to make appointment... weeks go by, nothing. We go through court and the judge tells him he must make appointment. weeks go by, the day before court appearance, the therapist called me saying ex says he will go after her until her career is ruined. Therapist backs out for undisclosed reasons.   


Judge appoints new therapist. The same thing just happened. Another court appearance bc he is delaying and the judge mandates scheduling a therapy session by a certain date. Now the new therapist has just confirmed she is backing out bc she cannot deal with the ex.   


If you believe I may be favoring everything towards me, just assume I am not, and I left out horrific details about this man. I do not want to write a novel and give details about who I/we are...

He is keeping my children from me... What do I do? Anything would be amazing.

"Background info: I live in Orange County, CA. I'm a grad student that lives an hour away from home during the weekdays, but comeback home to work on both Saturday and Sunday. I live with my parents, but one of them works that day and the other can't drive.

I set up a Saturday appointment for a windshield replacement at Safelite 9am. I dropped off my car at the place when it opened (9am). I was told the job would take 2-3 hours, and that they would call me when it was done. Afterwards, my boyfriend dropped me off at work at 10am, but still hadn't received a call from them when I go off of work at 2pm. 

I decided to wait till they called me to show up, it was around 4:15pm when I get a text message saying they just started working on my car. Which was strange since I dropped it off so early in the day. I panicked a little because the places closes at 5pm and needed my car for work tomorrow. I tried calling them, but no one answered so I had my boyfriend bring me to safelite at 4:40pm. 

There was no one initial in the front office, so we waited till someone showed up and told them that we got a message the it was being worked up. They were wondering why we showed up when it wasn't finished, but we told them that we thought they close at 5pm and needed to get our car back before they close. He then told us they stay later to finish cars after they ""close"" and our car would be ready in an hour. So we left to get dinner, and finally got a call saying the car was done at 6pm. We showed up at the place, with no one in-front again. When someone came, we told them about our car. They said they were just taking the car around to test the car sensor in the windshield and it will be right out. 

40 minutes later, we're still waiting. When someone finally comes and tells us that they can't calibrate the sensor in the windshield. So we will need to bring it back another day to calibrate. That they were going to replace the windshield that was just installed because it was defective. That they didn't have their car sensor guy in today, but he'll be here the next time we show up. That the next appointment available was Thursday, and that all the weekend dates weren't available for the next two weeks. We would have to pay for the windshield services today or they wouldn't be able to give the car back to us and it wouldn't be under warranty if we didn't. I asked them I we could pay after we get our windshield replaced correctly. They had to call the manager to approve of this and that they would contact us with steps moving forward. 

Since then have just randomly scheduled me on weekdays, without my consent to those dates. I've just been pushing back the services dates for a couple of months because I'm in school and work on the weekend still. 

Winter break is here now so I actually have time to get it done. 

what should I do? I don't want to take my car back to them, since they basically wasted my whole day waiting for a car that wasn't finished. I would rather take my car somewhere else, but I don't know if they can hold me accountable for this bill. They recently threatened me with taking the bill to collections.

My sibling and I would be considered the heirs of the property (no living spouse), but after looking at the information on the NY Courts website, I'm looking for a little guidance to make sure I'm doing this all correctly. 

We have to go to the surrogate Court and file for administration (it looks like e-filing is also an option). We would be attempting to represent ourselves, unless we absolutely cannot navigate this entire thing. 

My questions are basically:
1. Is the ""petition for letters of administration"" the correct form I should be looking at? And if so, there are 18 pages and it looks like some of the pages are for different types of situations. I believe I would fill up to page five, pages 6 through 9 do not apply, page 10 looks like it would be a response the court fills out? And anything after that I'm just lost. 

2. How long does the process take after submission?

3. What are the usual steps or hurdles that come along with all of this? 

4. Would we be better off hiring somebody? I would estimate her estate is worth under $150k. Can anyone give me a ballpark figure an estate attorney might charge? And would I be able to add the cost of the attorney as a debt on the administration form?

Im a travel nanny in California who had a contract to work for a family for 10 weeks. The single mom was to go back to work after several years off. In the interview process I explained I was concerned that the position she was offering was “unstable” and I had reservations about quitting my VERY stable position and she said she would “guarantee pay” me for the 10 weeks NO MATTER what happens. I wasnt sure her career would take off as she had taken a few years off (as a model). 

So I wrote up a contract where we both came up with the terms together. I was to be available to travel at the drop of a hat and she estimated we would be traveling 2-3 weeks a month. I was to be paid $6000/month no matter how much or how little we traveled. After the first 2 weeks her agent wasnt booking jobs and we had a conversation that travel was looking unlikely but that she would still hold her her side of the contract as would I, I would go stay at her house and watch the kid 2 days a week and still be available for travel— we did you 1 big out of country trip. I worked 2 weeks in Dec and reminded her that my next visit would be pay day (she had almost missed a pay day last month and tried to tell me she didnt have the money but ended up getting it somehow and I was paid on time). She then calls me and tells me she does not have the funds to pay me for the entire month of Dec ($6000) and thats the end of our working relationship. In our contract it states that I would be paid through Dec 31 not matter what. Contract states:

The nanny will be paid a salary of $6000 per month. The family guarantees to offer the nanny a minimum of $15,000 with potential bonuses depending on workload. If the family chooses not to use the nanny’s services for the guaranteed timeframe between October 17, 2023 and December 31, 2023 within the nanny’s typical schedule for any reason, the nanny will still be paid in full.

Also states:

If the nanny is terminated for cause* (excluding reasons listed above), the family will provide the nanny 4 weeks  written notice or pay wages in lieu of unserved notice.  All accrued and unused paid time off will be lost unless that time is legally required to be paid out.
If the nanny is terminated for any other reason, the family will provide the nanny 4 weeks written notice or pay wages in lieu of unserved notice.

What is my legal recourse here? I was to start being on payroll after 2 months which never happened so this was under the table. Im thinking I will have to take her to small claims court but will this get ME in legal trouble if so? Do I have a case? I emailed her saying I need to be paid the $3000 for the half of the month I DID work. She tried calling me but I declined and texted saying all future communication needs to be over email or text. She emailed days later saying she doesnt have the money. I even offered her to make payments. I feel I cant go to the Labor Board because that will get me in some kind of trouble too? I dont know if this is relevant at all but she has a green card (been in the US for over 15 yrs).

"Throw-away for reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently had a house fire. It wasn't a total loss, but substantial enough that the entire house needed to be gutted down to the studs. Insurance is covering the cost to restore the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Had several bids for the restoration. Chose a company that reviewed well and was recommended to me. They agreed to do it for the insurance estimated amount of $275,000. They sent me the contract with the payment schedule. In there, I saw that it was referencing a proposal document. I asked for that document. They provided it and it listed out the scope of work. It  had a line item that said everything in the insurance estimate was in scope, and detailed out electrical, plumbing, flooring, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I signed the proposal. I then stated for me to sign the contract to agree to work on my house, I had a few stipulations: no out of pocket costs, anything that wasn't in the insurance estimate would be approved by insurance prior to work being done. They agreed, said there shouldn't be any out-of-pocket costs, and they would work with insurance for anything that wasn't in scope prior to working on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I signed the contract and released funds for the contract signing. Work began on restoring my house. The next payment draw was for framing and rough in plumbing complete. Paid that. So on and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been 7 months into the project and I get an email stating that they messed up their scope of work -- that several items aren't in scope and they can't cut any more costs because they have cut as much as they can in their profit. However, these items are itemized in the insurance estimate. Their proposal says that everything from the insurance estimate is within scope. They wanted me to ask insurance for more money. I knew insurance would refuse, and they did. I told the contractor they needed to own up to their mistake and take that hit. They since have refused to update me or tell me what they plan to do with these items.

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, they hit me with an invoice to pay for plumbing. Said it wasn't paid for by insurance, but it is the proposal from earlier. This portion of plumbing was out-of-scope from insurance. Its been months since plumbing was done and the restoration is supposed to be done in 4 months. I also paid an invoice on the payment schedule that said framing and rough in plumbing several months ago. They said they would eat some of the cost on the plumbing since insurance said they wouldn't pay for it -- this was near the beginning of the restoration work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I should have to pay for this and I am being cold-shouldered on items that are in insurance estimate but they claim are not in their scope of work. What should I do?

"Hello, all. Sorry for the poor title. My issue is that a tow company refused to take my offer of paying by debit or credit card and would only take cash. Story:

My car was recently towed. I attempted to pay with a credit card and was told they do not accept credit card payments. I also had a debit card if necessary. They are required by state law to accept payments by card. They told me I was wrong and that I could call the police if I wanted and I would be told the same thing. notified law enforcement and when they arrived, the tow company told them that the machine that process card payments was broken. They also said they never got a chance to tell me this because I grew irate. I ended up having to pay in cash to get my vehicle back as they offered me no other option. Is any of this legal?

"Not sure if this is appropriate for this forum, It's more of ""Why did this happen to me"" and questions about legal definitions rather than, ""What can I do next""   Or maybe it can be viewed as what not to do in a similar situation.  All of this happened several years ago and no lasting affects, other than I now have an ""At Fault"" accident on my record. The only one in almost 40 years of driving both commercially and privately.  
  
I know there is a legal definition of driving that involves being in the driver seat with the motor running. It doesn't matter if the car is moving, or is in park.  The legal definition is there to prevent people under the influence from getting away with a technicality.  
  
This happened in Auburn, CA. I live about 4 hours away near Santa Rosa, CA, this has minor importance later in the story.  
  
I had just finished a 2 day camping trip with a bunch of scouts, I dropped them off at a restaurant and went to go fill up with gas. There was a line at the gas station, so I drove up to the end of the line, and put my car in park,  
  
This is where I admit I am on shaky ground legally - I turned on my cell phone for the first time in 2 days and started to deal with all the incoming notifications while waiting in line at the gas station. I thought it was okay because I was not moving and in park.  
  
The lady in the car in front of me finished filling with gas, and since she was blocked from going forward, she proceeded to put her car into reverse without looking and backed into me.  No damage to my car, there was a slight dent in her rear bumper, and her license plate was bent.  
  
At the time, she agreed that she was in the wrong, that she backed into me. We exchanged insurance info and left without incident.  
  
A week later, my insurance company contacts me and tells me that she has filed a different claim, that I pulled straight into the gas station and rammed into her car while she was filling up with gas. So now it's my word against hers and we go back and forth a few times until I let slip that I was looking at my cell phone and at that point it's instantly my fault. It seems using a cell phone while driving (the legal definition) is a more serious offense than backing up without looking.  
  
Since the location was 4 hours away, it took me a month before I could go up there and request the video footage from the security cameras, but it turned out they only keep 2 weeks worth of records before they are overwritten.   
  
Like I said, This was all years ago, but I still think about it now and then in terms of what I could of done differently.  Maybe tried to get video evidence immediately, but I don't know how long that would have taken and I had a group of tired scouts waiting to go home.

"quick background: 

1. origonal business started with two partners (Iowa - LLC) (myself(1st time owner) and for purposes of this discussion ""bob""(experienced business owner)) 
2. Added a third business partner (""tom"" - not in Iowa) under the impression he had significant contacts in the business field providing many sources of advertising revenue to the business. (1.2 years since we added Tom)  - This was a no salary, share of profit only partner
3. Tom provided a handfull, (maybe 20 contacts) and I had to work them to get any revenue out of them with no help from Tom.  (only generated 1% revenue compared to other advertisers)

We (Bob and myself) feel he did not live up to what was the intent of the partnership when we brought him in and would like to buy him out.  Between our offer plus all the profit he made off the business in that 1.2 years he would have made 200% of his initial investment.  

We have a partnership agreement that doesn't have any restrictions on starting competing business(important note for later) and it states that the partnership can be dissolved with a majority vote.  (Bob and I have 70% voting rights between us)  

Bob is also the managing partner and has 100% authority according the agreement to set salaries without requirements for permission or reporting to the partners. Bob and I do collect a salary that got a significant raise this year.  Tom was informed that the raises were coming, but uniformed of the amount which does cut into all of our profits.

We held the meeting with Tom, declared we as majority owners would like to buy him out and gave him a few days to make a counter offer.  We stated that if we can't agree to amount, then we would vote to dissolve the business(Bob and I would start a new business up and provide the same services we did before).  The business doesn't have any debt, but does have a few employees and future deposits for next years events that would need to be transitioned to the new company or returned.  

Our lawyer says that we are well in our rights according the contract to do this.  Tom says his lawyer says if we dissolve the business he would prevent us from starting a new one and sue us personally.  I am the lowest person on the wealth ladder between the three partners and I am worried of personally being prevented from having the business to operate and provide an income for myself(and family).  I am also worried about impacting our employees if we are prevented from starting a new business.

We prefer the buyout, but his ask would be a 500-600% return on their investment and I know Bob will not go that high.  (I don't think it is a reasonable number either)

I am worried that we are headed to dissolving the business and don't want to lose my ability to provide for my family.   Should I be freaking out?, or is this normal for business partnerships and they usually workout in the end?

Thanks

"I am separated with my wife for over a year. We are not yet divorced but our relationship got worse ever since she started dating another man. We have two kids 6 and 7

1 month ago, she came late to pick up our kids at my place and I didnt go downstairs right away as they were finishing dinner. She got mad and went to suit me for domestic violence (verbal/psychological) and asked for a restraining order. The day after, I filed too and requested a restraining order against her.

Two/three weeks later, she contacted me, and came to my place to convince me to ask both of our cases to be dismissed. The same day, we requested the dismissal. The final decision to dismiss was up to the prosecutor.

Prior to the school holidays, I sent her an email with my proposal for the visitation. Essentially, I requested that the kids will be one day with me, and the next with her and so and so forth. She replied to this email after 6 days and only 1 and half day pior to the beginning of the holidays. She sent me a notarised document stating which days the days the kids will be with me and which days with her. She said that if I dont reply, the kids would remain with her during the entire holidays.

I immediately replied to the email telling her that I refused her proposal because it came way too late. During the first few days of the holidays, she brought me the kids but today, she was supposed to bring them at my place at 8.30am and she wasnt here. I called her several times and texted her without a response.

"We are in the state of Illinois in the US. My sister’s recent ex-boyfriend was aggressive and physically abusive towards her during the end of their relationship, and she recorded the audio during one of their fights in our apartment while they were dating because she was afraid he might hurt her. In the recording, he also verbally admitted to abusing her in the past. She luckily ended the relationship a few weeks later before things got even worse. A few of her concerned friends and I reported him to his school on my sister’s behalf (with her permission), and a Title IX investigation opened.

My sister hasn’t shared the audio recording with the investigators, but she has mentioned its existence and they’ve included her statement in their report, which will be shared with the ex-boyfriend. The Title IX investigators have told her that because they are not part of the legal system, she could send the recordings without consequence from them, but the ex-boyfriend would find out that she sent the recordings, so the investigators said that they couldn’t give proper legal advice about what she should do.

Here are our questions:

1. We’re aware that Illinois is a two-party consent state, but is it still illegal for her to record audio in her own home? We read a few articles online that say it’s legal when it’s in your own property or in your own rental, but some other articles say that it’s not legal even in your own home if there is expected privacy, so we wanted to know which was true.

2. If it is actually illegal to record audio without consent in her own home, is it okay that she told the investigators that she did record, which is going into the report that will be sent to the ex-boyfriend? Meaning, can the ex use my sister’s admission of recording against her legally? She is wondering if she should just tell the investigators to remove any mention of the recording from the written report.

"Oof, right before the holidays. Lots of details but I’ll try to stay on point. I’m open to any advice (legal/hr/practical). I’m NYC based in terms of employee rights. 

I was hired to my (early stage startup) company in July as an executive. The title and comp were a bit below my expectations, but I liked the project and believed the CEO that they were just not ready yet for those C level titles and compensation packages. I often work in early stage businesses and so figured I could help them develop towards offering better comp. 

The next two people we hired were given more senior titles and higher comp packages, even though they were my peers and we all report directly to the CEO, we all have similar education and experience metrics. On top of that, I was not given ownership of the functions in the job description, and given less senior ownership over other things. This was from the start. I assumed I needed to onboard, build trust, etc to achieve handoff from the CEO. 

*(The CEO took a particular interest in me, but still held me back. It felt very psychosexual, like a pet. I did not include this in my formal complaint, but just sharing with you redditors. It’s relevant but impossible to substantiate.) 

Then it becomes apparent we have a lot of assholes that the CEO turns a blind eye to in the business ecosystem. Various individuals from contractors to a board director made sexual advances, ethnic or racial slurs, etc in group context, in front of the CEO, or directly to me. All the while, I have made several requests for role clarification, etc, formally and informally. 

It’s worth noting my performance and execution on the work I was doing has been stellar. Even members of the board had publicly commented on how I’ve brought professionalism to the business. Our internal team often thanks me in our weekly all hands meetings. I have extensive tracking of my execution and the outcomes I helped with. 

Long story short, I’ve just called out the board to enforce their harassment policy, and formally asked them to stop the CEO’s hostility and retaliation. Things have been escalating, and while this is the last business day of the year for us, I felt I had no other choice. 

I have no idea if there’s anyway I get through this keeping the job. It seems unlikely. But I do have written messages, emails, texts, transcriptions etc that covers EVERYTHING I claim. 

I am also not tied to any mediation, arbitration, IP assignment, noncompete or even NDA. I recommended the CEO to make me sign. He didn’t think it mattered. I have had (and still have) unrestricted access and know everything about our IP, customers, strategy. 

The part of my heart that feels sad, used, toyed with and frankly very angry, wants to go full Targaryen. I could argue IP ownership for instance since I created their first product roadmap.

It seems like the best realistic outcome however, is minimal reputation impact, and a healthy separation in the form of (a lot) of severance. I do think I should be prepared to hit hard and take and offensive position to defense - since these are good ‘ol bully’s. 

What do you think? What else should I be doing now to protect my interests and family? The board acknowledged receipt but we agree to reconvene Jan 2 after the holidays. 

Adding more details, I turned down suitable job offers to accept this one, and used the language of being hired under false pretenses to the board, in addition to the harassment and retaliation. I also mentioned the CEO spends company money based on nepotism, which I know the board has critiqued him on in the past. The guy burned $2m this year while only barely closing new business, and he was utterly negligent with spending on product development.

"TLDR: The guy who I think robbed and assaulted me was arrested and charged for doing the same thing to others. Since he’s already been charged, is there anything I should do? 



Three years ago, I was had my phone stolen outside of a college bar in Minneapolis and was hit in the head and knocked unconscious in the process. A group of people were later arrested and charged for stealing iPhones about a year later. 

Fast forward to today, and the Wall Street Journal just posted a video on YouTube where they interviewed the main guy who was stealing phones. I think it may have been the exact guy who robbed me, as he matches the description exactly. After I was robbed, the security guards told me it was a shorter, light skinned black guy in a red sweatshirt. In the WSJ video, they showed security footage where he was wearing a red sweatshirt at a college bar. He also explained to a T of what he would do once he stole the phone. He specifically said he wouldn’t touch Venmo, and just go for bank accounts, which is exactly what happened to me. 

Since I was knocked out, I don’t really remember anything from the incident, so would definitely be hard to prove it was him. However, the incident happened right by a set of city cameras, which probably had a good angle at the entire thing. 

I am wondering if there is anything that I should do at this point, and if there is anyone I should contact about this. I don’t want to go out of my way to press charges or anything, but if it would be helpful towards any future prosecutions, I would be more than happy to help. The POS left me face down unconscious on the sidewalk and attempted to empty my entire bank account. He also didn’t seem remorseful at all in the video, so wouldn’t mind offering any help I can, but also am not sure if there is anything that could be done at this point.","Was assaulted and robbed 3 years ago.

For context, this occurred in the state of Tennessee. 

Last year, my father was having to file for bankruptcy over a mess with a car he cosigned for, and had used a quitclaim deed to transfer the property his house is on into my name to avoid having a lien put on it by the collections agency handling the cosigned car. We later found out that they could've put a lien on it anyway, but whatever. 

Fast forward to earlier this year. I move out of the house to live with a friend, and use a quitclaim deed to put the property back in my father's name and then he uses one a few months later to put his wife's name on the title. 

As far as I'm aware, the only responsibilities that were held with the property to begin with were property taxes and a now paid off mortgage (aside from utilities and such as that). 

Back taxes on the property have been paid up, and as far as I understand, I'm just responsible for this year's property taxes since my name was on the title as of January 1st. I haven't gotten anything in the mail about owing anyone anything nor have I gotten any calls about anything regarding the property. 

But, I'm young, dumb and don't really understand how the world works, so I'm wondering if there's any consequences to that that I should be concerned about at all. Owing someone money, tax implications, etc.

I rent a room in a house in Texas. I have 3 months to go on my lease and my landlord switched property management companies. My original lease was $750 per month: $600 for rent and $150 for utilities. The new property management company wants me to sign a new lease which says that rent is $600 plus some misc fees totaling $25 per month, and the cost of all utilities is split between the tenants. They will charge $140/month as a base and then any overage will be returned or any additional costs will be charged to us. Since the house is not at full occupancy, it is likely that my portion under these new rules will be much more than the $150 I currently pay. 

My questions:

1. Do they have to honor my original lease? 
2. Do I have to sign the new lease in order to remain in the house for the remainder of my original lease?
3. Per the new lease, I would be responsible for 100% of the house's utilities if the other tenants move out. Is this legal? Assuming that I did nothing to cause roommates to leave, I can't control whether they have enough tenants to keep the house at full capacity.

December 2022 I got a speeding infraction 22356 (b) in CA ""speed over 70mph"" in a 70mph zone officer made it seem like he was doing me a favor, my record was otherwise clean and I work in the automotive industry as a Service Writer/Advisor for an independent repair shop. So having any marks is an issue especially with me debating on moving to a dealership position in the near future. Immediately I hired a large local law firm that specializes in traffic tickets with billboards all over LA I thought they were a safe bet. How wrong I was.

I gave them any and all documentation and kept in constant communication with any other letters I received in the mail. Paid them immediately and signed whatever documents they needed. Somehow they forgot my court date and resulted in me getting a failure to appear on my record and license suspended. 

Now once I got the letter from the DMV my license was suspended I was furious, luckily they were able to get it instated within a day but the driving record still shows Failure to Appear, my insurance has gone up 140% and most providers won't even write me a policy with that on my record and the temporary suspension. Oh and the ticket they weren't able to get knocked down at all so I still got 1pt and $400 fine.

This large firm totally failed me and now they just keep pointing fingers within their firm that it was the clerks error, that it was the secretary fault and they claim they are in touch with the court house trying to fix things but it has been months and they never reach out to me I have to call ask for my case manager and feel like they aren't doing anything.

So with my employment dependent on a clean record and putting a financial toll on me, what is my best plan of action?

So I just didn’t realize that was necessary and I should have been more diligent in reading all the documents they mailed me. An honest mistake.

"I moved to PA in 2021 from NY.

"For some background: I am a resident of Wisconsin and the following events transpired in Wisconsin. I was rear-ended on the interstate in late September by a moving truck. The moving company accepted liability and asked that I get a quote for the damages from a body shop (but not before offering to pay me much less than the repairs were going to cost, which I of course refused). I sent the quote, all parties accepted the terms, and I dropped my car off at the body shop.

"Hi, based in Illinois, not in the city though.

&amp;#x200B;

We started renting a house in July. It has been an experience to say, the landlord lied about a lot of crap before we moved in (specifically if the house ever flooded, he told us no but neighbors told us yes it did and that's why it was renovated). Our big issue is the pests. We are swarmed with all types of bugs, have been year round, but the worst part is the mice. 

We saw the feces in the drawers in the kitchen when we moved in, but thought it was old and cleaned it up. 2 weeks after our move in date, when we finally moved everything in, we saw everything in the kitchen was eaten, defecated on, and urinated on. I immediately sent pictures and requested a service to come out and exterminate, and it took about a week or two of back and forth between him, us, and our realtor to finally get it done.

When the pest control came, they pointed out a ton of holes around the house. There is a few in the roof, a giant one behind the stove (that the mice are currently actively using and even eating the exposed insulation) and holes all around the foundation (no basement). Since they determined that we were not at fault, I know it is the landlord's responsibility in full to take care of the problem.

Well he stopped paying for the pest control, and when I asked why he said it's because it is our problem, he does not believe in pest control, and once again tried to gaslight me into believing that this is ""normal"" for every house. I have lived in multiple houses in my life, all in the Midwest, all in different ecosystems, and have NEVER experienced this before. Even in a house older than this one. He told me that if I am so bothered by living with mice, that I should ""look for different housing"".

&amp;#x200B;

Our next steps are having a county inspector come out, and having another official investigation into the cause of the mice. From there, we do not know how to proceed. We have always paid full rent (more than what the house is even worth) and have never been late. Am I being crazy about not wanting to live in these conditions, or do we have rights? Keep in mind, we have been living like this, barely able to use the kitchen, washing everything everyday, unable to use 90% of the cabinets, and even handwashing silverware, plates, pans and pots every time before we use them. They ate through some of my wooden utensils at first, and they are not sold anymore and also irreplaceable as they were my deceased mother's utensils.

&amp;#x200B;

Another tidbit, idk if it is relevant, our housing is not cheap. It isn't 7k a month but its not under 2k a month either, and we're not really in a bad area either. None of our neighbors have these rodent issues.

"At the beginning of November, a car that was smoking before stopping parked next to mine,  caught fire and melted half of my vehicle while I was at work.

The driver’s insurance company (progressive) ruled that the driver of the vehicle wasn’t negligent and thus had no responsibility to pay a claim. I only had liability (with progressive as well) and my underinsured/uninsured couldn’t be used to pay the damages either.

"Here's the situation. I tried my best to make it brief. 

A home buying company, call them A1, offered $62K for our home. Shortly before signing, another woman ""Kelly"" offered $65K, saying she wanted to fix it up and flip it for a profit. 

I signed an agreement (non-trec) with kelly for $65K. She later claimed renovation costs were higher and had me sign an ""amendment"" lowering the price to $50K.

This amendment was actually for a TREC contract I was unaware of. The actual TREC sent later had different terms and buyers. I did not sign the main TREC document because Kelly had misrepresented the situation. 

Looking back, it seems the original buyers, A1, were working with Kelly from the start. I think once it became clear to them that I had stopped contact with kelly, A1 sent out someone to threaten legal actions. That's when we realized they were working together. 

Kelly made numerous attempts through rushed documents and lies to trick me into an unfavorable deal. I cut off contact after realizing it was a scam. Kelly is threatening legal action over a non-signed trec agreement. 

I had signed the amendment because she presented it as *not a new contract"" but an amendment to a contract. 

Anyhow, I am having a family member contact a lawyer who can hopefully give advice. But in the meantime, I wanted to post here, and hopefully get some feedback on the situation. 

tl;dr I signed a purchase agreement, buyer later convinced me to drop the price and sign an amendment, the amendment was not to our agreement but to a TREC, they sent the TREC later with no explanation, apparently hoping i'd just sign it. I didn't and now they are threatening legal action I guess to intimidate me into complying.

Edit: I cut off contact with Kelly last Friday. Prior to that she had mentioned closing the deal, signing the house over by today. And today is when we're getting threats with legal action.

"Hi all – I am a lawyer but have no experience in New York tenant/landlord matters and was hoping to hear from anyone with experience/insight into the two topics below.   
  
**Duty to Mitigate for Broken Lease**

* We are breaking a lease by vacating in mid-January and notified them in late November. They acknowledged and notified us that we would be obligated to pay rent through March 31 under our lease. They ignored my offer to find a sublease for the remaining term (technically through August, although we have an early termination right starting March 31).
* Our apartment is rent-stabilized, so have only had preferential rent increases of \~2-3% over the past 3 years.  We moved in August 2020 and benefited from a very low early COVID rate, so the legal regulated rent is MUCH higher than we are currently paying.  They’ve relisted the apartment at just below the legal regulated rent – over $1,300 more per month than we are currently paying.
* Under N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 227-E, landlords have a duty to mitigate and take action to re-rent at the lower of FMV or our existing rate (see [here](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/RPP/227-E)).  My concern is that because they are relisting the apartment at such a high rate, they will be unable to re-rent it and we will end up paying an additional two months of rent for February and March 2024. 
* I’ve done some research but can’t find much beyond the statutory text and generic articles about this topic. I want to minimize the hassle of dealing with this while also making clear that if they fail to rent the apartment at the higher rate, they have not fulfilled their obligations under § 227-E. 	
* Does it make sense to send an email to them referencing their obligations under 227-E? I don't necessarily want to turn things hostile and does seem a bit unreasonable that they would rerent it at our exact rate if they can get more, but I don't think we should be the on the hook for their attempting to overprice the place. 

**Disguised Rent**  


* Relatedly, we have a fixed utility charge of $350 per month intended to cover heat/water. They raised this in our September 2022 renewal from $150 to $350 and when asked for an explanation noted: ""The rent increase is justified due to increased cost to upkeep the building due to inflation and market conditions. "" This seemed questionable (and they literally used the words ""rent increase"") but we accepted it since we didn’t want to jeopardize the renewal or find a new place to live. Since then, we’ve paid about $3,200 total in increased utility charges.
* Does anyone have any insight into what qualifies as a rent overcharge or disguised rent increase for rent-stabilized apartments? Would it matter if not every tenant in the building is paying the same higher utility rate?
* More importantly, can this be leveraged to resolve the above situation or should I consider filing a rent overcharge complaint with the NYC DHCR/ORA? I looked at the form and it seems pretty burdensome and I imagine could lead to a long, drawn-out process after we've moved and left the state. These landlords have been OK, not great and not terrible, but this always stunk to me of circumventing the rent stabilization requirements they are held to for the tax advantages received in building the apartment. 

Beyond these questions, I’d be curious for any and all advice on how to handle this situation to not be on the hook for extra rent because they are holding out trying to maximize their rental income. I am not confrontational by nature but two months of double rent would make a huge difference for us. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!

Both the detective and I have reached out to the prosecutor handling the case and have gotten no response. Is there anything I can do, or should be doing, in this situation? I know that these things take time, but it's been almost a year with absolutely no progress. I have ample proof of the crime, and I feel that he should have been charged long ago. He's just out there living his life while I'm left picking up the pieces and waiting for a decision to be made. I can't keep living like this. I'm exhausted of not knowing what will happen. I feel like I've been on edge for an entire year and there seems to be no end in sight.

"A friend of mine is at a loss of what to do and I’m trying to seek some advice on where she should start, what type of lawyer to seek, etc

Her daughter passed unexpectedly away a couple years ago, leaving my friend’s now 14 year old granddaughter behind. When the daughter passed away, she was going through a divorce with her husband but it was never finalized. Husband received all life insurance money, blew it, and now collects social security for the granddaughter. 

The home (a single wide outdated trailer) provided for the granddaughter is not structurally sound and she sleeps on a mattress parked on the living room floor. Her father is never home, often leaving the girl alone overnights for several nights in a row.  There is no food in the home, my friend takes food over regularly. The father will not allow the child to spend nights at my friend’s home and I assume this is to not jeopardize the social security money he receives. The child does not have access to a phone when her father isn’t home; she will go to a neighbor in the trailer park to ask to use their phone to contact someone to bring her food. She attends public school. She is terrified of her father. 

Where does one start to advocate for this child? My friend doesn’t care about the social security, she just wants to provide a better home for the child.

"I understand that a lot of guilty or resentful people will claim that they lost a case because they can’t admit they’re wrong… etc. However, I’ll explain in 3 sentences why I feel that I, as well as my daughter are victims of injustice &amp; a small town corrupted judicial system. 

My child’s father took me out for custody for our at the time 5 year old daughter, even though he’d never been in her life &amp; had his rights involuntarily terminated with his biological son. All because I had moved on &amp; had asked him for the first time to pay child support. He perjured himself repeatedly on the stand, was constantly in contempt, civil &amp; criminal, yet my attorney would do nothing. The amount of evidence I had is staggering. &amp; so- he did win primary custody of her &amp; he lived 4 hours away in another state, mind you, he’s a drug addict, yet has a lucrative job. 3 months after my daughter left, she made several allegations that was far more than I could have ever imagined. Yet, I was &amp; still am severely suffering legal abuse syndrome, plus effects of his abuse, so I was so frightened to do anything. I spent the entire night on hotlines and the next day called the sheriff’s department. I was told by him to not take her back, to go to there courthouse just thing the next morning &amp; ask for a ex-parte &amp; a dvo. Well, the judge said no, because it sounded like a custody issue, when it obviously wasn’t by the allegations I made on her behalf. I am a bartender/manager of a brewer &amp; often serve some of the younger attorneys in my town. One reached out to me &amp; told me that his attorney had told that judge, not the judge assigned to my case, to not grant it before they even came out. 20 days after this, he was granted sole custody of her &amp; I was to not contact her… except I didn’t know this… I wasn’t served until over a month after that was granted, in which I never got my chance to defend myself &amp; the pages of lies he filed on me in retaliation for the domestic violence case, which, also was continued TEN times, in which his attorney lied repeatedly &amp; I have proof of, of why it needed to be continued. The domestic violence was not heard until 3 months after I filed when I woke up to a text saying that my child’s father was incarcerated, in my county, in this state, for 9 felonies, including meth, &amp; 2 days prior had been arrested for 4 felonies, including meth, all while my daughter was in the “Care” of a 54 year old habitual felon, who my child’s father has been posing with meth to watch my child, so that she could not contact me again, after multiple times she called after she was left at their apartment alone, but he had put the wrong address on all of the court papers &amp; I could not get a successful welfare check until I had my 6 year old daughter turn her location on, which took quite a bit of effort, &amp; then open the door to tell me what their apartment number was. I have all of this on video plus more. So, he is in jail, she is in Tennessee. Long story short, she was in an extreme state of neglect, had lost 11 pounds, missed over 40 days of school, had no medical insurance, and tested positive for meth and marijuana. Over 6 months later, he took me back to court, even though I tried to get his rights terminated because of abandonment, &amp; was denied. &amp; now we’re still in court, over $20k later for me, I have NO MORE MONEY for an attorney, &amp; I am so frightened for her to be back with him.

"Seeking advice on a complicated family matter.  

Backstory - my mom passed away 8 years ago.  Her life insurance and savings all went to my dad.  Both of my parents are lawyers and did quite well.  At this point in his life my Dad has what I’d estimate to be ~$3m in assets.  I have one sister who is not close with me or my Dad.  We haven’t spoken in years.  My Dads health has not been good since my Moms passing.   He’s a heavy drinker and has had a benign tumor removed from his brain among other things.  He’s had seizures after the brain surgery and continues to drink.

Fast forward to 1.5 years ago - my Dad found a new girlfriend at the local bar.  She’s a hospice nurse from Ohio.  He lives in Florida.  They fell “in love” and she was moving in with him to Florida within 6 months.  They act like a high school couple and he’s head over heels for her.  It’s very awkward for me.  I’ve visited twice since she moved in with my 2 kids - 3 and 4 - a couple of times.  She’s always been really nice and seemed like a “blessing” for him to find someone at this point in his life.  

Now the weird stuff.  His best friend is his brother who lives in the same town.  Before this girlfriend they would hang out everyday.  Now they NEVER hang out and he only does things with her family and friends.  Constantly hosting them from out of town.  

He had two rings of my mothers and gave me one to propose to my girlfriend and the other for her to “wear” - the one he gave me was tested and is FAKE.  I just found out today. 

His health has deteriorated recently.  

My Dad and uncle have a shared bank account (which is my Dads money) and he recently asked to move it into the girlfriends name.  Around half a million dollars.  “In case she needs to pay his medical bills”

My uncle believes it’s my money and is going to tell him “no” we’re not going to move it into her name.  But there are other (bigger) accounts that I don’t think I can do anything to stop him from leaving to her if things go south.  One is an investment account of $2m.   

My uncle and aunts have a theory that she has “done this before” and is slowly POISONING him to get his money.  She’s always been nice to me but is constantly feeding him liquor and cocktails.  She does seem to love him and is good with my kids when I visit.  I have no idea what to think of this but everyone in my family doesn’t like this woman.

His latest health issue has been a stomach issue with accelerated heart rate. He went to the hospital and was released.  Now he’s becoming increasingly jaundice and fatigued.  I think it is a liver or pancreas issue related to his drinking problem.  He is going back to the hospital today for more testing.  

I’m lost at what to do.  I don’t know who or what to believe.  I love my dad and don’t want to lose him.  If I do lose him I will HATE him if he leaves his money to her.  I’m not trying to be greedy but this woman has been with him a year and half and I consider that our family’s money.  For the record I personally don’t think she’s poisoning him but have started to question it more. 

Is there anything I can do given the current situation to ensure his wealth stays in my family?  I’m willing to allow her to stay in his house and other things but fear he is completely brainwashed and will give her much more.

They’ve been asked to add time off taken retroactively to 2023 to get their numbers down to 40 hours ASAP. They did not take enough time off during the year to get near this number of hours remaining, and any additional time documented in the system as PTO would be fabricated.

"Hello,

I bought a car where the dealer sold it to us for 60000 miles and the actual miles on the title state 100,000. Title says actual on the mileage. Carfax also shows that miles in the car for this year and last year were much higher than on the sales receipt. Dealer denied to give us a refund. As such, we are seeking a lawyer.

We have been given the option of seeking nolo.com or our city’s courthouse to seek a lawyer. Problem is dealer’s wife works in the courthouse and we are afraid some personal interests can arise. How can we find a lawyer with expertise in odometer fraud?

Also how can we take steps to prevent the dealer from taking any sort of retaliation against us, including physical harm or property destruction?",Odometer fraud case will need to be taken to court,18okity,1703267024.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18okity/odometer_fraud_case_will_need_to_be_taken_to_court/,
"So I'm having an issue with my auto insurance company. This is a long one. Alot of info and a lot of context. This is a months worth of ""interactions."" 

My car was stolen last month. I filed a claim on the 20th of Novemeber, and it was found (crashed and towed) on November 24th. 

I live in Pennsylvania.  My car was stolen at a location 3 hours away from me (in Philadelphia) in the night after arriving at the airbnb from a concert. 

My insurance adjustor spoke to me on November 20th to confirm and initiate a recorded statement for the investigation needed to be sure my car was actually stolen and not ""stolen"" by me. Understandable fraud is a real thing. I answered all of her questions and gave her all the info she ASKED for, afterwards, when it was my turn to ask questions, she told me she doesn't answer ""what ifs"" and wouldn't be able to help me until my car was found. She didn't tell me what to do when it was found other than to give her a call. This conversation on the phone did not end well. Every time I asked a question, she would respond with, ""I won't know until your car is found. Call when your car is found."" I ended up getting g frustrated and asked to speak to someone else, which she declined, then hung up on me. I did not hear from her (this was Thanksgiving week as well, but no emails or mail either). 

On November 24th, I got a call that my car was found. I called the insurance company multiple times and received no response. I emailed the email that was given to me for all claim related matters. No response. 

On Novemeber 30th, I received a call from an investigator.  I did speak to a claims specialist otp about my claim, but they weren't able to give me much info besides ""talk to your adjustor,"" who isn't answering or responding to me. The investigator told me they were calling to investigate my claim to make sure it was legit. At this point, my car had already been found. I was outside in NYC when I received the call. He insisted on being okay with the noise and wanted to set up an interview. When I declined his first offer to call (I had prior plans at that time), he became annoyed and  mentioned that I was being ""combative"" with my previous adjustor as well - as I've mentioned, I admit to getting frustrated but this is customer service,  I feel it's their job to answer my questions and advise me. He then started accusing me of yelling at him and being loud, which be said was okay since I was in a noisy area and INSISTED on speaking to me. He hung up on me as well. 

I got a call on December 4th from a new investigator looking into my claim. I still haven't heard from my adjustor, and the supervisor I had tried to contact did not return any of my calls either. I had tried to call 5+ times this day - a monday and the previous Friday. This investigator was very nice and patient with my anxieties on the situation.  He was open with not being able to help me but told me he'd send a note to my adjustor and the supervisor. At this point, I started sending emails in addition to calls to leave a written trail of all my attempts. I still have not received any info on what to do with my car. The tow yard and the police release place told me I need a hold harmless agreement from my insurance company to get my vehicle or I need to go myself. This is covered in my insurance, and it's 3 hours away from me, so I moved forward with contacting my insurance about this (which I had already done through email and phone calls). 

Later this day, I received multiple letters from my insurance adjustor via post. The dates were set for the 20th of Novemeber. This had time sensitive information and claims that she informed about moving my car ON MY OWN, but if I could not, I could contact them to move it for me. If I failed to do it, the debt would be on me. This letter was dated the 20th and said the coverage would stop on the 20th for this. My car was not found until the 24th, and I was not relayed any of this information. I went through the process of calls and emails again. No response. I did get in contact with the claims specialist here and there, but none of them could give me the info I was looking for since it was policy related. At this point, I'd called the supervisor 5+ times and left messages with no response, I also called my primary adjustor and got ""the mailbox is full"" redirected and heard the same message. I continued with the investigator that was assigned and sent him all the info he asked for.  He told me he didn't even know my car was found. 

I exchanged some emails with an adjustor in her office and was told my car would be towed and moved , no dates given, or where just that it was scheduled. After multiple emails repeating my questions (she only answered one question at a time via email), I was given the conclusion that my claim was accepted and my car would be moved to x location 2 hours away from me. 

A week later (12/12), my primary adjustor resurfaced and called me (which I missed), stating they needed proof of ownership for my car. She sent it via email as well and repeated ""your responsibility"" this and claiming to have discussions with me that were not had. I corrected her in my response email and asked for more info, which she did not respond to. I received another voicemail from her telling me what to do to get my title. I did this and sent it to her twice via email, which she did not respond to. 

The following week (12/21), I called and emailed her again asking for an update. She rejected my call but sent an email specifying that she did not receive my title with dates and times she ""called"" me claiming I was unavailable and that this was time sensitive.  At this point, her emails have become very accusatory and date oriented (assuming to cover her since she's been MIA). I sent her a screenshot of the emails I sent the week before and reattached the title. She did not respond to this email once again. 

Now, for today, I received an email saying my claim would not be covered after I was told it would be due to using this car for business.  This is false. I attempted to call her once again and sent an email. No response. It is still only 12:30 pm, but I already know how this is going to go. Right before Christmas and New Years, too, it feels like a stall.

I'm trying to get it resolved currently but have been hung up twice by representatives. At this point, I feel I need representation.  The emotional distress I've been in, the amount of work I've missed, and the money that is accumulated - and still is - on my vehicle in the tow yard is insane. At this point, I can't afford to take it out myself. Even then, this is not on me. I wasn't given any information until too late. 

What're my options, and what can I do? I can't force anyone to call me back or speak to me, but this is their job, and it's been a month. Now, I probably won't hear back until after the New Year. 

*** Some background info: 
I've attempted to reach a supervisor, but there was no response. 
I've told them their letter reached me 2 weeks after the date, and she is still sending me 'late' letters. 
I have full coverage on my car but no extras.  No rental coverage either.

"  
Hello all,  
I find myself in need of sound legal advice concerning what seems to be an exorbitant amount of damage costs being charged to me. While I acknowledge there were minor damages, they were well within the realm of normal wear and tear. Despite this, the property manager presented me with an invoice totaling $1600, which already included the deduction of a $750 deposit. It's important to note that I occupied a two-bedroom, two-bath, 900 sq ft apartment as a single female.  
I took great care to maintain the property in immaculate condition, and the only damages were related to nails and screws, which, according to the lease, fall under normal wear and tear. The most significant charge was a $1000 labor fee, despite the presence of salaried maintenance personnel responsible for such tasks.  
Moreover, the property manager has been unable to provide proper documentation regarding the hours billed for labor, and I was never afforded the opportunity to inspect the property alongside them to agree on any potential charges.

"i know i’m dumb so let’s just get that out of the way. 
i deposited a fraudulent check, i didn’t spend any money what so ever because after a few hours of research i realized it was a fraudulent check. 
(the scam was thru indeed. i got a “job offer” and they sent me a $2,500 thru email and i stupidly deposited it.) however, after realizing it was fake, i disputed the transaction through my chase account. i spent absolutely none of that money. not even a penny. i called customer service and was told that the check won’t come through but my account will be fine. fast forward to today, i am in the negatives for over $2,500 despite not spending any of that money and talking to multiple chase customer service reps who all told me it’ll be fine. i called the fraud department this morning and was told that “they can’t do anything sorry!” so i told them i was going to file a complaint with the BBB &amp; CFPB. her attitude changed real fast and she told me that my account will be fine tomorrow, the -$2500 will be gone and taken care of. 
i still went through and filed the report with both the BBB and CFPB cause i don’t trust chase at this point after taking action immediately and being told not to worry and my account will be fine yet im in debt over $2,500 bc of all the fees and what not. 
i got scammed years ago by the classic “im sending you x amount of money and you send me x back.” this was with USAA though, so once the check bounced, i was in debt for what i had spent. that makes sense. i spent that money. but with chase, as i’ve reiterated multiple times, i didn’t spend one dime of that check. so once the check bounced, shouldn’t my account have just gone back to my OG funds? why am i in debt for a check that bounced despite not spending any of that money? are they in the legal right to do that? will the BBB &amp; CFPB even be able to help?

" Hello, this occurred in Arizona almost 2 years ago now. I was renting an apartment with my younger sister and there was a fire in her bathroom. I woke up to smoke detectors, banging and screaming from outside, very traumatic. The fire dept determined it was the vent fan that caused the fire. We were never given a place to stay while being moved to another unit and the unit we were moved to was a severe downgrade, dirty, old, poorly painted and already peeling, I pointed this out and they said this was all they had. I threatened to involve a third party and they gave us one month free rent in the worse apartment. I took this as a win as I couldn’t afford a lawyer. We recently moved out and I am no longer speaking with my sister. The other day I received a bill for the apparent mess she left in our apartment (I had already moved out for several weeks before the lease ended) and I quite honestly don’t feel I need to pay any of it. I’m still traumatized from the fire, very angry that they never gave us accommodations while they poorly re-floored another unit for us to stay in, and now they are trying to charge us for the “damage” that was left. I am now seriously considering hiring a lawyer to not only clear this bill but for the fear I now live with of waking to a fire that was no fault of my own. Have I waited too long? Do I have any legal recourse here? Where do I even start with this if at all? Any advice is very much appreciated. This is a throwaway account btw.

"\[CO\] It's practically a rhetorical question, but I have to ask because I am seeking a copy of a specific 1979 case file from the District Court, which ""should"" be in their archive, but is not. It was a big ugly class-action suit that involved homeowners, corrupt county officials, a corrupt judge, a corrupt property developer, embezzlement of public monies, defective public infrastructure, the list goes on and on. Over 165 additional lawsuits arose from this case, which has been referenced in dozens of other court cases nationwide.

Anyway, the file should be at least a few hundred pages, but when I requested a copy, the only trace of it the Clerks could find (in 4 hours of searching physical and digital archives) is a one-page placeholder (and the microfilm-to-digital copy) with big stencil letters saying ""Case 12345 not on file at time of filming"". The Clerk explained to me that in 1981, all of the physical case files from 1915-1981 had been ""sent off"" to be archived to microfilm (which has all been digitized since) and that the placeholder SHOULD'VE been replaced with the original file when the physical records were put back into storage.

It strikes me as odd that the Clerk has been so taken by surprise, and apologetic, for their lack of ability to locate and produce the records to me. She said quote ""I know where it should be, but it's not. There's GOT to be something somewhere. We will keep looking but we're very understaffed.""

TL;DR - A huge case file that made the county look really bad and cost them a lot of money has gone missing. Is there a legitimate excuse for the missing file, or is it fairly safe to conclude that the file was deliberately misplaced?

"We're located in NY in the US. 

Question: Is she allowed to file a police report for harassment/slander? And if so how would this help her in court?

For context, my mom used to co-own a nail salon with another person and recently they had a falling out that led to my mom requesting her half of her investment in the salon back and leaving that particular salon. The day she left cops were called on false theft allegations. These allegations were thrown out the window by the cops due to lack of evidence.

Right after she left, her ex-co-owner (Sam, fake name) started sending false allegations of theft using out-of-context security cam footage as ""proof"" of her stealing money from the cash register to everyone she could think of. This started with Sam's personal social media accounts, which included mutual friends, strangers, etc. Following this she started threatening other local salons over hiring my mom using a contract made between them. (As far as I know, a contract was made to ensure that my mom would receive her money back by Oct 2024 and one of the stipulations was that my mom could not work in a salon within a 5-mile radius of the original salon.) Many of the salons she was contacting were outside of the 5-mile radius but due to her threats, these salons were reluctant to hire my mom because they didn't want trouble. She did eventually find a studio where she takes clients. More recently she started sending these false allegations to my mom's clients (all of whom were loyal clients from the old salon that moved with my mom). This is impacting her financially and mentally.

"Yesterday at work the supervisor in my department lost it on me. I thought I called him a bitch when I did not. He flew off the handle shouting I needed to watch my language and better not speak to him that way and kept repeating “you call me a bitch bro” while posturing like we were in a schoolyard fight. He continued to escalate while inching closer to me before another person had to take him out of the building. 

We work in the warehouse for a fairly large home decor store. There were two others present but they are all close outside of work. They are also all under 25 with our supervisor being the youngest. I am 45. 

This guy does not want the position. He was moved into it temporarily to help out but our store director will not let him return to the front end where he shines. He and I spoke about it just two days ago. We get along great until he’s feeling pressured and then this can happen. He’s there to supervise and I hold him to that standard. So when the pressure is on and we’re not meeting our goals he will zero in on me while ignoring everything the other two are doing to slow things down. 

I’m not sure what to do. This job supplements my disability so I really need to keep it. I had hoped to move into a full time management position and transition off of disability but I feel like issues like this are harming my chances. Until this new director came on it has been a very “lord of the flies” scenario in my department.

It’s toxic right now but it has the potential to change once leadership in my area of the company improve. I have applied to move into this position but as I said, I feel like issues like this are preventing upper management from allowing me to move up.

"I have been seeing my PCP since I was a teenager. I am now in my late 30’s. In my adult life, being sexually active and considered high risk, I have always asked for full STD screenings a couple times a year. 

Last year I needed to see my PCP for a regular checkup however he had no availability for months. I decided to see a different doctor there whom I had seen once in the past. We went over everything during the annual visit and I had asked for a full STD screening as well like I have asked for in the past. Blood drawn, peed in a cup and waited for the results. 

I received a call at work the following week from who I assume is a doctors assistant and she said “we have your test results back, and your positive for XXX.” (an STD). I was in shock and embarrassed and couldn’t say anything. All I could say was “ok thank you”. 

After a couple hours just thinking how the hell this is possible, I called back and tried to get my PCP on the phone, not the doctor I asked to see that day. 

He eventually called me and said it has been in my system for a long time based on the antibody counts. I wanted to discuss in person so we setup an appointment. When I went in I asked him how come this didn’t come back on past tests and he said he doesn’t test for it because of these types of reactions from patients, and that most people have this virus in their system with no symptoms. He said he could prescribe me medication to take forever if I wanted or to call if I had an outbreak and they’d give me a prescription to fill when I needed it. 

I thought this was wrong not to test for all STD’s, but I also understood not to freak someone out. 

This has affected my every day anxiety, my sex life and the relationship with my partner. I’m afraid of passing this on to them. 

I was but in Buspar shortly after to help with anxiety along with the Klonopin I am already on. 

The way I was informed and not screening me for all STD’s I am starting to think is unacceptable.

"Long story short lost 15k to a revin and stolen car. The car was given back to the original owner. The scammer is still not found by the police after months even with multiple different camera footage, ID, and her car tags. Even then it would be getting blood from stone. My city limit for small claims is 25k. I have a consultation with a lawyer next week because he was very interested in my case and said while there might not be much we can do about the scammer there is a chance we can go after her bank.

Details about what happens:

I paid with a cashier's check. I found the real vin a couple of hours after buying the car when I was cleaning it. It did not match the VIN on the title, windshield, door jams, or the scanner when I plugged it up. We did the transaction at my bank (Regions). My bank made it crystal clear they did not have that much cash on hand and normally wouldn't on a Saturday when they are open for a few hours. The scammer said she be okay since she went to her local bank (same city). After the police confirmed my suspicion the same day I called my bank and tried to get them to issue a stop payment but got misleading information from the call rep saying that only my local branch could do it not the rep on the phone. My bank does not have an emergency hotline and made me wait till Monday to talk to my store branch. On Monday I went as soon as they opened and my bank went back and forth between the branch and the customer service rep blaming each other. Then they told me they could not do anything because the scammer somehow was able to cash the check at her bank right before they closed on Saturday.

"Long story short me and this woman have been dealing with each other off and on for a couple years. Within the last year however, we’ve gotten into nasty disagreements. Never physical. We never had a physical altercation. One day however we were over my house chilling and I touched her face to get her attention. There was no bad blood or ill will at this point. After I touched her, she got extremely angry and told me not touch her again. I didn’t. However we went back and forth for what had to be about 10 minutes, and I was telling her “I could touch you if I want to, but I’m not going to because I respect you.” I guess she was extremely offended/angry at the “if I want to part” and so she kept antagonizing me to do it. It was like but not limited to “do it bitch, I dare you” or “you’re not going to do it because you’re not fucking stupid” or “if you do it I’ll kill you” so as a pride thing and to show her she wasn’t going to do any of the heinous acts she said she would do to me, I touched her. It was a simple touch of the face like the first time I touched her inoffensively. Just a touch. Not a tap, push, or mush, just a simple touch. She kept telling me to do it, so I did it. Afterwards she twisted my face with her hand. I didn’t touch her again, and we argued back and forth. Then she left. She made a few death threats through texts(the same ones she made in person, I have screenshots) then I hadnt heard from her. My sister was her student in her class. I specifically asked her to leave my sister alone, and not to talk to her about our relationship
Because my sister is literally like 9 and that it was disrupting the learning environment. I’ve had to tell her this several times. Before the disagreement, she interrogated my sister about women I have may spoke to, and my sister answered. Then she used the information my sister gave her, to harass me and incite death threats through messages. I screenshot that as well. This was weeks before the incident, however my sister texted me the day after the incident coincidentally saying “I didn’t know you guys were back together”(she only knew were together at all, or back because this woman told her. I hadn’t even known she was my sister’s teacher until the death threats) I got extremely angry and texted her. Apparently the woman had told her this weeks ago, approximately around the time I told her not to speak to her about us. She texted “mind your fucking business or get your sister out of my home room” (she’s not smart enough to realize my sister is my business lol) but this forces me and my mom to come to the school, and we resolve the situation over the phone before it escalated to her losing her job(I wish we would have!). My mom spoke to her on the phone, and her and my mom had an agreement that she would leave me alone, I would leave her alone, and she would let my sister be a child/student. I wasn’t there for the phone conversation but that’s what my mom told me and she said she agreed. A day or so later, the woman hits me up again because my mom mentioned that I was going back to my ex girlfriend for whatever reason during the conversation so that really heated the girl up. The girl is very vindictive because I told her I didnt want to be with her(I told her this from the beginning, yet she still stuck around. She was extremely deadset on my being my girlfriend and meeting my family.) My mom said she, herself  mentioned my ex briefly, and that it was a minor detail among the conversation of her being a teacher, leaving my sister alone, and leaving me alone. So despite her agreeing to leave me alone, the girl texts me twice on social media, once on Facebook and another on Instagram. I screenshot them both and then blocked her. 3 weeks pass and I hadn’t heard from her or made any contact with her. I get a restraining order. All the physical allegation s against me were 100 percent lies with the only truth being our toxic interactions. She doesn’t even mention the fact that I touched her once,the only physical contact that would have been truthful. Clearly just trying to get me in trouble. I go the restraining order hearing with my mom as a witness, the girl doesn’t show up. The judge doesn’t even give me an opportunity to head my side. I think it’s all over, and unknowing to me, without any notice. I have criminal charges pressed against me for simple battery. Everyone told me the state has just picked it up since she didn’t attended. I’ve already missed two court dates, by no fault of my own, I didn’t get any notice. By the time of the next court date, it will have almost been a year since the woman initially filed the restraining order. However because I kept missing court dates through no fault of my own, it’s been lingering this long. I gave them two addresses, and hadn’t received a letter either time. I only knew I had a court date the first time, because I pulled over and informed I had a warrant for my arrest for simple battery, but the police said, “they didn’t want me.” I got the warrant recalled the 1st time, didn’t get a letter in the mail, for the 2nd and could not get it recalled the 2nd time. I found out by the cops pulling me over, but again not taking me. I was told the jails are so full they aren’t taking anyone who doesnt have anything particularly heinous. I was informed that this time I had to turn myself in and post bail if I wanted the warrant to clear and wait for a 3rd hearing. I did that already. What should I do while awaiting my court date? I have several documents of evidence attesting to my story regarding what happened with her me my mom and my sister. Never had any priors, turned myself in, college graduate, 27, not sure if any of this means anything as mitigating factors. Actually did none of the acts listed on the restraining order.  I’m assuming the plaintiff not showing up for the criminal charges since she did not show up for the restraining order. I did nothing to this woman, and I’m pretty sure she’s only doing this because I told she’d never be anything more to me than a friend.

"Good morning y'all, TLDR at the bottom.  


Recently, Discovercard has started applying ""returned payments"" to my wife's discover card account, stating that they have attempted to complete the transaction with my bank, however our bank has ""not authorized the payment.""  


This raises a further issue, because when we got married two years ago and opened a joint checking account, we've been paying from that account since then. Looking at our bank history  ***There has not been a single successful transaction in the 2 and a half years the card has been paid off on our joint checking account.*** We have confirmations galore both on the discover app, and through email that we have successfully paid down the balance, two and a half years worth, and right before the holidays they're dropping a $3000 bomb on us out of the blue, with the potential to be in upwards of $13000 should they look all the way back to 2021. the balance in the app has gone down, she was able to charge more to the card, no issue at all. now they're backpedaling and charging all of that to her account.  


When we asked our bank ""wtf, yo?"" they said they never so much as received a transaction request, let alone denied one. the agents I worked with both said that they couldn't see anything from discover.   


we call Discover, and every agent we have spoken to is inquisitive and helpful as we look into the issue, but the moment before we get anywhere and they actually try to look at the requests and give us a reason or any info, they put us on hold, and come back completely stoney, and provide absolutely nothing. refusing to provide details of transactions, dates, trace IDs, the reason the transaction failed nothing. not just ""I dont have that info"" but ""I won't give you that informaiton"". we've offered to pay the current balance if we can get it in writing that there wont be any more returned payments and they refuse that as well.   


the legal question in this issue is pretty simple  


Is my wife, the account holder, legally entitled to the details of the transactions between her accounts?  


I live in oregon, is there a statute of limitatons on these kinds of debts that anybody knows of?

&amp;#x200B;

Do our heaps of confirmations actually give us a leg to stand on in small claims court for the balance, or would we only be able to sue for any interest/fees associated with the balance?  


And this one is totally for everyone to speculate at:  
I think they're giving us no info because I think they don't have it because *they never actually attempted to charge our bank*. Do they even have proof of the transaction attempts? and if so, if we pay the current balance of $3000 and close it now, does the resultant debt collection have any actual ground should they find the remaining $10,000?  


Tell me what you think y'all. We can pay it all outright, but I'd rather not give those dickheads a single cent of my money more than they're entitled to. ",Finance Law question!,18oj15f,1703263071.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18oj15f/finance_law_question/,
"I’ve tried looking up FMLA laws and other stuff. None of it makes sense so here I am. For context, we opened our studio in August. All instructors are considered employees and receive a W-2. We have a little under 20 employees. Some instructors and some who are other staff.

In Texas. 
I work for a medium sized music store that’s owned by a large music store. 

We offer repair services for band and orchestra instruments and charge for the repairs. 

The tech who did the repair gets paid for their labor on that instrument.

However, we do not offer those services for guitars and is not prerequisite that anyone who works there has to know how to repair the instrument they play. 

That means flutists don’t need to know how to fix flutes and if they can there is no expectation to perform that task.

That said if a customer approaches me, a salesperson who is also a guitar tech, the company expects me to perform repairs on guitars at no charge to the customer. 

The company does not compensate me for the work performed.

So I offer to our customers my services for a fair rate based on other music stores in our area.

The work is done offsite with the full consent of the customer.

The parts are purchased by the customer from the store.
I have been informed that I am not allowed to offer these services since the expectation is that I do it for free.
I am the only person at my store who can do this type of work. 

This takes me off the sales floor for the time thus limiting my earnings because while repairing a guitar I cannot help customers that I can* make a commission from if they make a purchase. (*potentially)
I would like to know just how far can the phrase “Additional duties as assigned” can be taken when it comes to hourly employees. 

If I know how to repair an instrument cable if asked do I need to bring my soldering iron? If an oboist needs a reed carved do we do it at no cost?

Finally, we do not offer these services in our company. 

There are no guitar techs on staff at the repair hubs or stores with repair shops. I happen to work at a store. 

This is a trade that requires training, tools, and expertise that is not required for the job.

In fact, there is another service that we do not officially offer - piano tuning and moving. When customers ask about this we will typically give the phone number of a local piano tuner to the customer. So there is precedent for relaying work to other entities.",“Additional duties as assigned”,18oimjh,1703261987.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18oimjh/additional_duties_as_assigned/,

"Last night I had a bit of a shock brought to my attention.

I am heavily involved in a few billiard-related tournaments and leagues in my area. One place I spend quite a bit of time at just to be around people I actually enjoy being around and in what I felt was a safe place in my area. Being a woman playing a primarily man's game where I am, it took a lot to earn the respect I have up there. 

I was also involved with a man who worked there, at first things were great. We did typical couple things but it was a complicated relationship, we weren't together but he wanted to be and I wanted to remain single and focus on myself. We have been arguing a lot due to my time schedule and my inability to come see him lately. He's been mean, and finally said he was done with me but was upset I didn't feel like fighting with him to get back together. 

About a month ago, he sent me a link to a porn with a woman who looked very similar to me but wasn't me. I argued with him back and forth for a few hours trying to point out any detail I could to prove it wasn't me - a big one being that she was a little more tan than me and he knees didn't have the scarring that mine do due to a motorcycle accident. A week or 2 later, he did the same thing with pictures he found online, I'd sent him a nude in a specific pose and this girl was in the same pose with the same color underwear as me. It was not me though. 

Now, last night I was playing in the billiard tournament I go to every week. I got to talking with a friend and his girlfriend, who I really don't know the girlfriend well, and she approached me saying ""I saw some shit about you."" and proceeds to bring up the porn video. I later approached another friend of mine and asked him if he heard something about a video and he said he heard about it but he saw some pictures. 

I am devastated. First off, I don't know if the picture I actually sent was shared around this pool hall but also because there is porn and pictures of some women who do look similar to me but aren't, floating around and people are believing it is me. Now, even if he only shared with things he found online, that are not me, people think they have seen my naked body, that they have seen me having sex in a video. 

I've never, ever been in this situation and I never thought I would be. But I'm so embarrassed and have cried quite a bit since. People think they have seen me in such a vulnerable state. I will be scheduling an appointment with my therapist about this in a bit because I really am having a hard time processing it. I am afraid that this has changed how people view me and I am afraid of people's intentions now that they have seen this. Is...there anything I can do about this?

"I'm going through a divorce in Houston.  My wife ran off with my kids and I hired an attorney.  My attorney was basically useless and kept suggesting we just need to wait.  After a few months of this I found out that the law firm had held a consultation with my wife and sent her to an attorney that used to work at their firm.  

Due to all this, I found another attorney who has been great.  She confirmed my concerns about the conflict of interest so I fired the previous attorney and requested a refund.  They met with me and offered my retainer back $2300 remaining and a $600 refund.  I said to return the retainer and not the refund because I want it all back and will be looking into my options.  This was a bad move on my part because their toon changed and they started billing me for work I didn't want them to do.  I let them know that they were fired and not on the case and they told me that by law they had to keep working on the case until the court approved the substitution of attorney.  During this time they pulled out another $100 from my account to keep the retainer full.  Once the substitution was approved I contacted them and they said they would give me my retainer back in a month.  

That brings us to now, I just got a call from their collections department asking me to pay them $2300.  They said they did so much work that the retainer was now empty and I owed them now.  I never saw any of this work, and all of it was after I sent them in writing that they were fired.  

I've reached out to a few legal malpractice attorneys and they all said my case isn't a high enough dollar value for them to take it.  One suggested I file a grievance with the state bar.  

That is where I am now, I've started filing it and it tells me I can't file against a law firm but just individual attorneys.  The problem is, my attorney didn't meet with my wife as far as I know.  The work done after they were fired was done with multiple attorneys and I don't know who all ""worked"" on it.  I also am having a hard time finding the attorneys within the Texas Bar's search feature which is making filing this hard as well.  

Do I just file for every attorney who works there?  I'm lost, overwhelmed and don't know what to do.

"I saw a new doctor in June for my annual wellness exam. Most of the time was spent giving my medical history to the receptionist and a nurse. The doctor spent 5-10 minutes with me and checked my ears, heartbeat, and lungs. I remained dressed the entire appointment. They had my blood drawn at the end of the appointment. 

The doctor uses an online portal to report test results and notes. I was surprised to see notes about a thorough examination I “received”, and supposed medical conversations and advice that did not occur. I chalked it up to it being a new patient visit. However, I just went in for a required six month appointment (required to get refills on my prescriptions for chronic conditions) and I again see notes in my record about a thorough physical examination and a detailed conversation about my medications that did not occur. I saw a different doctor in the practice this time and she was in the room with me for just 1.5 minutes. I know this because I videotaped it on my phone just in case. The only “exam” I received was by the nurse, who took my blood pressure and weighed me. 

Is this legal? Is this doctor scamming my insurance? It must be across the practice since the same thing happened with two different doctors. Besides switching to a different practice, what should I do, if anything?

"Hi I am seeking legal advice for my partner who ended up having complications from a simple procedure on Tuesday at NewYork-Presbyterian David H. Koch Center.
Tuesday morning my partner went in for a R-CPD injection (Botox injection in her throat) to enable her to burp. She has never burped her whole life and she found out about this procedure a few months ago. It’s a simple 15min appointment where she would have to go under anesthesia. The only side effect was a soar throat that would subside in a few days, then she should be burping up a storm. We were excited for this hilarious after effect in a few days time. 

She was taken in to her appointment Tuesday morning, about 35mins later the surgeon comes out and tells me “everything went fine, however there was an accident she made, and there is a small laceration she made in her neck that required stitches”. She said not to worry and that she might be a little more soar but will take an extra few days to heal. 

When my partner came out she was in a lot of pain in her throat so they gave her a pain killer and Tylenol to take. They said the spitting up blood and spit should stop within 12 hours and the neck pain in 2 days.
They checked us out and we went home. For the rest of the day she was not able to keep down anything other than a few sips of water which she later would spit up. The blood got less and less but the gagging did not. She also said she was experiencing back/shoulder/ and chest stiffness and pain every time she moved. I reported this to her surgeon who said that’s normal for post recovery for this procedure. Hours went by and she still wasn’t able to drink much and only a little ice cream went down. The next day she felt just as bad and I was getting worried that she was getting dehydrated. I talked to the doctor again and she said to let her know if there are signs of infection then we can go to the ER. She wasn’t sure what the body pain was about, other than our thought that it could be a bad reaction to the anesthesia. That night she got a temperature of 100.0, we were about to go in to the ER, but she took two Motrin and her temperature went down to 98.8, so we thought it would be okay. By the next morning she still wasn’t getting liquids down and was in pain, we decided she needed IV, so we packed up and went to the ER. 

The doctor said she called the residents there to let them know the situation. We check in at 11 and we are waiting in the ER all day until a doctor finally sees her at 9PM (American healthcare). In that time she only got two IVs, blood work and a cat scan. By the time the doctor finally told us what was going on she said that from the laceration, it created air in her neck which is causing the bad pain. (Btw she has been unable to talk this entire time from the surgery). She would have to stay 2-3 days/ at worse 2 weeks to make sure the hole closes up and the air gets reabsorbed back in. My partner and I would never have known this was a possibility and we are frankly angry that the surgeon for making a mistake like this from a simple procedure. She just got into a room Thursday night at 2am and I’m wondering if we have any legal legs to stand on. The doctor has been checking in but she’s going on vacation and will be out of touch from here on out. I would think the hospital will at least pay the bills for the mistake the surgeon made!

Prior to this we didn't even have to provide an image of a test, however yesterday I did send my positive test after receiving the policy change email and that seemed sufficient for yesterday's work from home but I had to put.

"I am wondering if it is worth it at this point to speak with a lawyer. I was dumb and deleted my former post but I will recap here. 

I had been on an antidepressant since the winter of 2021. It wasn’t amazing but it was a baseline. The pcp I went to for my annual exams to keep my script up to date separated from the clinic. I wasn’t notified(I’m not upset and I don’t know if it’s required but I’m including all the info I can). 

I called in my last refill before my annual exam was due on a Wednesday and when I hadn’t gotten any texts saying my meds were ready by Friday, I reached out. I was told that my script was “canceled” and that I could get more info than they could by calling the clinic. I called. I was met with someone with an attitude that I was due for my annual anyway. I said I would schedule but I needed my medication. She then informed me that the pcp I saw is no longer with the clinic, I’d have to see someone new. Fine. The earliest I could get in was the following thursday(yesterday now as I’m writing this). I asked what could be done about the medication. She said she’d send a message to the new pcp to see if he would cover the meds but that could take up to two business days. And given that they canceled the script, the pharmacy wouldn’t be able to give me any of my medication to get me to my appt. 

So I spent the whole weekend sick(it may sound fast but this is an SNRI that I notice the next day if I forgot a dose. It sucks). I was dizzy, nauseous, lightheaded, irritable, etc.

Monday comes, and I had an eval with a new psychiatrist who ends up prescribing something different, and says that while I’m off the med already(though unadvisable to quit cold turkey, not my fault) that I should just stay off it. 

Thursday rolls around. The new pcp states he never received a message about getting my meds refilled or he would have signed off immediately. 

I know this is long winded I’m sorry. 

So where I’m curious here, do I have a legal leg to stand on with this? I know that they can withhold meds until you get in for exams, I get that. But I was basically forced into withdrawals of a med that will continue to kick my ass for 1-3 weeks(Cymbalta withdrawals is a whole freaking beast), during the holidays, with my birthday coming up on Wednesday. I know those things aren’t controllable, but I’m a wreck, crying and angry and sick.  I know it wasn’t illegal but it’s so damn sketchy to just be able to do this to people. Any medical professional tells you that you need to taper off mental health drugs gradually so you don’t get slammed by withdrawals but I was forced into withdrawals because I was due at the beginning of the month/year for an exam…. Please be kind, but I appreciate the advice

TLDR: Med refill withheld to fulfill upcoming annual exam, forced into withdrawal from Cymbalta, legal but unethical af. Advice?

"My mother lives in Florida and works as an LNA through an agency.

"&gt;*tldr: ex defames me in small industry, lost job offer, I show him evidence he is lying and say if he continues to defame me I will expose the truth. I ask for apology, explanation and a positive reference, he sends me c&amp;d for sexual harassment, BLACKMAIL and defamation??? HELP! Do not want the drama, I just want him to admit the truth so we can both move on in the TRUTH.* 

This is a bit of a long one but I (F35) am freaking out a bit here… My former close friend, colleague and sexual partner (M36) cut off contact with me in August. For context: We worked together for a year. I was his direct supervisor. We were both upper management in the same department.  In September of 2022 we had to take a work trip 2 hours away. We stopped for a beer after our work was complete on the way back. He made physical contact with me. We later ended up hanging out late into the evening talking and drinking. One thing led to another and against my better judgement we kissed. Everything was 💯 consensual. In fact we ended up continuing a sexual relationship on and off until July 2023. There was a period of time where he wanted to be my “person.” Things were complicated with his home situation and we worked together, I was his boss so it was always a little but murky and our friendship/sexual relationship was a secret at work but he knew my friends outside of work. 

We were very close, shared everything and had a genuinely strong connection. Everything was consensual. I did let him take a lot of time off of work that wasn’t documented and I may have been easy on him when he made mistakes at work because I didn’t want to punish him too hard and face retaliation. 

In May 2023 he put in notice that he would be leaving the company in 45 days. He wrote a 7 page long resignation letter about why he was leaving which had to do with the c-suite, the workload, lack of appreciation and also his father has a terminal illness and he wanted to move home. He himself was suffering from a mental illness and needed time to decompress. He wanted to sell his house, move home and live off the money for a while traveling with his sick father. Before his official last day of work we made plans to travel together for a kayak trip with my friends. He and I went up early to the mountains for some time alone at a nice hotel and my friends met us the following day for camping and kayaking. We had an amazing trip. He stayed at my house for several nights the following weeks as his floors were being redone to sell his house. 

The last time I saw him on July 27th we had an argument when he came to pick up some belongings from my house. I believe he started the argument because on July 15th he had met someone new and he didnt know how to end things with me properly.  I tried to discuss the argument with him and he stopped returning my calls and text messages. He blew off a backpacking trip we had planned with another friend for August 15th 2023. Finally August 30th 2023 he contacted me saying that I will no longer be a part of his life’s journey because I called him too many times while he was ghosting me - I was genuinely worried about him and he never told me not to contact him again. Only that I will no longer be a part of his journey. 

He still had a ton of my personal belongings that were just for him to borrow, while I did give him gifts throughout our friendship  there were lots of items he had of mine that were not gifts. I reached out to apologize a lot for any times of stress I was going thru or attitude I had about him leaving -“ I was sad and maybe my emotions didn’t come out right when he was preparing to move… and can I please have my items? “ I sent him my address 100s of times and he read the messages but claimed never to see them. 

I was laid off from the company we both worked at in November and continued to try to get my stuff back. Finally, after 4 months of No Contact and holding my things hostage he called me in December to ask for my address and he sent me my items. After receiving them I had an obgyn appt and had an irregular pap, testing positive for HPV - a cancerous strain. I knew he had ghosted me because he had met another woman shortly before moving home who has been stalking my Instagram and LinkedIn accounts since August (F45). I reached out to him about the HPV because his new girlfriend is probably high risk at her age. I know I got it from him as he has been my only sexual partner in 3 years and all annual tests have been negative. 

After reaching out about HPV diagnosis I was on my way to accept an offer for a new job closer to where he lives (1.5 hrs from our former work). I was called by my recruiter as I was driving to be told they were rescinding my offer because they knew my old employee who accused me of “punishing him by making him work weekends and never giving him pto.” Not true at all. Honestly perhaps the opposite that I gave him too much time off… also we are exempt employees and had to work nights and weekends if that’s what it took to get the job done. Our industry is small and I lost out on a 6 figure job because of his lies. So I reached out and told him he better tell me what the fuck was going on cuz he needs to stop talking shit as I have proof he is slandering. 

I told him I have Numerous texts of him thanking me for being the best boss he has had, thanking me for time off etc. When I first started at my old job this ""friend"" had reported my predecessor to me for not allowing him time off, over working him, and selling cocaine to associates, and being high on cocaine and weed at work. I 100% believed him at the time but employees spoke out to me that my friend was in-fact making these stories up. And now he is doing the same thing to me he did to my predecessor. I was upset about these false accusations and when I threatened to expose the truth the next time I heard one of these made up stories he called me non stop all day long. I asked him to please let me gather my thoughts and sent him an email of what was happening from my perspective. During this time the cyber stalking from his new current girlfriend got worse. She was searching my linkedin profile every 6 hours for days. 

Last night I told him that I was ready to discuss things now and tried calling him. Every time I called his girlfriend picked up. Finally I said, look I am going to file a slander lawsuit and cyberstalking unless you can give me some good reasons and a written recommendation discrediting what you have been saying about me to potential employers as you cost me a lot of money with your lies. His girlfriend then informed me I will be receiving legal paperwork. 

I got an email a few hours ago with a ""cease and desist"" saying I caused him harm, I wrongfully terminated him, I was stalking him (we live hours away from each other and I do not follow him on any social media platform) and I sexually harassed him. I immediately informed my local police who happened to be on my road dealing with a medical emergency. I then got a lawyer who is serving papers next week (Merry Christmas). I also sent his lawyer a lot of evidence of a consensual relationship, a good working environment, acknowledgement that I was a good boss, etc. and screenshots of his girlfriend repeatedly stalking me for months at a time ( I never once visited her profile and she looked at mine daily). I really DO NOT WANT TO GO TO COURT. 

I just want him to admit that he is lying and I want him to get my name out of his mouth and his new woman's mouth. I want him to write me an honest letter of recommendation or a linkedin review or something that publicly refutes the claims he made, and I FOR SURE want any mention of sexual harassment rescinded and destroyed. THIS GUY IS RUINING MY LIFE. What do I do here? He has no proof and I have a ton of evidence to back me up as well as witnesses to our CONSENSUAL relationship and how much vacation time and days off he actually took while we were employed together.

"My parents came from africa to visit me on the holidays, I've been studying in LA living on my own for two years and they used to live here and had me 21 years ago. Anyways they surprised me with a trip to vegas with them since they wanna experience some nostalgia from 20 years ago there and have a fun time with me in general. First of all I didn't step foot in vegas ever and never kne how much of a scam fest it is but we found that out 30 min after setting foot in our hotel.
We are by no means rich so they were so happy telling me that they got a 3 night stay for quite cheap off the strip in ""circus circus hotel"" and we could just drive over with my car from there to the strip and other tourist attractions here, sounds all good so far . Apparently what they didn't tell me and i found this out later the hotel booking was done on a 3rd party site booking.com for 202$ for 2 rooms and after the fact i found out that they spent a month going through other ads for hotels that had expensive fees and such that would need to be charged on arrival , the one they booked had no mention of any fees anywhere on the ad (thank god we have a screenshot) and even says all taxes and fees included in that 202$  they paid, they even sent a message to the websites customer support before finalizing the booking to make sure that that amount was all they would need to pay for the hotel (no screenshots or conversation history available one our end but it should be on theirs) 
Welp here's how it went, we got to the hotel parcked and started checking in , my mother was in the lobby with our stuff and me and my father were speaking with the reception guy (i need to do most of the talking since their english isn't great) we begin by giving them my father's 0assport he made the booking with and i try giving him the booking number but he brushes me off and says they only deal with names, the guy pulls up that we have two rooms and says there's gotta be a security deposit for each room, seems normal so far so my father says yes and pulls his card to pay but as he's about to swipe i ask the dude again what are we paying exactly since he didn't even tell us what the deposit was at this point his reply is (25$ deposit per night per room and remaining room fees) he said that shit lightning quick i caught the deposit part and started counting not caring too much about the rest of the sentence since i didn't know anything about the booking details at that point i thought maybe they paid a portion online and they know they're paying the rest now. Welp and so my dather inserts his credit card seeing it was a 194$ charge he thought at this point that it's both rooms deposit in a single charge but the reception guy asks him to remove and do it again for the second room and my dad started pushing back at this point hut me as an idiot who never saw the charge and thought everything was above board rncouraged my dad to pay and said its just the deposit for the second room they'll give it back and so my father paid another 194$ in the sapn of 2 seconds. He looked up his transactions while we were having lunch outside later and got stunned by those two heavy charges on there and we started hoping that this was just a deposit that we'll get back so we rushed to the reception to ask them and they seemed like they've been through this exact scenario a million times. Talking to them was rough for my parents they knew exactly how to snake around everything and explained that they processed a 39$ resort fee per day per room that was NEVER mentioned anywhere on the online ad nor face to face while we were paying he just slid it in conversation to save his ass while we were talking about the deposit fees not even the amount we were gonna pay or the words resort fees. We grt into a bit of an argument with the front desk they call a sadsy manager to deal with us that done this before and she tells us to check the booking but their page on booking.com was changed during this whole ordeal it now miraculously mentions a 120$ resort fee that never was there when we paid and the booking.com support we called myltiple times , explained the situation but it doesn't seem will lead anywhere i even started doubting if they were real support or a call center that's in on the scam. After the altrecation they kept our stuff hostage as both our keys became dysfunctional when went up to our rooms and they demanded a resolution from us then and there the options they prsented were just eat the fee and finish our stay or get charged for the night and the night's resort fee and just leave that night or tomorrow morning with nowhere to go.

"One of my relatives passed away a few years ago.  They didn’t have a will so their entire estate went to probate and ended up being passed down to her surviving relatives.  The family members closest living next of kin is the executor but his wife is more take charge (the person that passed away didn’t care for her) and she took it upon herself to clean the house out and trap and take animals to the shelter.  2 years go by, and the final paperwork gets sent in the mail.  As I’m going through the inventory section, I see that she has billed the estate almost $105,000 and 150/hr  for cleaning out  the house and taking care of the animals before taking them to a shelter(she drew this out for 2 years) I then decided to ask the lawyer for a more detailed account of what exactly she’s billing the estate for as there is no logical explanation for that much money being billed to the estate.  It took over a week to produce an inventory with a prior  a text from this family member saying we have to hurry and can we just ask her the questions directly.  No.  We cannot.  Something shady is going on and I know it in my gut. This is not the first sign of greed and conniving behavior this person has shown.  She is claiming that she charged the estate this much because that’s her rate as a “consultant” in her job and the attorney told her she could charge her hourly rate.   She charges this rate by the way for driving  to and  from the house of  the deceased, and feeding the cats ( saying it takes 30 minutes to do so) I am beyond disgusted and don’t know what to do.  If I hire a lawyer and litigate, it could cost upwards of 30k and she can charge the estate for her legal fees and if she wins, she doesn’t have to pay the money back and I lose that money.

"Immigrant friend needs help

Friend has lived in CA since 5 years old, now 28 years old. Got married to citizen, but currently separated on bad terms. Not officially divorced. Currently not in contact with each other. Married 3 years now. 

While going back in dating pool, friend meets crazy girl. Girl gets drunk, scratches arm, friend removes hand by wrists. Friend is sober. Friend calls cops to remove her from vehicle. Does not disclose scratches on arm, cops see red wrist on girl, friend gets battery charge, girl gets sent to drunk tank. Girl bails friend out. 

Case still open, although looks like it’ll be dropped based on details. Friend is scared of being deported. 

Girl then makes threats to call ICE on friend if he does not pay back fees for bail under her name. Girl forces friend to live with her + pay her rent, without adding friend to lease - and under terms of threat. Friend pays rent out of fear, and drives around for her. Friend prioritized rent, then got car repoed. Friend relies on car for money. Girl pays to get car off repo, widening his debt with her. Girl had money for rent, but continues to extort friend for money/services. 

What is best for friend to do? 

This is clearly extortion of an immigrant by threatening to notify ICE over money.",Help : extortion of immigrant act CA,18ob9ci,1703238252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18ob9ci/help_extortion_of_immigrant_act_ca/,
"My roommates and I have moved out of our previous apartment on October 29, 2023. We should have received our security deposit and list of deductions by November 19, 2023. We called and followed up with them about a week after Nov 19, to which we discovered they didn’t send it to the right address, the claimed to have fixed it and tried to send it again. We followed up with them again via phone call the first week of Dec bc we still hadn’t received it and they said we should get it by about Dec. 15th. Dec 15th passed and nothing. We called them again and went to voicemail, so I sent them an email essentially saying it’s been more than 21 days and we still don’t have our deposit and we are now demanding a full refund of our entire deposit. To which they responded with

“Hello, 

I reviewed your account, and it looks like a deposit refund was issued on 11/2/23, and a re-issued check was also sent on 11/27/23 with an updated apartment number. The check was mailed to [current address].  If you have trouble receiving mail at your new address, I can have the check stopped and re-issued, mailing it to our office for you to pick up. Please let me know which you prefer, and I will let our corporate office know. Thank you. “

I would like to make it clear I had emailed them the correct new address before October 29th and they said they would adjust it and I even called them to be sure, all within the month of October.

I just feel like we deserve the full refund at this point and I’m afraid if I just agree to pick it up at the office it won’t be that full refund. It has been nearly 2 months since we’ve moved out of there and I really doubt the post office would have the same issue multiple times with delivering our mail.

"WARNING⚠️. Long post ahead! Please bear with me. Using a dummy account for additional protection. Not sure if the people involve are using this platform.

My EX boyfriend (M 34) and  I (F 28) were in an on again and off again relationship for 9 years. He had a son with his ex gf before me but they were already separated when I met him. I thought he is the one already since we're really compatible with each other and we had our fair share of ups and downs.

But within that 9 years, since I was too trusting of him, we started taking n*de videos and he assured me that he deleted all of it. (This is a crucial info for later)

Fast forward, things got rocky and he broke up with me saying that he was tired of all our fights and that he wanted to get back with his baby mama. I begged him not to leave me, and told him I'll be okay being his mistress. So he got back with his Baby Mama and we continued with our relationship in secret.

Until I found out that I was pregnant. So I confronted him about it, only to discover that her baby mama, recently delivered their second child. This was the point that I left him for good. And I returned home to my parents. (Classic, I know)

I had our son and I never contacted him again. I never asked for child support since my parents do not want him in my son's life. Until, my son turned 1. 

We got reconnected (can't remember how) and he was asking if he could see the child. I said no, and that he would have to prove himself first before he could see our son. We started dating again. Our communication was mainly thru chat texts and calls since I was working and can't find a schedule to meet. We did meet up a few times but it was really rare due to my schedule being really chaotic. Until, her ex GF contacted me, asking me where he is and told me that they were still living together and is going through some issues and that she was pregnant again for the third time!

So, I broke up with him again and asked him to try and patch things up with the girl. So we lost contact and I avoided him for good. I stayed single, focused on my kid and my career and was able to find a good man eventually.

Everything is really great. My current BF (M 36) was close to my kid and I was closed to his. We have jobs and was able to go on vacations with the kids. 

Until recently, I was on my way to my BF's apartment when he texted me, that he is still at work and I won't be able to go inside since he accidentally brought the keys with him. So I decided to wait for him at a near coffee shop. And I saw Ex BF there with his second son. 

We talked for a bit when I decided to leave. He told me they were leaving too, so we headed to the exit and I let him go first since he was with a kid and I was following them. We were still inside the store and he was reaching for the door when suddenly he stopped at his tracks and turned to me and told me to go back to our seats and that he needed help. 

He explained that someone who he recently got into a fight with was outside and he was sure that they are waiting for him. He begged me to stay with him until he can call someone to pick him up and that he would leave his son with me to make sure his son stays safe incase they would cause a commotion and he would just meet us back in his apartment. 

So I stayed with him while he was trying to call someone. After a few minutes, his baby mama, stormed into the store with police  and was demanding to give her the child. So he gave him the child, and when she looked at me,  she shouted at me saying she'll make sure to drag my name for the cases she was about to file against my ex BF.

I left the place and my ex BF followed me apologizing for what happened and was able to contact me thru a social media platform that I didn't know that he had an account.

I proceeded to my BF's apartment and told him everything what happened. I thought things would be better if he heard what happened from me than hearing and knowing about it from other people. But we got into a fight, so I decided to go home to calm things down. 

After a few hours, ny EX BF contacted me  saying that my current boyfriend reached out to his baby mama and apparently was really angry. I contacted him about it and he is insisting we break up. I was not able to read their conversation since he wont let me see it so I let it go and agreed to what he wants. 

Weeks pass, and my EX bf, (father of my kid) started to patch things up with me. Saying he wanted to try settling down with me but he just wants to make sure that he would be able to visit and spend time with his sons even if they are not together with the mom anymore. Everything was fine and by this time, I was the one paying mostly with the finances of the household.(meals, grocery and etc) since my salary was a bit bigger than his and he still needs to send money  for the kids even if they are not with him. Since the girl is jobless. This lasted for a few weeks, and we decided to request for a conference with her ex gf to talk about the custody of their children. But as soon as she discovered that we were trying to patch things up between us, his ex GF filed for a protection order against him prohibiting him from seeing the kids.

I know how important his kids to him. So, he started to settle things again between him and his baby mama. This stained our relationship again and I told him once more, to go and fix things with her again. Even if the thought of him leaving me again pains me, I know I'll be okay since I got my kid with me. If he wanted to fight for us, he would loose his kids with her. So I accepted the situation and was ready to focus on my career and kid again.

Now this is the part where he started to blackmail me. He started asking money from me. I said no since I don't have any obligations to pay anything related to his needs since we were not together anymore. He should ask moeny from her not me. Then he informed me that somehow the girl was able to see our personal videos when we were still together. I don't know how, but she did. And because the girl was really angry with me because of what happened in coffee shop, the girl wants to leak those videos and post it on social media platforms. He is saying that he'll let the girl post it on social media if I dont give him the money that he wants. So I stood my ground saying that if they will post those videos, I'll file charges againts them.

He was still intimidating me, so I decided to file a report and requested a conference with them to settle things. Unfortunately we were not able to talk since my ex kept on missing the appoitment. And the worker advised me, they will issue a certificate to file action if he keeps on missing the appointment  and I'll be able to charge him.

This is what I'm confused about. I got a news that my ex boyfriend is confident that they could just deny the existence of the videos since it was a long time ago and the case will be dismissed. And it would be impossible to prove that they have the videos and that it was stored in the girls icloud account. 

All I have right now are screenshots of our conversation that he was blackmailing me. Will this screenshots be enough for me to file a case? I also have screenshots of conversations that he admitted that the girl has the videos.",My Ex-boyfriend tried to blackmail me.,18ob38k,1703237520.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18ob38k/my_exboyfriend_tried_to_blackmail_me/,

"Last week I went to the Emergency Room because I was having a miscarriage. I was bleeding out in line. I went to the nurse checking in and I was put on a wheel chair and pushed back into line and was told to let them know if I felt like I was going to pass out. I told her I was going to pass out and I couldn’t handle the pain. She said sorry and left me in line. 30 minutes of agonizing pain my husband went back to the nurse and he brushed him off. He told him that I was bleeding, but the nurse said because I wasn’t 20 weeks I needed to wait. About 1 hour later, I was bleeding out in line. I was soaked in blood and miscarriage tissue, even my wheel chair had blood on it. I was throwing up at that point and lost all color in my face. My husband went back to the nurse and he finally told him to bring me up to the front and somebody checked me out. When they realized how much I was bleeding they finally took me in. They eventually took out what they needed to and discharged me. They told me to take iron supplements and that was it. Over the weekend, I had absolutely no energy… couldn’t walk the restroom without being out of breath. I was exhausted from eating. The iron supplements killed my GI system on top of everything. 

I made an appointment with my primary on Monday and she told me I was anemic due to the blood loss from waiting in the ER and sent me straight to the ER to get a blood transfusion. She was stunned at the way they made me wait and told me they shouldn’t have told me to take iron supplements because my anemia isn’t necessarily from being iron deficient, but from the blood loss I had in the ED. She said I needed a blood transfusion on the same day I originally went in. 

The miscarriage was so hard as it was. Then having nurses not listen to my pain was just the cherry on top. I’m so traumatized by the care, pain, and blood I’m scared to try again.

"Located in MD.

Ex husband and I have been separated since March 2023 and officially divorced since October. We've agreed on a 50/50 custody.

Ever since COVID, he's had an on and off relationship with drugs, namely dxm, mushroom, weed, sometimes ketamine. In April, he suffered from psychosis because in his own words, took too much mushrooms and refused to sleep for 5 days. It was a really hectic time, constant harassment, and he ended up in a car accident. They expunged it because of the psychosis. But a week before that, I had filled out an emergency petition because he had called me, saying someone broke in and called the police himself and yelled at us that we were lying about him calling us. Shit show. Then he had the car accident and he was kept at the mental institution for 1.5 months and deemed okay, so he was released.

Back to two days ago, it's his week and our 7 yr old daughter calls me in tears to rush over and get her because he was being weird. Granted, she has never called me crying like this or claiming his weird so I knew something was up. Thank God I was home so I was there within 10 mins. He was indeed, under the influence, with what, not sure maybe a large dose of mushrooms. He has this look in his eyes, where he just stares without blinking, eyes open, and starts mocking or oh-ing and ah-ing to whatever you say. She claims he accused her of eating glue, he was following her around the house asking ""who are you"" ""You're not my daughter"" ""this is not reality"". When I got there, he kept trying to reach for her, and then asked ""Where if she?"" Numberous times despite her being right next to him. I have a 7 minute video of him interacting with us (a lot of it is his feet bc I was afraid he would take my phone since he took her tablet while she was cideo chatting me while I was driving over), and at some point you hear her cry because he snaychef a birthday card she made her friend and started to crumbled it and laughed. He also suffers from MDD and PTSD so him on drugs doesn't help that. My daughter ran to my car and wanted to come home with me and as a responsible mother, I took her.

He called numerous times, and I answered the first three times. He kept asking why I abducted her, what happened, etc. She spoke to him and repeated the story 18 times and he kept saying ""what?"" ""This isn't my daughter.""

Yesterday afternoon, he tried to pick her up from school but I ended up getting there before him, he lied to the school about some girls threatened to shot our daughter, once again, I assume he was under the influence. It's technically still his week but I wasn't going to let some drug addict take her.

He ambushed us at her friends party yesterday, seeming somewhat normal, although he had told me Wednesday night he had no intentions of going but he knew we would be there. After the party, he starts gas lighting my daughter saying she never explained herself, he never spoke to her, he was just being silly and playing around, he wasn't the one who crumbled the birthday card, it was her. Etc just straight up lies. He also admitted to our daughter that he had ""taken a lot of medicine that day but it shouldn't have affected him."" His bootleg therapist considers his drug usage medicine. 
I told him I have a video of the interaction and he wants to see it but I haven't sent it yet. Should I?

What in the world do I do? I know we have a legal agreement and I know I took her on his days but it was for her safety. She was in teats and uncomfortable and choose to be with him. But he certainly broke the parental agreement of being under the influence while with her. How do I go about this?

"Hi, I had a attorney consultation scheduled for today and got no showed, so trying to get any advice from here. 

I was renting a house, vacated it 2 months ago, and the landlord did not provide any itemized deduction. He said he will return the deposit in 21 days when we met at the property for the inspection. I texted him about returning deposit, he responded that he will but never did. I've sent emails and called, he just ignores now. I've sent a demand letter just now, which will arrive next week. 

I read up on the relevant clause and think this should be a straight forward small claims case. But what I'm just so shocked is how the landlord can be so bold and choose to not return the deposit.

"Hi all, I have been on temporary disability and thus leave from work due to a serious injury.

When I left work to go on leave, I was a top performer in my commission based role at a very large company and I have seniority over half my team.

I got the lowest possible raise and I know many others who are “under achievers” by company standards made more than double in their raise than I did.

It seems like discrimination to come back from leave and get the smallest raise they dole out despite having consistently been a top performer. 

If there was any performance issue, I’m not aware of it as my manager has never even given me a formal review in the years I’ve been in the role. I doubt there was any issue, as our work has meticulous metrics we must meet - so we are constantly reviewing our own stats as they pertain to quotas.

- i left telling the mechanic he has lost a customer

"Hello, I am in Maryland, USA. I had someone I know personally, but not well, move in to my spare room after my previous roommate moved out. I needed the financial assistance.
Things were fine at first, but as he has gotten more comfortable, things have gotten worse. Lately he has been very angry and not controlling it. Stomping around, slamming objects, slamming doors, screaming (not at me, but loud enough for me to hear). Earlier I overheard him talking in his room (I think he may of been praying) and said something along the lines of “help me before I kill someone and regret it every minute I’m in that cell.” Some more yelling after that. 
Another thing to note: We had what I think was a homeless person cut through our backyard and my roommate was completely freaked out and mentioned that he should get a gun to protect the house.
I have a 4 year old child who also doesn’t need to be exposed to this. I’ve locked both of us in my room for the night.  

He is not on my lease, my landlord knows he is living here but was never put on the lease. But he has lived here since July, so I know he legally has to have at least 30 days notice.
What worries me is this: He wanted to apply for government assistance when he moved in, and needed proof of how much he pays in rent. I didn’t want to put him on the lease, so I created a sublease agreement contract stating how much he pays so he could use it for the applications. I didn’t realize at the time that that sublease agreement states the sublease is for a year. My actual lease states I cannot sublease.
Is the sublease contract I gave to him valid since I technically am not allowed to sublease? Or am I stuck with him living here until July?

"Back in January I was hired by a company and I was working there until I got laid off for seemingly no reason around late July. I later found out the company underwent budget cuts, so I assumed that was the reason, but I never knew for sure. I never slacked on work nor did I have any issues with the company so it was very sudden and strange. My last payment came in on August 1st and everything was fine until 2 weeks later I kept getting paid. I was curious and read through my contract and there was no mention of any post-termination compensation or severance pay or anything of the sort. I asked friends about this and most said it might be some sort of severance pay. I assumed this was the case and just let it be. 

This went on for the rest of the year until a few days ago when I received an email from said company asking me to repay them the overpayment. They said they just realized this and are asking me to repay around 10k back to the company. The issue isn’t so much paying it back, but whether I am legally required to do so.

"A few days ago, I(m27) left my work late in the evening (junior high band concert) to go to my brother’s 27th birthday party. An hour into our arrival (around 9pm) he was told by his neighbor that there were gunshots heard in the area, and that police had closed off the exit to the apartment complex. We(my pregnant gf(f30) and son (m2)) waited around a half hour and that was about the time that we were told the police opened up the exit, so we decided to leave. 

As we were exiting the complex, we noticed the police officers standing in a small mob, one armed with what seemed like a heavy rifle, and they all stared at our vehicle as we were exiting. We thought that was incredibly odd and were disturbed but we kept going anyway. We also noticed a man on the ground in handcuffs but we figured they had caught their perpetrator. Not ten seconds after traveling west, the police officers followed after us and I pulled over thinking I committed some sort of traffic violation. As the cop pulls over, you can hear a loud voice yelling “put your hands on the vehicle”. They then ordered me to get out of the vehicle with my hands in the air. Sadly, my parents and sister were in a vehicle driving the same path and they witnessed me with my hands in the air as I was being ordered by the police , as they pointed a gun at me, to approach them slowly. My family pulls over, but now I have no clue what’s going on as I am terrified of what will happen to my family, my girlfriend and son. 

The police force me into handcuffs, pat me down to search for weapons, I think, and proceed to put me into a police vehicle. From a distance, I can see my girlfriend being approached by a police officer, and my parents being approached in the vehicle ahead of them as well. I ask why they are arresting me and I’m told “you’re not being arrested, you’re being detained”. The officer tells me two things that don’t seem to add up, one being that the man in handcuffs told the officers that I was the one who shot the gunshots that were heard earlier, and another reason being that I “matched the description”. 

Not only a few minutes later, I hear the officer say “it’s not him” and one of the officers apologizes profusely as he puts his large rifle away in the trunk of his vehicle. I ask for their badge numbers and proceed to talk to these police officers about how idiotic their decision was to conduct themselves this way, and they double down on their behavior, saying they were doing their “due diligence”. I ask them for their badge numbers, curse a few words and walk away. My parents are doing the same to a different officer. We drive away and pull over together shortly after. 

More details about the incident reveal themselves as I am told that the police officer pointed a large rifle at my girlfriend and son as he searched the vehicle through the window, and forced my pregnant girlfriend to keep her hands in the air. She believes that through the tears and fear he saw in the eyes of herself and my son that it motivated him to put his arms away. He then explains to her that they were in the process of an investigation, and that apparently a women involved in the aforementioned gunshots mentioned that a person in a vehicle was responsible for firing a gun. They proceed to offer stickers to my son to soothe him. 

Since the day has passed, many things have happened that give us great concern. My girlfriend has begun to show symptoms of a miscarriage, spotting and vomiting to be specific. My son has been constructing mega block pieces to make what seems like a toy gun and pretends to shoot with it(this is probably just toddler things but still odd), and I haven’t been able to really rest. Truthfully, the students have had several “free days” in class because I have been so incredibly distraught by the entire event. 

I am not sure how to proceed. I would like to have their be some sort of consequence for these officers for what I believe to be wrongdoing, but I have no clue if I even have grounds to even put in a complaint with the sheriff, or whoever is even do that with.

"⛔️⛔️ THIS MAY BE A LITTLE TOO DESCRIPTIVE IN THE BEGINNING ⛔️⛔️

Of course my toe bled underneath the nail and everything. Since then my nail is lifting little by little.. but it has been fine since and no bleeding.

I work at a warehouse and while I was picking boxes to be bagged, I was sliding a heavy box because it was too big to carry so while I was sliding it to the cart, there was an uneven part of the floor that suddenly stopped the box from moving forward as I was pushing it forward— not too fast but pushed hard enough for how heavy it was— and it pushed back right into my toe that was already previously injured from above. Now that toe is bleeding again and irritating me (hurts worse than it has since it was first injured). Would this fall under being injured at work and getting workers comp., or should I just let this go?

My toe hasn’t been hurting or anything since working at the warehouse until now. It hasn’t bled or anything until now. And it hasn’t hurt at all until today from what happened, and YES I was wearing steel toe boots and yes all managers saw me and everything, I don’t think I was doing anything wrong as I have seen others do this too + my managers and supervisors saw me doing it since I started, because the boxes just be too darn heavy to carry sometimes.

Having said that, my mom passed away this year and my brother swooped in like a vulture and took over.

They wrote $500 on this deed when the property is definitely worth between $20 and $30 thousand dollars at the very least (based on surrounding properties, prices, inflation). Is this illegal? 

Further, my brother forged my dying mother's signature on her death bed literal hours before she died, a quit claim deed, where he took ownership of her property. My mom's partner said they have proof that not only was my mother not able to agree to this, but that the notary was not present and essentially lied (I guess?) since they weren't present at the time of signing. Per my understanding, they're required to be present at the time of signing, but maybe this isn't true, I don't know.

Friday I was questioned by my safety officer if I have a note for them etc. I explained yes and HR has it.

Today I wake up from a nap to get ready for my 12 hour night shift to a voice-mail from my eye doctor who I'd just seen this morning for my 30 day lasik checkup. The voice-mail stated my safety officer (another union member) called them to tell them I'm not allowed to have 20 percent tinted prescription safetys (that I dont need because of lasik) and they need to change the contract and order me new prescription lenses that are clear and confiscate my tinted lenses. The woman said she looked at my chart and while they understand I'm having issues with light sensitivity, they can't give me a note because they're hands are tied since they have a contract with the company I work for. 

Is the surgeons note sufficient? I'm not wearing 5 percent tinted glasses. They aren't that dark at all, just look it from the reflection and I explained this. 

Can the eye place deny me even after admitting they know I'm having sensitivity issues but ""have a contract with my company""?

I'm unsure what to do in this situation and I have no clue what my union is gonna do for me as they've been pretty useless with other people's things etc. I was told this could have breached hippa if they gave any info to the company and they shouldn't be calling the eye place demanding they change my glasses etc.

"Suing a Municipality

I own a property maintenance and management company in a town of 25,000 people. There are very few larger contracts within this area due to population and recently we came upon an RFP for a Property Management Contract for two Non-Profit Housing Buildings that are owned and operated a small board an the local Municipality. 

We supplied and submitted our bid on time and we have since been awaiting the awarding process and decision to become public. Since waiting, I have found out that they have chosen another Property Management Company for the bid. Also, I found out that there was only two bids on this project, our bid and the company that won the bid. 

The other property management company that was awarded the contract is solely owned by 1 of the 5 board members. This awarding process was done in an off camera closed to the public meeting.

"Not too long ago I was 302'd. Rights taken. Here's the story, plus there's a video if anyone is interested

29 MALE.

To start I'll mention my parents are becoming mildly abusive. I'm not exactly sure what happened but one moment I was relaxing on my futon, the next the police are opening my door. My parents had claimed I was having a crisis. Maybe the cops got a warrant. Either way, nothing was announced and I was not warned before the police entered. Three of them.

After entering we have a brief discussion. The main guy keeps talking over me. Everything I do/say was making perfect sense. The cop switches from ""you have to go to the hospital,"" to ""okay we just want to talk"". They take a few possessions including some paraphernalia. They also began taking a couple knives out and giving them to my parents. I had just purchased a pocket knife. Before I know it the guy grabs me by the wrist. I refuse to let go of what I had for a second, and then he squeezes tightly so I let go. I'm still confused as to why they're in my house or what's going on. Idk what exactly was even wrong at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Downstairs I talk to the crisis team. It was one or two people along with my family and the two cops. (one had just left). I talk completely calmly and friendly but it leads to that moment where they take me into custody. I just remember the cuffs tightening around my wrist and having had no explanation nor reason for this to happen. The cuffs tighten and a small scuffle happens. Before I know it they're loading me into the truck. I'm not read my rights or told what's going on.I ride all the way to some place with my hat pointed downward, hands behind my back, unable to see where I'm going.

&amp;#x200B;

We get to the destination and they search me. Then I'm put into what's basically solitary. There was no clock, I got my clothes and phone taken. Had to sit there in some weird room, with a tv that wasn't really functional (was playing some creepy old music). There were four other rooms with no one in them. I became disoriented and confused. After some unknown amount of time I was taken out, they walk me through a hospital and take me to my room. Again no clock, no cell phone, no clothes, they didn't even have drinking water available. I ended up spending over a week there. I'm still not sure whether I got a warrant for something or I was 302'd.

Is this legal?

My parents are getting old. I'm more aware than them. Fill out a form and suddenly you're restrained and your rights are taken away? I have video of the situation.

The reason for my social being any issue is because I need that in order to receive a bank card to get direct deposit. I get paid biweekly. The card is going to take a while to ship to me. I literally told my district manager during the interview and she said no problem, we’ll figure it out. Just put in what you have at the moment. I let her know about my upcoming appointment. She told me to not worry and she’ll talk to HR, shortly after I began working awaiting my appointment still.

"Hey! I’m curious how to handle this situation I’m in involving a couple who have been harassing me.
Some context my wife and I are getting divorced and after we agreed to separate amicably through mediation, she was influenced by her friends (we’ll call them L &amp; T) to not only hire an attorney and cut ties with me but to also fire a protection order and mention a ton of things in the file to make me look bad, including using a hand written apology letter against me. Ugh.
So that exists and to be frank I don’t want to have anything to do with her and have complied to the T with not going near her home, work, or vehicle, or interacting with her online or anything.

Fast forward 4 months after the PO was filed, I get a text from a strange number claiming to be someone I matched with from bumble named Rachel. They ask me out to lunch to which I did not respond because they seemed fishy. I asked them to send me a photo of themselves to remind me who they were exactly because I hadn’t been in the app in a long time. They instead sent me an article about a some article about some girl named Ashley James.
After which they sent a long message that starts off with: 

“Did you know that you communicated with me AFTER you were issued the protection order for domestic violence? That is a violation of your protection order. “
It goes on and on accusing me of so many things and even implying that the judge reading my rights “everything you say can be used against you.” Was something the judge was saying because he knew I was a liar. 

I investigate into who this person is because I’m afraid I was hacked or being extorted somehow. 
The person even sent me a video clip of myself in court defending myself which they admitted to paying $25 for because it’s public record.
The person went on and on and said they weee going to share the video far and wide and told me I need to move out of the state and leave my community of peers.
I blocked them and called the police which didn’t do much. I found the form they submitted to obtain that video and it was my ex wife’s friend T.
I also found out that either T or L or my ex herself took the protection order to the organizers of an event that booked me as a performer in order to get me kicked off the event which they succeeded at.
I asked the judge for a dismissal of the PO since it wasn’t protecting her because I was willingly minding my business. And because it was being used against me to harass me and take away my opportunities for income.
The judge denied my request and ordered my ex to tell her friends to leave me alone and to not bother me about this.
And asked her to dismiss the PO when the divorce was final.

Fast forward to December 16th and I’m at a public event that I bought tickets for (I went with 4 other friends) 
And I got there right at doors which was 8pm.
At around just after midnight I get a tap on my shoulder while sitting in the front row from T and he’s telling me to leave or he’ll call the cops cause I’m violating the protection order.
However for 4 hours during the whole show they were no where to be seen and neither was my ex. Also mind you the original PO the judge said that if we cross paths at a public place that doesn’t count as a violation as long as we leave each other alone and don’t go near each other or anything.
Since the last performer was on stage, and my ex was no where to be seen, and the door man verified I’m not on a long blacklist I decided to not leave and T decided to take out his phone and film me while saying “you’re violating a PO what are you gonna do? I’m gonna call the cops.” My friend who came with me stepped in between us which earned him a shove from T that was seen by the security guard who kicked out T and made him wait outside.
Every time I walked out for a smoke T was there taking pics of me.
And when I left he followed me recording me calling me a sex offender and sexual abuser and trying to get a reaction out of me.
Now today I saw his Instagram account for his blog was viewing my stories. So I messaged him telling him that the judge said to leave me alone. I told him to not stalk my instagram and I blocked him.
He then made at least one new burner account (with his first and last name) and I speculate other accounts with different names because they all showed up as people who viewed my story with random account names and no bio, profile pic, or followers.
I blocked the rest and reported them.

I’ve been to the Portland police and they can’t do much. And I tried filing a PO in Oregon where I reside and where they reside and my request was denied.

I’m looking into a motion for reconsideration on the original PO so that hopefully they won’t have that to harass me with the assumed intent to entrap me. 
But I’m less concerned about the PO as I am with them.
Do I have any case to sue them or press charges?

Tonight I received an email from their legal department with the link to an Instagram account where they reposted my video from TikTok. I guess the video was getting pretty popular and someone posted it onto a popular IG account. This is not my account. 

The legal team mentions that as part of my separation agreement that I signed, I violated the portion where it states:

“Employee represents and warrants that Employee has not and will not share or utilize company information provided to him or produced by him during Employee’s tenure at the firm.”

Again, In the video I posted I do not mention any names of my company, my coworkers, or even myself. My username just has my first name in it.

"Hello all. 

In November 2022, I started to rent a unit with my landlord. I paid a down deposit (1 month worth of rent) of $650 that was to cover any damages and whatnot. 

He ended up selling the property to a new landlord, and signed some sort of contract because he refused to release deposits of tenants, so my new landlord sent us letters stating they do not hold deposits. Meaning, I’m ripped from $650. 

My lease is over, and I plan to move soon. My entire family is telling me that whenever I’m ready to move out, not to pay my final months worth of rent to accommodate for the missing $650. 

I want to do this as it would not only give me leverage toward my future home, but also they are just jerks who don’t deserve my final payment since they wouldn’t fight for me as their tenant.

"I worked for a company in OH for three years up until 12/20/23 when I was fired for abandonment. 

On Nov 27th I called off work due to severe mental health issues and informed my job that I would not be able to return until I got things sorted out, hopefully with the help of some sort of therapy. At the time I had three days worth of PTO and close to 200 hours of Short Term Disability saved up. I was informed by my boss that if I was absent for longer than the three days of PTO I had, I would be able to retroactively use my Short Term Disability after two weeks of absence as long as I got a statement from the doctor. I wasn’t able to get a doctor’s appointment until 12/7 where they issued me the note stating that I would be unable to work from 12/4 to 12/15. Doctor stated that she does not issue out notes for longer than two week periods of time and I would have to schedule a return appointment two weeks later. The earliest they were able to schedule me back was for 12/20. I communicated this with my boss and told her that I was still unable to get help due to Ohio Health taking forever to communicate with my insurance. 

On 12/18 I was sent an email from all the higher ups stating that if I didn’t submit another doctor’s note by 12/19, my employment would be terminated. I sent them another email reiterating that this would not be possible because my appointment was not until the day after. On the morning of 12/20 I was sent an email stating that my employment was terminated. 

I had half expected this because I knew they were struggling with money (at one point the CEO asked all the employees to make a five dollar donation to the company from each of their paystubs) and my direct manager did not like me or anyone else at the company with a shred of intelligence. In the termination email they also requested that I bring in a check to pay for the next paycheck’s Medical Insurance premium. I told them they would be welcome to take it out of the paycheck paying me for the short term disability that was granted to me up to the date of my termination. They ignored this and again requested that I send in a check.

"So, I was driving home tonight after work and things were going pretty well in all fairness. During the drive, as I entered my hometown; the traffic had slowed to a crawl (5-8mph maybe?), as there was an accident in front of me so the front lanes (my lane, and the lane to my right) are blocked off requiring you to take a left or a right.

While I am driving this car starts to swerve into my lane but only slightly without a turn signal so I didn't think much of it as I figured he might've lost his control for a second and would fix his mistake.

Unfortunately, I continued moving forward while checking the rest of my surroundings to make sure everything is safe and okay (this process took 3 seconds maximum) and while I looked back forward he was still merging and the car behind me wasn't slowing down to allow me to allow the car to merge as the car never initiated their blinkers, this car was ""sideswiped"" by me a little as he apparently was trying to get in front of me even though his blinker was off. Keep in mind that breaking to allow him in wasn't possible due to how close the driver to my rear was.

So when this occurred, he stopped driving and I had swerved to the left sharply thinking I had just had a near miss - but to my surprise, I would later find out, it wasn't a miss but a direct hit/swipe.

So I told him to keep driving and go in front of me as I thought the situation had been narrowly avoided, he pulls over shortly but I make little of it as I believe he may just be settling down from stress or something and I continue heading home.

While sitting on a road ahead, he pulls up to me and rolls their window down and start asking me what I am doing and I informed them that merging unsafely is illegal and they just stated that they were going to ""call the police"" since I sideswiped them and drove off as I was in the process of saying ""okay, so let's take care of it."" and never turned around to try to take care of it.

I have a video, you can see me slowly inching towards this car that's trying to merge but failing as they are merging in a point where they have insufficient room. I'm not how this looks for the driver (me) but I am looking for some opinions. The video honestly just looks like I'm obliviously closing the gap between my car and his without concern or panic, but I had no choice as the only options were to be rear ended or to drive left into oncoming traffic and my mind was racing to think of what to do.

Early this year I moved between one property that my landlord owned (and wanted to sell) and her own residence that she was moving out of, on the same street. A friend addressed holiday mail to me at the old address. I went to leave a note for the newer neighbors to say ""Hi, if you get any mail addressed to [my first name] or [roommate's name] we'd appreciate it if you would move it over to our box, thanks!""

"I am not sure if this is the correct place to ask this but it's worth a shot.

My wife recently signed up (on 11/30) for a service that requires an initial one time payment followed by an optional monthly subscription. This was advertised as if the first month is free with the initial purchase. The subscription then auto renews ""on the one month anniversary of your payment date"", according to the conditions that they sent out via email after signing up. 

We tried to cancel the membership recently, well before the one month anniversary, and they said that to do so we had to pay for the month of December first. They say that since she signed up on the last day of november that single day counted as her free month. They will not allow us to cancel the subscription otherwise, which is pretty expensive for a monthly charge.

After examining the situation further there was not any possible window for her to cancel in time before the end of the day on 11/30. Upon signing up you have to take a 10 hour course. If you try to cancel the subscription before the 10 hour course has been completed then you are stripped of all benefits basically forfeit the initial purchase. What's more, they only allow you to cancel by calling them and their call center is only open during normal business hours. From when she signed up on 11/30 if she immediately marathoned the 10 hour course straight, the call center would have no longer been open anyway.

This seems illegal where something is advertised as having an optional subscription fee that actually ends up being a mandatory subscription fee. 

Since they refused to let us cancel the subscription we have canceled the credit card used to purchase it until we can figure out what to do. It feels like extortion since they will not allow us to cancel the reoccurring subscription unless we agree to pay this unreasonable fee. I am obviously concerned about this going to collections if we don't address it somehow. From what I can find online this company has a reputation of being shady and making it difficult for people to cancel their subscriptions.

"Hello this is my first post so I apologize for how lengthy this post is and if I should have gone about this post  another way.

This is my situation: my ex boyfriend and I have an 8 year old daughter. I also have an 18 year old daughter from my previous marriage, she has always lived with me. Anyhow, we split up about 6 years ago (long story short, manipulative, narcissistic behaviors, controlling etc.)  we agreed on a parental schedule (outside of court between us) he doesn’t pay me any child support and I cover all of her expenses including medical insurance, although, at the time he made significantly more money than me.  I am very chill kind of person and one that avoids conflicts at all cost.
I  have allowed him to see her whenever he wants as I am very flexible. He travels a lot for fun as his older daughter (26) is an adult so he can take off whenever he wants for weeks at a time therefore not abiding by the “schedule” we agreed to most of the time.  Now that my daughter is older she is constantly being disappointed with his long trips, and also when he says he will pick her up and he doesn’t.  

Anyhow, this weekend we have family over that are here from out of town and I told him our plans to do things with her and the family. Technically it’s “his weekend” to have her but of-course all of a sudden he  is telling me  he will not allow me to have her one day this weekend that’s all I asked for. He pulls this kind of stuff all the time and honestly it’s a way to control me and upset me as he know how important it is for me for her to spend time with my nephews especially after my brother and his wife sudden death two years ago. I explained this to him and he just said No you can’t have her it’s my weekend. (mind you I allowed him to take her last week to a skiing trip on my weekend) There has been times it’s my day to have her and I ask him to bring her back at a certain time as we have plans, and 9 out of 10 times he will bring her back hours later!  I’m just tired of him using her to get to me and not abiding by our agreed schedule.

"So backstory: I noticed around the beginning of the year my landlord wasn't cashing any of my rent checks, I had about 4 or 5 months of uncashed checks. Thought that was weird. Then the Landlord texts me and apologizes for not cashing and says he had family shit he had to deal with. Thought it was fishy but oh well. Fast forward a few more months I he starts talking about wanting to sell the house, I think ok whatever he's talked about it before, but I find out he sold his Camero and has been ""out of work."" I start googling his name and find out that he's facing felony charges for breaking a restraining order and threats of violence against a woman (hence scumbag) and now it's all clicking, he's probably trying to feed lawyers to make sure he doesn't catch a felony.

He starts actually getting traction on the selling of the house, does some really superficial repairs, and paints a couple things. He asks for us to vacate when the house is being shown (I have a 14 year old 100lbs Yellow lab that is pretty difficult to get into the car because he's not a fan anymore). I do end up vacating the first two times and then he starts asking for more showings, most of which has been not within 24 hours so I have to get stern and tell him ""Hey, by law we need 24 hours notice so cut it out with that."" I then am scheduled to have surgery that had me not able to lift more than 10lbs for the last few weeks and I looked it up and found out oh I don't have to leave my house at all when they're showing it, so I notify him that I will not be vacating for further showings. My roommate also works a night shift as an EMT from 5pm to 5am. He gets pretty upset that during the day they can't see his room because we're not going to have him being woken up when he normally should be sleeping. I laid out to him that the schedule going forward for showings should be monday through friday noon to 5 and if they want to see my roommates room they would need to book the 4pm slot. I also work from home if that means anything.

Landlord is quite grumpy that I don't want to allow weekends but I've seen that we only have to agree for reasonable hours which include 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday excluding holidays. He says he wants to talk about the schedule for showing the house and change the air filter on the furnace so he gives 24 hours notice and comes over to do that. Well he had his girlfriend give us envelopes that have a 90 days notice to vacate in them. Merry Christmas.

Also, I've never been late on a rent payment and I'm a bit handy so I've done major repairs in the house with the permission of the landlord and them taking the materials and labor out of the rent.

My question is: Do I still have to honor showings and what other advice would anyone have?

Additionally: I have a place to go and my roommate has a place to go, but I can't really do the bulk of lifting right now because of the surgery.

"My mother passed away in 2020 and my grandfather became the executor of her will/estate. My sister and I are her beneficiaries. My sister is 17 and I became her legal guardian. Yesterday, my grandfather got a call from a lawyer asking for me (her daughter/beneficiary) to give him a call. I returned his call today I was told that one of my mother’s great aunts passed away and left her around 40k CAD. He said that as she has passed on, the money is to go to her estate. My mother was adopted so neither myself nor my grandparents have heard of this aunt. 
Naturally, I thought he was fucking with me but after lots of googling &amp; searching we found out that he is reputable. We also found the obituary for said great aunt. 
I don’t want to get my hopes or expectations up because my mother (god rest her soul) passed on with somewhat of a rocky financial history and some debts. 
To top it off, my grandpa (executor) whom is 81 is losing his sharpness and memory so I can’t really ask him too many questions on the subject (although I have complete trust in him) 
This may be premature, as the attorney said he was going to send me an email with more information, and has asked for a copy of my mother’s will.
Just wondering if anyone can give me any advice or let me know what I should expect, or anything I shouldn’t do. This is a huge piece of information and kind of overwhelming.

"This is my very first time posting so please excuse any errors. I'm also on mobile.

Sister (F35) recently got her own place for herself and her 2 small children. Before that, they were living with her now ex (M33) for the past year. Their relationship was extremely toxic with him being physically, emotionally and financially abusive. They occupied the top floor of the house, his mother owns and lives in the house. 

My sister has had to work very hard to set a new place up for her and the children. Her ex was extremely controlling and would go through her phone, has damaged her car, manipulated her into taking out loans for things. She's had to be very careful. The big move was 2 weeks ago and to be honest I was terrified that she wouldn't make it because he caught a whiff that she was going to move, just not when or where. The day came and her stayed in there bedroom and refused to open the door. Then refused to let anyone in the house (her friends that were helping her move). She was only able to grab 3 boxes. 

I had called the non emergency police line and was told to have her call 911 and request an escort. And she did. But what ended up happening was the officer forced her to hand over her house key. She was devastated. So I had her go to her local precinct and talk to a sheriff. She then went back to the house accompanied by 2 officers but again the ex kept locking doors and physically not allowing her to take anything. The officers told her to file a protective order and that when he is served she'll be allowed to get her things. That's if he can be served. He now won't open the door or leave the house. There is an expiration date on the protective order. His mother is terrified of him and unfortunately is no help. 

He is holding most of her children's things and all over her things. She was told that he was going to throw some of her things out in the yard tonight but found out he was only going to give her pajamas. I know these things that are being held are just material possessions but she has no money to replace anything. I keep trying to remind her that she's doing a good thing, she got her and her children out of physical harms way but she just feels so defeated. She can't afford legal representation. I had to take out a loan from my 401k to give her so that she could make the deposit and first months rent. 

I just don't know what she can do at this point, other than having to forget about her belongings. He is not concerned with the police presence because he knows his rights.

Hello, 
I have cancer and my husband has abandoned me. My husband told me that he was going to visit his mom n North Carolina for Thanksgiving. The day after the holiday a moving company came to my house packed his things and moved them out. He also have the movers take my car. When asked him why he took the car because I have appointments and treatments he told me “make me an offer I can’t refuse and I’ll see”. Soon after he turned off all the utilities and locked me out of our accounts. My husband has also raped me several times. Including while I miscarried our first child together. Later he raped me for 4 days straight. Only allowing me to urinate and drink water. When my mother learned of this she wouldn’t allow me to be alone with him. I stopped having sex with him after I had to have reconstructive surgery on my reproductive system. A month post operation I found out he had herpes and is unfaithful. He refuses pay for my medications, food or even an Uber for my doctors appointments. He said he will consider helping me if I make him an offer he can’t refuse. He never allowed me to work so I have no income. I need help, he knows that I don’t have anything, nor am I well enough to get and keep a job. I’m sure he won’t help me because I also learned that he is 100k in the rears for child support.  He has moved on and has began dating another person.

"I've been able to find copious amounts of resources and records for identifying tenant rights for individuals, but I'm struggling to locate similar resources for commercial tenant rights. We're a small business (three employees) operating out of a small (3,000 sq ft ) warehouse space in Oregon and we've had a number of questionable actions by our commercial landlord that we can't figure out if we have grounds to push back or if ""that's just the way life is"".

Some examples:

CAMS rate was clearly disclosed as part of the lease signing and in our lease, but leaves it open ended for ""Adjustments"". Last year, our yearly ""adjustment"" was 10% of our entire yearly CAMS payment. I understand some years might go above or below the estimate, but is there any requirement that the landlord at least make a good faith effort not to falsely advertise a monthly rate?

Do I have a right to request to see what those CAMS are going towards?

Do we have the right to push back on CAMS items that are egregious or wasteful? Like the commercial park's landscaping sprinklers run 24/7 every other day until the water just runs in rivers down the drainage for hours at a time.

As part of CAMS, our landlord charges us a 3% ""management fee""... This was not disclosed in our lease. Seems... fishy? What's stopping them from at any time just changing that to a 10% fee or whatever their heart desires?

Some of our utilities are pass-through from the landlord, such as our individual unit's water bill. They charge us a $25 ""meter reading fee"" each month even though it's not a third party reading the meter. Is this legit? Our lease says ""If any utility services are provided by or through Landlord, charges to Tenant through CAM charges shall be comparable with prevailing rates for comparable services,"" so we were surprised to see additional monthly fees billed outside of cams. We also have no access to the meter to verify if what they're reading is accurate.

Similarly, they often don't get us these pass-through invoices in a timely manner. We're still requesting water bills from August so we can pay these bills in this fiscal year.

&amp;#x200B;

Since a lot of the answers in this sub are ""what does your lease say"", here's the TLDR:

Re: CAMS - it allows for overage/under but no requirement to accurately present the monthly rate nor any requirement to share the specifics of the costs with tenants.

Re: pass through utilities - shared utilities are mentioned in CAMS (for things like landscape water and parking lot lights) but no mention of prorated/by unit pass through bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Our previous landlord was very hands off and all our bills were in our name (not pass through), and our CAMS never adjusted, so friction with a commercial landlord is new for us and we're worried about rocking the boat. That being said, these things are costing our (very) small business thousands of dollars each year and we're feeling the crunch as we head into 2024. Any help even just pointing me in the right direction re: resources to research this more myself would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

- lived together for 4 (in 2 properties)
- first property he already had before we got together
- he got a job opportunity, moved interstate and didn’t come back
- I was living at that property by myself looking after his animals (1 dog and a cat)
- he decided he wanted to stay for work but not live out of an Airbnb anymore (it was a good time to sell the first house)
- I facilitated the moving/selling/purchasing of old house to new house (note my name was not on the title of the first nor the second property but he didn’t do anything “it’s a woman’s job” which may give an insight into why I left him”
- I got him a profit of 150k for his first home as I went to a second agent (and the first one was being suss)
- moved all of his/my/our belongings interstate including the animals
- he works away 4 weeks at a time, home for 2
- I was left to pay all the bills for the house (excluding mortgage and rates although he did push for it, he refused to put my name on the title so I didn’t pay for that) 
- ‘bills’ include water gas electricity groceries fulltime (almost tripled the food intake when he was home for the 2 weeks) plus dog food &amp; home maintenance such as fortnightly lawns

"My father died 17 days after his wife in Florida. So she died first, and then him.  Which means he automatically gets 30% of everything. They have a house together that they bought many years after they were married. So the house is not premarital property, it's under both of their names, legally. My father paid half of the mortgage at this house. And I can also see online where he paid to have improvements made on the house, such as he added a screened in porch.

I contacted the estate planner of the trust and apparently what the wife has tried to do is to set up the trust to where her son gets 100% of the entire house - The house that my grandfather paid half the bills at - And all the money. It says online that in Florida, a resident can't cut their spouse out of their share of the estate, property, or trust when they die.

My father might not have known the trust existed. ""While there are legitimate reasons for a spouse to set up a trust during marriage, sometimes it is done in order to improperly shield assets from equitable distribution. Often, the non-beneficiary spouse is not aware of the trust.""

Any ideas on what we can do in the situation?

"I apologize for the long post but the back story is very relevant.

In December 2019, I signed a lease with my mom who was at the time a year and some change clean from meth use. In March 2020 when the pandemic hit, she relapsed and quit paying rent. I tried to keep it up on my own but my job at the time would not cover the entire rent and I was only 19 and very unsure of what to do. I gave my mom my half of the rent money before I was sure she relapsed and she presumably spent it on drugs since the rent was not paid. 

I made a verbal agreement with the landlord to vacate the property by the end of may and she would relieve me of responsibility. I cleared out the unit and vacated but my mother refused to vacate. I communicated all of this with the landlord but she couldn’t evict my mom due to COVID. I fought to get my name removed from the lease but the landlord refused.

The rental management company would not take my name of the lease either unless I got a restraining order against my mom which I had no legitimate reason for and also didn’t want to do.

This credit card, we believe is from around 2011 or 2012 and hasn't been used or paid on since then.

But I've never been in any sort of legal issue and I'm lost trying to figure out what to do. I know that she should file her answer to the summons and show up for court, but beyond that... we could really use some guidance.

"I am a 25f artist wanting to make my art public. One thing I always wanted to do was write a conic based on an intellectual property.  In 2022, the copyright for ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" by A.A Milne went into the public domain. In the year that followed, I noticed the movie Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey come out. While that movie is terrible at both the pooh license and the slasher genre as a whole, it gave me hope that maybe I can write a comic about Pooh!

However I'm nervous about it. For starters, the only thing I know for sure is that the original characters, plots,and settings of the books are now public domain, with Disney owning the trademarks for their versions of the characters.  Meaning if I make Pooh, he can't be a yellow bear with a red shirt. But I am worried about how far disneys lawyers will reach for trademark infringement. I know I'm not allowed to draw Tigger till 2024, and characters like Cessy and Gopher are 100% off limits since they're Disney originals.

So I ask, lawyers of reddit, how can I be 100% sure that my designs of pooh and friends won't infringe on trademarks of Disney? What kind of lawyers should I speak to about my ideas?

"Hi All,

I have a friend who is having some weird issues with a landlord and would like some advice. There are 3 roommates, all on the lease agreement and one of them is moving out at the end of their term. The other two would like to remain in the apartment and are in the process of finding a new roommate. 

They have a lease that is set to expire on January 31st, 2024. The landlord has been harassing them via text, phone calls, and unannounced visits to their door by banging asking for an update daily. 

The landlord notified them of their renewal terms on December 4th, 2023. This is where the questions come into play. The lease states the following (As written with verbiage and case as to not deviate from the original text):

""27. RENEWAL OF LEASE: The Tenant must be offered a renewal of this Lease by the Landlord, unless the Landlord has good cause not to do so under applicable law. Reasonable changes may be included in the renewal Lease. Not less than 2 MONTHS days before the expiration of the Term of the Lease, the Landlord shall notify the Tenant of the proposed terms for the renewal Lease. Within 60 days after the Tenant receives the Landlord's renewal notice, Tenant shall notify Landlord whether Tenant accepts or rejects the proposed renewal Lease. If the Tenant does not notify the Landlord of Tenant;s acceptance, then the landlord's proposal shall be considered to have been rejected. If the Tenant does not accept the renewal Lease, the Tenant must vacate the Property at the end of the Term.""

There is a section as defined below:

""44. OTHER LEASE PROVISIONS, IF ANY:
[...]
2. Tenant to give the owner 60 days (2 months) notice to vacate at the end of the lease term""

Now, to our understanding, he did not provide the correct notice to be able to fulfill this time frame as December 4th-January 31st is less than 60 days (That is 58 days).

Also, as they do not have intent to leave as of now, unless they can't find a new roommate (As they are struggling to do as the apartment is way over priced. i.e. $5,000/mo), if they decide not to renew, is he within his rights to withhold the security deposit (about $6,500) or do they have a case if he does?

" Looking for some input. Long post. 

I have 2 half sisters who are 14 and 15 and have been truly a terror to deal with over the last couple of years. Their dad is a hothead and has threatened my mom about various things since they were born (custody, trying to get her in trouble, etc). My mom is never one to stand up to him. This year, he filed a CPS case against my mom for baseless claims and lies in an attempt to get her in trouble. Me, the older sister, who is 27, was also named in the case for completely false information as well as my stepdad. For context, here what happened: I offered to drive them down to an all ages concert Jack Harlow. I made the offer because my mom is essentially a single mom and constantly driving around them in their friends. She wasn’t thrilled about driving 2 1/2 to 3 hours to bring them to this concert that they got tickets for for their birthday. We didn’t have enough tickets for me and my husband to go in attendance with them so I asked my mom prior to bringing them down if it was OK that we dropped them off And picked them up down there. She was obviously fine with that. I gave them a stern lecture on the way down about staying together, charging up their cell phones and behaving well. We dropped them off at the front door and we all have Life360, so we saw their location during the entire concert. I checked in on them halfway through the concert to see How much longer that they expected to be. We picked them up at the front door and I got out and walked to meet them since it was super busy down in that area. There was no incident that occurred. In the CPS report earlier this year, their dad states that I left them there and “abandoned them” and that they called me several times for help. It was easy to prove that this was incorrect and the case was closed with no maltreatment found for any party named. Obviously, it did a number on our family dynamic and I haven’t spoke to them since. I do not take accusations like this lately and I don’t think that anyone should. 
This past weekend, they got into a normal teenage fight with my mom and called their dad who became enraged and sent her a lengthy, threatening text message Stating that he is opening up another CPS case on her for “mentally abusing” my sisters. In all honesty, they mentally abuse my mother on a daily basis. frankly, I believe that they are completely out of control. Recently, they’ve told my mom to go lie on train tracks and die, called her an immature brat, hang up on her left, and right, they barely go to school, etc. He also mentioned my name again in the threatening text message and stated that he is including me, because of how I “treat them”. And he is emailing a copy to my employer. I am a nurse, so I feel like I need to take legal action against him to stop this harassment and baseless threats. As mentioned, I have not spoken to them for the entirety of the year, and even before that, I saw them occasionally. Even if we have had arguments in the past like siblings do, that is not illegal.I filed a harassment restraining order, and the judge set a hearing for more information. I guess I kind of felt like it would’ve been granted as an ex parte given the details that I provided and his direct threat to contact my employer but I have no experience with this. I am seriously worried if it is not granted and then it will just give him more power to use CPS inappropriately and make false accusations and claims left and right and to stop at no cost.",CPS/OFP Help,18o2d7a,1703206411.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18o2d7a/cpsofp_help/,

"I live in an apartment with assigned, controlled access, garage parking. I work from home, and on the rare occasion I take my car out, I park far away and by myself.  Within the last month or two the space next to mine has changed hands, and I’ve noticed 3+ dings all at the same height on my passenger side (their driver side as we both back in). These are deep, the paint has chipped exposing the metal body. I understand accidents happen and people experience mobility issues, but it’s hard to imagine they don’t know they’re causing damage.

There is a concrete column between our spaces which is far enough forward that it doesn’t impact the doors trajectory; however, it does ensure that no matter what, they always have at least 1.5-2ft to get out of their vehicle. I can’t park any further away from them or I will encroach on my other parking neighbor, who is consistently capable of respectfully parking despite having a large pickup truck.

I plan to ask to move spaces, but am concerned that the damage may eventually rust and progress beyond cosmetic damage. Here are my ideas, beyond addressing it with building management.

1) Document (pictures) of damage to my car, any chips on edge of their door, and their height from the ground. Call non-emergency to see if I can get a police report started.

"I am a first time poster so sorry if long winded, not sure what is pertinent. I work at the city hall for a small town in WA state.  I have worked here for a year. During this yr outside my regular duties I have also filled the roll of IT manager, for both the city and the police station because I passed the security background in order to set up body cams, new hire setup, excetra. I have also done the grant writing, city development, and several other positions not being filled. The city's out of date server system died. In order to keep city federally compliant and running, and to keep costs low, I rebuilt the entire network from ground up. The city is currently running off this system. Now I was not forced to fill these rolls but with no one able to do them and the city failing I agreed to do these jobs. In order to be compensated for all I'm doing, my supervisor and union reps proposed a new job position with better pay, only needed Council approval. Now I realize that getting compensation for work done will be nearly impossible legally, they'll claim I ""volunteered"", but when you have a defcon 9 problem and no one but you has the knowledge to fix it, and they're all staring at you going ""help, help, help"" you feel an obligation to your city and co workers to get it done. The problem I need advise with is this. The Council is fully aware of the work I've done, they have had a 30 page write up of all I've done for the city for over 6 months and why new job position is needed in order to compensate me and save city money. Union approved. For over 6 months Council has put off voting, each time stating they need more info to justify my raise and title. Two particular members have been disparaging me. They have demanded to see my job application, which they have no right to. Have called in to question everything about me during official city meetings with innuendo and open ended questions. Such as ""Is he even qualified"". Well you have my qualifications in front of you showi g im over qualified with college degrees in the IT field. It has been alot of political theater. The coucil hates the mayor and i work for the mayor, so therefore my job promotion is some how ""questiinable"". So I set up meeting with union rep for advise. I quote "" The city is screwing you, and you should quit and find another job. Now union issues are going to be separate but I'm sharing that to show I'm not receiving help for these issues. During last City Coucil Meeting they finally did vote no to approve the new position. With all the theater I was not surprised. I'm not required to attend these meeting. My niece texted she had flat tire on entrance ramp to town. So after the vote I left to help her. A coucil member stated on record after I left, ""(my name) just left, I guess that shows how much he care about his job with (city name).

"Hi everyone, around the beginning of December we received a letter from a few local law firms offering their service bc my dad was getting sued for not paying his Best Buy cards. Alarmed, my mom went up to Best Buy and there were no cards under my dad’s name. We brushed it off and assumed that this was some spam mail.

Skip to today, a man went up to our door today and handed us court papers from our District court. They said we had 14 days to give them a written response and stapled evidence of the credit card payments. The thing is- my dad never made the card and when I called Best Buy, there is no card made under my dad’s SSN. They led me to a  identity theft hotline and they said they couldn’t offer help because the bank handed it to a debt collector? (I’m not sure what this means).

The victim was unidentified.
This accident was in her payees nieghborhood.

"Here's some back story. 
I was with a company based in CA for 5 years. The 5th year, I moved out to TX and continued to work for them but as a 1099 and not salary. A year later, the company is bought out. I have now been working for the new company doing the same thing as a 1099. Issues started happening last year where they wouldn't pay for 6 or 8 weeks at a time. They would get me caught up on payment and then 3 months later it would happen again. They have not been doing good financially this last year. 6 months ago, they told me they are not paying their subcontractors or vendors right now. Only there employees on payroll. I fall into the subcontractor category so every 2 or 3 months I would have to bitch and moan to get paid. They would pay 25% of what they owe me and promise the remaining the following week. Weeks and months would go by where they didn't pay or catch up. It took me threatening to not give them the work they were requesting to have them send another check for 25% of what they owe me. 3 weeks ago, I had to use my credit cards and money I have saved for taxes for my monthly bills. 
I told them they can expect a ""late fee"" of 10% of the total amount of invoices no paid. After I sent that invoice with that additional charge, they told me to not do anymore work for them until they catch me up. I ask when they will pay the remaining (over $10k). They said they are going to try to pay it when they can. 
It's been a couple weeks now of searching for a new job and I tried reaching out asking again. They said they are pushing to get 20% of the remaining paid next week. 
What can I do, what should I do?

"My fiancé and I are in the process of packing to move out. Our soon to be ex landlord seems to be getting the property ready to sell. We have been compliant and let him into our unit as he has needed and interfaces with his definitely uninsured and unlicensed contractors. However this morning while cleaning for an insurance inspection I went outside and into the basement to discover a sizable amount of our belongings have been removed from the property and we were given no notice to remove them ourselves.

He has taken an engine I was planning to rebuild which would cost $500 just to buy as a non running core, an engine wiring harness which is between $200-250 on eBay, an engine hoist which would cost $300 new, 2 pairs of jack stands another $100, a vintage sewing machine, $150, 2 pressure washers- $250 each, a gallon of unopened full synthetic transmission fluid and steering fluid, $60 a 3 ton low profile floor jack $150, a 3 gallon bostitch air compressor $130, 2 5000 btu air conditioners $200, a 1500 watt space heater $100 a pet stroller, $100 a high end designer paint fandeck $50 plus all the time and gas it would take to repurchase these items. 

On Monday someone knocked on my door and informed me of the inspection and then asked about another tenants junk car that has been in a t bone collision they said they were going to have it towed but the car is still there since they gave that tenant the courtesy of letting them deal with it themselves. but made no mention that I should be moving any possessions I didn’t want thrown away or stolen to be sold. He has no lien against me and as I said had given no notice of his intent to clear my possessions. Plus we are still in possession of the unit until the middle of January. In reality I have not sent an official notice of termination yet and the only agreement we have to vacate by mid January was a verbal agreement on a handshake. He called last night at 9pm while I was a sleeping but did not text me and then this morning I awoke to find all of our stuff disappeared. 

What recourse do I have. I couldn’t find any section in the ri tenant landlord laws regarding possessions in storage. But I’ve read that a landlord has an obligation to inform a tenant that they are removing items and put them in storage for a reasonable amount of time so the tenant can retrieve them. 

I’m thinking I should file a police report and threaten civil litigation to get him to arbitrate with me and come to a reasonable compromise? Plus this property has black mold in the walls so if I wanted to I could make it difficult for him by going to the housing authority at which point he would likely have to pay $50-80k or more for a professional mold remidiation job to get this property insurable and sellable.

"Located in North Carolina. My grandmother is in the process of selling a home. She came into possession of the home when her son passed unexpectedly. In October a title check was performed and she was told by the attorney that there was a 4100 dollar lien on the home that stemmed from court charges on her son. The sale was continued at that point. Come to this week (December), my grandmother signed her portion of the closing documents on Monday. The buyer signed her portion on Wednesday. Today the lawyer informed my grandma that he had made a mistake in the title search. He searched only her name, upon searching her son’s name he discovered an additional 12,000 dollars in court charges against the title. This would have affected both her decision to sell originally and the sale price if she knew a total of 16,000 dollars would be coming out of her check.

"Last year, I was working as a driver for a cannabis company. I had worked for them for 3 months before getting into a car accident on my way to work (off the clock). My car was a total loss, and I was injured and unable to do much for a number of months.

     I am curious if I have a case from wrongful termination due to them letting me go for what thebmanager told me today when I called ""them not knowing when I would show up for work"" despite me having given them a doctors note.

My partner called the privacy department and the employee there noted that a supporting excel document with patients protected health information was uploaded as a link within an article and the publishers also missed it. 

As a result, anyone viewing the article could go in and download a table of patients genetic testing results. Thankfully it didn’t include their names t but it’s their age, genetic test results, sex,  patient reference number, etc.

We requested a copy of what was uploaded publicly and are waiting for more information from the privacy dept and research dept responsible for the exposure. 

Basically all they said was we have revamped our policies, reported to regulators, and are being fined. They said they are not paying impacted patients. 

It feels fucked up because we paid for the testing, they use it for research to make more money, someone exposed it and now you get nothing but a notice? The person was like “oh I know it’s a bad feeling, I remember being in a breach with my financial information”. That’s great.

Especially in our modern world with internet scrappers. I am doubtful there is any logging information that can give any sort of certainty as to who may have accessed the details and then from there you’ve lost control when it’s downloaded.

After a couple days we had to call again because she was pouring an unknown liquid (maybe water) on our balcony.

Every once in a while she starts talking about us loudly, wishing us death, quoting our private conversations from other days etc. The apartment complex management has been great and she’s getting evicted soon but right now she’s in the middle of one of her rants.

What does this mean for us right now? Does it mean she’ll get arrested immediately if we call the police again?

My brother is in a relationship with this one woman who lives in California. She came to Florida to visit him and while she was here she decided to stay and they eventually had a child together. So she decided that she wanted to go back to California and my brother agreed to go with her so they all went to her home in California. Here’s the problem. My brother tells me that her family is illegally growing and selling weed and that conditions where they live aren’t safe. There are wild dogs running around and my brother actually got attacked by one. The family fights a lot and they are verbally abusive to each other. My brother decided that he wants to come home but he doesn’t want to leave without his child. His girlfriend doesn’t want to go to Florida. She refuses to leave or let my brother take the child with him. What can he do? Could he take his child and just leave? Does he have to go to court and get some kind of agreement established for custody?,Is there any way my brother can come back home with custody of his child?,18ox9xu,1703304595.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18ox9xu/is_there_any_way_my_brother_can_come_back_home/,
"Hi all,My husband and I have had the month from hell. He was recently diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderall, but with a family history of Bipolar Disorder, it ended up leading to a hypomanic/manic episode. It's been a lot, but I've been trying to get him medical support the whole way - a process made more difficult by his anosognosia (he hasn't realized or been able to admit anything is wrong with him. It straight-up doesn't compute in his brain. Not abnormal for hypomanic or manic episodes.)

Things came to a head a few nights ago, when he developed a paranoid (potentially psychotic) delusion about me trying to hurt him (I was asleep in bed), and called my mom in the middle of the night, terrified. This resulted in her calling for a wellness check on him, and the police came and tried to get him to go to the hospital, but he refused and they couldn't force it.

The next day he continued to be agitated and paranoid. He wanted to talk, but wasn't making sense and we were both getting frustrated, so I removed myself from the conversation and went to the bedroom to lay in bed and scroll through my phone. A few minutes later, he threw open the door and pinned me down, forcefully grabbing my phone.

Frightened FOR him, I called 911, as I had been instructed to do as a means of getting him medical help. I explained the situation over the phone, but made it very clear that he was in the midst of a mental health crisis and that I wanted to get him help.

The police arrived a few minutes later and I once again explained that he's not a violent person, he's just not himself and needs mental health care. I asked them to take him to the ER, but they were very focused on the fact that he had put hands on me (even though I told them I wasn't hurt).  I asked repeatedly for him to not be arrested, but for him to instead receive mental health intervention. But apparently in Oregon, once they learn that physical contact was initiated, the initiator must be arrested (or at least that's what they told me).

So they cuffed him and took him to jail as I sat there watching in horror. They booked him under a misdemeanor-harassment charge. I then spent the entire night on the phone with the jail and the police department, trying to rectify the situation and get him in to see a counselor at the facility. I asked for charges to be dropped as the ""victim"", but was shot down because Oregon apparently ""takes domestic violence very seriously"" and doesn't care about what the victim wants in that situation. I was terrified for him, sitting in jail in the middle of a mental health event. So incredibly painful and frustrating!

He was arraigned the next morning and released after he was assessed by a mental health professional, thank god, under the condition that he comply with mental health care advice. But his court date is scheduled for about a month from now and I am desperate for him to not have to go. My heart is breaking thinking about him potentially being shown photos the police took of the redness on my chest and my broken fingernail. He was so traumatized by the entire experience (much more than me), and it would be really retraumatizing for him to have to see photos, perhaps hear audio of my account from the bodycam, etc.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can get the court to simply dismiss the case? It was never my intention or wish for him to be arrested - I simply wanted to get a paramedic out or have him taken to the ER to get HELP. I've been in constant contact with the DA's victim's rights dept. to make sure they know I and the others who love him are united in our advocacy for him, but I desperately want this to just go away entirely before the hearing rolls around. He is cooperating with mental health care advice and starting to level out, and I just want to put this whole thing behind us.
