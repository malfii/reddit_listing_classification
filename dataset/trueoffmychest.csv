"(Throwaway account as my friends know my main account.)

I (17M) am currently working part-time for a well known store in the UK to try to save some money for university. I was putting some stock on the shelves near the back of the store when a man asked a question about some sticky tape on the shelf next to me. He was stuttering quite a lot and breathing very heavily but I assured him that the tape he had chosen would be enough to wrap up his presents for Christmas. He then starts asking about another tape brand and I let him know that it would also be sufficient. At this point he’s breathing really heavily and starts to cry. He explains that he suffers from panic attacks and is on medication currently. I try to assure him that either tape will be fine, but he’s really stressed out over the whole situation. I’m not really sure what to do at this point. I have had quite a few neurodivergent friends in the past and I’ve also volunteered in a children's library before but nothing could have prepared me for this.   
I offer to get him a glass of water and say that he can sit in the staff room for a bit if he needs a less stressful place off the shop floor. He stutters and cries but doesn't really answer. I suddenly feel worried that I’ve overloaded him with questions and I really didn’t want to add to his stress so I kept quiet for a bit. I’m not a very touchy person so I didn't stand too close to him or put my hand on his shoulder etc.  
Once he’s calmed down a bit, I ask him if there’s anything I can help him with. He explains (while still crying) that he just wants to get a Christmas card and some science magazines for his son. I create a list with him so that we have a plan on what we need and where to go in the shop as an attempt to reassure the man. It takes some time, but I picked out a nice card for his son and we got some science magazines. I hold his bag and all his stuff for him and stand in the queue with him. Eventually he pays for his items, thanks me and leaves. I can’t remember if he was still crying at this point. I immediately go find my manager and tell them I’m going on my break.  
I go to the toilet and immediately break down in tears, which I haven’t really done since last year. I don’t mean this in a strong, I'm a man grrrr kind of way, more so I just don’t tend to process my emotions through crying, I usually just contemplate things while listening to music. I think what broke me the most is that this poor man was just trying to get a gift for his son, just trying to show love, but couldn’t. My colleagues were busy at the time and it just felt like I was sucked into this lonely world with him where even tasks like shopping become difficult. I also didn’t know how to handle the situation (I’m only 17 and don’t have a lot of experience compared to adults) and had no support from anyone else. I felt so helpless which had really upset me. It feels like adults always know what to do but I’m almost an adult but don’t.  
This has just devastated me all day since and I haven’t really felt like talking to anyone about it. I think the silver lining is that this man loves his son, and hopefully also has a loving partner. I’m hoping that when the man got home he was proud that he was able to go to the shops alone.  
I’m not really sure what to take away from this experience. I hope writing it all down will help me get it off my chest, and perhaps some of you could suggest what the better course of action could have been. Thanks

I lost my dad back in October. I had been wanting to get back into going fishing with him for awhile now but never made the time. We used to go sand bass fishing at night when they’d spawn in the fall and I kept wanting to try and get with him and my brothers to go back. It hit me today after talking with my wife she was talking about getting me something for my birthday and it got me thinking about the gift she got me last year for finishing my bachelor’s degree and it was a fishing pole and then it just kind of flooded in that I can’t go fishing with dad anymore.

"Adding  TW and putting as NSFW cos I'm not sure where this will go, so it's just to be on the safe side

So, as the title might suggest, I was in this ""relationship"" two years ago (if it could even be called that) and I found out sonething that made me question it, and really sorry if this is a bit messy

Context:
In early November 2021, I was talked into being with this boy, let's call him Jack, I initially said no cos of the fact that he's not my type and seemed dodgy, however, I was talked in to being with him, at that point I had only known him for a few days at this point, a couple week later, he was constantly taking about doing it like it was the only thing that matters in a relationship, I kept saying no cos I didn't know him well enough and I wasn't attracted to him at all and didn't wally the same situation happening to me as what my mum was on when she found out she was pregnant with me, eventually he talks to be able it and gets me to talk about why I didn't want to do it, and I tell him and what happened when my mum, to keep a long story short she was on the pill, he used a condom, pill failed, condom broke, mum got pregnant and my bio father left her, he lied to me and said he'd stay, and I thought I had security, he also convinced me to go on birth control, I had to start by going on the pill before getting the implant, and he refused to wear protection cos he ""didn't like the feel of it"", and he only preferred bring on top while whoever he was doing was underneath. The implant went in on 8th February 2022, that was painful as he'll, but that's s story for another time, 10 days later, on 18th February 2022 he decided to dump me, and its around this time that I find out he gave me lied to me and gave me a false sense of security just to force me to have sex with him even though I wasn't ready, but at the time I just though that because I consenteed in some way that it was still consent and I lived the next 2 years of my life thinking that.

Fast forward to this year, 2023, I go back to college to get a level 2 in whatever I managed to pass level 1 in 5 years ago, and one of the lessons on the time table is ppd and one of the ppd lessons was about sexual health, and the explanation bit said sex should be a good experience for everyone, free of coercion, violence etc, just paraphrasing, amd 2 weeks later, it was about drugs, alcohol and consent, and in the consent bit, it said that consent should be freedom to choose, yada yada yada, you get the drift, and a few weeks before that, I saw a post with multiple slides, one of the slides was saying how forced concent is not consent and all that, and those 3 things together made me question it my ""relationship"" with Jack, and I messaged a few friends about it and how it felt like rape, only for them to say that it is rape, and just thay alone made me feel sick, a little while later, I send a message to my ppd teacher, let's call him Mr Awesome, cos he is awesome, and said briefly how the explanation bit for both sex health and consent made me question my time with Jack, and Mr Awesome sent an email asking if I wanted to talk about it and I said yes please cos I haven't had a chance to process the information properly, and because I said about it the day after the college broke up for Christmas holidays, it was decided that I could talk to Mr Awesome about it after the first ppd lesson after the holidays, and it won't affect any lessons cos ppd os the last lesson for one of the days that I have college.

So yeah, I took a step into getting help, remembering the situation has made me feel slightly sick again, I've took a pigeon step towards getting help that I've needed for god knows how long, I'm proud of myself cos asking for help even with the simplest of things makes my anxiety shoot, Mr Awesome is awesome, and I'm gonna find out if the unwell feeling is remembering my situation, anxiety or just hunger and yes I'll update when I talk to Mr Awesome about the situation.

"Hello! I’m not too sure how to start this so I guess I’ll start with some info: I’m a 19 year old female, 5’2, and I’m about 148 pounds. I lift regularly (4 days out of 7), and while I do cardio it’s not exactly something I take seriously bc I hate doing it. I usually run on the treadmill for a mile or I walk on an incline. I don’t diet, and I eat three meals plus a snack. I don’t drink coffees or sodas often, it’s just bottled waters. I weighed myself today and I found out I was 148 pounds. I’m absolutely crushed by this. I used to be a 135-140 pounds. 

Also some context: I used to play high school and travel softball, so every weekend was hours and hours of running and exercising. I’m now just a college student that uses what information she knows. 

I’d like to think that I’m totally ok with what I look like, cause with lifting I have some amount of muscle that plays into how I weigh.

"I'm mentally and emotionally drained with most of them. I don't know how it's come to pass but it seems like everyone I know has mid to severe mental health problems. Almost everyone (myself included) suffers from depression. A couple of them have DID and I have to keep track of so many alters. Most of them have so many triggers it's like walking on eggshells with them constantly. Others treat our common chat server as a place to vent about how much they hate their daily life *every single day.* I could set my watch to how consistent the exact same complaints are. I can't really begrudge them this one because I often vent too. 

Several of them mention shit like ""about ready to swallow a whole bottle of painkillers and hope it kills me"" so off-handedly that it drives me crazy. I'm *tired* of freaking out, worrying and caring about them. I mostly feel angry at them for burdening me with that. Over the last year I've felt like doing the equivalent of standing up and screaming at them about this kind of stuff. 

But I don't. It's not what they need in their lives, no matter how much *I* need to do this to vent. They aren't my punching bags. But gods know how much they piss me off sometimes. 

I struggle with depression and health-affecting anxiety every damn day, too. But I'm fucking doing something about it. I'm seeing a therapist and taking my medication, trying to improve my life. It's rough. I know that, being mostly in the US, they don't have an easy time with the healthcare system there. I'm in Europe and I have a decent support system in my family. I got *furious* with one of them, who casually said I ""had it easy"" or how I'm ""basically neurotypical"" as if that's some fucking put-down. Well, fuck you and sorry that I don't think it's right for me to unload all of my own shit on everyone. 

I want to say I love them and want to continue being supportive, but gods dammit, they make it incredibly difficult. I needed somewhere to vent all this that isn't our server.

So today my stepfather decided to stay the night here and I was getting ominous vibes. I am an introvert and like to stay at home but whenever my brother goes out he(stepfather) comes and does it with her(mom), I think they believe I can't hear them, well maybe they try to make little sounds but unfortunately I can hear them and much worse,  whenever I see their crumbly clothes after they come out. Worst of all was that one day when I didn't still get expose to all these, I went to give my stepdad with his phone cause it was ringing nonstop and I saw my mom on top of him  standing by a corner shocked they might have thought I couldn't see anything from that corner and I also didn't entered the room and came out shocked and scared that day.

So back to today, mom told him to sleep with my brother but he won't so she decided to sleep in the middle of us (the thing is he is and always sees me as his daughter, and saw me grow up and I feel no bad intentions from him towards me)..so the unlucky me 😭 is also a night person and my mom knows it and I was trying to study for the whole night but they told me to turn off the light cause they couldn't sleep so I did as they said.

They would scold me if I were to stay on my phone so I put off my phone too but still couldn't sleep at some point they started snoring so I thought maybe I am saved but at 1 p.m they thought I was asleep cause I was keeping my eyes shut trying to fall asleep not moving or making noise and suddenly the bed stared shaking violently and I heard weird noises and heavy breathing and panting🤢

"What is your impression of the young woman in the (true) story below? 

Mandy is 23, single, being pursued by a cute guy, Jared 24, quite persistently. Jared has an on and off girlfriend, which gives Mandy pause and causes her to move on to other opportunities. 

Still, he is persistent. In a couple of situations, at bars and after parties, Jared swears he’s broken up with his girlfriend, says he really wants to be with Mandy.  They make out, hook up, but never have sex.  On one occasion Jared says he loves Mandy; she tells him he’s being ridiculous. 

More on again and off again. 

One night after a wedding, around midnight, Jared calls Mandy, says he wants to see her. She says ok, come over. They hang out on the couch, her roommates are home, in their rooms. It’s around 1230am. 

They fool around on the couch. Things progress quickly; her bra comes off, and he is skillfully touching her. Her panties come off. They are still in the living room, on the couch. She decides in that moment that she wants it to happen. She has only had sex with one guy, her college boyfriend. She’s 23, she’s horny, she deserves this. 

They fuck, right there on the couch. If her roommates come out of their rooms, it would be quite obvious what was happening. And she can’t believe it’s happening, it feels surreal, but it feels good. 

His phone rings, repeatedly, while they are fucking. Mandy is sure it must be his girlfriend, trying to track him down. 

They finish. He doesn’t stay the night. 

The next morning, she feels a certain sheepish pride and satisfaction. Mandy and Jared never have sex again.

So when I talked to her about another work issue I decided to thank her for making the file so clean.  She pauses and asks if I'm being sarcastic.  I have to reassure her I'm not.  After a minute she believed me and we moved on to solving the issue at hand.

I get the courage after a year to finally spill the beans to my new husband(we dated for 10 years just got married last month, yay!) we have a regular sex life so I didn’t think this would be a problem. I thought he would be excited to try something new in the bedroom.

I open up to him about my kink and he laughs at me and makes fun of it. He jokes about magicians making people act like chickens or be silly on stage. He asks how is that sexual  and laughs at my proposal completely shutting me down. I withdraw myself as I’ve never felt so ashamed and turned off in my life. We just got married and I feel sad about everything. I don’t know how to process this. I realize he doesn’t have to be into it but laughing at it was hurtful and now I just feel sad that I even opened up about it. How else can I explore my desires?

"\*\*\* As I write this I don't think I'll divorce. I am venting and also accepting the fact that I may have gotten this wrong \*\*\*

I am a 40 YO who's been married for 3 years. This is my second marriage. The first one I married young and my wife came out the closet 4 years in. Went through shit but no hard feelings. We have two wonderful kids together. 

Fast forward 10 years and I married again. Really thought I was mature enough by now and knew what I was getting into. *God I was wrong.* 

I love kids and enjoy being a dad so we naturally got pregnant. In the spam of one year my loving wife went from someone who was concerned with wooing me to someone who sees me mainly as provider and an errant boy.

Everything we ever talk about revolts around the baby or how she is feeling. I understand pregnancy must be very hard (I will never understand it personally, I just say I can sympathize) but other than me being there for making sure she is fed, taken care of, buy the stuff she and the baby needs, I am not in the equation. 

Everybody comes and says *""well, this is what life is supposed to be""*. Is it? 

I don't remember the last time I did anything for my self. My social circle disappeared because none of my guy friends are married. I suddendly don't have time to even go to the gym because I need to either be working, cooking, cleaning, doing errands. Any free time is spent buying things and /or planing for the baby.

Last time we had sex was over 6 months ago and it's me who doesn't feel it. 

In between my marriages I had an amazing life. I craved the intimacy and deepness of a relationship but I think somewhere in the middle between being single and having someone is the sweet spot. 

From now on whenever anyone comes in and says they don't see benefit on marriage I am going to have to agree with them.

I know that she’s only 3, she’s gonna be crazy and usually I’m pretty good at regulating myself, or at the very least making it a point to apologize to her when I lose my temper. But today she was crazy. It was okay and tolerable for the first few hours. The first straw was when she wouldn’t let me finish changing her; she was just running around laughing while I was exhausted. Then she was just generally being insane; deliberately doing things I told her not to, not listening when I asked her to do things, normal 3 year old stuff. It was when my mom was off  and she had to go to swimming lessons that all hell broke loose. She started saying she didn’t love everybody and hitting. I picked her up to try to get her ready to leave when she smacked me in the face. She’s hit me before but this was like a complete slap that stung. I was able to hold back tears until she hit me again. I just lost it. Between her and work I feel so burnt out and my depression isn’t helping. And when I went to check if I had any clothes in the laundry room it seemed like she had calmed down but she just ran over to me and hit me again.

"S.O. ""John"" (M 41) and I ""Jane""  (F 37) have been together for 10 years. John had a dog ""Max"" for 2 years before we got together, so Max is now 12.

Ill include the background context if anyone cares to read it in a comment. 

I hate Max. It didn't start this way, but now he is one more burdensome task to complete. I spend all my time taking care of our children (5 mos twins) and our new home we moved into last week. I have tried to talk to John about it but I am just guilted for my negative feelings and that Max is old and won't be around much longer. (Max is a mutt of large breeds that tend to live 12-15 yrs.) I've told John that I frequently *genuinely* forget to let Max inside or feed him. When Max is inside he is constantly crying, even when his bowls are full and he just went out. He cries everytime the babies cry and is scared of them and all of their things (swings, bouncers, etc) John can never remember to take care of him either and tells me he doesn't have the capacity to do so because he is working 50-60 hrs/week. 
We bought auto feeders/water and Max is old enough now that the exercise of running around the large fenced backyard tires him out. Just a walk around the neighborhood and he is dragging his paws on the concrete. He mostly just lays in the sunshine in the grass all day. 

John's mother offered to take Max, she doesn't particularly love dogs either, but would take good care of him and has watched him many times, but John refused this idea saying I was trying to force him to get rid of his dog.

At this point I wish Max would just peacefully pass in his sleep so I wouldnt have this extra being to care for, to worry about a nervous old dog around 2 babies with grabby hands, an animal shedding all over my new brown floors (poor choice on our part to move into a home with dark wood flooring and a large, long white haired dog) or this wedge in my relationship.

"I feel guilty even just typing that because I love this man dearly but things have been so rocky.

This went started to go down dramatically when my bf (let’s call him Bob fake name obviously.) read private messages between me and a internet friend. These messages were asking for advice since I had no clue how to process what happened the night before and was scared. Bob told me he came home and obviously I was tipsy. I remember offering him a drink and the rest is a blur. I chalked it up to my gold fish memory till the next day bob started to talk about what happened, which I remembered non of it and realized I may have blacked out withhold drinking without realizing. He continued to say how we attempted anal (Which I have never agreed to even when sober) and went into more detail about it but I won’t get into detail here. I haven’t been able to look at him the same way since that happened and only turned to my friend for advice what to do. He never read their reply to my messages but my friend said it didn’t sound too good what happened.. since then Bob has lost trust in me and even asked if I was cheating which I said no too and that I have been loyal to him since day one. He has asked this multiple times throughout the last few months which has definitely hurt but in a way I understand why he may be asking and it has to do with his trust issues with having been cheated on in the past.

One time as of recently saying my hyper fixation on was “not pretty to look at.” Even once saying a joke and only realizing it went to far when I started to cry. He quickly apologized and I tried to laugh through the pain. The joke wasn’t far from the truth but I was caught off guard with it since I’m still in the grieving process. (long story short: I had a pet cat with a dick shape on her head, she was taken by my family and I never saw her again, family claiming I never loved the animal and didn’t care. Changed micro chip info to theirs and basically adopted her as their one behind my back after claiming to keep her for a month till I could take her back.)

"I just need to get this off my chest. Advice is you have any please. I’m writing this on mobile so sorry for the layout

I (23f) am a stay at home mom to a 16 month old. My (23m) husband is in the military. It’s our first year and we got stationed cross country from all of our family and friends. This wasn’t an issue because for two years before he joined we lived away from everyone anyway, but I guess it changed once we had our daughter. 

He goes to work every day while I stay home with our daughter. We get to spend the mornings together and he goes to work early afternoon and gets home once my daughter and I are in bed. I do most of the chores are in the house because it’s some alone time for me while he watches our daughter. 

This has been our normal for awhile and it’s been fine. I’ve had very bad postpartum anxiety and depression. It didn’t help that I was a single mom from when our daughter was a month old to 6 months. Anyway enough lead up. 

I feel like I’m barely holding on. I don’t feel like my own person anymore. I don’t see anyone adult besides my husband because we don’t know anyone here. I’m terrified to go back to work for the sole fact that my daughter would have to go into daycare and all of the horror stories of kids getting killed by mistreatment has made my anxiety go through the roof. I can barely even drive with our daughter due to anxiety and previous history when she was younger.

I try to get out of the house and go on walks because I know it’s good for you but my depression has been really bad lately so we haven’t been going on walks for the past few months. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can feel myself starting to spiral. I’ve had a bad history for self harm and suicidal thoughts. 

I’m getting those thoughts of “what is I were just break my leg or give myself a concussion so then maybe I can spend a few days in the hospital alone”

I know this seems like I’m going from 0 to 100 but there’s so much more, I just feel like I’m rambling. 

Before anyone says anything, I did tell my husband this and he said what he normally does “I hear you” and “I see where you’re coming from”. I’m getting tired of hearing those phrases but I know he only says it because he doesn’t know what to do. Hell I don’t know what to do.

"So hey reddit, i just want to get this off of my chest because why not? 

This is a long post, everything is messed up in it, thank you, if you read it.

I fell in love with a guy in 2016 and we are from different religions and it is a big deal in India so I avoided him with everything I had in me, fast forward to 2017-18 when I find out he has feelings for me too, but we didn’t act on it. We just stayed friends, he focused on his studies while I on the other hand, while focusing on my studies and job, went out with a couple other guys from 2017-2021 (what can I say, I’m just an attention seeker:)), he just had one casual thing during this whole time. Now in 2022 we were not in touch due to something he did but this year he reached out to me again on my birthday, apologised and because i will be leaving the country soon, I accepted it. We went on a date as friends and one thing led to another and we started dating, it became official and we were fine. 

He would call and text and flirt everyday at first, he was living in another city at that time while I was working from home, still in our hometown, slowly everyday became once in two days, then once in three days then straight to once a week. Okay I get it, he was busy, he hasn’t really been with anyone before so he doesn’t know how relationships are different from friendships, he used to send me a daily reminder of little things like “you are important” or “i miss you” and write it as a daily reminder. I am head over heels in love with this guy because after years of just endless hours of not being able to tell someone how you really feel to simply being able to be your realest self in front of them, it was a blessing for me. I thanked God everyday. Even on the days he didn’t call or text or simply ignored the memes i sent. 

I went to see him where he lived, in September, we spent 3 days together and for the first time I slept with someone. He says it was his first time too, but idk I don’t think so. Anyway, i have never been physically involved with anyone atp, I just always thought it should be with someone I actually loved and he was this guy. Previously we had this conversation and I told him I was an emotional mess and for me being this close to someone is not easy and if i ever slept with someone, it would be because i see a future with them. He is 23 and i am 22f.

Anyway so I come back to our hometown and he is there, be mid September we have completely stopped talking. I got so mad, i burst out at him, send him angry texts and his reply was “knowing all my things, you have said so much, I don’t want to say anything now” 

At this point him staying “busy” felt like excuses to me and i agree i said things which were out of line but i justified it to myself saying “this is just a delayed reaction to his actions”

But never in 7 years this guy, who is the closest friend to me, had gotten mad at me, so i thought i did something so wrong which cannot be fixed like this, i went to his place again in October, i called him he didn’t answer. I wanted to surprise him but he was working (he was a student in a Film school and shoots had odd timings and at this point we had been no contact for a week or two) so i just sent a video of the place he lived in and wrote “surprise, I guess”

I also sent the link to the hotel i was staying at. It was 1 in the night so i went to sleep, next morning he had still not seen the messages. Around 2pm I text him “it’s okay, i understand you are busy and your finals are going on but the least you could do is see the messages, anyway no need to come meet me or anything, I will just explore the city a little and leave” 

He started calling after this but I didn’t answer, so he called my best friend, started yelling at her, she called me told me to talk to him, I did, he didn’t yell at me but i could make it from his tone that he is mad and maybe cried a little?

He told me he was going to do some work and will come meet me the same day, he came to meet me around 9 at night, started to talk about how badly this is going and how it cannot be fixed but after sometime he just was not mad anymore? Maybe happy to see me? I got him flowers too lol! 

Anyway he left around 12 because he had to go for another project early the next morning and didn’t even come for 5-10 minutes while the rest of my stay, i was there for 4 days, I don’t blame him but it would have been nice if he could’ve just showed up for 10 minutes at least once in the last 2 days, i was staying 3-4 minutes from his hostel.

Anyway I come back to my hometown, he is still not talking to me. I text him everyday, he just replies, and if I don’t text then i do not get a reply. 

Of course i got mad again and by this time i had called him multiple times, he told me he will call me but never did so we just stopped talking. From October till now, his course has ended and he is back in our hometown, he hasn’t called. We were no contact for a while until i called him an asshole in a random text, i have never used any “bad” words with him since we know each other. He calls when I was asleep (i work nights so i sleep during the day with my phone on silent)

I text him, he tells me he wanted to meet but never followed up on that. Now again, I am the one reaching out and he is still ignoring me. 

From day 1 I told him to let me know when he’s done but well I guess it is too much to ask, just like when he asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I said a handwritten letter for which he wrote me a 5 line note and only sent it to me when i begged for a couple of months. Or just like when I asked him to just text me once a day? 

We were already on weekly calls before i went there for the first time, I just don’t know what I did wrong.

I told him I loved him, he never did. I literally wait and stare at my phone screen to see if he texts or calls. (Edit: I can’t stop being whatever i am being here)

I am sitting here bawling my eyes out for a guy who maybe never cared and i have been in love with him for years.

"  Hello, wrote this in a rush so may be a bit of a hard read, Apologies.

  I (20f) am or I am not a child of an affair between my mom and dad. From my knowledge of events, my mom was aware my dad was married and still proceeded to have a relationship with him cause she had some type of condition that required her to get pregnant to save her life and I’m some sort of miracle baby. But before proceeding she laid out the condition that with or without him she would get pregnant and he agreed to it. They started actively trying to get pregnant with me going to doctor’s appointments, and IVF treatments, he knew her days of ovulation better than her at some point and finally, she got pregnant, had me, and her life was saved.

    And continued to have a relationship with him for the next six months after my birth he was very present according to her and my uncles they even shared a beer after I was born. I believe they were supposed To get married eventually, cause I come from a culture where that’s okay but his first wife didn’t let that happen, he already had three kids with her, and from how it was explained his first wife had more money than him and came from a family with power who tried to imprison my mom for dumb reasons, and my father tired of it all in family court finally denied me as his daughter and left the both of us, but said when it’s time for my marriage my mom should call him for whatever that means. I grew up unaware my dad was alive or I didn’t care enough to know if he was or not. When I was in middle school I met one of my half siblings cause for some reason we live in the same city and she transferred to my school but I didn’t know she was my half-sister, it wasn’t until someone overheard me and my friend talking about my dads last name and he said there was a girl with the same last name in the class above us and she might be my cousin since it’s not a common last name.
   I thought maybe as well cause I somehow met a distant cousin from my dad's side not too long ago so I didn’t mind, until I told my mom about it and she asked for the full name and she said that’s my sister. To which I was too stunned to speak and told me about the rest of my siblings I forgot I had cause I didn’t care, she warned me to stay away from her to which I did cause again wasn’t that curious. Until a faithful day during exam week after an exam. Me and a couple of friends, were sitting down and talking and my half-sister and her friends sat across from us, she then proceeded to call me and ask if I was an unflattering word for disabled to which I said no or I’m dumb (can’t speak) and I also said no. Even her friends were flabbergasted at what was going on. I told my mom about it and she immediately told the school about it , they were honestly waiting for an excuse to kick my half-sister out because she wasn’t the nicest of people and within 2 weeks she was transferred into another section of my school for only girls, we also had another unpleasant meeting to which I was entering the school grounds and she was at the gate talking to her friends, I have our dads lifeless face and was kind of starring at her from the corner of my eye due to me having terrible eyesight I stared pretty long to make sure it was her.( I’ve been told a lot when I do this I look mean and I’ve almost gotten into altercations with seniors cause they thought I was looking at them wrong but no, I’m just my dad's daughter)she then screams from where she was “Stop staring at me with your dirty eyes”. I was too stunned to speak and everyone was looking at me. I refused to acknowledge it and walked away like she was talking to a ghost, not me. We’ve seen and passed each other many more times and I would wait for her to start something with me so I could sock her in the face because we both were known problems in our respective demographics back then ( not as bullies, but we both have tempers and can go from 0-100 rather quickly), but she didn’t and we went about our lives, from what I understood everyone in her class knew of me as her half-sister. They literally crowded my class to look and gawk at me and failed horribly to whisper “That’s G sister, that’s G sister” (she was very popular) thankfully I wasn’t bullied or made fun of so I would like to think she wasn’t all bad. After graduating high school I found all my half siblings on Facebook and Instagram and followed them to know more cause I finally got curious about them. It’s been years and sometimes I feel like reaching out to know their side of the story or what they know. Because a lot of the stuff I know seems a bit off. And genuinely learning about that part of my life haunts me from time to time. because I knew my grandfather as a very traditional man but loved me unconditionally even though my mom was his favorite child, I’m still a product of an unconventional relationship he wouldn’t stand for even though he has well had children out of wedlock he almost abandoned. And the fact that my uncles were cool with my moms married boyfriend is honestly puzzling. I know my dad gave me my English first name and a whole different culturally significant name from the one I have now ( one of the name’s being his late father’s name) but my mom gave me a new cultural significant name and kept the English name as is, I remember I had a conversation with my mom about me having another birth certificate with the names my dad gave me but she denies it now. So just want to piece together this looming puzzle in my life, and maybe having a heart to heart wth her may solve it.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. When we got together, I knew he had a kid. I would usually not talk to men who had kids because I didn’t want to interfere with the baby’s mother. But somehow, he hooked me like a fish and I couldn’t have been happier to get to know him and his child. 

The child is now four, and I have had the pleasure of watching him grow. Recently, my boyfriend has been bringing his baby mama up in every conversation, at first I was accepting of it but now I feel like I’m competing. 

Today, in the car, I was having a conversation about which flowers I like, and somehow he brought his baby mama up. Finally, I had enough and said, “Look, I understand that you are going to talk about her because she is part of your life due to your child. But quite frankly, I don’t believe she needs to be brought up in every conversation.” And the only reason I made this statement was because he had brought her up four times previously within the day. 

He got extremely heated and said, “I need to grow up. No other woman would act how you act about my baby mama.” Which cut deep, because I thought I was being an adult by explaining why I don’t like it.

I responded, “Well, if you want another woman to do what I do for you and your child, then go find one.” Then he responded, “Trust me, I will.” 

Then I asked him, “Imagine I had a baby daddy, and I brought him up every chance I got about things that have nothing to do with US. How would you feel?” That’s when he said, “Well, I wouldn’t be with you. I wouldn’t be with any woman who had a kid because I’m not helping raise some other man’s child.” 

That hurt, because for the last two years I have been helping him raise HIS child. I have never complained, I never nagged, I have actually enjoyed being around his child. 

What hurt is the fact that I have been putting blood, sweat, and tears into our relationship for you to tell me that you wouldn’t do the same for me and telling me how easy it would be to find another woman to do what I do for them. 

We haven’t talked since this morning, but he has been trying to contact me.

"(Changing ages for privacy) My (20m) immediate family consists of me, my parents, and my sister (18f). Me and my sister both have allergies and sensory issues. I was diagnosed with allergies to dairy and certain cooking ingredients over six years ago. It was hard, but after it happened my extended family and my parents were very understanding And asked me what I could eat whenever they agreed to host dinner or at least provided a side dish so I didn’t have to go hungry. After a couple of years, they stopped doing this. I would end up having to go to dinners thinking they’d provide me with something to eat because they hosted dinner and insisted on making food themselves, but they’d make something like pizza, which I can’t eat (they’ve made me my own special kind before, but they stopped doing that after I think one or two times). I feel weird bringing my own food to Christmas or thanksgiving or even just a family cookout, but I’ve started to have to. They’ve told me they “feel bad” seeing me sit there and watch everyone eat without anything and have tried to force me to eat something that makes me sick. I didn’t, obviously. They’ve also given me weird looks when I bring my own food, so they think it’s rude. They just announced for the second year they’re going to host Christmas Eve and order Chinese food. Me and my sister both can’t have anything. They make her gag and the spices in basically everything make me ill. They didn’t even ask us first, they just announced it And never reached out to ask what we can eat. I’m honestly just tempted to skip. We’re going to see the same family the next day during Christmas Day dinner, and I can actually eat food there since me and my sister are also helping host. It went from people caring about what I could eat for maybe a year or two, tops, to being content with just letting me sit there in silence and watch them all talk and laugh and eat together.

"We got a letter from my wife's car's manufacturer. Part recall. We make an appointment with the dealerships's service center. My wife takes our second car to work and I take her car into the dealership to be fixed. 

I talk to a guy at a desk to check on the vehicle. 

Car dealership guy: ""What phone number is on the registry?""

Me: ""My wife's. Lemme pull it up.""

Car dealership guy: ""That's okay, I'll check my phone too since she was texting me last night.""

I just said ""mmhm"" and kept looking in my phone. 
Then, he decides I don't get the joke, so he tries explaining it to me. I say ""yeah, I get it"" and read him my wife's phone number. He just sits there and types it in, then tells me to wait while my car part is replaced. He's red in the face and squirming in his chair.

"After 10 years together and 3 kids later (and raising a stepchild), I finally found out that he's been cheating on me and now he wants to end things. I know I should be happy, but the truth is that I feel broken and scared.

I put up with so much for years even though I should have known better. I've never had a problem with him having access to my phone. He would go through texts, emails, call logs, and social media. I had nothing to hide though. Then he deleted every male off of my Facebook before deleting my Facebook entirely. He told me to deal with it or leave. He said he didn't trust me because of my past.. I was open and honest about it and told him everything. Maybe I shouldn't have.. I hoped things would change though.. Eventually he closed out all of my friends by telling them I didn't want to talk to them. Any time any of his friends tried to get to know me, he'd tell them I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them.

After I became pregnant with our first child, he started getting worse.. Slapping me in the face and throwing me around.. I even jumped out of the car at one point and walked to a store crying.. I asked to use the phone and called my family for help. Instead of helping, they called him and told him where I was so he could get me. I've always known my family is fucking terrible, but that made me realize they really didn't give a fuck about me. I knew I didn't have anywhere to go. After our last kid, who is only one, he forced me to get my tubes tied. He said he wouldn't do it and I had to do it or it would be over.

He forced me to sign a post-nup. At this point, he'd threaten to kill me numerous times. He said he'd throw me and our child on the street, then he'd take our child from me, not because he wanted her, but just to hurt me. All of our money has gone into an account that only has his name on it. I have a single credit card that I can only use in an emergency. All of our property, investments, anything you can think of are in his name.. Everything has gone towards his retirement because we'd be able to retire early off of it.

Our house has a camera in every room, if not multiple cameras. He constantly watches me. He has set up child locks on my phone and follows my location. Just to make sure he knows where I am, there are multiple Apple air tags that he uses. I'm not allowed to talk to anyone. If I do, he considers it cheating.. He has threatened multiple bosses of mine if he finds any type of communication.. Then I have to go into damage control in order to keep my job and explain to them the shit I put up with.

I stay at home and take care of the animals, the kids, the house.. I also work a full-time job (mostly from home so we don't have to spend money on daycare). He doesn't spend any time with the kids. When he is home, he wants his food made, his clothes ready for him, his medicine out for him.. then he takes a nap. He goes out every night to the gym for a few hours and then is out most of the night at bars or with friends.. I haven't gone out on my own since we've been married.. He has never stayed home with the kids without me.

I've never been allowed to see his phone. He said it was out of principle. After years, I finally figured out the password.. That's when I found everything.. he'd been seeing and talking to multiple people over the years.. I found dick pics and videos. Sexting. Everything.. He's pretty much in a relationship with a bartender at the nearest bar to our house.. and he's also fucking around with the mother of his first child.. I felt sick to my stomach when I saw everything. My heart literally dropped.

I told him I found everything. I half expected to get my ass beat for getting on his phone. No.. instead he said he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me. I asked what changed.. he said it's because I found out.

I do everything for him. I've done everything for him. I've done literally anything I can to make him happy. Even when he got mad at me for having communication with anyone else, I apologized. I just wanted him to be happy and want to be with me and for us to have a good marriage. I'm sure I'm forgetting about half of the fucked up stuff he's done to me...

I haven’t been allowed to buy myself clothes. I can’t wear make up. I can’t get my hair cut. I can’t do anything because he assumes I’m doing it for someone else. He gets brand new clothes all the time.. wears cologne.. gets his hair and beard trimmed.. he literally tries to make me as ugly as possible to anyone. 

He's told me to kill myself over and over. He's told me I'm worthless, ugly, fat, stupid, and no one loves me.. not even the kids. He would tell me over and over that everything is my fault. That I should be the one working harder. That I don't do enough to show that I love him or care for him. He said that the only reason he even asked me to marry him was for financial reasons and that he probably never did love me. I should be happy this is over. I know I should.

I've gone to multiple therapists over the years. I've told them the truth. I usually made it a few sessions before he made me quit or go to someone else. They'd always say the same things.. and prescribe me a ton of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. He told me he wanted them to do that so then I'd look crazy during the divorce and unable to take care of myself or the children.

What am I going to do though? My future is gone. I still thought maybe he would change. Now I don't know where I'm going to live, how I'm going to retire, how I'm going to handle him being with the kids when I'm not around.. I don't trust him. He doesn't care about them at all.

He's convinced everyone else in the world that he's some amazing person. He has tons of friends. He's the fun guy to hang out with. He'll go on random trips across country. He'll stay out all night. He'll be the sweetest guy in the world. And he convinces everyone else I'm some monster and they should feel sorry for him that he's married to me..

Maybe he's right.. maybe no one will ever love me. Maybe I am all of the things he says I am. Maybe  I deserved this all along and I really was never good enough. I can barely breathe. I can't make it through a day without crying. It's been less than two weeks.. It's fucking Christmas.

"My best friend of 20+ years does not like my fiance, but I have to think it's more her and her past than him.

I, 28F I've been with my fiance  34M for 3+ years. We are engaged and are moving in together next year and have talked about having kids and everything. We are 100% on the same page with everything in terms of our lifestyles, we're both independent and want to work and support one another's goals. He is the most respectful guy I have ever dated, loves me exactly how I am, never stopped putting in the same effort he was putting in at the beginning of the relationship after all these years, and I couldn't ask for a better guy. Now, when I met him, he was pretty fairly well off financially, and the only reason I'm bringing this part up is because he had a rough year recently and lost a lot of money. Some of it was stolen, he got scammed badly, and he had some residuals for a decade that he stopped receiving after the pandemic. He still has savings, and I have a good job and he has a plan to fix his situation. He currently has a part-time job and just interviewed for a position that pays three figures and thinks he did really well. If he got the job, it would be next month, but my friend does not trust him because she has had really bad past relationships where people lied about money.

She is convinced my fiance is lying to me about his money, but the thing is, she is the ONLY person who has met him who doesn't love him. My parents love him, same with my siblings,  and all my other friends who have met him. I think my friend has really bad trust issues with guys because she almost married this one guy until she found out he lied about how much money he had, and same thing happened I think later in another relationship. I understand she is trying to protect me and everything, but it's really gotten to me. Like she'll send me memes on Instagram that are like ""why would you date a broke guy"" and it really gets to me. I could care less about money and I'd rather date a poor guy who is a really great person than a horrible person who is rich, because people can always turn their financial situation around. 

It's sad too, because this best friend of mine, lets call her Rachel, has met my fiance multiple times and she initially approved its just recently I think she is being way too harsh about my fiance. She is freaking out that him and I talked about having kids and she is demanding I live with him for at least 8 months before getting married and then be married for at least a year or something before having kids.....she even suggested I go on birth control because she's so worried about this. 

I feel heartbroken feeling as though I have to choose between two people who both mean so much to me but I have thought multiple times of not being super close with Rachel anymore, despite us knowing each other for so long.

"My grandfather has multiple health conditions that may or may not result in his passing in a few years, he is nearing his 70's. He has expressed his wish for me to have children so that he can become a great-grandfather hopefully before he passes away.

Every time the topic came up, I would either change the topic, deflect, or make a joke about it. Like, saying ""Well who knows (my brother) would want kids too!"" or ""Haha, does a fur baby count? (referring to pets)"". But I never really gave him a serious answer because I honestly don't know what to say to him. 

I am autistic and have a few other disorders, some genetic and some not, but I wouldn't want to give the genetic ones to my children. Furthermore I have history with major depression and anxiety, and I am terrified of what will happen to me and how my body works postpartum. And the entire idea of pregnancy terrifies me as well, as I have done my research and there seems to be many risks that most people don't really talk about. 

I am currently looking to get my tubes tied, and if I get a desire to have children in the future, I would be perfectly fine with adopting. But I do not ever want to biologically conceive a child.

I don't know what the best thing to do for my grandfather is. On one hand, I could explain all of this to him and make it clear that I don't wish to conceive children, but then it could just end up making his possible last few years miserable and heartbroken. Or I could lie and say that I promise to give him great-grandchildren biologically, but that just...feels wrong, to lie to my grandfather like that. Yes it would make him happier but I don't know if that's the morally best thing to do.

He's taken care of me in my childhood when both of my parents were working, and I don't resent him for asking me this because I'm very aware he comes from a different time and he means the best for me. I am willing to deal with the consequences of whether or not I lie to him, though I guess I need more time to figure out which choice is best for him.

I made a comment to my boyfriend that it would be nice to have a baby that would be close in age and grow up with its cousins, and he agreed. He has been open about really wanting to try for a baby in the next year. I also recently made a Facebook after not having social media for a few years so I could keep up with family and see pictures. This is where the situation came to light.

When we first started dating my boyfriend shared with me that his ex had two children (they are both under 8). He said they were not biologically his, but he had raised them for years and they had called him dad. Him and his ex had a rocky relationship, and I’ve seen proof of her behavior that lead me to believe what he told me. He told me he tried to continue seeing them after they split, but it became a cycle of him and his ex fighting, her telling him he’d never see the kids again, then a few weeks/days later using the kids to try to guilt him into getting back together, rinse and repeat. He told me it was incredibly difficult, but he eventually decided it wasn’t fair to the kids to be in and out of their lives, and he had to stop seeing them. His ex still contacted him randomly for a little while after we started dating, and what I saw corroborated this. 

I had no reason to disbelieve what he told me. He talked about it openly and how much he missed them and thought about them. He told me if they ever reached out and wanted to talk to him, he would do it in a heartbeat. He also told me his aunt still had his ex on social media and sent him pictures of the kids occasionally, which he would save to his phone (I know for a fact he has his ex blocked on all platforms, when she contacts him it’s through a number generator). I told him I was fine with all this and supported it, and even supported him trying to see them again, as long as I was aware of what was going on. He said the same cycle would happen again and it would just hurt the kids further, but he would let me know if anything changed. 

Anyway, as I stated earlier, I made a Facebook after a few years of not having one. My boyfriend doesn’t use Facebook much anymore, he occasionally watches videos, but doesn’t post or anything. I did end up looking at his profile though, and I saw pictures of the kids. I know for a fact one is not his (mixed race), but the other I noticed does look like him. I also noticed he was born while my boyfriend was still with his ex. My heart dropped seeing this. I told my boyfriend we needed to talk and sat down with him and brought my findings to his attention.

He assured me he was being honest about the kids not being his. Him and his ex had an on-and-off relationship due to their constant fighting. During one of their breaks his ex got pregnant by one of her exes. When they got back together, she found out she was pregnant, and he decided to stay and raise the baby with her, as her other son already considered him a father and they had a strong bond. He gave me the name of the biological father, and I can see similarities between the child and him, as well. But I do still think he looks like my boyfriend. 

At this point I asked him if he had signed the birth certificate. He admitted to me he had. I asked him why he didn’t tell me and asked if he was paying child support. He told me he hadn’t thought to tell me because he wasn’t paying child support or anything. I asked him if he realized she could go to court at any time and he would owe years in back pay, and also that if anything happened to her he was the legal father of this child. He looked kind of dumbfounded when I told him this and said that a paternity test would prove he wasn’t the father if anything ever came up. 

We had a discussion and I asked him if he wanted to stay on the birth certificate, as I was fine if he wanted to. I also said he had rights as a legal father and could fight for visitation. He told me he didn’t think that was a good idea, and he was fine with trying to get taken off the birth certificate. We looked up the laws in our state and since so much time has passed, a judge can decide that even if he is biologically not the father, he could be determined to be a “more fit” father, even if it’s just to provide child support. 

At this point I told him I did not feel comfortable moving forward in our relationship until I knew he was not biologically the father, especially before we consider trying for a baby. I have no issue with him having a child, I have no issue if he wanted to remain in the child’s life, but I would be incredibly upset if he had lied to me and wasn’t taking accountability for the child. He told me he understood and just asked that he could save up some money for a lawyer, court, and potentially owing child support if the judge decided that. 

I agreed, but I have been an anxious wreck since this happened. It is on my mind constantly. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. He is incredibly caring. I cannot see him being the type of person that would just leave a child behind without reason. I can tell he loves them and misses them. If it is his child, why would he do this, especially when it seems like he’d be so happy to see them? Could it be because of his ex? Still not okay to me, but I have just been trying to make sense of this in my head ever since, constantly ruminating. I even asked him what would happen if we did have kids and ended up splitting, and he seemed hurt at my suggestion. 

I am so upset and hurt, because I feel like if I find out this is his child, I shouldn’t stay in this relationship. It would be morally wrong if I did, right? I feel like I would be an accomplice in him not being in his child’s life. I love him so much and I really don’t want to leave him.

"So I've told my friend that I've liked him in the past, and he got broken up with last October, and I broke up with my ex back in August.

When I told him I liked him I said ""we both just got out of a relationship recently, so I know things won't work, plus we have some distance between us"" (I'm in canada, he's in the US) so I didn't want to possibly ruin our friendship by dating.

Well today he told me how he's alone, and that everyone and their brothers are all ""boo'd up"" and it kinda really hurt. But I don't want to be selfish, and take away from his pain, and tell him how I feel.

I'm sorry if none of this is making sense, my head has been in a bad place for the past week and not sure how to form my feelings into a format.

"I’ve been with my (m22) partner since we were 18/19. 

When we first got together i had the rose tinted glasses on. He had an obnoxious mommy thing- when i say obnoxious i mean I was completely new to relationships, sex and kinks and i was transparent that due to trauma i needed time to explore and take things slow. But he was insistent that every relationship had a “top” and a “bottom” and that ours was “100%” me. 

He would want me to pick him up, lay him on my lap and call him princess, cook and clean for him whilst he played xbox, tend to his sexual fantasies 2/3 times a day but say that it was for my pleasure and praise him. At the same time as this, he would watch porn whilst i was asleep next to him. 

He put in no effort. I would buy everything, food, dates. He stayed at my house for 4 months straight and never even bothered with my family. 

When things got more serious, later we moved into together- albeit in a rush due a terminally ill relative. 

I fell pregnant due to his recklessness and during the 16 weeks i was pregnant i began to seriously resent him. I couldn’t even pretend  to play along with the “mommy” thing anymore and i no longer wanted to spend spare time with him.  

After the abortion, Which he insisted i had and was no help whatsoever during this time whilst i was still recovery from the surgery i found out that he had been obsessively watching porn- despite me setting a boundary and asking him not too. 

Over the next few months, a cycle would occour of me finding out he was watching porn still, confronting him- he would lie and then admit it and cry to make me feel sorry for him. 

He found out his dad had terminal cancer and his coping mechanism was to masterbate to furry porn. 

More recently, he is hostile. I am no longer fussed to cater any of his sexual needs- vanilla, bdsm or otherwise. He gets frustrated that i’m busy- always expecting me to drop what im doing to help him with a simple task i.e hanging up a photo frame. 

When i point out im busy, he is sour that i don’t think his rendezvous is more important. 

When it comes to paying rent, he has some money in his bank which could’ve covered the debt he and his dad caused. Instead, he has made me pay it out of our shared account for bills and utilities- meaning that this month we will not be able to afford an adequate food shop, heating or most other house hold essentials such as toilet paper, electricity and internet. 

He speaks to me like i am a child- something that is wasting his time. Doesn’t even try with my interests but expects me to be enthralled by his and doesn’t contribute anything towards the the smooth sailing of the house whatsoever. 

He shouted at my mom a week after her mom died because his radiator started leaking due to neglect from him and his dad. He called my sister with postpartum a whore and a rubbish mum and screamed at my kids siblings.

"sorry for typo or bad grammar 

I did not ever expect to be finally talking about this, let alone with a bunch of strangers, But I think I just need to let it out because I’ve only been feeling rage and anger these past few days.

my stepdad is a very controlling, angsty and clingy person and i hate him. i dont feel safe with him and i don’t wanna see him anymore. but my mom refuses to leave him. 

So for backstory, my mom met my stepdad about 10 years ago and my bond with him was really close up until i was 9 when i started puberty. When i started puberty he would constantly look at my thighs and chest and when i got out of the shower in a towel he would just look me up and down. he has also been very controlling with me and i cant even drink sweet drinks once in awhile. 

Anyway, back to the main point, since 2019, my fam and i have only been moving houses here and there because either rent was too high or our roommates are unbearable. When my stepdad invited my family over to stay with him, my mom was more than happy to accept it, but i told my sister that i felt uncomfortable with it and she talked to my mom, but my mom said no.

I have already moved in my stepdads and my mom wants to finally plan to get her own house asap. the thing is, my stepdad is currently staying with his aunt who is angsty and always finds problems with people. she dislikes my family and my stepdad doesn’t like her because of that. 

i already feel uncomfortable staying here, but because of his aunt, my mom wants to invite my stepdad to move in with us as she is planning to buy our own house. 

my sister and i are against it, we have talked about it to her, i even told my mom he always looks at my thighs. yet she doesn’t listen and says im overreacting. i rlly feel like shit and i dont want to have to constantly go out next time to avoid my stepdad at home. i hate it here and i dont want him to move in. i dont know how to go about this and i dont wish to stay home anymore. i want to be able to wear shorts comfortably at home, i want to be able to drink any sweet drinks i want, i want to spend time with my mom any time.

"For better or for worse, in sickness and in health; I work on the ground I was married on. The happiness I felt that day was second to none. My betrothed, then pregnant with our first daughter. We’d been together since youth, tugged on each other’s hearts for 15 years before we tied the knot. For some context- a most welcome blessing was the fact that I work on several ranches, one of which is almost exclusively inaccessible via road, (due to a gated entry and terribly steep narrow path down the side of a canyon. The road caves in almost yearly with the rainfall.) nay for those who care for it. It is, from what I’m told a quite famous fishing location on the Deschutes river for any avid fishermen willing to make the trek several miles upstream. Beautiful as any place I could hope to find matrimony. As a rancher’s salary is humble and this location available to us, we were wed there. In fact, I’m sure we are the only couple to have ever been wed there. With every great wedding, all close relatives and friends were shuttled down this path for our ceremony. At my side, my best man was my brother, whom later I would find entangled with my wife nearly a year to the day of our first anniversary. Now, every trip down this narrow stretch, I almost always gravitate to the edge of the cliffside . Pressing the odds of perhaps one of these days, the path giving way under the weight of the truck, sending the vehicle tumbling downward with me inside. Only then would I needn’t face the land where our arch once stood that we made our vows under. I’m sure it would befit such beauty to such tragedy.

I have a good job, have built own house and don't rely on parents money anymore since I started working. Unfortunately, I don't have the Greek-god like looks as I wasn't lucky with the genes.

I have been nice to everyone irrespective of their personalities and situations, not going out of control and managing situations calmly and helping out when required. I'm also open to suggestions and improvements and I believe communication is vital in a relationship. But in the end when the time comes to take the next step, all I get to hear is that ""You are a nice person, you will get/deserve someone better. I don't deserve you."" I don't annoy or bother them once they have decided to move on after making their decision final.

"NSFW tag just in case!

I (18f) have recently started having a couple of hookups, nothing crazy though, I've only done this with two men so far.

I'd like to think I'm a really confident person and I think I can fake that a lot, but men have never really liked me in a romantic way, I've never even had a boyfriend, just one failed talking stage. So finding at least two guys that find me attractive was a bit of a confidence boost.

However, last night ruined it for me. I had been over to Sam's (18m fake name) house once before and things went okay, I didn't get to finish but he did... twice. Should have been my first red flag tbh. But I went over again last night and we were having sex and he made me finish.

I should preface this with the fact that when I finish, I am able to squirt. (Sorry if this is TMI) I went to the bathroom to clean up and whatever and when I came back there was a spot on his bed and Sam said something like ""Damn we must have sweat a lot."" Like what????

It wasn't a huge wet spot, and I told him ""Oh I'm so sorry I should have warned you or had you lay a towel down or something. But when I finish I squirt a bit...""

He then looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""Oh my God what? That literally makes me want to vomit. I guess I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.""

We then went and watched some more of this movie that we started watching before having sex but my mood was ruined. Sam then started asking me about my body count and seemed to judge me for it (mine is 3 his is 4 so idfk). 

And the Cherry on top, he asked me if I think he's fit, I said yes as he has abs, big strong arms and legs, and goes to the gym frequently. He then gave a a hmmm and looked at me like he was judging me for my body. For reference, I'm kind of short and on the curvier side, and I've seen this look many times before, I know it means that he thinks I'm big. This made me want to cry so I told him it was getting late and I left.

He didn't even get up off of the couch walk me to the door or say goodbye.

I feel like a piece of shit now and just needed to vent here do thank you.

"31 (M) UK

I wanted to openly talk about this as it happened some 20yrs ago and it was only recently that I discovered it had created some issues within myself. 

When I was around 10/11, my mom started attending a Christian church where she met her now husband. I was never really into it back it then but she would always send me on these weekend away trips that the church would do for the kids. 

I don’t really remember a lot about them but fleeting memories here and there. This always sticks out. 

I was at the age of about 12/13 on this one trip and the rooms were automatically filled so you didn’t have a choice with who you shared a room with. I ended up with three other boys who were much older than me. I was also still quite short at the time. 

I sort of kept myself to myself as I didn’t know them and I’ve always been quite shy because I’ve always been bullied and never had many friends. 

Here comes the hard part. 
I distinctly remember the event. It was harrowing. 

The three boys were being rowdy as it was and started watching porn on the old style phones where you had to limewire it and put it on your phone. 

I was still keeping to myself and was about to go and leave as to which one of them got up and started to harass me, blocking my path and trying to not let me go. 

One of them grabbed me from behind and pushed me up against the wall. One held me there as another started to undress me, and the third boy was there wanking while watching. The one who undressed me held my jaw and mouth open and the one who was wanking came over and started putting it in my mouth. I remember crying and sort of trying to fight everything but I was too weak. I’m not sure how long it went on for it, but it felt like an eternity. 

They took it in turns “with me” until they decided enough was enough and finished themselves off on me. I remember curling up in a ball on the floor crying and they got dressed and left me there. 

I went to shower and clean myself off and just the whole thing was a blur. I remember texting my mom to say I wanted to come home because I didn’t like it, but she said it was only one night and I’d be back home tomorrow night. 

I got dressed after and asked to change rooms when I found the person who was leading the camp thing, and they said they’d try and find me a new room, which they did. 

I didn’t speak to anyone all weekend after that. Shut myself off completely. My partner doesn’t really know the full story just that I was SA’d by boys at my church when I was younger. 

We go travelling a lot now and she enjoys seeing all the architecture in cathedrals and stuff, I can’t stand to walk in. I hate it, I feel sick. 

I hate religion because of this, my mom would always say the people of god love one another and are there to protect you, it sounds cliche but it didn’t work for me. I couldn’t bring myself to report the boys because I felt I wouldn’t be taken seriously. I was bullied everyday at school, I’d report people and it got worse for me, so I guess I felt that it wouldn’t have worked if I did. 

I never went to the church again, I told my parents I didn’t want to go anymore. They tried to force me at some stages and took me whether I wanted to or not and I felt sick being there. 

I remember a boy at my school when I was in college, I went to the toilet and left the cubicle door unlocked, he had followed me in, locked the door and tried to undress me. I managed to punch him (god knows how in such a small space), unlock the door and leave but I remember everything came flashing back at that point. 

It’s too late for me now to have anything done about it. I can’t bring myself to tell my parents about it, something I have to live with.

We have had discussions before about how neither of us are comfortable with eachother going (nothing to do with trust) and we promised we wudnt. Last time i saw Mark was 2 weeks ago and he brought up the topic about how he would never go etc. 

Last night was the night his friends were going. It started as him calling me, claiming how bored he was and straight away i knew where this was going. He told me he doesnt care about what promises he made and how its not worth him being bored for 1 night, than making me happy and respecting our boundaries. This was followed by a one sided argument which he proceeded to insult me, mock my anxiety, and obviously made me cry. He told me im crying like a r***** and that its all fake to manipulate him. He told me if his friends knew how stupid i was they would hate me. I told him to relax and i asked him to listen to me remind him of the conversations we have had prior, he told me i had 1 hour to decide if i wanted to “let” him clubbing or he would break up with me . I tried to call him a few times to which he all declined and it turns out he spent all his night on discord playing video games.

"this is the dumbest problem to ever have, i know, pls be kind to me, im complaining on reddit so obviously i’m in a weird and horrible state of mind 💀

i just want to look conventionally attractive. i know i can be considered “pretty” or “cute”, but not in a real way. i’m a “type”. a very small, specific group of people like me. and it’s for how i present, my hair and clothes and makeup, not for my actual features. i want to be the attractive where everybody KNOWS you’re attractive, whether or not they are personally attracted to you. i want to be the naturally beautiful, no makeup, no more blonde eyelashes and white eyebrows. feminine.

i have a boyfriend who loves me, he tells me i’m the most beautiful person he’s ever seen. but of course he says that, he has to. he has never lied to me, im certain of this, he has a very difficult time lying (morally), but i think this is the one thing he’s just not truthful about.

i want to look the kind of pretty that brooke monk is. whether you hate her or like her, she IS pretty (i’m convinced people only hate her because she’s pretty and has an online presence). or the kind of pretty that emma watson is. or sophia lillis, or zendaya, or my cousin, or my mom. where it’s just a fact that they are attractive people.

i get an ego boost from my workplace. im 19, everybody else is 46 and up. any young people that come into my place of employment can immediately recognize that, objectively, as the youngest and only female, i am attractive in comparison to the people they likely see in a day in this industry (auto parts, warehousing). i have been flirted with a lot at work by people my age and older. but it’s only because of that fact- they don’t have much to compte me to.

but as soon as i go out into the real world, none of it matters. compared to the general population, im really, truly, below average. i can bump myself up a bit to average/slightly above average with good makeup and done up hair, but i don’t want to have to. 

and non of that “don’t compare yourself” bullshit. it doesn’t matter if i don’t, other people will. our whole life is spent comparing everything. 

it just truly kills me that i can’t be the most beautiful person in the world. or just beautiful at all. the most i get is cute, sometimes.

"I currently babysit full time for a woman who was once my friend, but after the experiences I've had in her home... There are no methods to the madness she calls ""parenting"", and as someone who studied child development, her words and actions revolving around her kids piss me off to indescribable degrees. When I quit, she probably won't see me again. Her parenting has literally killed our friendship - if I bring up the issues I'm having, she'd probably punch me in the face.

But I can't quit. I need the pennies I get from her to buy fucking groceries. And I also feel like she's been trying to guilt trip me about my payment lately (example, telling me I'm her ""biggest expense""... Yeah, say that after taking your kid to a daycare, lady). So financially, stressed the hell out.

I've been job hunting since I started babysitting for her. At first, casually. This was supposed to be temporary, so I was taking my sweet time, trying to find an employment opportunity that would fit my specific needs. Then her two oldest kids went to school in September and I'm left at home with the toddler... Okay, job hunt a little more. Nothing. Now I'm job hunting so vigorously that I'm emailing companies from their main websites to see if they have any local opportunities I could take advantage of.

I keep having mini mental breakdowns during the day. I've got a pinch of depression already, and normally, I can stuff the tears down until I'm in my own space and can comfortably let out the tension and move on. But these days, I can't. I'll be fine and then ***BAM*** I'm the opposite of fine and it all pours out of me. Never with the older kids around or any adults in the complex... I'll usually just go find a private corner where the toddler can't see me or ask questions. Just a minute or two to lose my mind, pull myself back together and get back to kiddo.

But I hate it. I hate this part of my life. I hate that at 31, this is as far as I've gotten. I feel like a useless failure. I'm better than this. I'm smart and capable. But I also have medical issues that cause a struggle and means that a lot of employment opportunities won't work for me...

I'm lucky to have the supportive partner I have, though. He's so compassionate and understanding about what's going on. Today when I was texting him about my struggles, he came back immediately with ""I'll talk to [my boss] and see if any of his professional connections have a job that would work for you.

"Its my latest relationship, just 6-7 months ago. I have moved on, havent really think about him. But then lately things we did just kept appearing in my mind. Maybe because im actually regret to be with him, for the way he turned out to be.

But i cant get rid of our time when i ask him when he realized that he’s falling in love with me. 

He said its when he spending his time making a minecraft server with me. We were just friends then, new friends. He kept thinking why he suddenly gave so much effort create a server (theres a problem back then) for me. He said thats when he realized he got feelings for me, because he would never be bothered with things like that.

We met from study place. Starting as study buddy then become a game partner to a relationship.

Too bad it ends when he comes to me and said that hes not ready for a relationship. He said all that stuff but sometimes i wonder if it just him step off because of his family issue. His family had a problem before our breakup, i kept reassuring him i would be there for him, that its not his fault that things are happening in his family. Yet he still go

It did make me regret for how quick it is, it escalated pretty fast, more than what im ready. 

I dont know, i dont miss him though. I just feel like its a mistake to be with him.

"My older sister (23) and I (21 F) have had a pretty strange relationship my entire life. We are compete opposites to the point that I can’t recall the last time we had an argument because we have mutually agreed that we have nothing in common. We are both in college and are living off campus in an apartment with another roommate that happens to be my friend from high school. My sister is the smartest person I know and has won several awards for her outstanding academic successes. However; she is severely lacking in social skills and has many obsessive tendencies that do make living with her a challenge. She doesn’t have any friends so she calls my mom 1-2 times a day and needs to “report” to me about almost everything she does. For example I can’t interrupt her studies because she finds it disruptive, but has no problem barging in on my studies anytime of the day to let me know when she’s taking a shower, a nap, going to eat or even start her homework. She doesn’t have much of a life outside of school so she retells stories about our childhood over and over. She is deathly afraid of growing up and almost conducts herself in an extremely childish manner. She doesn’t drive (frankly I wouldn’t want her to) so I drive her back forth from the apartment to our hometown for holidays. She is a very intense personality and every time we get in the car she gets into huge “trauma dumping” rants that inevitably end up with her in tears balling her eyes out . I do value the fact that she confides in me but I can only do so much and I do not like the fact that I am becoming a therapist to her. We have both had trauma because of family issues and we are both asian and adopted into a white household. What is starting to bother me is that she can’t seem to shake the idea that she is forever and always a victim. She is extremely pessimistic and tells me that she envy’s me because I have a social life and  a long term relationship. I had a victim mentality but I realized that a self deprecating person isn’t necessarily something that people want to befriend, but my sister has not recognized that and blames her autism, ocd , and ethnicity for every reason she doesn’t have a social life. I can’t deny that those are definitely challenges that she has to live with but she is letting it define her life. My mother also tends to baby my sister when it comes to everyday tasks and I feel like it has stunted her in a way. I got a job in high school and has been working ever since . My sister finally got a job at 21 and only had it for less than a year because she “ couldn’t stand the work environment”. Now in her free time all she does is play on her computer and go online. When it comes to chores around the house I do all of them and my mother never asks my sister because my sister “ has enough on her plate”. I have ADD and anxiety as well as a working student and yet my mother doesn’t have any problem with asking me for help and whenever I ask “couldn’t you just ask my sister for help” all my mother can do is make an excuse that she doesn’t want to bother her. My sister obsesses over very negative information that she finds online about statistics, autism and Asian studies. She is interested in learning but to a detriment. She has surrounded herself with the idea that there is no good in the world and that every human is out to hurt her in some way. The last time we had to drive together I was at my breaking point, I can sympathize with her but I told her that it’s getting harder to truly feel sorry for her because she has done nothing but stew over her issues for years without any action to try to help herself. She got frustrated with me and went on about how I wouldn’t ever understand and how my life is seemingly perfect compared to her own. At this point I can’t stand to be around her much because all she does is irritate me and then dump all of her problems on me. I don’t feel that I can tell her how I truly feel because she is hard on herself and already feels like a burden plus she has had suicidal thoughts so I don’t every want to trigger them.  I feel guilty about even holding onto resentment because she didn’t choose to have autism and I can see how deeply she struggles with it.",My struggles with resentment towards my autistic sister and the overwhelming guilt that follows,18ntnyx,1703183306.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ntnyx/my_struggles_with_resentment_towards_my_autistic/,
"Did I get sexually assaulted last night? (Throwaway account I don’t want this on my main)

I was at my college gym last night like normal and after I finished my set at the cable stack, this girl walked go to me and started feeling my chest. Like without saying anything she was grabbing and squeezing my right pec. I moved out of the way and said, “What are you doing?” And then she said, “I wanted to feel your chest, you work out obviously what’s the big deal?” I didn’t know what to say, or what to do, and I just left that area of the gym and finished my workout and left. It was super awkward and weird.

I don’t know this girl, I don’t go to parties but I still am social and I was talking to my gf about this and she said that I was assaulted. She said to me, imagine if you were a girl and a guy did that to you, that would be weird and creepy as fck. I didn’t think that much of it at the time besides it was just really weird, but did I actually get “sexually assaulted” at the gym?

"I (21m) have had my fair share of crushes over the years, and one thing I’ve realized is the only way I can ever get over them is finding someone else. I was recently reminded of this because I caught feelings for a girl in my class this semester, and suddenly my feelings for my ex (kinda?) situationship disappeared. This is kinda crazy because I had cut off my ex (i’ll just refer to her as that because it’s easier) last summer, and spent over a year trying to get over her because she was bad for me and didn’t treat me well, and yet my feelings for her persisted. But now I finally catch feelings for someone else and magically it feels like I’m completely over it. Is this normal? Part of me feels like this is a reflection of something being wrong with me: maybe I’m too much of a hopeless romantic, maybe I need to work towards being more self-actualized, who knows.

"This post may be too long, sorry if it seems a bit disorganised or rushed, English is not my first language and I will write it to just be able to vent, as I don't want to talk about this to anyone I actually know.

To give context I (21 F) went through a bit of a strange event, I guess.

When I was 14 years old, my father tried to convince me to have sex, and he touched me, he didn't actually assaulted me, at the time I didn't even know how to react beyond yelling at him after he touched me, I was mainly confused because I never thought something like that could happen, I had this idea that when someone wants to abuse you, it would be forced, but he started talking about it like it was something super normal, saying he needed someone since he and my mother were never intimate anymore.

I was so confused and panicked that I didn't even answer, we were in a pretty isolated area, there were no houses for several meters away from there, plus it was really late (we were out as we had just bought a motorbike and he said to go for a ride so he could see how I drove), I didn't start yelling and talking back until he touched me, so he just stopped, said sorry and we kept quiet until we got home.

I honestly thought I wouldn't tell my mother, but she always urged me to trust her and tell her everything, so when I got up the courage I told her, she confronted him and they had a huge fight that night. He lived with us for another 2-3 years (I can't really remember, I have a lot of trouble remembering correctly what happened after that outside of a few events), it was quite stressful actually, he apologised to me on three occasions, he always cried and said he didn't want to hurt me, and I really came to believe him, but each time he ended up doing more of the same, so I just decided to start ignoring him after that.

I tried not to leave my room, and during holidays he would come in to work (he was quite heavy, he would come in at 7 am and leave almost at 7-8 pm, but I liked it because I didn't have to be home), finally he was the one who asked my mother for a divorce and they separated, I have two other siblings, and my mother got full custody (it should be noted that none of this was ever taken to court, my siblings nor any other relatives - and in fact no one besides my mother - knew about what happened). 

After this happened (including the other attempts after he asked for forgiveness) I started to have memories of much earlier, I guess I must have been 9-10 years old at the time, where he did similar things (mainly touching me or rubbing against me), yet still, I repeat that I don't remember him actually abusing me on any occasion, and even so, I don't know if that really happened or was just my brain making things up because of what happened.

After that context, now we come to what is causing me a lot of conflict:

I always held a grudge against him, mainly for having hurt my mother in that way, even so, she would talk to me all the time about how I should forgive him, how it wasn't his fault and that he grew up in a very conflictive environment.

I never took her words seriously, honestly it sounds stupid to me to want to justify the damage he did to us as if it wasn't his fault and just forgive him, I haven't spoken to him since he left home, but even so, he still comes on Saturdays to visit my brother and sister so I try to stay in my room.

I always tried to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, mainly because when he was still living here, he often tried to talk to me, saying that what had happened was my fault, and for a long time, that helped me to see that he was trying to manipulate me.

Still, lately the guilt hasn't left me alone, not just guilt, but anger at myself, I had hoped that after all this time I would have closure, but these episodes of guilt come and go from time to time, it makes me sick to feel this way, I don't think I have the right since I was never really abused to feel this bad, that happened when I was 14 and now I'm 21, it should be enough time to turn the page and sometimes it just seems like I can't and I'm just feelings sorry for myself like I was a child.

I feel guilty for making my mom suffer like this, for making my bothers grow up without a father figure, and I feel even more angered because I know what I said it's just shit, he is not a father figure, he was never a good husband, and still I feel like I ruined it for everyone.

I just feel so confused and lost, I KNOW that I shouldn't feel this way, despite of what he did to me, he was not a good person in general, he was manipulative, verbally aggressive towards my mom, he is really an awful person, and still I can't help but feel horrible for all of it, like it was my fault even though I know it's not, that's what frustrates me the most.

It still difficult to talk about this with anyone, nobody in my family knows it yet, just my brother and sis (because he told them, obviously saying that everything was just a misunderstanding and that I got scared), after a few years I finally told this to my two closest friends and very recently a few more of them knew because I started to cry about it when I was drunk.",Im feeling guilty for my father's actions,18nsvnz,1703181243.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nsvnz/im_feeling_guilty_for_my_fathers_actions/,

"I met my wife while she was in a relationship with someone else. I was instantly attracted to her, and she and I quickly became good friends. I met her then-boyfriend for the first time some weeks after meeting her, and my very first thought after being introduced to him was, ""Oh yeah. I can wait this out."" 

Throughout the course of that evening, he gave off the vibe that he was trying extremely hard to make sure I and everyone else he was meeting came away with the impression that he was just the coolest; that their relationship was solid. I knew better though. Not from anything specific that she told me, but from just how tired she looked anytime she talked about him. No matter what she said--good, bad or anything in between--she just looked exhausted every time he came up in conversation, and any time I saw them together.

In the months that followed I would see him occasionally, but I saw her almost every day because we worked together. We became very close, eventually confirming to each other that we were best friends. I had by that point been saying to myself for some time that I was in love with her.

I continued to bide my time. Over the winter, she found herself in a situation where she had no transportation to work. I offered her rides whenever she needed them. Her boyfriend had the time and the capability to take her to work, but didn't want to. So I got to instead. I would take her every chance I got. Even on my days off. Even when her shift started at 4am. This became the status quo for several months, and on these rides we became quite close. I was loving every second of it. Every moment with her was a gift, and still is almost a decade later.

She opened up to me about how terrible her relationship was. She told me about how he yelled at her, manipulated her, abused her verbally, emotionally, sometimes sexually. It was sometimes pretty raw. 

On one occasion a coworker of ours was having a shindig and their place, and invited several other coworkers and their partners for drinks and games. I asked her if she and her boyfriend were planning on attending. She said they were. I was, as ever, excited to see her despite the presence of her boyfriend. 

As it happened, however, he decided he didn't want to come. I think he expected her to stay home with him, but she boldly told him she was going anyway. When she showed up without him, I was over the moon. That night, she relaxed in a way I hadn't seen before. She was loose, confident and really, really funny. It was incredible to see her come alive like that. I had always known that version of her was there, and it was wonderful to see it come out among friends. 

We remained close to each other the whole night. When it came time to play a game (Cards Against Humanity, I think), I sat down on a big comfy chair. Designed for one person, but big enough for two if they were willing to cuddle. We were, and we did.

It was electric. I'll never forget the feeling when she sat down next to me, my arm around her. It was the first time in many years that I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. 

Over the next few months her relationship with her boyfriend really started to deteriorate. After work one day she asked me to just take her to my place. Her boyfriend wouldn't be home for a few more hours, and she didn't want to be in their shared space.

We cuddled up on my couch and watched a movie. Just enjoying each other's presence. Near the end of the movie she glanced at her phone and saw she had missed several texts and calls from her boyfriend. She asked me to pause the movie and she called him back.

I sat on the couch next to her while she spoke with him. He immediately started screaming at her for not being at home, and I was able to hear it all. Never in my life have I heard such vile things. I was absolutely taken aback. I'd never witnessed such abuse, and it was over the phone! I couldn't even imagine the hell she must have been living in. 

She told him she was coming home, and asked me to take her. I asked if she was sure. I was horrified at the thought of taking her to that environment, but she kept telling me that the blow-up that I had just witnessed was not even that bad.

Up to that point, we hadn't ever talked about her breaking up with him. On the drive to her place, the subject came up. She expressed fear that no one else would ever want to be with her. In response I said, ""I would date the shit out of you."" I also told her that no matter what, I would never, ever treat her like what I just witnessed.

Abusive relationships are very hard to leave, and she stayed with him for a few more months. In that time, she and I got closer and closer. Eventually the tension was too much for us, and our physical relationship which had been only frequent hugs and occasional cuddling to that point, became even more physical, and the sex was better than anything either of us had experienced. The first time was awkward, but the second time was glorious. It's only gotten better in the time since.

For 29 days she cheated on him with me. It was the most exciting, thrilling 4 weeks of my entire life. We fell deeply, madly in love with each other. He never confronted her specifically about her and I, but I suspect he knew in his gut he'd lost control over her.

He did not react well to the loss of control, and it took myself and several of our other close friends to convince her to leave after she told us that he had pushed her down the stairs. One day, while he was at work, a few of us took our lunch hour together, went to her place and cleaned it out of all her stuff as quickly as we could and got her out of there. I don't think she ever saw him again.

A week or two later, and we were both ready to be with one another. We made it official, and have been in a happy, healthy and thriving relationship ever since. We married one another almost 2 years ago, and have been together nearly 9. 

As for her ex, shortly after she left him, he briefly moved back to their hometown and began dating an old acquaintance of theirs much younger than he was. They moved to Alaska, where he employed the same abusive patterns he had used on my wife. Only this time he was much, much worse. He beat her pretty badly a few times and was arrested. My wife provided written testimony at his trial. He was convicted and sentenced to probation, and he cannot leave the state of Alaska for several more years. I hope he rots up there.

Up until I met him, I don't know that I can say that I'd ever truly hated anyone. It's such a strong word! But I HATE that man. What he did to my wife, and other women with the misfortune to have come across his path, is not something I'll ever forgive. No one else should, either.

My wife doesn't feel the same way as I do about how we got together. For me it was thrilling, and I look back on that time fondly. But for her it was traumatic, which I totally understand. It's been difficult for her to process. We don't talk about it much, and that's okay.

I'm so grateful for my wife. I love her so much, and I have and will continue to make sure that she feels like she made the right choice in being with me every single day. I know it wasn't an easy one for her to make.

**ETA:** Many of you have pointed out that I shouldn't take any pleasure in the time during which my wife was being abused. You're right. I definitely don't revel in the fact that she was abused, and it wasn't my intention to convey that I do. I didn't manipulate her. *She chose me.* And I chose her. I choose her every single day. That's what I revel in. 

I don't believe in the concept of ""soulmates,"" but that's what she and I are. I don't know how else to describe it. When we met it felt as if we'd always been connected in some way. This is something she and I talk about often. It would take more than several posts to describe the depth and strength of our connection.

I'm sorry so many of you have been cheated on. A lot of you surely didn't deserve it. Sounds like some of you did, though.

Extremely specialized.

I honestly don't know if anyone on this planet can do what I do half as good as myself.

Without giving out certain details... I am permanently on the outside looking in. You could say that I don't think of myself as human anymore. I really am not. I know that sounds weird. It is, in many ways, intentional. It has helped me accomplish a lot.

There is just one catch.

I just see humans performing needlessly complicated rituals that serve little to no purpose. You all cannot stop them because of \[Unpopular Opinion Post\]. I don't know I will post the unpopular opinion. It was about white lies, but it spread to more of a venting about everything.

See recently I have been forced to deal with people in a semi-professional context. They are sort of my boss, but it is a bit indeterminate at this time. What's the problem?

My specialization means I don't see \[Coworker Interaction\] but \[X+3Y+Z\^2\] and I think about it in terms of that. Not really a math equation. This is intended to be a 'throw away'. Just a good representation.

"I just got accepted to go to Japan to learn Japanese for three weeks at Akita Inaka School last month. I was so happy since I lost my job but Mom convinced me to do something big for myself to get myself from feeling sorry for myself. I booked the flight, insurance, and getting everything I need and as I try to prep for leaving, I find that my passport is not in the place I usually leave. I am 30F years old and I have only used my passport once to go to Austria; I looked through all of my things in my room because I do have a habit of misplacing things even though I know they are still in my room.

My brother (28) has been diagnosed with bipolar for about 6 or seven years now and it has become a huge problem. After multiple calls to the local police, multiple stays at hospitals, my mother putting him out and then bringing him back in, medications, one restraining order, and a couple of group homes, he has become one of the biggest burdens of my family in my opinion. The first big incident is when my mom told him she is not going to pay for his phone bill anymore because he never helps out around the house and all he does is eat and leave messes (he was about 22 or 23 at that time). He tore up the whole house to the point we are just now getting our house back together and the police were called, which started him getting in and out of jail. 

Fast forward to the past two months, and my mom and I know my brother has been sneaking into the house and stealing things since we had to move into a hotel for re-modeling and he is in a group home. He usually takes stuff from my mom but steals cash from me when Mom cannot give him cash, which is now totaling up to more than a thousand dollars throughout this 6 years. This time when we came back home, I noticed my cash was gone and my jewelry was gone. Now I find out my passport is gone; when I told my mom it had to be him, she told me to look again, so I did, but deep I knew it was him because I would never put an important document like that anywhere.  

I always tell him I am going to file a police report if he keeps stealing from us, but he is now stealing packages from people's porch. I can never bring myself to do it because he is still my brother; I don't want to say I love him anymore because he is a professional scammer who knows how to slick talk his way with my mom and the doctors, but he is still someone I spent my childhood with. I always think back to my first day of Kindergarten, when he thought he was going to school with me because we did everything together; I remember when we would bond over watching Saturday cartoons together.

I (25F) planned on wearing lingerie tonight when I'll see my boyfriend. It's such a major step for me, and I'm absolutely terrified. I have a complicated relationship with lingerie and sex, but I'm proud of myself for how far I've come.

As a teenager, I was sexually assaulted, repeatedly, by my grand-father, over a period of two years. I told my parents a month before my 15th birthday, they helped me file a complaint when I was ready to, at age 17, and he was condemned about a year and a half later. I was in therapy for 2 years, and it helped tremendously.

A year into my therapy, I realised I needed new bras, because the old ones were too small. Apparently, the trauma halted my puberty and I was ""stuck"" at a 32B from age 12 to 17. In a single year, I went from a 32B to a 32D. My first reaction, when I was told my new size, was to panic, because I was afraid that if my breasts were bigger, I would attract more male attention and would be assaulted again. But I still managed to get into the cabin and put on the damn bra, and it was nothing special, black and no lace at all, but for the first time in years, **I felt pretty and I wasn't terrified by that idea**. For the first time in years, I felt pretty and it felt good. I felt pretty, and my next thought wasn't : ""Make sure the boys don't find you too pretty, though.""

Since then, I've enjoyed buying some nice matching sets and lingerie. I like wearing it, I like knowing that I have a pretty bra on. But it's only fine if I do it for me, in secret, under my clothes, where no one can see it.

Because I'm still terrified when it comes to wearing lingerie for someone else, that I'm intimate with. After my grand father was confronted by my dad and admitted to the sexual assault, he came to apologize to me and gave me 50€. As if that was enough to cover the damage. As if he was paying me for my services. I felt like my own grand father was treating me like a prostitue, a body you can buy. I was so taken aback, being confronted with him and all, I accepted the money and said thank you, but I was disgusted. I'm still shaken when I think of it. And to this day, I'm afraid that if I wear lingerie, if I try to be sexy and inviting, I'll be treated like a body again, and only a body.

I don't necessarily mind it when that's the point of the relationship - I had a friend-with-benefits for about a year, and I didn't mind wearing lingerie with them. We were buddies, but clearly, we were there for the sex, not for the mind or the emotions. But if I'm with someone I love, the idea that I could be just a body feels horrendous. I want to be loved first, wanted second. I know I'm not super beautiful, I'm not the kind of woman who makes heads turn or whatnot, and I still want to feel pretty, but I want that to be an added bonus. Wearing lingerie with someone I love terrifies me, because it makes me feel like I'm putting my body first, wrapped in a nice package, for someone to use.

But I trust my boyfriend. I love him. He's been amazing, catches me off-guard at every turn with how great he is. He makes me realise what is actually a loving, repespecful, trusting relationship. I feel like I was only ""playing house"" before him. He's everything I could ever dream of, and more, so much more, and it brings tears to my eyes that I was lucky enough to meet him and to date him. I'm going to his place tonight, for a little dinner together. I'll be wearing lingerie. Not the most revealing one, not the sexiest one, but still, lingerie, and I'll be sexy, and I'll be scared, but I trust him. And I'm proud of me for doing it even though I'm scared, and I won't back out of this plan.

I don't know why I needed to say it, but I've been catching myself all day, getting cold feet about the idea, but I know I'll be fine, and maybe I need to write it to believe it fully. And it'll be a great dinner, and a great night, and I'll be happy and relieved afterwards, and I'll feel silly for even being scared.",Wearing lingerie terrifies me.,18nrnsx,1703178074.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nrnsx/wearing_lingerie_terrifies_me/,
"I’m not sure how to verbalize this so forgive me if it makes so sense. This post is just as the title says, I feel absolutely disgusted by my body and I am trying to understand what’s going on. 
For some context: I have never had a healthy relationship with sex or my body. I (25F) was molested when I was 4 by my baby sitter and then sexually assaulted when I was 18. Call it bad luck (I’m trying to make light of this) but in between those years and even after I have been inappropriately touched by both sexes and have since then had nightmares about being assaulted or assaulting others. I’ve attempted to work through that, I’ve gone to therapy, I meditate and I try to process my thoughts but what I am stumped on is the physical repulsion I feel when I touch my body sometimes or when someone touches me. 
I’ll explain. 
Sometimes when I shower and the water hits my shoulder, back or nipples; or I clean my piercings and the water touches it in a certain way, I get goosebumps, chills, feel nauseous and physically recoil. Then my mind feels fuzzy. It also happens when my partner touches me and I want to know what this is and why it happens. I want to fix it but I don’t know what to call it or why it happens. I would love to know if this happens to anyone, if they know how to fix it.",I Feel Disgusted by My Body,18nrfv8,1703177480.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nrfv8/i_feel_disgusted_by_my_body/,

"ive had muscle spasms since i was 8 or 9, first realizing i was needing to flex my knees/elbows over and over again or i would freak out. i could try to stop it, but my heart would be too fast to the point of passing out if i didn't. it slowly moved to forehead/eye twitching where i would need to scrunch my face over and over for a couple years or so. i rarely noticed myself doing it unless i was at the movie theatre for some reason, where i would notice myself scrunching my face throughout the entire movie. as i got older, the face twitching mixed with the knee/arm twitching and also added a new thumb twitch, where i would need to straighten both of my thumbs at the same time over and over. it's never been something i paid much attention to, because my body just automatically does it now to prevent my heart racing too fast (i also have a heart murmur which doesn't help).

fast forward to about 6 months ago i started smoking weed. everything was fine at first and i really needed the relaxation from work/my anxiety. a few weeks ago, i started having random bad nights while smoking where i would go extremely internal. it started making me more depressed and made it so i would sweat, can't swallow and sometimes can't breathe. this was only some nights so i continued to smoke since it never lasted very long. one night, me and my boyfriend were smoking outside and i told him about my nerves and how i thought it could be OCD by the way my brain makes me do it over and over. i told him about my twitching assuming he hadn't noticed, but he looked over at me and just said ""oh yeah you twitch and shake a lot."" at the time, it didn't bother me but last night i fully realized what he said. 

it hit me like a truck last night that he noticed my twitching and shaking and never mentioned it, because its something normal to him since i do it constantly. it fully made me realize how much i really do twitch and could feel every single nerve ending in my body. i felt completely trapped in my own body and felt like a prisoner since now i can't control it. i had the most intense panic attack in my life and i was on the verge of passing out. i couldn't breathe and my heart rate was around 140-160 for an hour or so. i genuinely never noticed how bad it got since it became normal to me. now its the next morning and once i've noticed it, i can't forget about it. it's pretty much all i can focus on and im just hoping i get through the next day without a panic attack.

i know weed affects everyone differently, but it was one of the worst experiences of my life and i don't think i can do it again for a very long time, if ever. i am 100% going to a doctor about this after realizing how intense it's became over the years.",never smoking again after realizing i have tourettes while i was high,18nqpvr,1703175536.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nqpvr/never_smoking_again_after_realizing_i_have/,

"So for context me and my gf are 17 and have been together for a little over a year. Our relationship is great and we have good communication skills and overall just a mature relationship. 

If I’m being honest I’m a pretty sensitive person and there will be more things that bother me than things that will bother my girlfriend. Every time I bring something up to her she validates my feelings and changes some of her actions and what not and takes my feelings into more consideration. It’s pretty often that I mention something that bothers me and it hasn’t been much of an issue.

Recently we had a conversation and she explained that she feels like she’s “losing herself” and doesn’t want to constantly change for my needs and whatnot. I heard her out and recognized and understood her feelings. Then she said that she thinks our relationship needs a little distance as in (not texting as often since we do very consistently, not calling as often, not hanging out very much during the week.) she thinks this will rebuild our relationship with eachother and help us in the future. 

Naturally im a very attached person and love her being attached and love myself being attached to her too and with these new terms of distance that I agreed to it’s been hard on me mentally. For example: I would love to see her often throughout the week but now only seeing her 1 day on the weekend is hard on me.

Anyways, I’m just stuck on what to do because this affects me so much. Now I understand that she is her own person and is open to her own feelings but this whole “distance” thing really affects me, and before you say to break up and move on… I don’t want to do that.

"I’ve struggled with anxiety for years, but the past few months, it’s been different.  I’ve had absolutely no motivation to do anything other than go to work, come home, play a game, and repeat.  I rarely talk to my friends or family, I don’t feel motivated to do my artistic hobbies, and I haven’t left the house that often.  Heck, I’ve even felt unmotivated to buy Christmas presents for the family and had to force myself to do so, yet they’re still unwrapped.  For a while, I thought it was just anxiety from all the news or the holidays and kept telling myself “once the new year starts, it’ll all be better and you can do all that stuff later.”

But I absolutely HATE the feeling.  It’s freaking CHRISTMAS and instead of feeling happy and excited for what’s to come, I feel anxious, tense, and like I don’t care.  I just want to tell these feelings to take a hike, but they’re like a cloud always over my head no matter how hard I try.  Sometimes it feels like I’m in a cage and have no motivation to get out.  It’s caused harm, like the fact that I keep delaying me doing things despite their deadlines being days away.

For the last year, I've been working on the companies proprietary project which has been quoted as ""the most important project at the company"" many times in monthly company meetings.

Last week, they sent out bonus letters and...it was disappointing. My company sends out bonuses during December only and last year was the first year the company gave out bonuses because it was the first time the company actually profited. I've known for awhile that the company has had a bit of a rough financial year. We had a couple clients that had to back out of contracts and the company didn't do great financially this year.

However...some of my coworkers and I were discussing the bonuses. We are comfortable sharing our salary and financial information with each other. I am salary and can't really complain about my yearly income. We were discussing our bonus payouts where I came to find out my bonus payout was **20%** of the others....even those that started working around the same time as me received much more than I did.

She has been on pain medication, but when I got home from work, she could hardly stand up and kept falling. Spinning in a circle and her head was titled to the left. She fell hard once, and the vet warned us to be really careful with her because one wrong move could make her paralyzed.

"26m in Canada. I have autism and OCD, and after a really tough year of depression and existential crises, my parents understandably want me to be more open and honest about my feelings. For too long I've bottled up my feelings because I figured that life isn't meant to be enjoyed, and that it would have been selfish for me to want happiness in life when I should focus on being a valuable employee above all else. I struggle with working 40 hours per week and I know that if I haven't gotten used to it by the time my parents are both gone, I'll finally be able to kill myself (I haven't said this to my parents because I know my mom would be so upset to hear it). I'm back in therapy now and working on improving my mindset. I have virtually no self-esteem and I feel immense levels of guilt and shame for being autistic.

But when I tell my mom about how I'm feeling, it upsets her so much that it makes her use a tone of voice with me that I find terrifying. I have since I was a little kid and I've just never grown out of it. I have a sensory reaction to people yelling at me and I can't prevent myself from crying in that situation, but when it's my mom's voice, it's the most crushing thing to hear and it gives me such a strong reaction that I can't even put into words.

When she gets upset/frustrated with me she uses a stern tone of voice that immediately sends me into fight/flight/freeze, and I feel like I'm a little kid who's in trouble. I immediately start apologizing for upsetting her so much, but this makes her even more upset and sounding even more mad, so she raises her voice more, and my sensory reaction becomes worse. This leads her to leave the room in frustration and refuse to talk to me for a little while.

For my whole life, I've essentially done anything to avoid hearing this tone of voice, even if it meant lying about my mental health or other things. My mom is understandably going to be upset that her son is so mentally ill. I can't control how she reacts, so it's my responsibility to correctly react when she uses that tone of voice with me.

I know I need to accept that if I'm going to be honest about my poor mental health, then it's going to upset my mom because she wants me to be more mentally healthy. I can't imagine how much it must hurt to see your own child going through this. I have to be figure out how to stop my sensory reaction from happening when my mom speaks to me like this; immediately panicking and apologizing makes everything worse. If I can keep my cool and not revert back to a kid being punished, then I'll be better at communicating my feelings in general.

Thank you for reading. This is all so hard for me. I upset my mom in this manner last night even though things were going well before that. Now she isn't talking to me and I'm so afraid of saying the wrong thing to make her more upset.

"(27M) I did it the other night. I was laying in bed next to my gf (24f) looking at Reddit porn when an old friend who lives across the country messaged me. It started with us catching up. How are you doing, how’s your relationship, and what are u up to. She was telling me how her relationship ended a week or two ago, how they never progressed since they started yada yada. Then she tells me she was hoping I was single again because she was gonna send the itinerary. I said sarcastically “yeah lol I’m just gonna leave my girl for a few days like haha bye babe”, and then that’s when she really got into it. Telling me how pretty my dick was and how she missed it and it was the best sex of her life and nothing could compare, and literally just a whole bunch of other shit. I shut it down and told her to chill out. I went into the other room because I was becoming very uncomfortable with what just happened and my gf is sleeping next to me. I tried to switch the convo up to asking her about work, but she kept pressing me about this sexual shit. I kept entertaining it by replying to some of the stuff that she was saying, and I felt crazy like wtf is happening but still kept letting it continue.

I actually stopped replying for 30 mins after all of this and deleted a bunch of the texts where she was talking crazy,  but I was still horny and thinking about porn and sex so I started masturbating and thinking about some of what she said. I replied again and wanted to see what else she had to say. She wanted to see my dick now. I pulled up an old photo from 2 yrs ago (don’t ask why I still have it I used to send them to my gf all the time). That’s when it really set in. The worst feeling I have ever felt. I tried to unsend the photo a couple minutes later and when the option went away I panicked so hard. I rushed out another text saying “wow I have to block u now I feel terrible and so guilty now, I just cheated wtf” I hadn’t even came so it wasn’t post nut clarity. I just wow I was so sick to my stomach I couldn’t do anything but sit here and think of how shitty I was, and how I broke my gfs trust for no reason literally none other than I was already gonna masturbate and this girl basically wrote me porn.

 I haven’t talked to this girl who I sexted since my relationship started. YEARSSS….For this exact reason that she knows how to talk freaky and get a response. Every single person I’ve talked to said I shouldn’t say anything to my gf and it will break her heart and ruin everything. I want to tell her so bad. I feel so guilty and horrible about it. I never expected this shit to happen like this. I never considered cheating once in our relationship. How this happened is really crazy to me. I have been sick for the past couple days just constantly thinking about it. Is it selfish for me to want to tell her because of how it’s tearing me up inside? Then it goes from me being relieved because I told her to her feeling like shit because I told her. 

The whole conversation lasted no longer than 40-50 mins and it wasn’t like back and forth.


 Yea idk what to do. I need help.

"For context: I am the eldest daughter in an asian family so if you have seen memes about us bearing the responsibility for the whole family, then that’s true most of the time.

I’m already 27, my husband and I both have stable job, and I am at that point in my life where I can see myself having kids in a year or two (I originally wanted it to be after 30s but then I remembered that my mom almost died giving birth to my youngest sister when she’s about 30 something and triggered a pre-eclampsia and we were told / was told by my healthcare provider that genetically we are more prone to having complications when we give birth around that age). 

So I asked my sisters jokingly if would it be okay for they’re okay with having a baby as a Christmas present this year. 

Before anything, my sisters are wonderful people. They are truly the best. But what kind of made me sad was one of my sister’s response telling me that I’m not thinking straight and that there are still a lot of things to do. My youngest sister is still in school and I’m the sole provider of the family which means I am responsible for paying her tuition, the bills at home, groceries, and other stuff. My parents have separated too so I’m also sending allowance to my mom every now and then while I provide at home. 

One reason before why I was a bit hesitant to marry my husband was because of this. I feel like instead of being an asset, I am more of a liability and I think it’s unfair for him to take on some of my responsibilities because it’s supposed to be mine. I never asked money from him though although he offered a lot of times because I feel ashamed of myself. 

I just feel like if I was born in a different family with different dynamics, maybe this wouldn’t be a problem. Sometimes I feel completely helpless and sad of my situation, telling myself that I should have not married my husband yet because I am not yet done with my responsibilities at home.

I’m not really looking for advice. I just want to vent about it because I don’t want to tell my husband about this and make him worry.

He told me to lay down which i did and he began to feel my Belly.
Around the Stomach region he found the spot that hurt(the longer he used some strenght on it), then he said ""its pulsating"".

At first i didnt know what to think about it, ""what could pulsate?"" Im asking myself.

Then he said its defently something with my Bloodvessels, it may be an aneursym.

I know that it isnt sure yet as i need to do some more examinations but its something that could lead to my death.

"my mom and dad were never married so we never lived in the same house. i was actually raised by my grandmother basically my entire life. my dad wasn’t bad but he really wasn’t there either, same with my mom. 

years go by and my dad finds my stepmom, she’s really great and i love her and she has a daughter nearly a decade younger than me (i’m 20) i’ve been around them since i was about 13 and that’s when my dad started to be more dad like. it was still rocky as i felt i didn’t know him. but there would be times where he’d say we’d do something then we don’t and it hurt. when i got to high school, i moved in with them. things were ok but i still would feel like i didn’t belong. 

through highschool, they would do things as the three of them and often ppl would ask me how that made me feel as they would post pictures of the three of them. i was included sometimes. my mom died at the beginning of my sophomore year and things just got worse. 

times passes and i’ve now moved out, but what’s been getting to me is that my stepsister calls my dad “daddy” and he treats her like a daughter which ofc i expected but i often feel like he does wayyyyyy more for her than he’s ever done for me. she has her dad in her life and his wife. i remember my college move in day i had to be there by 9am and instead of making sure everything was okay, they took her to school, pushing me to rush everything. we live like and hour away and it was raining so we needed to be gone. 

even with me moved out, they’ll ask me to come with them to do something bc they miss me and then turn around and post a picture of them three from the same day. i sacrificed my own sleep to be with them. i work overnights and will try to at least have some time with them when i can and it just hurts to never feel truly included.",jealous of the relationship my dad has with my little stepsister,18notgs,1703170417.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18notgs/jealous_of_the_relationship_my_dad_has_with_my/,

"I (27M) live in a country in Central Europe and have felt that a lot of, if not most, of gender issues are highly exaggerated issues of the first world countries that do not know what a true suffering and oppression looks like. Male privilege is one of them where I always had an approach to everyone based on how intelligent and/or polite they were, not if they were men or women, white or black... And I kinda assume that is the norm that most of the people have.

But recently I started working in a company where I am slightly below management level / slightly above rest of my team. Not so much as to be their boss just something as a person responsible for my team and calling shots when none of the bosses were here at the moment when decision is needed.

There is another female coworker (28F) that is on the same position as me, just for the different shift and prior to me, my position was held by another female coworker. As I started at my position in the first few weeks I decided not to make waves as I was new to this but I then decided to ask for some changes that my coworkers were complaining about. And just as that in a week I made one totally useless process in our work disappear and remade another that was bothering my coworkers, including my female counterpart on different shift.

I felt pretty good about it, until I talked about it with leader of the opposite shift and she told me that she was trying to make these changes for 6 months and was always dismissed and that ""Sometimes stuff needs to be explained by a guy with a d*ck."" I tried to explain that it was most likely because I came from the point of constructive criticism and try to explain everything to our manager (26F), but she told me that it was her approach as well.

I am here 3 months and I have made another change in processes and am negotiating another all making our jobs easier and smoother. I have noticed that my words are taken much more seriously by some of my colleagues than the words of my shift leader coworker and sometimes even than my manager. It was said by a coworker (49F) that it is due to my calm personality and inteligence but there is something in me and another colleague I talked with (24F) asking whether it is not because of me just being a man.

What is somewhat scary to me is that... I don't feel bad thinking about it at the slightest. Not sure whether I am looking for insight whether you guys think it is my approach to issues or me being a man, or on insight on my lack of negative emotions towards this issues or anything at all. I mostly just wanted to vent this out.

"I decided to stop going to church and affiliating myself with it. I come from a religious home, my father is a pastor and most of my family is highly religious. However, their actions have shown me that people who go to church are just as bad as the ones not in it. It’s very sad to see how  every time I go to a church, the message is always about judging and condemning others for their actions. When Jesus himself, asked people to love each other and to not spread hate towards each other. When I go there, it’s always the same Old Testament statements about how God despises homosexuals and anybody who doesn’t live in a God like manner. But in my heart I cannot condemn people for what they do because it’s not my problem. I should live my life focusing on what I do, why do they care so much about others when we should only focus on ourselves? 

I got tired of the hate messages, the hypocrisy, and the constant harassment towards people who aren’t in church. It’s a really sad thing to give up on church because I was raised all my life there. But I have not had a single good experience in any church. No child at the age of 8 should cry themselves to sleep because they sinned and are now going to hell. This was my everyday life for years, because I would sin and then have to keep apologizing over and over again. I got baptized but I still felt that I didn’t want to continue worrying about life after death. 

I like to believe there’s more to life than just one religion. I hope that whatever happens to me when I die, won’t be an abyss of fire.

"Basically I share shoes with my dad. Recently my parents went away and I was wearing these shoes. I usually wear sheos just by shoving my foot in them then adjust them. When I had to take them off I saw wrapper of an opened condom, I was stunned. 

Anyways very suspicious my parents did go somewhere else before but it makes no sense at all to do this, that rules only one possibility.

My dad did cheat on my mother confirmed in 2020, there was quite a big fight after my mum checked his phone, lasting 2 months of not talking to each other. It was only Infront of my elder sister he admitted and everything was better and he did apologise.

Anyways we're here now. I have no idea who to tell, my mum is likely on stage 1 cancer and is trying her best to stay in health awaiting treatment, my dad and brother both have a shop in business and always stay in contact. Back in 2020 my brother and mum hardly talked to him during those months. My sister is currently pregnant, although I think it's best to tell her in secret.

I can't reveal any of this in the open, otherwise my sister in law finds out and it's best to keep it private (we stay in one house). I did have an argument with my dad recently so not in the best of terms of that either. 

I could not tell anyone and that's deffo the most easiest thing, I could easily forget this (I've just given up on changing people) and just let God take care of it (we believe in strict punishment in the after life and in karma)

I haven't chucked the wrapping, it's still in the shoe under my foot as we speak. With my brother helping with shop right now, even taking this off and putting in the bin will risk conversation.

"I never know what to feel anymore. I never know what to think, what to say, and even as I'm writing this it just feels fake. Fabricated. The ramblings of a sad man about the life he lived, the unforgiving consequences of his own self-depreciating actions.

I had big dreams. I was an achiever. I got a scholarship that would help my family and myself tremendously, and I let it squander away. I was on my third year to become an engineer. I was a top performing student. I have no vices, and I am clean. I had friends that were proud of me and me proud of them. I was happy, but somehow by the end of this year I've become an outcast.

I quit school. I don't talk to my best friends anymore. I stay off social media so I don't see people I know living it up or interacting with me. I stay here in the veil of anonymity where no one knows me. As much as I want to put into word what is wrong with me, there's no easy way for me to start.

I don't even talk to my family anymore. I just sit here and play my games, eat, then sleep. The last time they saw me was when my grandmother died, and there I could just feel their stares, their disappointment. I never wanted to run as far away as possible from anything else in my life. I just wanted to get out there and return to my room and lock out all interaction from other people. They don't know what's wrong with me, because I don't talk to them. They just let me be because they're afraid of what might happen if they push me.

I tried to take my life 6 years ago. It hurt, and I failed, and I vowed to never let myself feel anything close to that pain again. For a minute there everything was fine. I kept my vow, but the will to die reared its ugly head. I don't want to kill myself, but man would it solve everything quick and clean. 

So now I just stay silent. Locked out from everything. Apart from interacting with random people off the internet, I have no more personal relationships with anyone. When I have, like, 5 messages with   
someone, I just begin to panic and hyperventilate. I'm only 21 years old. I don't know how I let myself become like this. I have no money to my name, I'm literally just munching on the food my family bring to the table. I contribute nothing of sort to society.

I'm a bad person. I don't know about the world, but my family would be a hell of a lot better if I wasn't here. I feel sorry for them, because one moment they were all so proud of me, but then I've become this deadbeat person with nothing to offer. I don't want to hurt myself. I just want to exist somewhere, to be something else away from here, to be someone else entirely, if that was remotely possible. If I could just have the chance to restart, I would probably do things a little better. If I had a save point 6 years ago, maybe things would be different.

This is the first time in six months I've even attempted to face myself. After this, I would just revert to doing the same stuff again. But then, after that, where do I go? If every attempt to fix myself ends up being a failure again and again and again, why would I even try?

But i've never been understood. I make people understand and forgive them endlessly, just for them to easily and without being asked do things for someone else.

I have been dating my partner for four years. We moved in within the last year together. We’re both nonbinary and we were both originally unsure of transitioning. My partner recently told me that they want to get bottom surgery. I said I would be here to support them. They asked if I would support them as their partner. I felt trapped. I love my partner so much, but I don’t want to be with someone who has male genitalia. It makes me uncomfortable (I didn’t say any of this to them). I said I wasn’t sure what would happen, but I promised to be there. They said they wouldn’t get the surgery if I wouldn’t be with them. They would stay dysphoric if it meant we would be together. That is the last thing I want. I tried explaining they should live their life, without worrying about us. That I wanted them to be happy. They got upset and wouldn’t calm down until I reassured them I would be here for them. I tried to be vague. It’s been weighing on me since we talked about it. I broke down the other day in the car thinking about breaking up with them. 

If I could, I would stay with them. But I don’t want to think they’re disgusting for having a penis. It’s just… not what I find attractive. I’m planning on talking about it more with them, but I have no idea how to handle it. I’m also worried about our lease and if we break up, what would happen. We can’t pay for our place without the other. Should I just wait the six months until our lease is almost up? And what should I say to them? Anything I think of just makes me imagine them crying and breaking down. I’ve tired convincing myself that maybe I’m bisexual, but I know I’m not. I’m so tired of carrying this burden.

He stopped complimenting me, insulted my family, and demeaned my eating habits. He's ditched me for friends, and I had to beg him to spend my birthday with me. He told me he wants to be friends and that he still cares about me, yet he's treating me so coldly, ignoring me, and lying to me. He's left me alone in a city I moved to for him; he hasn't let me meet my roommates; he hasn't let me go out and make friends. I admit that I've gotten upset with him at times about this and 'snapped' because he refused to talk to me, but he's claiming that I'm shouting and the way I talked to him was wrong (even though I have never shouted at him). I, hand on heart, have never insulted him or shouted at him; we have had small arguments nearly every day because he said something that upset me, but I explained that all I need is a sorry to move on. He has never had a problem with me until I started defending myself after three months of keeping quiet. He couldn't give that sorry to me, so now I'm being criticized for standing up for myself and asking us to talk about why I'm upset and why we're arguing. All I have ever done is support him, while he has let me go to bed anxious and having panic attacks. This also worries me because I'm one of the only people he has here for support, although I do feel used. I explained to him that I only got so frequently upset because he wouldn't talk to me, but he's still blaming me for this relationship failing.

"Hi everyone, I'm 18 years old, this is my final high school year and in my country we have Baccalaureate ""Examen National du Baccalaureate "" ( it's a national test) and I need to get a minimum of 16 out of 20 to get accepted in good universities (our grading system is a 20-point grading scale)   
Thus, I've been struggling with my mental health since I was 16years old let's say. I went to psychiatrist today, and she didn't help at all because she didn't understand my issue (maybe i didn't know how to express my feelings because it's the first time opening up to a person) i have another session next month and i hope i can try to explain to her more abt my issues and life.  
  
 Anyway, i'm here today seeking help because i need to study cuz time is running out and i'm completely lost. I have had good marks since my first year in high school (lower grade i got was 17/20) until third year, my marks started going down (got 15/20) and this year, in my first term, i don't even think that i can reach 13/20. But since second year, i feel really empty inside i have no purpose in life i'm living but i'm not living (i'm physically present but mentally absent) i have a goal and i want to achieve it, but this goal progressively started to faint as i get older and start to realize that it's hard to reach it (i want to be a software engineer). Adding to that, I have never been happy with my self or what i did, i always blame myself for everything, i'm too hard on myself but i can't help it. Moreover, when i look at myself i can't find something that makes me unique or interesting basically i'm stupid, ugly and disgusting maybe the only good thing is my personality since i have great mindset and kindhearted as my friends say (i don't claim that). Also, i'm that therapist friend that everyone feels safe talking to and expressing their feelings which made me feel exhausted and numb because it's hard for me to not only handle my problems but also listen to my friend's problems and try to help them. Sadly, i have never tried to reach out to someone because when i compare my problems with others i feel like it's not worth to be sad about so i accept the fact that no one will listen to me and ignore that problem and live with it holding that sad feelings inside me and try to move on but i never did (it's clearly not a good solution to get over my problems) . Besides, when i'm studying i don't feel like i accomplish something even if i solve a quite hard exercise i feel like i did nothing special and everyone will get it easily.   
So please if u have an idea or a solution on how can i ignore my feelings again and start studying like i was in my first year of high school tell me

"Around this time last year, my now ex wife an I were visiting family for the holidays and we toasted the new year with a group of friends and a very expensive bottle of champagne. We were planning a trip to Mexico and just got a big bonus. Everything seemed great! We had some cracks in our marriage but nothing I didn't think couldn't be worked out.

This year on New Years? I'll likely be working... as in sex work. Catering mostly to middle aged men like myself. It feels surreal to even type that out. The money REALLY helps! Most of the time it's not that bad and I am hoping to find steady regulars because it's too chaotic and stressful with random men. Absolutely NOBODY knows, nor will they find out if I can help it! Hence the throwaway account. I take many other precautions as well.

So, how did it happen? It's about finances. We dipped into retirement to help our daughter pay for college because time slipped away. It wasn't because of that though. It was because I had an aggressive plan to get us back on track and cut expenses but my wife wanted to spend.. like the expensive trip to Mexico she was planning. She's addicted to social media and keeping up appearances. Then I lost my job in this shit economy and being an older white male in tech is like the kiss of death in job interviews! I took a much lower paying position that a contact in LinkedIn offered and had a 2 year plan to learn a new skill that might even pay more than I was making before. That was final straw for her. She DEMANDED that I find a job like the one I just lost and was maxxing out credit cards to pay for a lifestyle we could no longer afford. It just became unsustainable. She mentioned divorce first and I sadly realized that if we stayed together, we would retire in poverty unless she was willing to change and it did not appear she was.

The divorce killed me, financially, emotionally, the stress of bills piling up and not being able to find a side gig. My job had a position open up that required more travel and I took it. I tried dating again also when I was in new cities and was just lost! It's a new world out there and I was never really that good at impressing women when I was younger. The few dates I had felt like job interviews again and I just stopped.

I was always aware of being bisexually curious. It never was a driving urge but it was always there. I tried hooking up with guys on things like Grindr and realized that I kinda liked it. I didn't like meeting random men though and flirted with the idea of a male escort although I couldn't really afford it. Then I got the crazy idea that I could be the male escort and not only scratch this itch but get paid!

I have E.D. and am generally more of shy person so I gravitated to being a bottom with guys. I like it actually. I like letting someone else perform and I found I am pretty good in that role. I had some nice pictures taken that revealed my appearance but not my identity. The photographer was very creative!

I know exactly who my clientele is and how to market to them. Middle aged guys on business trips who want relief with no drama or strings. Because of my job, I was already in the same hotels and the same areas where they congregate. That is not the only type I will see but they are my bread and butter. I also market myself to women who want to try pegging and that has actually worked out but it's from word of mouth, they really don't seek men out on male escort sites.

Positives? Starting to make a dent in bills and even saving some. Amazing what that does for lowering stress! Was able to buy daughter a nice gift for Christmas that she will not be expecting! Feel like i am in more control of my future. I actually like sex in this way and meeting new and different guys and the occasional women is exciting. I'm actually learning what makes men attractive and what doesn't and it really is not what I thought!

Negatives? Random guys can be scary! It's not always businessmen and men in general are just way stronger and way more capable of being aggressive in sex than women. It's often without warning and even a regular who seemed safe can surprise you. Most of these guys are cheating on wives and Gfs and I really wish I could limit myself to guys who were not. Since I market myself as a bottom, many guys automatically think that my boundaries don't matter or that I WANT to be degraded and verbally abused (I do not). I try to make that clear upfront and that doesn't seem to help.

"Am I being unreasonable?

The first part is a lot of background and then also excuse the rambling at the end as I got a lot of emotions out by typing this.

I (26F) have a friend that I made almost a year ago. She (28F) is quite nice and has always been someone I considered to be genuine.

I have a fairly well paying job (in comparison to her and her husband) and sometimes when we go for coffee I've paid for and her one child (5F), the other is not yet able to partake in anything (10m M).

But she has insisted before that she'd like to treat me and has bought once or twice or we have both just paid for ourselves. I've also helped her with her volunteer work as she sometimes has people who quit at the last minute or do not show up, so I feel I've been a constant and reliable friend. I've also driven her around a few times and not asked for fuel money.

When I was sick she bought me a small 'hope you getter better soon' hamper.

I bought her daughter a semi-expensive toy for her birthday. Nothing too extravagant but the base toy of a whole series as I could get it on sale at a store near my work which is in the city compared to our smaller town that doesn't really have a big toy store. I made sure to stay well in their boundaries and had her and her husband's preapproval as I didn't want to create expectations or make them feel uncomfortable and the message from them was that it was super thoughtful and that it would make their child very happy and that they could then tell others to buy some of the add-ons if they wanted to.

For her birthday I got her a treatment at a local spa as I felt she deserved an hour or two of being pampered. I made sure that she did not see the price of the gift as I did not want to make her uncomfortable and I also got it at a better deal due to knowing the manager of the place.

Additional background, at my job we work on a few projects simultaneously and I knew my November month was going to be hell and that in order to avoid burn out like I experienced the year before I needed to make time for rest and that I'd also need to say no to social interactions as it just drained me further (introvert over here). I communicated this upfront to her as I know she is one of those people who will speak to you daily and thinks something is wrong if you don't respond. 

She didn't fully get it and kept asking me to meet up and if I said sorry I can't as I am busy with work she'd respond with something along the lines of, 'if Wednesday doesn't work, how about Thursday?' which showed me she either wasn't getting it or didn't want to get it.

But the craziness of work happened and I couldn't respond daily anymore and expect for work calls I was hardly using my phone. I would respond every 2nd or 3rd day when I got a chance.

My birthday was in the beginning of December and she was pestering me about doing something to celebrate it in the last week of November and I again told her that November is not going to happen but that just after my birthday all my work needs to be submitted and I will be home free. She tried to push for more but I stood firm as I honestly had no room to push my schedule in any which way especially as it would result in one of my team members having to pick up my slack which is not only unfair but also not how we treat each other outside of emergencies.

It is then decided that I should let her know when I am available as it was my schedule out of all of us (her, her husband, and two of our friends) that was the most strict at the moment. No problem, I'm finally free of my work commitments for now and I reach out and basically organise my own birthday celebration but I don't mind. We decide on bowling and what day we'd meet up.

The day comes and I meet her and her husband there but our other two friends are running late but no biggy. Her and I go to pay so long and when prompted to pay she is no longer next to me and I see she is asking her husband something (afterwards I found out it was for his card as she couldn't find hers), but the cashier had already processed the whole thing and I felt slightly put on the spot and paid for everyone but didn't think too much about it as they'd pay me back. As I finish putting my purse away, she has come back and says let me just pay quick but I stopped her and said, 'I already did because when I turned around you were gone and the lady kinda made me feel awkward.', she peoceeded with a 'oh thanks, how much was it?' and I gave her a per person amount as I figured she'd transfer the money to me as we've done before. For context in my country the price of one person to play bowling and is also the price of a fairly decent meal (a good hamburger, fries and a drink with tip).

Anyway, the other friends show up and as  I paid for them already they pay for my drinks. We proceed to have a fun night and as we are discussing dinner options (also her idea), she says 'oh we won't be joining for dinner' and her and her husband proceed to thank me for inviting them and organising a fun night and leave before I could process much else.

There was no mention of my birthday from them, which was the original purpose of the get together and I realised at the end there wasn't even a small token or gift like a chocolate with a quick 'Happy Birthday'. And they never paid me back.

I've seen her go out of her way for people and get them small gifts for even simple occasions. Additionally, we've even bonded over the fact that both of our main love languages is gift giving.

I don't need anything extravagant but I'd like some sort of acknowledgement. 

I don't know if this is her way of punishing me because I wasn't available for a whole month and that I basically had low contact. I do think she has some abandonment issues based on brief information she has shared of her childhood but she never goes into much detail.

But am I being unreasonable in feeling a little hurt that she couldn't even make a small acknowledgement or gesture?

I know I can't bring this up with her by saying 'you hurt me when you did not acknowledge my birthday especially after you made such a big deal that it had to be celebrated', as she is a very emotional person and will make this a bigger thing than what it needs to be. She'll also tell others as she isn't the best at keeping things to herself especially when her emotions are involved. Our wider group would be effected as well and I don't like being the cause of drama.

Her attitude since has been a bit standoffish but I could even be projecting here to be honest. But I've also not been really included in some of the group events which also hurts. 

I don't think I need any validation on this post as I think I feel what I feel and I'm just trying to handle the situation. I also think she has some things she needs to deal with that I can't do for her and due to the type of person she is I can't raise with her as it could possibly become a victim game.

I am however trying to emotional sort myself out for the sake of our friend group as I don't want things to be awkward. 

I have spoken to my therapist briefly as I only mentioned it near the end of our session, and I obviously gave my biased view of events, but my therapist says it sounds like someone who is still emotionally immature in some ways.

It kind of made me feel that at least it isn't my fault but it doesn't take the hurt away.

I know I'll recover in time, by nature I am not someone who can hold something against someone for very long but I just need to put my own boundaries in place and stop myself from doing too much again.",I think my friend is mad at me for not being available,18nn26a,1703165380.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nn26a/i_think_my_friend_is_mad_at_me_for_not_being/,

We've had a few fights about this, and recently, when I brought up breaking up, she claimed she wants to surprise me. However, I suspect it might be a lie.

"My family never really gave much importance to my anger. I learned soon that my only option was sulking, and that I wouldn't get much with tantrums, and eventually, I learnt that being angry is egoistical and I should just let go.
Always let go.
Always keep it in.
And so it was, with bullies and mean friends, always protecting myself with a shield of irony. And when they broke through, I cried. Helpless, because I never learned how to speak up. Apathy was a way of protecting my self, too.

Well, now I'm 22 and past those coping mechanisms. People I know have told me that I'm too passive, and that sometimes I'm quite manipulative, playing both with positive emotions and with guilt to get what I want. So I'm trying to learn to speak up. 

But what do you do, when it doesn't work? I tried complaining to my mother and brother about something trivial that bothered me. They started laughing at me, making fun of the triviality of my annoyance. That's how it's always been in my family. My grandfather did it to my mother, my mother does it to me now. Despite me being the one who always consoled her, when her anger was burning up inside, making her want to cut all ties, to just run away and destroy everything. But she's doing it to me now. And I felt it. It's been a good ten minutes, but it's still here. A pressing rage in my chest, filling my eyes with tears as I type, and maybe I'll start to scream,and then I'm overreacting, and they're laughing even more, and I feel stupid and angrier, and angrier, and angrier...
And I feel violent, and of course I don't want to be violent, and I run away and lock myself in my room. Feeling like an angsty teenager, feeling ridiculous. But I never took up the space to be angsty. Always felt too guilty to bend any of their rules, never wanting to hurt them - and yet, somehow, sometimes, very much wanting to hurt them. Or myself.

I just can't figure out how to deal with this emotion. It's too strong, it scares me, it makes me feel sick and honestly genuinely hate myself. I know anger, theoretically. I know what has been said about anger, from Aristotle to Nussbaum, but what should I do with that when the ones who made you angry won't listen? When, even as you are maturely trying to explain your frustration, they keep diminishing you? What should I do when it inevitably grows bigger, with no outlet for me to be actually, just for once, listened to? 

They just want me to be this small thing. It's never enough. They need to keep me smaller, so they can keep doing everything they want undisturbed. And they are so sure they can, because they always won. 

I just want to scream. I just want to do something they won't be able to laugh at. I won't, so don't worry. That's just how I'm ""feeling"".","I was never given space to process anger, I never learned how to",18nmcrk,1703163154.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nmcrk/i_was_never_given_space_to_process_anger_i_never/,
"Me (25F) and him (21M) have been dating for two years. We met when I was an exchange student on his country and we were together physically for a year before I had to move back home and we’ve been doing long distance since then. He still has one year of college left and I’ll be graduating in the next few months. I can’t go work in his country because of visa issues, at least inmediately. He has no idea what he’s going to do with his life when he graduated (I don’t either). We see each other every 3/4 months, and he is coming to see me next week.

This past year we’ve had some issues.

-Found on his phone screenshots and pictures of girls with gym bodies (not any girls he knows personally). I confronted him and told him that since my body doesn’t look like the body those girls have, by fapping to it he is telling his brain that’s what he likes. Same with porn. He said he would try to watch it less but a few months later I still saw some girls on his instagram explore page. 

-There was a girl on his group friend that was into him, asking him to go study alone together and getting touchy with him. I am aware he was never interested in her, but he didn’t really say anything to her, although he tried to keep a bit of a distance between them because it was making him feel uncomfortable.

-Sometimes he has mentioned the future and he always uses the first person (“maybe I could live here”, instead of “maybe we could live here”)

-We facetime pretty much every night and a lot of times he is just scrolling on reddit while talking to me. He’s been getting better at this tho.

-Last year he had a breakdown where he told me he wasnt sure of being with me because he was soending too much time thinking about me and stressing about this relationship. We talked it out and continued being together but since then kinda everytime his mood shifts or he is kinda distant i have a lot of anxiety thinking he wants to dump me.

-He has ADHD, depression and anxiety. I also have my own trauma that I’m dealing with, but he kinda uses it as an excuse to sometimes not pay attention to me. I joined a music band recently and we have been doing some concerts. He keeps forgetting to ask me about how they went because he just doesnt remember. I told him to set alarms but he tells me I am being condescending. He also forgot our two year anniversary after I told him how important those dates were for me.

-Kinda continuing with that, a lot of times he is not busy and he justs spends time scrolling on his phone instead of calling me or being with me. This past summer we worked together on his country (I basically went there to be with him as much time as possible) and he kept going to the break room to be on his phone during his time off instead of looking for me or texting me.

-I am a person that loves giving little gifts, letters, send love memes… I have been basically begging him to send me a love letter for two years now. He keeps forgetting (he literally has a post office on campus). Same with flowes. He’s sent me flowers like three times (one of them I literally asked him to do it) while I’ve sent him stuff, ordered him uber eats, etc. He’s gotten food for me like once or twice.

Of course there have been good moments and we have made lots of memories together. I know he loves me a lot and I do love him too but with everything I feel that right now its not our moment to be together. He is coming next week and staying with me for two weeks and I dont even know if its worth it to talk about it. I feel that he needs me to pull away from him for him to realize that he wants to be with me. 
I acknowledge he has been making small improvements but I already told him that sorry doesnt cut it anymore. 

I think I have fallen in love with the potential of this relationship. I deserve so many more things than what he can give me right now but at the same time he is making slow changes so I dont know if maybe I am asking for too much or being selfish.",Mentally checked out of the relationship.,18nlxd7,1703161742.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nlxd7/mentally_checked_out_of_the_relationship/,
"I (31f) Over a month ago I asked my boyfriend (28m) if he would book me a massage for my birthday but it be on the morning of my baby shower as it was my only day off and 4 days before my birthday, I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and in pain as I work everyday. I even found a place and time had everything filled out and he just needed to put his card number in. 

 When the day before the shower came he hadn’t mentioned anything to me so I had asked him what time and where the massage was booked. He looked at me and said “what massage” once I reminded the massage I asked for he began to scramble and try to find a place. I walked off bc this is a theme for him and I’m so freaking tired of this. He comes into the bathroom a while later and asks if a certain time and day will work I told him no bc I work that day and time. Then comes back and asks if a 9am would work the next day. I told him yes, so he “booked” it. I’m still upset but I tell myself everything has been worked out and I shouldn’t be upset.

Come the next morning, I get up go buy him and myself some coffee and my son breakfast and head out to get my massage, as I am 2 minutes away I get a phone call from the spa asking if they could move my time later in the day as seeing it was booked over night the therapist never confirmed the massage and wasn’t there. Unfortunately I was unable to bc of the shower (I completely understand the spa and therapist are not at fault for this). I drive back home sad a fuck, walk through the door and go upstairs where he’s sitting in his office, tap his shoulder and he’s like why are you home early, I tell him what happened. Walk away and grab clothes to start getting ready, I didn’t want my entire day to be ruined. He then proceeded to follow me and I just started crying, I told him I’m tired of feeling undervalued and unappreciated and I shouldn’t have to ask for him to do nice things for me and how he had an entire month to book this massage. He gave me excuse after excuse which he always does. And then somehow it became my fault (it’s always my fault) he later goes to the store and buys an electro pulse massage muscle stimulator thing and hands it to me like “here, no need for a massage as is well” but I cannot use as I am pregnant and can cause early labor or even harm the baby. 

Shower went well, we get home later that night and he starts huffing and puffing in bed saying “I’m in so much physical pain” I bite and ask why “it’s just emotional pain and idk what to do” so now it’s my job to make him feel better, I’m rolling my eyes at this point because if it’s not about him it’s going to be about him one way or another. He goes on to tell me he “genuinely thought I wanted the massage on my birthday” yet if he did it would have been booked for my birthday on my birthday 🙃 which we will get to. I literally just gave up and went to bed, this man mentally exhausted me and emotionally drains me. I’m over it all

The day before my birthday he’s walking past me and I patch the couch for him to sit and spend time with me and he immediately starts going off on me “I’ve got this to do I’ve got that to do, I still need to buy your birthday present. Blah blah blah” again how dare I ask for a moment of your time. Then he storms off. My bad, my fault.

Come my birthday, I’m getting ready for an appointment and I walk in and out of the room, he doesn’t acknowledge any time I’ve entered the rooms. I leave for my appointment and come back, he’s in the shower, gets out walks past me, and ask he’s walking up the stairs says “Adin (my son) is so excited today is your birthday” so that he was him telling me he knows it’s my birthday. (It’s like he does this to get a reaction and inflict damage on me) then he does upstairs and into his office comes back down a while later says “you want something for dinner? I’ll pick up take out. I say yea but idk what and I’ll message him, he asks me what time I’m home I tell him 5:30pm and ask him if he could take my son to the store and pick me out a birthday cake he says that’s fine, he then leaves for the day. 

I head off to work I’m a Massage therapist and I had a full day of clients booked. I’m already dreading the day because I know I’m about to be in a world of pain but it’s my birthday and I love my clients, I truly enjoy what I do for a living it’s just hard being pregnant and working. Around 3pm I message him what I want for dinner and then set my phone down (I have clients back to back, never any breaks, which I prefer keeps the day moving quickly) an hour later he’s blowing my phone up saying the place is closed until 5 (which makes sense to order then as I’m not home until 5:30) then goes on to say he already ordered the food (it’s 4pm) I message him back and say I’m not home for another hour and a half and I didn’t really want to eat cold food or even eat it by myself for the matter. Well I apparently fucked up for that because now he is telling me that I am being mean to him and he “doesn’t even know what to say” to me. Which at this point I know exactly what he is doing, he is starting a fight so he can lock himself away in the office because now everything is my fault and all is well when it’s my fault.

I get home, have a cry on my car then put on a happy face because I’ve got a 5 year old who is so sweet and kind that I can’t let this ruin it for him. I walk through the door my son comes running and he is so happy, he sings me happy birthday and has me read a card he and my bf got which was attached to a few flowers that said “seasons greeting” no cake (which he said he would get me), no gift (weird thought you were getting me a gift day prior when I asked you to sit with me, guess me asking you that made it a reason to not get me a gift as I ruined your mood with wanting to be close) food was wrapped in aluminum and sat on the stove. I was too sad to eat and eating my birthday meal cold and  alone would have just made it worse. 

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or if I’m looking for anything other than maybe someone who understands what is going on. I don’t even know if I want to be with him anymore, he ruined my birthday last year as well with his same shitty attitude.

"I wish I had the energy to type everything I’m thinking and feeling and put all the ugliness into words, but my heart is so broken that I can’t feel anything. I’m so numb that I can’t cry. I truly tried to fight my own demons over the past 4 years. I know I didn’t try hard enough, but I at least tried. Earlier this year I finally felt somewhat better, finally feeling like despite all the bullshit life has thrown at me the past 4 years that I could finally not be constantly thinking, planning and backing out of suicide much anymore. But now life, god or whatever wants to put me back into that hole because my mom health is getting worse and I don’t know what to do. 

I hate how even now suicide is more on my mind than my mom’s health. She has COPD and I scoured the internet trying to find any hope in reading something anything that could help her and all I got were blunt comments about how no matter what if she doesn’t want to quit then it’s pointless trying to make her stop. But she still fucking smokes despite what she’s been through being sick over the past year. I’ve tried to convince her, I begged, I cried, I ignored her, I argued with her, I stopped buying her cigarettes, etc. But nothing I do or say will make her stop. She knows what it’s going to do with me and the rest of the family, hell she was a nurse almost for 40 years, so she knows what she’s doing despite smoking making her worse. I feel like I failed her as a son, I failed taking care of her, I don’t think I can live with this gut wrenching guilt.

I’m trying my hardest not to even think about suicide, but all I want is to kill myself so I don’t have to experience grief once again like I did when my dad died. I feel so selfish. I’m telling myself I need to stay until it happens, I’m deluding myself into believing maybe things might change, but I’m too jaded at this point. Once you’ve reached the bottom of the abyss it’s hard to get back up and by god I fucking tried and failed to not be suicidal and now I’m going to have to deal with my mom passing.

"Very long story short, my best friend of ten years is an IV heroin addict. She came clean to me about it in 2021 after I suspected for a long time. Since that day nothing has felt the same and I feel like my life is also falling apart.

We were the type of best friends that did EVERYTHING together. We worked together, lived together, moved across the country together. She was the sister I never had. Now I feel like I don’t even know her. 

I did so much for her trying to help once I found out, I gave her my car so she could use it to work, I got her multiple jobs and even had her work for me for a while but she kept nodding off at work and using in the bathroom (taking 40+ minute breaks). It has been traumatic to say the least. All the lies, stealing and gaslighting has turned me into someone I don’t even recognise. She even went to jail and I had to tell her family, when she didn’t show up to work I thought she was dead. I’ll never forget trying to track her down that night to discover she was alive in a jail cell.

The worst part is for the better part of two years I didn’t tell a single soul about it, out of loyalty to her. Until it got to the point where she wasn’t returning my texts or calls. I can’t talk to anyone about this not even her?

We haven’t spoken in months and no one’s been able to get a hold of her, even her friend she used to use with. I literally want to strangle her and scream at her and fantasise about bashing her to try get some sense into her. Which is completely out of character for me, I’m not a violent person. Not to mention the trauma from my extremely vivid recurring dreams of her dying, and the feeling of her cold body. It’s fucked.

Don’t know why I’m posting this I guess just need to get this off my chest. I feel so used, degraded and hopeless. I quit my job recently because my mental health is in the gutter. Grieving someone that is still alive is horrible I would not wish this on anyone.

"My dad has his own business. About 20 minutes ago, a family member who works for him said she tested positive for COVID-19. He came home looking exhausted, his voice gone, coughing a little. He tells us he cannot change his appointments this late into the year, with Christmas almost here. He refused to take a test, and said he'd wear a mask to work. I am so fucking pissed off with him. I told my mum to get him to think straight and coax him into a test. I've been listening to them from my room, as I refuse to get up and look at him right now. My mum said that whatever he decides is up to him now. We are going away for a holiday less than a week from now. I do not fucking know what to do.

UPDATE: He decided to test, he is negative. He is taking all the necessary precautions by spraying the rooms he's in and he will be sleeping in our spare room tonight, not with my mum. He is upset and worried about getting it, but what can he do.

"Like all posts like this, I hate myself and I don't want to try anymore. 

Trigger warning for people who suffered child abuse. 

 I would have offed myself by now if I didn't have that slight chance of possibly surviving. My own biological parents didn't want me and my adoptive parents used to abuse me growing up to the point where I just can't be around them without feeling like I am going to be hit for some reason. But I'm too much of a coward to tell them I want to go no contact. There's a part of me that feels I'll lose my relationship with my sibling whom I love dearly. They have been my best friend and really my only friend besides my husband. I just don't think my sibling would understand what I'm going through. Ever since they were born (4.5 year difference) I felt like my family dynamic changed. My sibling became my adoptive parents pride and joy, they were basically perfect and I could never do anything right. I don't have resentment towards my sibling. I understand that they might not see why I am afraid of my parents. I became the stress relief for both of my adoptive parents. When my dad wasn't around my mom would find any reason to hit me. I remember one time she dragged me by my hair into my room and proceeded to hold me by the neck against the wall while she punched my stomach. Another time when i was about 9 I threw up on the floor and she told me to lick it up. (She stopped me before I did cause she found it gross after the fact). Sometimes when i would miss the bus for school and I had to wake her up to drop me off she would get so mad that she would drag me to the bathroom, again by my hair, and shove me under the tub faucet to waterboard me. Most of the time she came up with an excuse to punish me.  There were so many times where she would get mad at me and drop me off at the most random places in town telling me she doesn't ever want to see me again and that I could figure it out. She would always pick me up but I think she was afraid of what my dad would say.  She would tell me, ""if your dad hears about why you got in trouble, think about what hes going to do to you."" Most of the time when my parents argued they would blame the fight on me. I secretly think my dad knew all along what my mom used to do, although my therapist said that's mind reading. I'm not too sure I believe my therapist though. My dad would always make excuses that he's trying his best and that she is difficult but he loves her. I think he's a coward too. He argues with her and just leaves when he doesn't want to argue with her leaving me, her favorite punching bag to be her stress relief. He would show up and asked me who hit me and I would never tell him. I made the mistake of telling him a few times and the beatings always got worse. My mom is and still one of the few things I'm terrified about. My dad on the other hand, I have my problems. He wasn't nearly as bad but he would always work so that we could have a better life. He never was home to stop anything, he basically was a complete stranger to me growing up and even more estranged now than ever. He would spoil my sibling and I with stuff he didn't have growing up. But when I was a young child he would physically abuse my mom in front of me and sometimes me too. He would continue to abuse her more than me until my sibling was about 4. I think it took him hitting his actual biological child to realize that maybe hitting isn't okay. But it still didn't stop. One time my mom lied about me running away (she kicked me out of the house) so he left work to find me. The cops did eventually located me and brought me back. I knew that it was about to get bad. They acted happy and so relieved that I was found and returned safely. Boy I wish I was kidnapped or killed because I think a part of me died that evening when the cops left. Any trust I had in anyone died the moment my dad tied me up and beat me with a belt for what felt like an eternity. It didn't matter where the belt landed, so long as I was being punished and I knew my lesson. The whole time he screamed at me that I'm so ungrateful and he does everything. I remember my mom's face as she watched. She seemed completely devoid of emotion, almost like she could care less that I was being hit. Her cold stare is still something I see in my sleep. My dad kept hitting me and screamed at me to apologize to my mom. I begged him to stop and kept apologizing to my mom to have him stop. I felt helpless and so alone. It didn't stop after that, in their famous fashion they would drag me by my hair to my room and keep hitting me. It wasn't until my dad thought I had something in my mouth because my face was so swollen that finally stopped hitting me. When I had surgery for a medical condition the hitting didn't stop during recovery either. I didn't feel safe with them. Most kids looked forward to summer break, I didn't. I used to get so sick about the thought of going home I would throw up before I got on the bus. I told a councilor at school and they didn't do anything besides put me in counciling for depressed kids. 

Now I'm an adult who can't seem to figure out what to do and I'm too scared to do anything.  I can't trust or rely on people and I'm a pushover.  I hate my job, I don't have any type of talent besides maybe drawing a bit. I don't have friends who want to hang out with me ever. I let people walk all over me because i cant say no. I get physically ill and i can't let things go. I obsess for weeks if i feel i did something wrong. I am socially awkward. I have a husband who has always been there and stood up for me against my parents but not there emotionally and I've tried therapy. When I talk to therapists it feels as if they are more focused on my mom, like she's some type of study case. It's so weird cause I almost feel like when i talk about these problems they get so fascinating with some of the shit she used to do to me that it almost feels like the therapist is focused on where she learned how to do some of the stuff and what he childhood is like. It's almost as if I'm put to the sidelines while the therapist is trying to figure out my mom's trauma.

Now it's Christmas and this is the first year I won't be attending with my parents. I feel bad but at the same time incredibly relieved. No one else has invited me over for Christmas or wants to come over to my place to celebrate. I'm tired, I just can't wait for everything to be over. I don't feel alive at all. I want to leave everything including my husband to start anew but I know it's not fair to him. So I plan on staying and just giving up completely in hopes that I go to sleep and never wake up.

"My boyfriend and I split over the weekend. I haven’t been able to get everything out about our relationship because we have a young kid together so I don’t feel right making everyone around us hate him.
We started dating April of 2020, I thought we had a good thing going but I found out he was sexting another girl on his birthday at the end of the year. I was so desperate for love that as much as it hurt, I forgave him and we continued the relationship.
I injured my foot at the gym in September 2021 and I told him multiple times I just wanted some support from him. All it felt like he did was complain that I couldn’t/didn’t want to do something. I almost broke it off because he was being an asshole, but stayed.
Then when we moved out together in May 2022, I ended up pregnant and didn’t find out until July. I was always tired so after work I never wanted to do anything (pregnancy caused anemia) which drove him to distance himself. I could have got an abortion but it was during the beginning of August that I had a miscarriage scare. When I heard the heart beat, I realized I couldn’t go through with it. The end of August was when I found out he was planning on ditching me for another woman, but being a hormonal mess I begged him to stay. Trust me when I say I should have just let him go, but our living situation was also stressful.
So things got better after about a month when we got the first ultrasound done. We got through the pregnancy, I gave birth at the end of winter and we moved in with my mom. He worked for the first few months while I stayed home with the baby. He quit during the summer and my mom said either he worked any job (even part time) or he’d have to move out, but he never tried anything. So he moved out at the end of August. She still let him stay over for a few days at a time.
Also, through all of this, we were only intimate a few times because I had pain after giving birth, it wasn’t comfortable for me. Plus for any other person who has given birth, you’re not exactly the most confident person during the postpartum phase. Especially when your partner never compliments you. All of this led to our break up. I’m broken up a bit still because I did love him, but this also led me to realize how emotionally immature he is, he couldn’t communicate his feelings. He couldn’t treat me with basic respect. I babied him and always had to tell him what to do. The kicker is he went on a date before we even officially ended it. So now I get to try to date as a 23 year old single mom who’s plus size.",I should have ended it a long time ago,18nkkf1,1703156780.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nkkf1/i_should_have_ended_it_a_long_time_ago/,
"I'm aware I said this in my last update but I wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice on what to do. It me a lot in conveying to J about how I felt, what my intentions were and what I wanted. Yet again I apologise for this update being late, J and I were stressing around this last week trying to find the perfect week for his family members. We both went on break around the time I made my last update so we only just finished Christmas shopping. We're honestly both nervous to fly over to see J's family since it's my first Christmas with them and also for obvious reasons that will become more evident once I tell you what occurred. 

**Update:** 

After J came back from hanging out with his friends we had dinner and I mentioned to him how I wanted to speak with him before we went to sleep. He agreed to do so, after we got ready for bed and laid down we spoke. I started off by telling him that I had to confess something about the reason I broke up with S but before I did the reason I didn't inform him before was because it was difficult for me to talk about it due to how much hurt it caused me. But I also mentioned how I didn't want to tell him because I wanted him to form a relationship with S freely without the influence of how my relationship with her ended. 

I proceeded to tell J that I had broken up with S because she cheated on me with several guys, to make sure he believed him I told him details of how I found out and how it made me feel. J was upset about just finding out because he told me that even though my intentions were good, he would've liked to know what kind of person S was before deciding to build a relationship with her. He explained how he wouldn't of been rude but he would've kept his distance because he genuinely despises cheaters and his siblings are no exception, whether they're half or full siblings. J did end up forgiving me, but only if I promised that there would be no secrets between us and I agreed.   


I told J why I wasn't comfortable having S around such as her cheating on me but also because just the fact that she's my ex made me uncomfortable. I did specify that I was fine with letting her come over sometime if he ever wanted that or that she was allowed to stay the night if he wanted but that letting her stay for several days was just a line I was not willing to cross. J expressed how after finding out why S and I had broken up, he wasn't comfortable letting her stay several days either. I mentioned how the fact that she had asked for my phone numerous times had come off as a bit off and J agreed before he explained the only reason he considered letting S stay was because his father had seemed so desperate. J added how his father had always seemed sad to see S left out and how he had probably seen this as a chance for 'sibling bonding' as he apparently called it. But now that J knew more about the break up, he definitely didn't want S staying. We concluded our discussion by agreeing that letting S stay with us would not only make the both of us uncomfortable but it would most likely strain our relationship.

Before we fell asleep I did inform J of the Reddit posts I made because I wanted to be completely honest with him, he only read the comments since he trusted that I had conveyed the whole thing properly. He appreciated the comments you guys left and he overall felt that consulting you guys for advise was a good idea since it had guided me with what to do. 

Two days after we spoke, J called his father to inform him that we didn't want S to stay with us. He did confess that I used to date S and that we had broken up due to her cheating, that I had forgiven her but that I felt uncomfortable with the idea of her staying with us. J told me he could tell how his father sounded down when he said he understood but J had made his decision and he was firm on it. That same day we were trying to find a way to tell S in the most polite way possible that we didn't want her to stay with us due to how my relationship with her ended, this was done as an attempt to lessen at least just a bit of tension before we saw her for Christmas (from last we heard, she's still going to be there). 

A few hours after J spoke with his father, he received a message from S and we figured her father must've told her how he wasn't going to buy the tickets any longer due to us not wanting her to stay with us. We don't know what exactly he told her, but J explained that knowing his father he probably worded whatever he said carefully as he's not one to like family drama, especially since he was trying to get S to warm up with J's family. Either way, it must've not worked because S texted J telling him how he had gotten over the fact that she used to date me and that he shouldn't let his insecurities get to him. She also mentioned how letting her stay with us for a few days was the least he could do since she had *allowed* him to date me even though she was left heartbroken with the breakup. 

J was obviously surprised at how hostile she suddenly was since she was usually overly friendly and always talked to him like they were close. J was obviously upset and he assumed that his father must've left the cheating part out when he spoke to S because she didn't say anything about that. But J did mention it, he explained how he didn't appreciate her making assumptions about what he was insecure about when she didn't even know anything about our relationship except for the basics. He then proceeded to tell her that he shouldn't ask her for permission to date me because him and I are both consenting adults and that she did not have any claim whatsoever over me. He pointed out how he had taken into consideration her feelings when deciding to continue dating me, which he explained he didn't necessarily have to but he did because he respected her. Yet at the end she had expressed that she didn't mind J dating me as long as he didn't talk about our relationship which was a boundary he very much respected unless S asked about us. Finally, he told her how the real reason *we* didn't want her to stay was because we both felt uncomfortable with her request when taking into consideration her past actions and how that ended up affecting me. 

S saw the message but she ended up leaving J on read. He ended up telling his father about what occurred and he told J that when we came over for Christmas it would probably for the best to just ignore her while also try our best to avoid her which we will most definitely do. 

This is all I have for now and I would've waited for after Christmas to update just to see if anything happened with S which I hope isn't the case. But I also wanted to update to see if there is anything else we should be doing. J is considering blocking her but he thinks that may be a bit too much, I still have S blocked on all socials and thankfully J never gave her my number so as far as I know she can't contact me. Don't know what other steps I could take. I will try to update after Christmas which will probably be on my profile since this sub-reddit won't let me post another update post. But hopefully J and I will survive Christmas without too much drama.

My whole life I’ve always loved the holidays. Every year we would decorate for Easter, St Patrick’s, Halloween, Christmas and every single year would always bring me so much joy. I’ve always especially loved Christmas and have fond memories of being little and admiring the way our Christmas tree. My mom would perfect it to the T and it looked more and more gorgeous every single year, but this year for some reason that all changed.

Because of my mom we didn’t decorate for Easter, “who cares”, we didn’t decorate for Halloween “too much work” and like, whatever right? But what really got me is that we can’t even put the Christmas tree up because of her. I’ve been asking her since mid November about it because I’ve been so excited about Christmas time. Everytime I ask if we can set it up she goes on a rant about how nobody else wants it up besides me and that I’m a narcissist and only care for myself. Is it really so selfish to want to decorate for the holidays?? It just makes me really sad everytime I go in the living room and see it bare. 

She claims it’s “so much work” and she’s “so depressed” but she’s not. Shes just INSANELY lazy. Shes always been super lazy but oh my god, she hasn’t gone to a real grocery store in YEARS because “I can just order it”. My adult sister even yelled at her for being so selfish when her young daughter (me) wants the tree up and how she just sits on her butt and watches TikTok for 12 hours a day (no exaggeration) or goes on dates with random men she meets on there, but she seriously doesn’t care. She doesn’t care about how other people feel at all. Everything always has to be the way she wants it, we can only ever do what mom wants to do. 

I don’t want her to feel depressed, but I’ve been depressed since I was 9 and she’s never cared. It’s been worse lately and I was thinking that the holidays would help cheer me up as they usually do but now it’s all ruined. She won’t even let me put up the stockings and she has only bought presents for herself so Christmas Day this year will just be another Monday to me I guess. It’s making me really sad but this is the way things will be for now on now that my grandparents are moved in.

"i dont mean literally a housewife, im only 18 but i feel like being the only daughter in my family is a full time job which i get nothing out of. i work 24/7 doing everything, i feel like a maid. whenever my family is too burdened to do something as simple as walking four feet to turn on the kettle, get themselves a cup of juice, make themselves a cup of coffee or even pick up something up from the floor do you know whos job it is? mine. i could be studying or talking to someone and my family would yell my name across the house to do something for them. and when i dont have time or i tell them im busy i get an earfull of how im so disrespectful, no one cares about them, i dont do anything, im lazy and selfish, im useless. 

I have to clean up after everyones messes, whenever someone leaves the door open in the bathroom and the dog pees on the floor, im the one that gets yelled at, whenever my family eats a large meal and decides to leave all the ingredients, sauces, dirty plates, I have to clean them. i spent hours cleaning up the entire kitchen today because i was told to and it was a disgusting mess, a few hours later it was just as bad as it initially was and i was instructed to clean it up again.

i remember when i was studying for my end of year exams, i was stressed out and told my parents before hand to please not bother me while im studying, 5 minutes in they scream my name, i tell them im busy, again another 5 minutes later they scream my name, and other, and other. i got mad and asked them if i was not allowed to study for my exams, my mother simply looked at me and said ""no. make me a cup of coffee"". 

but its not even my family thats the problem, my own boyfriend doesnt understand, he makes me work 24/7 too, making him free art for his video games even though i tell him that it stresses me out, his argument is that im lazy and we need to work for our future so we can make money. i can understand, im fine with it, i know its for work but the issue comes from when im already burnt out and depressed from the work of being a personal maid and housewife for my family, going onto my computer to relax and then getting scolded at by my boyfriend to ask why im not making art for him. and whenever i actually want to draw something personal, simply for fun, i show him the art proudly and he ask why i wasnt drawing what i was instructed to.

i have no say in anything in my life, i work for school, i work for my family, i work for my boyfriend and yet im called lazy by everyone, im tired, i just want to relax for once, all i want to do is just to relax and not do anything for just one day.

"I'm only 25. I used to be so happy. I loved my job. I loved my girlfriend. Our relationship was so good. I had a house that was my sanctuary. I literally had everything I'd ever wanted. Then we found out she was pregnant. It wasn't planned, we had only been together for 18 months. I didn't even know if I wanted to be a dad. Especially not this early on in my life. But she was ecstatic, she'd always wanted kids, so we kept it. We found out we were having a boy, and suddenly it felt real, and the reality sunk in that I was going to be a father. And I became so excited. I researched everything I could, I poured a ton of money and time into perfecting his nursery, his clothes, everything he needed. We spent hours upon hours brainstorming names. We did everything we could to ensure his life would be perfect. 

And then he was born. They took him away before either of us even got to see him properly. The ultrasounds had shown no abnormalities. He was supposed to be perfectly healthy, but instead he was fighting for breath. When we were finally able to see him in the NICU he had so many tubes obscuring his face we could barely see him. They told us he had CDH, which somehow had gone undetected up until his birth. He was supposed to go for surgery when he was stable. But he never became stable. The first time I got to hold him was after he had passed. The only time I got to see his face uncovered was after he had passed. He was my twin. 

I didn't get to experience a single moment of joy with him. From the minute he was born it was stress, anxiety, and dread. At least when other children pass their parents have moment of joy to look back on and remember them by. I didn't even get that. There wasn't a single thing that made this journey worth it. I was already happier than I had ever been before he was conceived. I didn't need him to make my life happy. I didn't need him to exist. If he had never existed I would've stayed living my perfect life. 

I can't even function properly anymore. I can't go back to my job that I loved so much. I can't bear to face my family and friends who were so eager me to meet my son. I don't ever want to be home, because everywhere I look there's reminders of him. And there's reminder of what my life was like before him, and I know I'm never ever getting that life back. I can feel my relationship with my girlfriend breaking apart. I know it's not going to survive this ordeal. 

What the fuck were those last nine months for. I had to watch my partner struggle with her health, with her body, with the pains of pregnancy and labour. We were planning on taking a two month long trip to Europe that we had always dreamed about. Instead we abandoned that because she was pregnant and could not bring herself to fly. We sacrificed any and all luxuries we wanted so that the money could go to our son, to ensure he would live the bestlife. But all that was more than fine at the time, because after all, we were supposed to be having a beautiful baby boy that made all the sacrifices worth it. 

I don't even miss him, because I didn't even get the chance to know him. I just wish he never existed in the first place. I wish I could go back in time to the night he was conceived and ensure that it never happened. I wish I could save myself from everything I'm feeling right now. Save my relationship, save my job, save my happiness and my joy and the life I used to live. It's not fucking fair.

I’m 27f and my sister would’ve been 29 this past April. We were best friends, we told each other everything, she was my main support system when my boyfriend died in college, I held her hair when she threw up during our clubbing days, I was there for her after her miscarriage, we cried together, we laughed together, we fought together, we were a force to be reckoned with, it was us against the world. 

The night before I got the worse phone call of my life, we spoke on the phone for hours, just laughing and talking as usual, everything seemed fine, or at least that’s what I thought. I keep thinking about that phone call and telling myself that she was crying for help and I didn’t see it. She use to tell me that she was okay and everything was fine with the brightest smile, but she was secretly hurting. I keep telling myself that it’s my fault for not trying harder to get her to talk to me, I could’ve pushed and pushed but I allowed her smile to blind me. I didn’t want to think anything was wrong because we were best friends, we tell each other everything right? Everybody around me keeps telling me to stop blaming myself because no one saw her depression, not just me. But I just can’t help but to blame myself. She put on a brave face every single day and faced the world all on her own.

It’s been exactly 1 year since her death December 21st, 2022. I keep telling myself that it will get better, but it doesn’t seem to get better for me, i miss her laugh, her smile, her voice yelling at me telling me to wake up at 7am, I miss our spa days, I miss rewatching our favorite TV series for the 100th time together, THe Vampire Diaries, The Originals, The 100, Friends, Pretty Little Liars. I miss her terrible cooking. I just miss her and I want her back. I’ve lost 30 lbs from not properly feeding myself, i’m 5’7 and 106lbs, some days I won’t even get out of bed, and when I do it’s like I’m dragging 100 extra lbs on my back. I don’t go out with friends and to family get togethers anymore because I don’t want to be the debbie downer of the party. I know that is unhealthy, and that’s what everyone keeps telling me. And I know I should see a therapist or whoever specializes in grief, but I keep pushing it off. I don’t have a good reason why I just do, and I know if she could see me now she would be so disappointed in me, but i’m not as strong as her, I can’t fake my smile for too long before I lose it.

She was imo the epitome of the evil step-mother. SM didn't waste any time putting distance between us &amp; Granny. I went from living with Granny to being lucky if I saw her 2-4× a year. It was a very difficult adjustment. 

In November of 1990, I (now 46F) was 13yo. It was Thanksgiving weekend. SM didn't want to travel to see Granny that weekend, so we weren't going to go until we got the call that Granny had a massive heart attack. I had a really bad feeling, but got told that I was overeacting. I wasn't allowed to pack any nice clothes ""just in case."" That detail will become relevant later.

Afte an 8-10 hour drive we finally arrived. Granny was in bad shape &amp; on life support while family members gathered. SM cruelly didn't want me to stay at the hospital &amp; colluded with Dad &amp; BW to trick me into leaving. Sadly, I fell for the trick.

I was put to bed at BW's home. I'm not sure how to explain what I experienced that night. Nightmare, vision or something else. I don't know if it had any paranormal connection or not. All I really know is this has tormented me for 33 years &amp; counting. 

I remember waking up (for lack of a better word) at 12:31a.m. During this experience, I had seen a hospital bed surrounded by doctors. Then 1 of them turned around &amp; his/her face was a skull. I got very emotional &amp; woke up BW. I told her, ""I hope you're happy. My Granny is dead &amp; I didn't get to be with her."" BW responded, ""It was just a nightmare, go back to sleep."" My Dad called around 8a.m. in the morning to tell us that Granny passed at 12:30a.m. Somehow, I had known within 1 minute of her passing that she was gone.

Now there was a scramble to adjust travel plans, make funeral arrangements, &amp; try to find me appropriate clothing to wear. I ended up being dressed in an ugly shirt/skirt combo borrowed from BW that had to be safety pinned at the waist so it would somewhat fit me.

A few days after the funeral, the ""dream"" occurred again. It had evolved to include the funeral events. 

Over the years this ""dream"" evolved more. It became the original version, plus the funeral. Then it added discovering that the funeral wasn't real &amp; frantically searching for Granny because SM had hidden her somewhere. With more evolution of the ""dream,"" I finally found Granny &amp; I was overjoyed.

Now we finally get to tonight &amp; what I truly hope is the end. I woke up in tears nearly an hour ago because it has happened &amp; evolved again. It went thru all the previous parts of the dream. I'm not sure how much ""time"" had passed since finding Granny, but it didn't feel like very long. I was laying beside her telling her about my life while searching for her &amp; my kids etc. I looked over, at 1st thinking she had fallen asleep. Then when I reached out to touch her, I realized that she wasn't asleep but she was passed away (again).

I wonder will I ever get past this crippling grief &amp; these reoccurring ""dreams,"" or am I doomed to suffer forever? Thankfully, they aren't as frequent as they used to be. Nowadays they mostly occur near the anniversary of Granny's original passing.

Right now it's 5:30a.m. for me &amp; I'm scared to go back to sleep.  In the past when these ""dreams"" have woken me up they have been so powerful that waking up was like hitting a pause button. No matter what I do while awake the ""dream"" resumes once I'm asleep again.

"So a bit of context, I was pulling into my driveway and heard this ungodly loud bang and a scraping sound and I thought I'd hit something. I stepped out the car and saw that my car was fine, then heard shouting for the main road about 100 meters away and saw the two cars involved. I rushed over and saw the wreck.

The two cars had been in a high speed collision and a man was unresponsive in his car. Some other people dragged him out and layed him on the ground in recovery position and he was just limp. Without getting into too much detail, his car was a mess of shattered glass, broken metal and blood. Everyone else was helping and I just froze.

A lot of crashes happen on that road, and I've been in one there too so I'm sort of accustomed to it, but I've never been so close to someone in that bad of a condition after one (usually both parties walk out fine).

I feel guilty for not doing anything to help and, despite not knowing the man at all, feeling so awful about it, like I'd lost someone close to me. I'm now scared to get in my car and drive along that road, and even thinking about it makes me feel ill. 

I haven't explained how I feel to anyone because I know that they'll judge me for making someone else's trauma my own, but I needed to just put it out there.",I witnessed some die in a car crash,18njz7i,1703154478.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18njz7i/i_witnessed_some_die_in_a_car_crash/,
"I (21M) have extremely thick hair, but my forehead shape is abysmal. It curves backwards and I have a widows peak and huge skull, so it gives the impression that it’s receding. It stresses me out so much and I get super worried about the possibility that it’s actually receding because I love my hair (my hair and eyes are my only two good features imo).

It’s just exhausting because I’ll notice baby hairs or something that I hadn’t noticed before and convince myself that it’s recession even though my hairline hasn’t changed since the stress started in like May.

"What the title says. I was his first relationship, his first everything. He was the first good man I had ever dated and someone I could genuinely see myself spending the rest of my life with. I loved him in a way that was deeper than I have ever known. I still do.

We were so bloody happy. So stupidly in love. And then two months in, I was brutally raped at a party while fairly drunk enough to not remember all of it. I repressed it for months, pretended it didn't happen. We talked about it maybe once or twice, he was there when I would fall into a spiral of depression when I would think about it, but beyond that I really think he thought I was ok. Or he didn't think about it. Months later, the full memory of what happened came back to me one night. And I fell apart. We fought for what felt like a month straight. I don't think he understood at all what I was going through, I had pretended I was fine for so long after it happened that he thought I was truly ok and just didn't understand how much I was suffering. He was naive, 23, and had never been around someone in so much pain before. How was he supposed to know?

Then a month after that, my ex sued me for custody of our daughter. He went scorched earth when he found out I was dating. He berated me daily, calling me a horrible mom, a deadbeat, saying I abandoned our daughter for grad school, telling me things about myself that only brought me further down into a depression. It killed something in me to have to take his abuse, knowing if I fought back it would ruin whatever chance of amicability we had for our daughter. My boyfriend was my rock through all of this, right there beside me telling me we would get through it. 

And then we jumped back into the school year. I was hollow. Months of being treated like shit, months of repressed pain from being assaulted, I couldn't function anymore. I would stay in his apartment while he went to work. I gave him zero breathing room. I started snapping at him over the stupidest things. Until he was hollow too. 

Over Thanksgiving he told me he didn't recognize himself anymore. I didn't understand at the time but now I do. He was someone who loved individuality, loved doing the things that made him happy. I robbed him of all of that because I couldn't see past my own darkness. In 2 months, my life fell apart. I lost everything and I lost the love of my life at the end of it.

When we broke up, he told me he saw us as friends and that he doesn't think hes in love anymore. He had told me he loved me days prior, I saw it in the way he interacted with me. But he was so wishy washy. One bad day, a couple days of being cooped up in the house and he would launch right back into running away. He told me when he reached his breaking point and not before  when we could have changed things and I resent him for it. I resent him for the conclusions he came to. How could he not see it was the circumstances of our relationship and not our relationship itself? WE were so good together, LIFE was just brutal at the time. If I had given him the space he needed, this wouldn't have happened. But how could I even know to when I was in agony for so long?

He didn't even think it through long enough to realize half of his belongings were at my place. We were both going home for winter break in the next couple days anyway. We agreed on a couple months of space and to talk after that about where we are. In that sense I have hope. For the first time in so long, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel in MY life. I want more for MYSELF not just the person I'm dating. I want to heal from everything that has happened to me and I'm done with letting my life pass me by. I want him to see that in a few months. I want him to see how much I've grown and healed, I want him to hear me when I say that the way things were in our relationship were so much a product of how much trauma I was holding inside me that I've begun unpacking. For the first time in my life, I want more than just existing. 

But I'm scared. I'm terrified that this space we are taking will make him dwell on all of the bad. Or make him ask questions like ""what does it mean that she has a daugjter w someone else, what will my traditional family think of that?"" Ask himself questions he never did. And think about All of the times I snapped at him, the fights id pick. How much pain there all was. I pray he will remember the good and see the context surrounding the bad, but I just don't know. I want to have hope but I'm worried when we talk in a few months that it will just be an even firmer no from him. Even one week apart, and I can see where everything went wrong in a way I never could before. I want to tell him that he won't know who I am anymore bc of how much healing has taken place. I want to tell him to take it slow with us, start as really close friends or in the early stages of dating where we brought out the best in each other because we also had our own lives until I lose mine to darkness. I want him to hear me and see the changes and I want him, more than anything to accept me back with open arms. I miss him. I love him. He's my best friend.

"Earlier this month I got a call from my Dad letting me know my only older brother had drowned and tragically passed away. He recently turned 40, struggled with addiction, and had been hanging around ""friends"" at homeless camps again. I say ""friends"" because it's unclear what happened and what exactly lead to his drowning as everyone present had a different story to tell about how it all happened.

Some people said he was helping others move their belongings since there was an imminent flooding, some said he was just high and jumped in a swelling flood of his own accord, and some say he was pushed or attacked and that's the reason he was swept away. 

My brother was my hero my entire life. He was such an enigmatic person that words can't exactly describe. He was such a talented artist, a tattooist for most his life, and the funniest person I've ever known. He was so caring and empathetic towards others and a loving father to his son. He struggled a lot with his past and his relationships since he was so well known. He was in and out of rehab, and in the hospital frequently for his debilitating asthma.
Recently I've been getting messages from one of his Facebook accounts after his passing. It's been devastating to lose him, and even more upsetting to wake up to messages from ""him"" and knowing it was from someone who had his log in info, and not my actual brother. 

All his belongings were missing even though he had his own apartment for the past 4 years. It seems someone stole his belongings (his keys, his phone?) and is now messaging me asking for money to ""give his account back"". The person has blocked my mother on fb so she is unable to see all her past messages with my brother since around 2010. The hacker is asking for money to unblock my mother and more money to get his account back to us which I doubt will actually happen. For some reason the death certificate has not been filed yet, as well as an autopsy (even though he died weeks ago?!) So we are unable to memorialize his accounts to get the hacker off of them. 

It's been hell to lose my only brother, and even worse to see him all over the news and receive messages from his account asking me for money to get the memories back online. 
I'm at a loss. I'm trying to get funds together to give to the hacker, totally unsure if that person is the one who killed him or not. 
My family has been supportive but I am stuck in this limbo of trying to get the last messages I can from him when I've already lost so much. 

All I want is to help my mom get the last messages she had with him to her but I don't think it will ever actually happen.

"My grandfather was born on a reserve , i grew up close to him and i didnt even know till i was an adult. His skin was brown but i thought it was just cus his heavily smoking caused discoloration.
  He had to run away from the reservation with his mother at a young age due to domestic violence. I dont know much about his past but i know he never spoke of it . I know that he married a residential school teacher but had to request special permission from the government to marry her . They gave him permission only if he disowned his culture and served in the military. He thankfully only got a bullet to the knee and got to go home and marry my grandmother .

 I know he was a alcoholic before my grandmother grew sick .that my father had to drop out of school to take care of his family cus my grandfather couldnt /wouldn't.  That there was domestic violence in my family that resulted of the alcoholism.

 I wasnt allowed to know about his heritage at a young age.  I recall asking what is my cultural background was for a school project and i was told nothing of it because he didn't want us to know . He didnt want us to be mistreated and considered us lucky we didnt look it it was a blessing for us was his thoughts according to my father.  

I grew up in a place full of other indigenous people and really wanted to be apart of the culture, i could feel myself drawn to it . I  hardly had a chance to experience the culture due to being considered not one of them or welcome.  In highschool scool i was told in helath class  that natives had a predispositions to be addicts in regard to some scientific studies , like our brains our just wired that way ? Idk smh ..
 i learnt of my heritage only when i became in dire need for dental care i couldn't afford.  My aunt told my mother about the coverage offered by my government for registraterd indigenous peoples that she applied for for herself and her own children, against my grandfathers wishes as he didnt want us to represent as natives out of fear of being thought less of . My father still to this day refusing to acknowledge his heritage and an alcoholic himself all his life from a young age .

 I cant help to think it is due to his heritage. Not because it is in his dna But because he had to experience the mistreatment and poverty   and shame that this country put on his father that forced him to experience the terible mistreatment of things like  residential school  and  being considered less of a human because the color of his skin or cultural upbringing forced into participating / bexoming a pawn in the war just so he could commit his  love to another human .Or even more so his mother and  father and elders beofre them , being forced to live isolated on the reservation. 

Its just gross the way they're treated and I understand him not wanting to sell out to the government allowing them to feel forgiven by throwing money at his descendants to make up for  the years of  generational of mistreatment. I get why he didn't want me his grandchild not treated like his people were and are still today . Still being seen as lesser humans becuse they're a majorty of those addicts with mental health problems. I see it and hear it like all the time everyday so casually .
  If the government really wanted to make amends theyd offer more then just a money to make up for it they need to offer free counseling and rehab and halfway housing and continued supports for life to heal their / our minds and souls.
 I got to stand inline with members of my grandfathers band today to receive some of the money distributed to the members of the the descendants who were mistreated,
; i still feel like i am looked at like i couldn't possibly belong . I feel like i do though . I dont think i can ever feel like i can belong anywhere cus the segregation is still present.

"My brother was born in 2008, and sadly, he was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which basically meant that he was born with half a heart, and soon lost the function of one of his lungs because of this. My parents lost absolutely everything, and ended up declaring bankruptcy because of the insane amounts of medical debt from the constant treatments he needed. We ended up having to move to Florida, from my home state of Colorado, to get him out of the altitude, so that he could have a chance of recovery. We moved in with my grandparents, who fought with both of my parents, constantly over every single discrepancy. My dad during this time, was working 60-80 hr weeks trying to support us. Eventually, my mother, who works in construction, got a job opportunity in my dad’s home state of Texas, so we ended up moving again, and I ended up leaving the sense of stability I had in Florida, to go live in an area in which was not the safest, to say the least. My father became a stay at home dad for the next couple years. My mother, bless her soul, hit the grindstone and spent the next 10 years working her way up in an industry, where she as a woman, was immediately discounted. At first it was nice having my dad at home, especially since for my entire life I had barely got to see him. However, the older I got, the more I realized that expectations for me were so unreasonably different from my brother. EVERYTHING which was mine, was also my brother’s in his eyes. Friends? Also my brother’s(he still does this TO THIS DAY, with me being 17) Toys/electronics? Too bad that my grandparents bought them for me specifically, because they were OUR’s now at my brother’s request. Additionally, my dad would also try to pressure me into doing extracurriculars that I didn’t want to do, such as football, than when I inevitably quit, he’d hold it against me as a reason to not support any other extra-curriculars that I actually WANTED to do. My freshman year was completely ruined, because he would refuse to address me without trying to pressure me into asking out random girls in my grade out. This made me a social pariah, which led to me dating my now ex-girlfriend, who I believe was a complete psychopath. This, he denies his involvement in me dating her, and instead insists that he did nothing but try to stop me from dating her. He’s fat, like 270 ibs fat, and has in the past made comments about my weight, whilst denying it, which contributed to my low self esteem I struggle with daily. Fast forward to 2 days ago, and my dad’s dad, who neglected to send me a birthday card, sent me $50 for Christmas. Because my brother didn’t get anything, my dad practically demanded that I give up half my gift card to my brother. Then, it all hit me… I was an afterthought in my father’s brain. I was his second favorite, and he has never tried to hide it. I can’t even care for my brother anymore, because he plays into it. I feel awful that I have no positive thoughts, feelings, memories, or emotions towards my only sibling. I’m scared that if he died tomorrow, I would feel completely indifferent. Fast forward to today, and I’m on “vacation” in hot springs, Arkansas. It’s 2:54 am and I’m completely unable to sleep because his fatass has been loudly snoring all night, and my brother has been constantly getting up with the soul purpose of making noise. I’ve completely given up on going to sleep at this point and could not be more pissed. This city is absolutely beautiful, and I’m being essentially forced to go tour a treatment plant near Little Rock, Arkansas, which is about 75 miles north. I’ve been the only one actually trying to get the disgusting excuse of a vacation going.

So I, 21(nb) have a childhood friend L, 20 (m) I’ve known basically all my life (family friends). We dated a bit in elementary school which was just puppy love, but since middle school I’ve been more than aware that he wanted a more…physical experience with me. And I’ve honestly never been that interested.

Well tonight I screwed up by allowing that to happen. You see, he’s visiting for the holidays from another state and asked if he could drive up to visit me and sadly I said yes. At first it was fine. He wasn’t the best kisser,couldn’t undo my bra, wasn’t that good at finding the “pleasurable” spots but he hit them enough that I could over look it. And then the main event happen. And y’all. 

Two condoms about five or six pumps each. And he did warn me so that isn’t truly what pissed me off/ made me regret it. What did is the fact he first lied about the first condom being “off” and then claimed he had a pulled muscle and couldn’t continue. And I tried to believe him, but the evidence in the condoms made it impossible to.

So okay fine he’s embarrassed, I can understand. I know some men get embarrassed about that type of thing. But the after math? He “didn’t” know where he threw my underwear, immediately started texting his “bromance” about meeting up and the worse part? Started watching and laughing at people hurting/clicking delete on themselves. Like what???

"It is extremely difficult to explain this 25-yr complicated love/fear relationship that I have with my father. He spanked me and my siblings as ounishment which when I think back is the first time I felt anxiety. The same anxiety I feel now anticipating how I'm supposed to tell my dad that actually when you asked if I graduated last week and I said yes and then you smiled all big and excited for me; in fact I lied... the look you'll give me. I am honestly horrified. I can't sleep or eat. Oddly enough that's also a similar feeling I feel in school actually. It's beginning to feel like I was just never cut out to fit his expectations. I'm a super super senior. I changed my majors from a ""respectable"" degree, architecture, to a ""not-respectable degree"", french. I was raised with ""money first, pleasure second"" mindset and lectures (think pharmacy; doctor and lawyer were too unobtainable for me according to them). I went to community college and made Dean's list. I didn't know what I wanted to do after so I transfered to university and tried architecture. Made it two and a half years and I lost all motivation (maybe burn out?) To continue even though I had once truly loved it. I couldn't pass my classes anymore. So i switched to a language I love, and am already fluent in, knowing that with this switch I would still graduate at the projected time. But... I got horribly anxious mid semester and instead of flunking my classes I dropped them with a W and only attended two. So I won't be graduating this semester. 

And I'm scared to let my dad down. I hate that I lied. But I have to come forward and tell him. I'm fucking 25 years old and I'm so afraid of my dad that I lied... It's insane. I don't even know where this exact fear comes from. I know I need therapy but I can't afford it right now. 

I don't think I can go back to school next semester because it gives me horrible anxiety and I truly think I would benefit from a break. But now I've lied on top of all of that. 

When I told my dad I switched majors this past febraury, he found out after the fact and was really upset with me bc it's an impractical degree and he only then was finding out. I explained that a degree is a degree and at this point I just want to finish because I was struggling mentally (I felt pathetic saying mental health issues but that's what it is) and it was better than nothing. He actually gave me very encouraging words and I fought my tears but my voice was cracking and gave me up that I was so relieved and happy (and surprised) to hear his words of encouragement. Until two days later when I suppose he had time to think it over because he called me to let me know that he now felt like I was sitting around doing nothing all day and I'm just using my emotions to manipulate him. I'm wasting my loan money on food and bumming around instead of working and getting my degree. And again, I was hit with a different kind of shock and disappointment, I thought he understood how I was struggling to even feed myself. That I felt paralyzed in my own body with panic regarding school. I tried to defend myself through sobs but I couldn't so I told him I had to go. He is such a reasonable and pragmatic person, but maybe to such a fault that he can't feel empathy anymore or just holds me to too high of standards. I'm not sure. But. I still love him. But I'm so scared of letting him down. I just needed to vent but I could really use some advice if anyone has any.

Only a week before I got one of my friends from work to help me clear out his mancave to make room for the adjustable bed. We had to remove one of those enormous and pillowy dark leather reclining couches and a matching easy chair. They were ridiculously sturdy and heavy. We took them all the way downstairs and out the front door.  Mother insisted that I should take them home as they were brand new and that she never liked them.  I'd rented a moving van, brought them home, and put them in the garage. Just three months before, the man in the adjustable bed upstairs had carried that couch and that chair up those stairs with the help of a friend. 

Last week I loaded them up in the back of my truck and took them to the dump. They never even made it inside. 

He was 82. 

&gt;*""When he passes I'll have to count all his meds and destroy them.  He's got some very powerful medicine here. Back in the day we used to just tell the families to flush it, but sometimes they'd keep it or sell it.  Not that flushing it was good.  Don't want these in the water supply.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Now I'm going to shave him, but we're close.  I can tell by his breathing we're getting close.  He's going to pass soon, so stay close by. He will take one long breath and then he'll stop breathing. It's not going to be long so stay close. Don't go anywhere.""*

She shaved his face going against the grain, and that's not how he shaved. It's not how he taught me to do it either. ""Go with the grain at first"" he'd said, ""after the big whiskers are gone you can go against the grain to make it smooth.  If you start against the grain, well, we have sensitive skin and you'll get inflamed.  It's uncomfortable and it'll make you break out.""  Even though she'd softened his beard with a hot towel his face was cherry red.  I went downstairs and got some cooling aftershave gel and some cologne. Calvin Klein Obsession. I brought it back upstairs and put the gel in my hands, rubbing them together.  I applied the gel to his face and was alarmed at how hot he was.  He had a fever. A very high fever.  He was freezing and complained of it in his lucid moments, but the heat was radiating from him. I took the cologne. I poured it into my hands and rubbed it into his face and neck. My father always wore too much cologne, but he also always smelled amazing. He wore so much that his scent often lingered for hours or days after a visit. I wear cologne just like him. 

As I was massaging the cologne into his face, tears began to roll down his cheeks.  All I'd wanted was to restore a little dignity, a little of his life before the last few weeks. For him to know he smelled good. It was a moment of tenderness that was long overdue and I think it surprised him.  I think it surprised him that I would touch him. 

I think it surprised me too.

I was seven years old the day he broke my heart. He'd taken me to school that morning.  We were in his Silverado.  Red and White Stripes. Waffly Red Velour Seats.  As he pulled into the turnaround to drop me off, I grabbed my Star Wars lunch box and crawled over the bench seat to kiss him goodbye. 

&gt;*""You know, you don't have to kiss me goodbye if you don't want to, Son.  You're 7 now.  You're growing up. You don't have to kiss me.""*

I recoiled immediately. For the first time in my short life, I knew what it felt like to cover up devastation with a smile. I crawled back to my door, opened it, and hopped out, holding back big tears. I could see four of my friends in front of the school and as I walked closer I knew I'd have to hide in the bathroom to let this out before I could speak to them.  I could hear him honking as he drove off. I didn't look back.

Years later when I told my therapist about this I told her that in that moment I didn't know if my father was telling me that he didn't want me to kiss him anymore or if I didn't have to. 

I've come to the conclusion it was both. 

A few weeks before, Mom called me, in tears, telling me how hateful he was being. That nothing she did for him was enough.  That he thought she was purposefully trying to aggravate him. Calling her stupid and worthless.  She wouldn't give me details or specifics about what he'd said, just that it was full of meanness and hate. He was being hurtful on purpose.  He had typically reserved that treatment for me.  I told her to put him on the phone. She did. ""Dad, listen to me.  It's important you know how serious I am right now. She is the only person in this world there to help you.  If I hear from her again, one more time, that you're being hateful, If you're anything less than cheerful and gracious, I will come get her, and her things, bring her back to my house and you will fucking die alone. I'm serious.  Figure your shit out, but I promise you YOU WILL FUCKING DIE ALONE. Do you understand me?"" He timidly responded ""Yes"". 

I remember thinking that he sounded like a frightened and confused 7-year-old. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The next few hours the nurse would suddenly stop talking and look at him.  She'd motion for us to come near.  She'd pull out a stethoscope and listen to his heart a few moments, and then say ""He's still here, but we're very close.""  She did that a few times after that. By the time he'd taken his last breath all the drama was gone.  We were used to it. He drew one last raspy breath, he exhaled a long rattle and then he didn't take another. We waited in silence as she listened for his heartbeat.   


""He's gone.""

We stood around his bed looking at his body as the nurse made doubly sure he wasn't breathing or had a heartbeat. My mother had her hands on his arm.  She looked at him with heartbreak on her face, but cried in silence. My sister said ""Goodbye Daddy, I love you""

I'll admit I had tears but I don't know, I still don't know if they were for him or for my mother and sister. I was glad he was no longer suffering.  I wanted to smoke a cigarette.  I was 41 years old and had never smoked in front of my parents.  Now seemed like the time. 

I walked out the front door wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants.  All the neighbor's houses were decorated for Christmas. Theirs was illuminated by only the porch light and the streetlamp.  I felt like a failure. I'd considered coming to their house a few weeks ago to decorate for Christmas as that was something he always did, in my childhood and ever since.  Their home always looked amazing at Christmas.  Lighted paths, candles in every window, a gorgeous tree in the front window, a wreath with a red bow, the whole house adorned with beautiful warm white light. I was angry that I hadn't done it. I lit the cigarette.  My mother came outside.  She asked me if I was smoking.  I said yes.  She lingered.  She said, ""I don't know what to do now"".  I told her ""I've got this."" She watched me take a few more puffs and went inside. 

When I went inside the nurse was still upstairs counting morphine pills.  I asked her what we should do now. 

&gt;""We need a police officer and an EMT to declare him deceased. I've already called the police and they'll be here in a few moments. After that, you can call the mortuary and let them know he's passed. You may want to do that now. They'll come and remove the body and an agent from our company will come after that to disassemble the bed and take away the other medical supplies"" 

It was 6:30 pm. I asked my mom to get me the information for the mortuary and that the nurse had called the Police and EMT to have him officially declared deceased. I remember thinking ""I need to put this on Facebook"".  I got out my laptop and posted that he'd passed a few moments ago. I put it on my page, and I put a post on his page. It felt so important to let everyone know he was gone. My phone began to blow up with notifications.  It was a nice distraction to read all the kind things people were saying to me and about my dad.  It was nice seeing ex-girlfriends and boyfriends that I didn't even know looked at my posts offer their condolences. I felt special and important. 

I was hungry.  Mom called the mortuary and they told her that it would be about 2 hours before they could get to my father as they were already on another pickup.  When she relayed their message to me she looked as though it might break her to be present when they took him away.  We ordered Chinese food and had it delivered. We ate and looked at our phones. From time to time my mother would say ""Do you remember when he...."" 

When the doorbell rang she looked at me and I told her ""Go.  I'll take care of this. Call me before you come home."" She opened the door and two very kind-looking men introduced themselves to her and offered their sympathies. She invited them in and we told them the police and EMT's had already been by and declared him dead.  The hospice nurse had taken his pills that she'd meticulously inventoried, hugged us all, and left about an hour before. They asked me where the body was.  I looked to my Mom and said ""Go now.  I'll call you when he's gone.""  She grabbed her purse and keys and my sister grabbed hers and they left.

The staircase to the mancave had a landing. That landing was a turn in the direction of the steps. At the top of the steps there was a hard left, and passage to the mancave where my dad had taken his last breath. I walkd them up the stairs, to the landing, up the next flight of stairs, down the path and showed them where he was waiting to be taken away.  I could already see the nervousness on their faces. They looked at his body and they looked at me. ""I'll go get the stretcher"" one said as he went downstairs.  The other gentleman asked me if I'd been there when they brought the bed up.  I told him I had not. I told him that I'd moved a couch downstairs and that I could offer some advice as far as that went. He nodded in agreement and I went to pee.  

As they brought the stretcher inside they lowered it and began to carry it up the first flight.  Once they got to the landing it was clear the stretcher was too long to make the turnaround, so they lifted it over the railing and onto the second flight of stairs.  The left turn for the passage was too narrow so they had to lift the stretcher one more time to get it over the railing and make the turn. It was getting pretty obvious that my father was not going to come down the stairs on the stretcher. 

Once in the mancave, the men looked at each other and then looked at me. 

&gt;*""We don't think we're going to be able to get him down. The passage and turns are too narrow and the stretcher won't make it.  We're going to have to carry his body down. Sometimes this is how we have to do it. You may not want to watch us do this*.""

My father was no small man.  Barrel-chested, strong, sturdy.  A big man.  Though the cancer had left him half the size he'd been all my life, he was still big. Though these two men looked able-bodied I could detect the fear they had of moving a body this way, especially a body like my father's, down two flights of stairs while his only son watched. 

I told them I would stay. 

They collapsed the stretcher and carried it down the stairs the same way they'd carried it up.  Once we were downstairs, they opened the legs of the stretcher again and locked the wheels, in readiness to accept my father's body. We were all already out of breath. 

We walked up the stairs and to his bed.  They lowered the railings and placed a sheet over his face, down the entirety of his body.  One man grabbed his feet and the other grabbed him under his arms.  They came around the corner, to the stairs and lifted his body over the railing to make the turn.  They made constant eye contact with each other.  As the man with his feet began his descent, he stepped backward down the stairs until the man holding his torso and my father's head got to the first step.  Once that first step was made the man holding his feet lost his footing and almost fell backwards. Dropping my father.  He got his balance back, but the man holding Dad's torso looked at him with this look that said ""We're going to drop this man while his kid watches"". I could see the terror on their faces as they made one more step down, almost losing him again.

I could see the terror on their faces as they made one more step down, almost losing him again. 

""Do you want me to help you?"" I asked in sincerity, sensing the fatigue and fear they were feeling. ""Do you think you could?  Would you mind? Are you sure?"" they asked.  ""I'm sure"" I responded and began to walk up the stairs.  

I came to his body and put my arms underneath him, my arms cradling his lower back and his thighs. ""He's still warm,"" I thought, thinking this might be a mistake. It had been almost four hours since he'd passed and his body was still as warm as when I'd put aftershave on him. I kept my mouth shut and carried his heavy and lifeless body down the first flight of stairs. When we got him to the landing, I was in the way and had to crawl under his body to get out of the way.  The I came up around his other side and cradled his legs and back in my arms once more as we carried him down the second flight. 

Once down the stairs the men lifted him onto the stretcher and sighed in relief that we'd gotten him down without dropping his body. We were all out of breath.  

""He was still really warm,"" I said inquisitively.  ""Yes,"" one responded ""The body will stay warm for several hours.  I know it's surprising. I assure you, he's gone."" He'd assuaged the fear I had that my father was still there. 

They brought his body to the door, opened it, and wheeled him to the hearse.  There was music playing in the hearse when they opened the large rear cargo door. It was 80's music. The Cure. 

However far away  
I will always love you  
However long I stay  
I will always love you  
Whatever words I say  
I will always love you  
I will always love you

The door closed, the men hugged me and thanked me one more time for helping them. They got in the hearse and slowly and tenderly drove the hearse away. 

I pulled a cigarette and lighter out of my pajama pants. I could see my breath. The cold felt good. 

I smoked a cigarette as I walked the block and back, admiring all the Christmas lights. I called my mom while on the walk and told her they'd taken him away. 

A few minutes later my mother and sister came back to the house. I didn't tell her about the difficulty we'd had getting his body down. 

We talked for a little bit about the next steps. His remembrance ceremony, his desire to be cremated, how long that would take.  

It was late and she was ready for bed. I was ready for another cigarette. 

""Are you going to stay the night again?"" she asked.  ""Of course, "" I responded as I stood up.  She stood up from the couch and gave me a long hug. ""You smell like your father's cologne"".

She was right. I did.  And it lingered on me for the next few days.

"After a rocky on and off in high school, my gf Carly and I finally became consistent in 2013 before going off to college  - we were 16. In 2014, things became difficult with her parents, and Carly and I entertained the idea of moving her in with me at my parents' via text if it came to it. Privacy and freedom to grow had already a problem for a long time, and Carly's mother read through her phone the next morning, as she'd done in the past (I had to apologize for more than one occasion of sexting because her mom took it upon herself to read through our messages). They forced her out of their house. After that, we dropped out of college and started working, eventually moving into our own place together. 

As time went on, it became easier for us to access alcohol. Carly began to drink every day(mental illness, including depression and addiction, is strong in both of our families), while the novelty had mostly passed for me. It was a consistent strain on our relationship. We had already become scarcely intimate, and it was difficult to find the time and wherewithal to go out or spend quality time together. Then I, selfish and ill-equipped for something this sensitive, would plead, bargain, get angry and say hurtful things, contribute to flat-out yelling matches, threaten to leave....anything to get her to realize the hurt that I was feeling; emotionally abusive. It felt like she was picking alcohol over me. The girl I loved was changing; gone. And I was changing, too.

We'd make up and move on for a while, but it always came around again. This cycle continued for almost 3 years. I became a monster - always worrying that she was hiding alcohol, constantly angry or downright cold... she didn't deserve that. She needed help and support, not more pressure from her partner. I feel so sorry for that. 

Eventually, we finally broke up. It happened suddenly during one of the usual ""break ups"" in frustration that would last half a day, except we didn't make up. That time was just it. But we were locked in a lease together, so we remained ""friends."" Ex's that occasionally slept together. As selfish and horribly toxic as it was, I'd felt neglected, disregarded, and invisible no matter how much I screamed. I needed to lash out and show her what she gave up, so I started dating other people and bringing them to our two-bedroom apartment to hang out and meet my ""roommate."" It was needlessly cruel. 

To be clear, I know that we're both better-off now - she and I, both, are in healthy relationships with partners we cherish, and experience has made us better people. Idk if the drinking has stopped, but that hardly matters now. And what I miss is the version of her that existed in high school before we had real hardship thrown at us in the adult world and couldn't handle it. But she was still my first love, and I still think about her every day. 

I don't know if I'll ever be able to move on completely. It feels like unfinished business; like there's still a part of me that I haven't recovered even though I'm 28 now, pushing 30. Therapy has helped a bit, provided perspective, but the old wounds and the guilt linger on. I wish I had done more to help Carly or had at least given her the love and support she desperately needed to help herself. I've felt broken since that time, like I don't deserve anyone.

"I never thought I’d be in this situation. When I heard about relationships like this in the past I thought they were ridiculous, stupid. “Just break up.”

5 years of my life. 5 years I’ve foolishly given my heart to a man who treats it flippantly and at times cruelly. 

The scariest part is even though I know how much suffering he has caused me I don’t want to let go. Because I love him more than I’ve ever loved anyone. He’s made me laugh harder than anyone. When we’re together just existing domestically it feels so seamless. I sleep better when we share a bed. Other partners typically have disturbed my sleep or I’ve felt uncomfortable sleeping next to them. But with him I just feel safe and peaceful.

We have unparalleled physical chemistry. He has been one of the most respectful and gentle lovers I’ve ever had. He never crosses  or even pushes my boundaries. He is affectionate in the ways I like. He can be so sweet. He claims I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him, that he loves me, that he can see himself marrying me and having kids with me. But it’s all so hard to believe when I look at his history of noncommittal behavior.

I truly admire him in many regards. He is brilliant and disciplined. He is a wonderful cook. He can pick up any hobby or skill with ease. He is well groomed in addition to keeping a clean living space. We share a lot of the same tastes in music and comedy. We have a very similar view of the world. He is the only person who keeps me on my toes with his vocabulary. Likewise it’s such a relief to not feel like I need to dumb down my speech for him to understand me. He reads voraciously. He is multilingual.

When I met him I just felt so comfortable around him. Like there was nothing I needed to tiptoe around or walk on eggshells like I had in my previous relationship. I just felt like I could be myself and he wouldn’t judge me.

Even one of his best friends said that I am perfect for him and balance him out.

But the truth is I think he is a sociopath. He seems to experience emotions very shallowly. He is dismissive of my emotions. I’ve never heard a true heartfelt apology from him. He is an incredibly selfish person. I really don’t think I’ve ever heard him express guilt over anything.
He’s told me himself he doesn’t think empathy exists and that he thought he might be a sociopath. Oddly enough I’ve had another man confess to me he thinks he might be a sociopath but in his case he seemed worried about it. Man “A,” my man, has always been cooooool as a cucumber. He is so contained. But then sometimes he will get angry, usually at strangers or someone in the periphery of his life, and vent to me his homicidal urges towards them. But 95% of the time he is even keel, a placid or nonchalant expression on his face. And then he’ll tell me about his violent dreams, how he dreams of war often. They seem to be violent more often than not.

Anyways, I don’t even want to get into why I’m angry with him at the moment. I’m just exhausted and frustrated with myself. I don’t want to suffer anymore.

"First off, let me start this by saying I don’t need anyone’s judgement. Am I aware stealing is wrong? Yes. Did I go into this situation intending to steal? No. Was that the outcome anyways? Yes. I have bad impulse control, and I’m well aware it’s going to get me into trouble someday.

Anyways, with that foreword aside, the situation at hand is as follows. I was walking around the small town I’m currently in at about 4AM, when I saw a sign for a THC/vape store, and was intrigued. As an aside, while I’m not 21, I have a full beard and have never been IDed, so I fully intended to pay for whatever I might have bought. Upon nearing the store, though, I saw that the lights were off. The sign in the window said 24/7, so I tried the door anyways, and it opened. I was wearing headphones, and did not hear the alarm I triggered. There was no one in the store, so I browsed for a second, before impulsively grabbing a few items of the shelf. I felt guilty, so I threw a $20 bill in place of a vape I took. (Just for the record, I only took two other things.) The total value of goods taken was probably about $100. Now, by this point, the alarm started beeping for real, so I took off my headphones and realized what was happening. I kinda just… left. I hadn’t drove there, and though my face was definitely on camera, I’m only in town for a week, so I doubt anything will come of it. 

So, yeah. I’m now the ~~proud~~ owner of a couple pieces of weed memorabilia, and a vape. I don’t know if this is the correct subreddit for such a confessional, but I suppose I am in fact getting this off of my chest.

Some men and women don't care, and prefer progressiveness; that's their preference and I respect that. 

Is it fucked up that I've always wanted to surrender myself to a man? I have had a great career and do fine financially, but I want to be spoiled.

I love when a man thoughtfully gets me gifts (doesn't even need to cost anything). I enjoy love notes/letters. 

I think it's the hottest thing when a man wants to pay for everything when he's around (ofc not spending more than he can afford). A man that shows he wants to provide and add value to my life just makes me want to surrender to him. I'm also not talking about in a simpy way, but a man like this will hold himself with a healthy dose of confidence and pride. 

There are men out there who are like this and respect and empower women, by the way. I've experienced it several times, and I just wasn't ready to settle down in those times.  

I've expressed this to almost every guy i've dated longterm and while they do this, it's their first time and I know they would prefer more splitting. 

Now I want to wait til I meet a man who was raised with these values. I don't know if I just have daddy issues or if it's some kink, but this is what I truly desire. It turns me on entirely. Ofc some men like this can be bad but not all; back in the day when all men were like this, there ofc were great ones.

The only man i've met who is like this is fucking married (it's open) and I've tried to uphold my boundaries bc I don't want to fucking fall for a married man who carries almost all the traits i've wanted in a man. I don't feel less of a woman or human if a guy spoils me. I feel more feminine actually.

Is this wishful thinking? If I have a psychological issue please tell me. I feel like I am the only woman who still wants this. 

Of course I like to spoil my man but that is not the point. Where are the men who are instinctually like this?",Are My Desires Too Unreal In This Modern Dating World?,18nhkrc,1703144494.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18nhkrc/are_my_desires_too_unreal_in_this_modern_dating/,

I have asthma + acid reflux. I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to soda (Pepsi, sprite, colored drinks etc) which is affecting it really badly. The thing is the doctor gives you a diet to reduce acid and its like every fucking food on earth is on that diet. I want to breathe like a normal human being and run around without losing air but it's like everytime I get better and I eat one thing it instantly flares back up again or I get sick and the acid comes back. The fuck am I supposed to do? Do I just starve myself forever? It doesn't help that I want to gain weight and you aren't even allowed to eat dairy.

"So, to put it succinctly, my (53 F) longest relationship was with a man, Martin (56M) who was omly a marginally involved dad to his own child Wayne (M 30), but lived with me and my son Robbie (M19) for 10  years. It was a long bumpy road  but ""stepson"" and I are close.  He lives half way across the country, the three of us live on the coast.

I broke up with Martin just before the pandemic. We are friends, but I can only spend a limited time with him  nefore he makes me annoyed and I get restless ans a bit bitchy. Martin is alsi a functional alcoholic and compulsive gambler. Martin has a chronic illness that is going to make travelling difficult. For his birthday I went halfers with Wayne on a plane ticket for Wayne to see all of us including his dad.

This summer, during the visit Martin was flakey and a no show much of the time.  It hurt Wayne a lot.  Wayne and I have discussed it both then, and since.  My compassion for my stepson is affecting my ability to ""play nice""  with my ex.  Unfortunately it bleeds into comments to my own son, Robbie.

Anyway, my annoyance and deep disappointment with the way Martin treats wayne has crept into how i talk about hom to Robbie.

Im finding myself torn between playing nice for Robbie's sake and  my feelings watching my ex stomp on his own child's heart.
Robbie has no illusions about Martin, but Matin was still his defacto dad and does not  want to hear negative talk.

"Let me start off by saying this is probably partially my fault. I downloaded Hinge yesterday and got a match with this girl i found very attractive, we started talking and she was quite funny and sweet, she had a job and life goals and was going to school. So i asked her out to go skating and look at some x-mas lights I had got there and upon walking through the door i immediately took notice of the fact that she was completely overweight and was wearing an absurd amount of makeup. it was quite annoying me because i realized i basically just got catfished and put in a very awkward position. The photos were very clearly from a long time ago. I stuck around for awhile and as the date came to an end she asked for a second date and I was honest and said i didn't think it was a match. I just think if your gonna put yourself on hinge and show yourself of too others only not look remotely close to that is just rude.

"ok, first of sorry in advance for the english, not my first language
well it's pretty simple as the title
I don't know anymore what I'm doing with my life
i ended a 1+ year relationship last tuesday 'cause i couldn't see a future with him + plus some other things
4 days later i got out in the middle of the night with a guy i ""met"" on an app(he had his intention but didn't actually accomplish, though he already knew that i wasn't on with that but accepted anyways) and we kissed but meh, didn't feel that ""chemitry"" i guess
some hours later i met another guy, we took breakfast together, did a lil' walk and then he invited me home [mhm who knows why? think it'll remain a mistery] and i accepted
we started watching a serie and in the meanwhile he started kissing me so i just kinda went with the flow, even though i stopped him many times telling him to watch lol
anyways
things just escalated i slept over a couple of times already, we ""act"" like a couple and all
we ""did it"" (let's say it didn't really work out) 
well now, i already informed him that i don't even know what I'm doing so he shouldn't have his hopes high about a love story
so here's the thing
i can't understand why I'm acting like this with him? kissing, caressing and yeah yk whatever a couple does and it's not even a week since we know eachother
could it be for the ""routine"" i had when i had a bf? 
worst thing is we kinda talked about it again and now he's just thinking about a future with kids with me and all💀 could it be true or is he just trying to brainwash me? but still at a certain point he just said ""it doesn't have to be love(meaning from me)""

"Please excuse me for my Bad grammer and if some of my scentences dont make sense. I'm just venting and am on my antidepressents, so it may seem incoherent. English isn't my first language. And im on mobile.

This Post sounds very much like an incel rant. But I want to clarify that I don't hate women or even resent the ones that hurt me. I know that humans are complex and I can't generalise but I just feel hopeless.

So where do I begin? I guess lets get some contest to my person before my rant. I (20m) have always had trouble connecting with women. No matter the age I feel like there is an invisble barrier preventing me for taking off my mask, that I put up.

I struggled with being honest with anyone that isn't male. That doens't just include ""friends"" but also my own family. 
Everytime I talk with my mother or my sister I feel this wave of distrust and like I can't form an connection. It saddens me since my relationship with them is very good.
I feel two faced because I struggle with being honest with them even though they care. It doesn't help that my psychologist is female.

I've had trouble with getting in relationships because no matter if they tell me they love me I can't take it at face value. I mean many girls in my childhood lied to me and spread secrets of mine. Even when I feel like they're being honest I think they have an ulterior motive to hurt me.

I feel like an incel, so bitter and jaded. I yearn for a connection but there is no way a woman would love me, right? I can't even try to get to know them because I can't be myself. Something is just hindering me,  so even when I think a woman is lovely or fun. 
My instinct tells me that they're just being nice and want to gain my trust, to hurt me.

I dont want to try dating apps and my low self esteem just is a gut punch.
I know that the fault lies with me and that the only one that can change this is me.

"My cousin, E, who is currently freelancing - technically she is unemployed as her jobs are few and far between periods. E has been married to her husband, P, for more than 5 years, and recently got divorced in February 2023. E also got a visa in the States after she married to her American husband, but they were very unhappy in the marriage as they often argued over issues such as him trying to pick a bone with her about her excessive spending on luxury bags and clothes. E also told P that she went to business conferences in different states but really she was lying to P about those and she always had a bunch of dating apps on her phone. E's obsession with other people's lives pretty much took up her entire day, as she would always be telling P about her ex-colleagues, ex-classmates and old friends and comparing their marriage to others'. 

So before E and P divorced, E actually went back to her hometown to meet up with her old friends. One of the old friends was G. G was her ex-boyfriend and she wanted to get back with G as she was unhappy with her marriage with P. P also couldn't deal with E anymore, nor fund her desires for luxury goods. E then went on to move all her furniture and her boxes of belongings into G's house without his permission. She hurried to move in to G's because she didn’t want to find her own place and pay rent and she refuses to rent her own car so she is driving her parent's car. She made her parent pay for the insurance too. She is a very irresponsible driver - I was in her car before and she had serious road rage and is known to drink and drive. She got into a few accidents before and they were all her fault yet she didn't get repercussions. G wanted to break up with E and started to ghost her so E decided to quit her job and fly to where G lived to confront him. Somehow E convinced G to stay together by purposely getting herself pregnant by refusing to take birth control pills without telling G, and is now making him marry her. G also likes to have sex without condoms, so he believes that the baby is his. Even though E is with G, she is still on dating apps and trying to reconnect with past classmates, workers, etc. to try to find a backup plan or a person who is richer than G. She likes to claim she is a virgin or has very few dating experiences in front of men so they think she is very innocent. She also refuses to do any of the housework because she claims that any injuries to her hands will stop her from working. Right now E is living with G. She doesn't contribute any expenses to the household. She doesn't do the housework as said before. She doesn't pay for meals or rent or utilities. G is very cheap and wants to save money, so they always try to have free meals at different people's homes. He also only lets her eat instant noodles or other cheap food. E plans to vacation early in 2024 despite being XX months pregnant. E is known to party hard and drink and do drugs. She also smokes too and refuses to give up smoking despite being pregnant.

G's family comes from old money, so G's father was quite reluctant to agree with this marriage, but he is pretty convinced that E is pregnant with G’s baby. G is unemployed right now and is living off of his grandma's inheritance. He is also banking on his father giving him money and knows that his dad will support him financially if there's a baby. G's sister is also pretty hostile towards E, due to E's past history of dating many men and dumping them after she depleted their money for her luxury wants. E has sought the advice of a lawyer about inheritances and divorces. She is eager to have G's father change his will to include her child once she is born. She is also eager to get married because she'll be able to divide G's property if they get divorced after being together for a while. She is also eager to give birth to try to claim child support if she divorces. She will only claim more parenting time with the child if that'll give her child support.

E also used to have cats to make her lovers stay in the relationship longer, but would dump the cats on her family to care for after the relationships end. G has already said that he knows he will be the only one looking after the kid. E has said many times that she hates kids. E might also dump the kid to her family, just as she did with her cats. E now plans on convincing G's father to hire them a nanny to look after the kid when the kid is born and she plans on bringing the kids often to G's sister's home so they can have ""free"" food and childcare help.

"I have a friend in the office/team, an early to mid 40s F, who has anxiety. We buy breakfast together and sometimes also lunch, depends on what our respective schedules allow. While we have almost the same route commuting home, as an introvert, I prefer to go home alone rather than spend it with someone I usually interact with at the office. I didn’t know how she’d take it given her anxiety and, also, she’s an insistent type of person so I established a white lie that I’ll be waiting for my partner and she’d go ahead.

On to what’s bothering me. For a while now, I’ve been feeling negative whenever talking to her because all I hear are constant complaints about her life:

- with her semi-entitled parents and their issues. like the types who raise their children and depend on them come retirement and at that age still play favorites who’s obviously not my friend (note: where we are from, this is kind of a natural thing and a baby boomer mindset), or
- how her car gets stricken by misfortunes at the parking lot (water marks from the adjacent car when it’s being washed there, scratches/dents from the adjacent car, also a parking lot caretaker who doesn’t seek permission when having to move her car), or
- how she’s a single parent and how little financial support she receives from the father, among other so many more. 
- how pay sucks every payday, how taxes are big every bonus time. Ugh!

It’s hard for me to excuse/qualify her rants by her anxiety, and I kind of want to stay away from her because I’m becoming fed up, I don’t wanna hear any of it anymore – like whenever she sends a message or calls me I’m dreading “what now?”

To add to this, one time we were buying coffee and the lines were long. I’m not one to cut in a line (ok not always – I’m not the image of perfection at falling in line – but at least not in the office where someone who knows you might be looking) but she cut in. There were two lines, I queued on one and she kinda talked to our colleague who was almost next in the other line. I was still at the far back of my line when our colleague had already left and she was shouting, asking for my order. I was so embarrassed at that moment I walked out of my line and said I don’t want to order anymore. I’ve seen her cut in line before but not at that level. For me, you do it one time, occasionally, fine I’ll let it pass but if it’s part of your system already, add the fact that a chunk of your day is to complain about life – no, just no.

The negativity is so triggering and also draining. I know friends can be sounding boards and should listen to a friend in need but on some level I don't wanna be that for her. Sometimes, I even come up with excuses just to not go with her at breakfast.

"So, hi. This is a throwaway account. Mainly because the stuff in here is documentary levels of heavy and I just… don’t feel comfortable having this shit connected to my official accounts.

I’m (23F) a child abuse victim. I always knew this. I had memories of my mom hitting me, beating me, neglecting me. I always downplayed its severity and told myself that it wasn't that bad, that other people had it worse than me. If it really had been that bad, then I would be much less well adjusted, right?

Things happened recently. I made another post about it on this subreddit, and it was kind of long and rambly, and I’ll admit, a bit of a pity-party. But I ended up having to move in with my mom, who I had convinced myself had changed. She began abusing me again, although more in the emotional sense. She ended up threatening to kick me out in 3 months, which ended up slowly dwindling to a month, and finally in a week. 

This all happened over the course of a month.

I got the news she was kicking me out via a text when I was at my fiance’s (26M). There was no sympathy or anything, I just was kicked out. I had been dealing with health issues, and my cat was at her house, so it was difficult. I tried to talk to my fiance’s parents about it, they didn’t believe she could even do this, and told me I was asking them to pity me. I felt lost.

I went back and on the way there, told her I was coming to get my cat so I could give him to a better home in the case I couldn’t take care of him. She refused to give him up and threatened the police on me. I had to come up with a plan, I contacted my dad, who took me in, and threatened her until she brought back my cat. Meanwhile, my health issues are being checked out, and I realize just how much was kept from me and my doctors.

First, I possibly have an auto-immune disease. I have been in pain most of my life. I kept asking for help but she kept telling me it was normal. Second, I was never told important details about my medical records. Thirdly, I remembered events from my childhood that made the previously stated physical abuse and neglect worse.

I didn’t go to preschool for long, I was taken out because I made the rest of the kids feel dumb and also because I didn’t have manners. Instead, I was taken go a babysitter who locked me in a dog cage and treated me like an animal. I was taken away from that woman because my mom realized that she’d be caught. I had to lock my room frequently to prevent my mom from beating me, and she convinced my dad to remove the locks. I started barricading the door. She used to force me to do housework, not in the chore sense but she treated me like a personal maid. She called me the r-word, dumb, to the point I no longer tried in school anymore. She encouraged me to continue talking to my sexual abuser and groomer because he was the only thing keeping my panic attacks at bay.

I’m at a loss. It’s been 23 years and I feel like my entire life is a lie, that I’ve wasted those years, that I am sick and I have little time left. I don’t know what to feel.

"I (39F) am a single parent to four amazing kids. Life has been difficult more often than not, but I've managed to maintain a positive attitude throughout most of it. However, a few years ago I was diagnosed a condition that while not life-threatening, causes chronic and sometimes excruciating pain. Add the fact that I have three vertebrae that are slowly disintegrating, joint injuries, a few concussions, and an immune system that just doesn't work, I feel like crap about 80% of the time. The worst of it has just hit in the last 3 years. I went from being able to run several miles at a time barely being able to walk a half mile some days, to having to use a cane last week because I sat in the same position for too long and irritated my bad knee. This means no more getting up and going for a 5-mile hike whenever I feel like it, being able to pull 12 hour shifts on my feet when needed, or even skipping medications that help me function somewhat close to normally. Heck, I can't even eat red meat or have a glass of wine without feeling it the next day. My pain tolerance is incredibly high, but that doesn't mean pain doesn't bother me. It just means that I've done things like still go to work and perform normal activities with an active shingles infection, go through most of my labor without an epidural and act completely normal, and generally stay calm in situations where I or someone else gets severely injured because I've had to function while in pain for decades.

Oh yeah, I also get involuntary muscle spasms throughout different parts of my body, but mostly in my legs and hands. You can see how this makes living a normal life difficult. I actually worked in healthcare until my symptoms got worse, which is when I was diagnosed. Even though I'm technically still board certified, there's certain aspects of my job that it just wouldn't be safe for me to do, so I've even had to retire from my old job early and change careers because my retirement pay is not enough to feed four teenagers where I live. My muscle spasms are slowly getting worse, despite an increase in my medication dosages that are supposed to control them. I'm worried that one of these days I'll have a bad one while driving and have a serious car accident. Even if I don't, my condition is not going to get any better. I've had shingles multiple times, pneumonia a few times, strep and lung infections more times than I care to count, and my allergy list is long enough that I have to be on prescription grade allergy medications in order to keep living where I currently live. Yes, I know I can move, but as of this year, all of my kids are in high school and I promised them they wouldn't have to switch districts or states until they finish.

I'm just constantly mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted. The only thing keeping me on this planet is that my kids are not ready to be parentless. I was thinking about all this the other night and felt just so hopeless. So I made a promise to myself. If things don't get better by the time I'm 50, and all the kids are financially and emotionally stable, I'll  allow myself to move to a country that allows medically assisted death. In a way, it has taken a mental load off me because I've basically promised myself that one way or the other my suffering will end. But I know it would probably freak out the few family members I'm still in touch with, so I'm definitely not going to tell them unless I get to that point and actually feel the need to go through with it. I have no idea how I would tell them.  I'm so worried about hurting my family members, but damn it, there are days I can barely get out of bed and I'm not even 40 yet.

I'm not the kind of person who has ever worried about growing older. I don't regret the past or lament over it. But right now, there is this distinct feeling of loss. Obviously triggered since I saw him and I don't really know how to deal with it. There's such a difference between life then and life now and it's hard to reconcile both. My memories are from when I was 16/17 yo and since yesterday I am in flashback mode. Remembering school and friends and life in general, back then. Is this nostalgia? Or does it sound like I'm having my first ""mid-life"" crisis? Yesterday was just me processing the situation and feeling happy to have had this reconnection but today I'm feeling quite weepy, panic-y, anxious, with a weight on my chest. FWIW, I'm 38F.

I know life has very obviously gotten better and I am happy where I am and what I'm doing; I've grown personally, professionally, financially. I shouldn't be feeling this way. So what gives? I don't have a clue. ",Unexpected 20 year flashback,18ngiie,1703140400.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ngiie/unexpected_20_year_flashback/,
"i suffer from a couple of conditions, not obvious nor physically presenting, that has resulted in me being on disability. 

I didn't want to do it, but my employer basically thrust me into FMLA because I said to my supervisor that I wished some days I wouldn't wake up. 

When I wasn't cleared for work after a failed attempt to return I was put on short term disability, then long-term, and finally governmental. It's destroyed my self worth. I've become even more withdrawn because I've lost my independence as a result and have to rely on others just to survive. 

I've been voluntarily hospitalized 4 times (I'm in my late 30s, first time I was 16), been in therapy essentially non-stop since and have tried every legal antidepressant available. The only thing that worked was Spravato, but it only helped with suicidal ideation. My depression and anxiety were just as bad, but I at least didn't think about ending my life. I tried Spravato for two years - no major improvement. 

Did DBT for a year, spent 3 months in an intensive outpatient program. The rest has been CBT. 

I do not know what reason I have to live for other than the genetic urge ""to keep going.""

I feel like a pathetic piece of shit for even posting this, but I still have some hope someone else who has been down this path can show me it's not just a slow downhill ride into a woodchipper. 

I paint, write, make music, read, hike, and more when my mind and life allow me. 

I've gotten to the point where Alan Watts would find me pitiful based on an excerpt from his reading ""Don't Think Too Much.""

""A  person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of illusion. By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull. Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating.""

I see no future for myself (again, this has been an issue my entire life), and do not find the ""normal"" alternatives palatable - not that I could hit ""normal"" if I were on the broadside of a Barn with it painted on there. The hatred, stupidity, vitriol, selfishness, near inability for humans to admit they're wrong, and essentially the incessant focus on wealth, sex, and power make me feel like even if my brain wasn't so scrambled I'd still not want to live.

I am by no means a saint. I'm as flawed as any other, but at least I'm willing to try and change. Despite failure after failure. The rest of humanity seems content to go over the cliff with their blindfolds on.

I don't know where this is going. 

If you're thinking about applying for disability, I'd suggest you consider what it would mean to have your income decimated, watch your social network collapse, and somehow be expected to function as if nothing's wrong other than what's said in therapy or a doctor's office. 

No one wants to hear about anyone's problems but their own, so it's impossible to try and clue those remaining in my life to what's going on, or I don't want to burden them further. 

I wish my mother had just aborted me instead of putting me up for adoption. Not have the guts to terminate me was the most selfish thing she could have done, knowing full well her genetics and that of her families was like a living DSM. 

I just want to be alone and independent, but we don't get what we want in life, and for a lot of people they don't even get the basic needs met that we all share. 

I'm pathetic. The most ""seen"" I've felt in my entire life was when I had some writing critiqued by AI. If that's not Weenie Hut Jr territory, I dunno what is. 

And so help me God, the next time someone says ""it must be nice not having to work"" I think my head may burst. No one is meant to live in this level of solitude and yet paradoxically a high level of dependence.

"For real it is sooo difficult to make her orgasm.

She doesn't seem to be able to orgasm vaginally and only can do so via clitoral stimulation.

But omg it is soo difficult. She must not be tired, her mind must be at the right place, she needs a lot of foreplay, lot of kissing, the clitoral stimulation needs to be in a particular way, she also needs to be touched in other places, the mood must be right, it musn't be so cold yet not so hot either that it starts to become sweaty. She needs to feel good about her body, she needs to feel clean down there.

OMG. And on the other hand for me, it's like a race. Start, keep going, keep going, and finish. Boom. Race won.

This is my first sexual relationship with my girlfriend and we have been together for around 3 years. 

We are emotionally resilient and have a great relationship and we enjoy the sex. I am able to make her orgasm almost every time we have sex, but I'm becoming increasingly wary in putting in soo much of an effort because it is starting to feel like a chore now.

Is this how majority of women have it? Are there even women who orgasm easily?

I don't feel like getting into details. I'm just so fucking useless. I missed an alarm, and ended up missing an important event for the person I love the most. I can't get over it. I had a fucking panic attack when I woke up, I apologized, and it seems okay between us, it didn't become a thing or anything, she knows I feel horrible.

She didn't say it but I know how it must feel, I cried thinking about it. I wanted to witness it so much, I hate myself. I wish I could go back. Our relationship is so good, and has been for so long, nothing shitty like this ever happens. It's so important to me to be supportive and I love her so much which makes this really hurt.

"My ex let themself get sa'd because of me?

This is going to be pretty messy, and probably quite long. 

I (16 m) used to have a friend (17 m) that was very dependant on me. He went to me with all his problems (things like bad thoughts, sh related things, etc etc) and for a while I was his only good friend. Because he had all these problems, I felt as if I couldn't really talk to him because I didn't want to burden him. Anytime I mentioned being hurt by something he'd done, he would immediately make himself a victim, saying that he was worthless, everyone hates him, and that he should just un*live. In doing so, he made me comfort him even though I was the one hurt by his actions. Because of this inability to communicate my feelings, the relationship became very one sided. I was his support, and therapist if you will. In 2022 I moved away from the small town we lived in to study. Before moving, I tried communicating with my friend. I told him he needed a bigger support system, that he couldn't just depend on me, and that I think it would be better if we weren't friends since our relationship had become very toxic. He responded like he usually did and I'm not in the habit of ghosting people so we stayed friends. I also obviously didn't want him to khs so I figured I would support him until he got better help.

In the fall of 2022, me and some other friends got him train tickets to come visit us and celebrate his birthday. I made him a hand made gift and baked him a cake and everything. We were going to celebrate at one of my friend's houses, a girl that I had liked for months. Before moving I would talk to my friend about this girl a lot and how much I liked her. So I never expected him to do what he did. I was staying with another friend, and he was supposed to stay at her house. The next day, the day of the celebration, I find out they slept together. I was shocked, and I still remember him laughing at me as I realized what was happening. This for me was the last time I would let him hurt me. So I cut contact.

I never ghosted him, if he reached out (which he did once) I responded. Before unfollowing him on social media, I saw he posted multiple tiktoks about me, which was fine. Months later, his new account popped up on my feed. I saw he had posted many more videos about me, some of them about missing me, but some were blaming me for all the problems in his life. Recently he posted a video saying I was responsible for his bad thoughts, sh, attempts, eds, addiction, and for him ""letting himself get sa'd to feel something"". This was insane to me. I commented on his video asking how I was responsible for these things since many of the problems he mentioned were true way before we even met. My current friends know about the situation and so they also commented in my defense. His video got taken down pretty quickly but he kept uploading new ones, saying he didn't mind being the villain as long as he could affect me after I ruined his life. He also said he was at the anger stage of grief and that being the bad guy was his therapy. 

I still feel very confused about this whole thing. I don't exactly know what he thinks I've done, to me all I've done is leave a toxic relationship. I would understand if I had just left without an explanation. But I had explained everything to him and I never ghosted him. That's why I'm posting here, hopefully I'll get some other perspectives on the situation.

"So I \[34 F\] work as an art teacher by day, and it doesn’t really pay the bills, so I’ve been working as a porn artist to try and make some extra money. I’m not poor by any means, but my wife is disabled and so whenever I can get extra cash, I animate and draw porn. I’ve been trying to gain twitter followers and have gotten a few commissions. Mostly it’s for fun.  
  
Yesterday I was banned from Rule 34 for no reason, said that I should have received an email saying why, no email. I don’t even use the website for commissions, mostly just to share my art, so I emailed them, and I did get a response pretty quickly.  
  
First, they said “the account was locked by admin for clearly not meeting the art standards of the website sorry, there was no need to inform because we warn on the upload page not to upload art like that.” and then “the art was made is some way that was not up to standard”.  
  
I sent them examples of my work, I’ve been an artist for over 20 years, professionally since I was 18 years old, and the response I get is basically ‘fuck you’. I’m sorry for swearing, but honestly it feels like a spit in the face. I’ve been trying to get my work out there, and some anonymous moderator decides that I’m a beginner artist when my work is—and this isn’t to disparage the wonderful porn artists out there—better than half of the work they let sit on Rule 34. It feels snobbish, I know, but I’m furious and I don’t know any way other to say it.   
  
There’s nothing I can do, now. I thought I was banned because I had to remake an account because I either forgot the password entirely, or somehow lost access to it. That would be a completely reasonable thing to ban someone for. Nope. Admin directly told me it’s because my art is too shit for their platform, even after I mentioned that I had remade my account.  
  
To be honest I don’t even know what I want anymore. I feel just like giving up posting my art anywhere at all. It used to make me happy, drawing big honkers, but now I just want to lay down and cry. It’s stupid I know, I shouldn't be this upset about something that doesn't even affect me in real life, and I shouldn't take it personally. At least writing about it and venting here helps a little. I'm not going to share my art here... because well I feel that is obvious, but I know that it isn't amateur by any standard. I've studied anatomy, I sell my SFW paintings all the time, I teach kids how to do what I do for a living (not porn). I haven't felt this angry or upset at criticism about my art for a long time.

If you have any insight, I'd love to know. Are the standards for Rule 34 just high? Am I just a bad artist and don't know? Am I just a baby who can't take criticism?

"I (m 20) don't really know how to explain my situation, but it's keeping me up at night. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I've never felt this way in my entire life. It's just little things here and there, but nothing concrete enough to actually warrant this concerned feeling. We just recently moved to a new town with my mom's new boyfriend (both 39). Ever since we moved, they both have been acting very suspicious (I think). Sometimes they'll say small things to each other in that tone of voice when you tell an inside joke (idk how to explain it). I keep replaying these moments in my head and I'm probably way overthinking, but I also just feel in my gut that something is off. My mom's boyfriend has a history with drugs &amp; prison, but my mom does not. My entire life, my mom hasn't been a drinker. She would only have an occasional glass of wine whenever her best friend visited. Ever since we moved here, she has been getting drunk way more often. It's not like every day, but it's way more than she ever has before. I started smoking weed when I was 16 and my mom would very rarely partake, but now she smokes more than I do. She has trauma from an ex many many many years ago so I don't think she would ever do hard drugs, but both my aunt and uncle have pill popping issues. She is an adult and I understand that she can do whatever she wants, but I just feel like something weird and suspicious is going on. I've been with my mom for literally my entire life and she's just been acting different enough to make me feel uneasy, but not different enough to take action yet? I just don't know how to explain it. I feel like I'm going crazy, except my sister is also noticing a change so maybe I'm not that crazy? I guess I'll keep y'all updated if I find out more.

"I know this is a small problem in comparison to what most people post on here but I can’t help but to have hurt feelings. My small group of 5 friends exchanged gifts tonight. I gave my friend a really nice ceramic mug, a matching coaster with an inside joke printed on it, and a collector set of matches. Nothing fancy, but heartfelt and picked out with her in mind. 

I watched my other friends get nice gifts such as necklaces, candles, books, earrings. All great stuff. 


I open my bag and it contained: 
 - a couple of cat toys (a type that my cat doesn’t play with) 
- cat treats (a brand that my cat doesn’t eat)
- eyelashes (glue on lashes which I don’t wear)
- a $5 Starbucks gift card
- an car freshener with a musical artist I like printed on it.


I can’t help but feel hurt because aside from the car freshener which is actually specific to me, it feels like my bag is a bunch of random cheap stuff that was thrown together at the last minute, like a mandatory work secret Santa instead of one among friends . Everyone else seems to get heartfelt and personal gifts and I only got one thing that I might use. It made me feel like the least liked friend, even though i know it’s just based on the one person who picked my name and not the whole group. It was hard to even be in the room when everyone else seemed genuinely happy with their gifts and I was almost tearing up.

"Now in college, we became rly good friends around 10th grade in a group, and then got closer in  11th and 12th grade  because we shared classes together and I developed feelings.  Just finished the first semester of college now, in different states. let's call her K.

&amp;#x200B;

She came out to me explicitly in the summer preceding 12th grade. I honestly didn't really care about her sexuality and my feelings towards her, I'm in no way jealous, or bitter towards her or her orientation,  I was simply grateful that she felt like she could be her honest self, and trusted me enough with that information to tell me. I honestly hope she finds a girl who cherishes and appreciates her the way she deserves it. ( I better be invited to the wedding ;))

I can know and understand  the logical explanation as to why I'm so desperately in love with her, it's because I've never felt so seen or connected with another person on the same level. We've spoken about personal things that we wouldn't share with anyone else, and that sort of connection (especially when there isn't a deep emotional connection in my other mostly male, teenage friendships)  leads to intense feelings. She's been through some difficult times in her life with mental health and family neglect, and I admire her strength and courage in pulling through those periods of her life. She's helped me a lot in sorting out my  own mental health  issues. She gave me my first proper drink, and we've spent a lot of late nights  texting and  bitching about essays  we needed to write, or  talking outside her house, v drunk on a bench till 3AM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how I've fallen into the stereotypical ""guy in love with his girl best friend"" stereotype/meme. Because I've had and have solely platonic friendships with girls with no problems, and I wish I didn't feel this way about K, but I do. When analysing it rationally, I've never wanted to date her, I've always  known that logically, it wouldn't work out even if we went to the same college and she was straight. I feel sometimes, that I'm betraying her in a weird way, by having these feelings and keeping them hidden.  At the same time, I'm kinda glad I can feel this strongly about someone, it's comforting, and if anyone is going to break my heart, I'm glad it's her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A big source of anxiety for me at the end of high school was us not being friends when school ended,  but we hung out a lot during the summer, and we text each other weekly for advice and random stuff. She's literally (sometimes)  the only reason I post on my close friends story.  she seems to be very happy with good friends at her college, which is genuinely great to see. 

  
I know that I should try my best to move on from these feelings, that in the long run they'll only hurt me and are probably stopping me from crushing on someone else or moving on entirely. But I don't really consider them a curse or something to ""get rid of"". Beyond any romantic/physical attraction, she's an amazing friend and person, and I want to stay close to her.  Obviously, the passage of time and growth will cause us to drift apart, we'll grow into college and become different people, and I'm probably just getting my heart broken in slow motion through slow, estrangement, but I recognise that as a healthy and natural part of life, so for now, I'm just  looking forward to seeing her again, hearing about college, and getting wasted on the bench outside her house, cause again, if anyone I know is going to break my heart, I'm very glad it'll be her.

I was looking through his collection of sexual photos and videos and noticed he had saved non-sexual photos of her in there.

"Just before 11pm tonight, my 6yo had a medical emergency and I grabbed her and I jumped straight in my car barefoot sobbing and panicking trying to drive her to Alder Hey Children's Hospital. She was screaming in panic/pain and I was in no state to drive cuz I was so upset and I also wasn't fully medicated which can affect my driving but I didn't have time to wait for an ambulance.   

I was only a minute or so into the drive and just as I was thinking that I wish there were some plod floating around, further down the road pulling up to a junction, I saw a police car and omg when I tell you the relief I felt because not only did I feel useless, her condition meant I was on a time limit to get her to hospital before she needed another operation.  I sped up to catch them up, beeping and flashing my lights at them literally nonstop.   

I made a holy show and they just didn't react at all.  For the beeping I kept doing about ten short bursts  then flashed my headlights quickly about 8 times, and then layed on the horn for about 5 seconds, flash my lights, rinse and repeat.  I was clearly tryna speed up to catch them n all. 
Other drivers were looking and stopped to let me through. The lights were just turning red as I went through them. 

The police had  turned right onto and they were quite far ahead (they were definitely doing over the speed limit to get where they were). 
They just carried on driving, albeit slower now I was back in sight. 
Our cars were the only cars on this road at the time.  I was finally catching them up and I was STILL flashing and beeping like a lunatic.

They finally stopped!

The relief was back because the real adults who adult better than my 37yo ass were going to take charge! 

I jumped outta my car grabbed, my little girl and ran barefoot, sobbing (half panic half relief) , holding her out towards the car and shouting for help.

**THEY WAITED UNTIL I HAD ALMOST REACHED THEIR CAR AND THEY SLOWLY DROVE OFF!!!!**

I chased them screaming for them to stop and come back until they got too far away for me to catch up. They turned right at the next junction. 

I had to drive to a friend's 10mins away cuz I knew i couldnt do a motorway right then. My driving was disgraceful cuz I was in no state. I don't know what I would have done if my friend hadn't answered his phone. Nobody else was answering. He was actually in the bath when I called n jumped straight out. 

That little speed demon got us there at the 11th hour. She didn't need an op but came very close to it and as a result had to have an unpleasant and painful procedure. I had to pin her down with nurses and a doctor while she screamed in pain.

If the police had helped us she wouldn't have had to go through that. It would have still been upsetting for her but with no pain. It would have been quite a quick visit n all.

I am (15M) and my best friend (14F) have confessed to each other two times but haven't done much about it. I am in love with this girl, deeply; The ""I wrote poems and sketched her in my art book multiple times"" kind of in love, this is the girl I want to marry one day, the girl I want to spend a good part of my life with. The kind of girl I would stay with even when we're old and out of the ""young hot and wild"" look, I want to be there for everything, from her highest moments to her heartbreaks.  


I will be calling her AUTUMN, (not her real name) 

I transferred schools last year in April because I was being stalked, and on the VERY first day of my new school, I was shocked and smitten. Autumn was across from me in the first class, and I swear to god it was like looking at a living painting. She got her twin brother to fetch me from the halls so I wouldn't have to go through the lonely new kid stage, (we joke about this a lot) and we kind of hit it off from there. Within the first week of our friendship, she started dating this other kid (14NB) I am friends with the other kid (Not a real name, but we'll be calling them MOON) but god I have grown to despise them.  


I don't despise Moon it's just I feel like they don't treat Autumn with enough respect. They've been through their honeymoon stage, but since September there has been no lunch-break cuddles, I love you's in the hallway, or just NONE of that shit. It feels like Moon is actively avoiding Autumn for no reason! She's complained to me that Moon doesn't want to hangout anymore, that they never want to talk, that they never compliment her, that they don't even treat her like a girlfriend anymore. And I'm sitting her thinking, 'I CAN TREAT YOU SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS'  


I do treat her so much better, I compliment Autumn every day, and I MADE A FUCKING SPOTIFY PLAYLIST FOR HER. I give her gifts, I draw her all the time, and every school morning for the past three weeks I have been giving her soda that I got with my OWN MONEY.  
We hang out one on one, go on bike rides. I confessed to her before, SHE'S CONFESSED TO ME BEFORE.  
We've even talked about what it would be like to have a relationship with each other, We've opened up about our pasts but Autumn keeps holding on to this dwindling relationship telling me that she can make it better, that she- with enough work can FIX it. BREAK UP ALREADY BREAK UP ALREADY  
I mean I've hung out and talked with Moon but they are such a dull person and you have to also be dull/depressed or sad (while making it your entire personality) just to understand them. They've started hanging out with Autumn's twin brother more than they've been hanging out with Autumn, that and my cousin (Who we'll be calling Jackie(F14))  


They hang out with Jackie so much, they're practically joined at the hip. It's so bad we've even speculated that Moon wants to date Jackie more than they want to continue dating Autumn. Moon KNOWS and has been TOLD that Autumn is feeling a disconnection and they keep saying they'll fix it, JUST DO KEEP DOING TO THE SAME SHIT. (Also Jackie talks like she wants to date Autumns' twin brother which makes this more confusing)  


I hate the fact they're still dating, and I hate being dragged around like a dog on a leash just waiting for them to break up eventually so I could hopefully be a rebound, but this isn't in a way where I'm pretending to be her friend just to date her. I fucking love being friends with Autumn, she's the funniest person you could ever meet, the second best-case scenario is that I get to keep that friendship even if shit goes down. The worst-case scenario is she keeps dating somebody who doesn't have the time to text her. Best case? We date and keep dating and Move in together and marry and live our best lives by each other sides and then die (hopefully together) and reincarnate to do the same shit in our next lives. Moon doesn't care for her anymore, and She has said I'm more of a boyfriend than they'll ever be. Moon is a good person in their own sense, but if they can't spend 2 minutes a day just to hug Autumn or at least say an I love you, they don't deserve her.  


She deserves so much better, and I want to be that better. I don't care if she's dating somebody, I am deeply in love with my best friend and I hate that.

I (20f) have been dating the most amazing man (24m) and I truly am happy and see a future with him, but I feel like I am being so deceitful and it’s tearing me apart. Like i feel like a bad partner for lying to him. 

Ik it sounds bad, but I have relapsed into my eating disorder that i was originally diagnosed with at 13-14. This has been going on for over a year. It has been so isolating and not even my family knows because i feel ashamed. I took to an online community on Twitter bc there’s many adults on there who are in college like me who are going through the same thing. i have made maybe a few posts on my account, some not even relating to my ED. But it’s comforting seeing the posts from others who are going through the same which is why i have stayed. Idk i know it’s very unhealthy, but it almost makes me feel less embarrassed and like i can at least know im not alone as an adult woman who should be over this already. 

However, the issue is my boyfriend has even asked me if I have a Twitter. My eating disorder account is the only Twitter account so I told him no because obviously I wasn’t going to give him that to casually follow. But I feel awful keeping this secret from him.

"I have never been able to get close to my brother. I’m in college and he’s in highschool, but growing up he was always different from what I had been. He also was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD which was later corrected to a mild autism diagnosis last year. After his diagnosis, his high school asked for him to be homeschool because they “couldn’t accommodate his needs” and I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for him. Soon after, when I was visiting home for a weekend, he ran away. It was traumatizing for my family but after a day he called and we went and brought him home. Since that incident, my parents and I have been much more gentle with him, but sometimes I worry they are too gentle. He has terrible hygiene and all he wants to do is play video games. They let him, because they are afraid if they push him too much he will leave again. I understand that, but also as his sister I feel that it is also a form of neglect to him to just let him get away with terrible hygiene and health. Him and I are very different, I’ve always been very self-sufficient and type A. I am somewhat of a health freak and I get anxious when things aren’t orderly. It’s a harsh contrast but I don’t need for him to be like me, I just wish he would be considerate that I exist in a space with him when we’re home. The thing that most upsets me is that he plays his video games in a dark room that shares a wall with my bedroom. He is in there probably 15 hours a day and I am not exaggerating. When he is on a game with his friends, he talks and screams and laughs and cusses so loudly. It’s so nonstop and frankly drives me nuts. It always has. I can even hear him as I’m typing this.

TV from the living room doesn’t bother me too badly but the constant outbursts and profanities and screaming is just not something I can tolerate. Every night I ask and ask and ask for him to be quiet and he never is. My parents ask and he doesn’t listen. It will have to get to the point of me sobbing in a panic for them to finally take me seriously and sometimes they don’t. I just get so overwhelmed from it, and there’s nowhere I can escape it. I don’t understand why I’m not owed peace in my bedroom especially at night, and when I talk about it with my parents they act like I’m high-maintenance for nagging him to be quiet every night. 

This is far from the first time this has happened, but last night I was so worked up over him continuing to scream on his video game that I just started sobbing crying. I went to my dad in the other room and asked him to please tell my brother to be quiet. My dad starts going on a rant about how I should just stop coming home if I hate my brother to the point I can’t be around him, and “I’m sorry he’s not the perfect popular kid but you should love him anyways” and I don’t even know what he’s talking about. I have never asked my brother to be those things. I have just asked him to respect me. I don’t think my dad understands how hurtful it is to villianize me like he does for asking for something so simple. My mom is more understanding but refuses to stand up for me because she doesn’t want the conflict. 

I feel like my parents forget that I’m not some sort of robot child. I have sensitivities and basic needs. I know that having OCPD doesn’t hold a candle to being on the spectrum but if I have to accommodate so much for my brothers disorder I don’t understand why he is exempt from having to accommodate (aka putting on deodorant and not screaming at midnight) for me.",The way my parents only seem to care about my autistic younger brother makes me feel neglected.,18ndfka,1703130015.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ndfka/the_way_my_parents_only_seem_to_care_about_my/,
"For the past two a half months I’ve(26f) been dealing with unemployment telling me they had overpaid me by $4,014 from the pandemic. During the pandemic I only received the stimulus checks and the 600 additional from Ohio unemployment, issued by the governor. Well, fast forward 3 years and I receive a collections letter. At first I thought it was just some scam but because I’m anxious about money so I called to check into it. After finding out it was real, I started the process of appealing it. Collecting evidence and finally getting a hearing with someone on dec 8th. The call lasted all of 20 minutes so of course I knew that it didn’t go my way. But I held off telling anyone except my parents and my bf. Once I got the final decision saying I had to pay it back I appealed it once again, hoping to some god they would have mercy. During that time my dad told my grandparents(82 m+f) what was going on,(they had no idea because I didn’t want to make them worry about me) and on my next visit they assured me that if anything was to happen they would help me take care of it. I assumed maybe a thousand because they are very generous people. To my surprise today while visiting they asked if there was a decision made and I told them yes. They asked how much and wrote me a check for the entire amount. I don’t know how I can possibly thank them enough. I broke down and cried because while I have a little savings I would have been paying on it for a couple years by myself with an insane interest rate of 14% a year.

"I crossed a boundary about 1 year ago with my friends boyfriend. My friend actually follows this page but I have no clue if they still are on it.

When I crossed a boundary, I didn't even know about, while it was my first time being high. I didn't know i crossed a boundary till November 23, 2023. While I got high on October 3rd 2022.

I crossed these boundaries in October of 2022.
I went to go have a good day with my friend and his boyfriend. (My friend and I have been friends for 5-6 and through that time we talked everyday nonstop, and talked about personal things we would would never tell anybody.) We went out to get sushi and then went back to my friends house (which their boyfriend also lives) we had already planned for this to be my first time to get high. 
This is where I cross boundaries with my friends boyfriend- and for my sake, I hope talking about this isn't crossing another boundary- but let's say I went through stuff while I was high and I see things I don't remember even seeing.
I go home.

I noticed that my friend doesn't text me at all anymore, like yes maybe a couple of instagram reels and a few, but not long, conversations about our lives. But since He doesn't answer me, I text their boyfriend 
'Hey, how's -soandso- doing, just wanted to check up on ya'll, I hope you guys are well.'
I text them this throughout the year (because I never hear from them anymore) 
Their boyfriend texts me back saying everything was okay and that my friend was doing fine. Texting me like everything was good between us. 

I ask this question again in November of 2023 and their boyfriend suddenly drops this load of what I did wrong and why they cut me off for so long and they were sorry if it wasn't the right way to handle the situation. 

I want you to know that I felt so bad I cried till I threw up, I never knew this and to know I hurt my dearest friends killed me. I apologized and talked  about how I was so sorry and addressed each situation as best I could. But after 24hrs of thinking about it and getting the opinions of others I started to get angry. 

I want another opinion, am I right to be angry?
Angry about missing out of a friendship because they didn't want to bring up boundaries?
I don't think I can even be friends with my closest friend ever again after this. 

I also just want two questions answered-
Did you defend me, at least care about me at all to not cut me off for more than a year?

"My family lives on a homestead that has chickens and goats. My brother and I are in charge of waking up in the morning and taking care of them. Usually we wake up about 8:30-9:00 a.m. on weekends and breaks. However, within the past week, my mom has been telling us to wake up earlier at 8:00 a.m and is very strict about it. 

There's something my brother and I created called 'sibling meetings' which is where we can talk freely and vent to each other about mostly our parents. Me and him basically talked about how sudden the change was and how mom expected us to conform to it overnight. We did talk about other things she's done which I won't get into. 

Then mom suddenly got mean. She wouldn't look at us anymore. She started doing the chores. And while usually a parent doing our normal chores is a kind gesture, this time it wasn't. She confronted us, saying that she wanted us at eight to do chores because '8:30-9:00 a.m was too late and I never said anything for four years because I was being nice'. Also, she said that she wanted us punctual because one day we'd have a job and college classes to go to. Which, we are never late to school, so I still don't understand why she enforced it the way she did. 

Then came the bombshell. She confessed she eavesdropped on our conversation and didn't like what we said. She said it made her upset and caused her to take our chores away. My brother said that we never complained about the chores, it was the time, but she didn't listen. 

What was so  painful for me was that a private conversation where I could let out all my stress and anger about home life was now stolen from me. My brother was the perfect person to talk to about home life: he understood and saw everything I saw. Having someone to relate to your situation is so relieving and validating. But now I can't have it anymore. 

Throughout the entire past year, there has been nothing but my mother proving herself to be one of the worst outcomes of the human race and only my brother truly understood. Those meetings helped me feel less alone in this predicament. And now it's gone. How can I feel comfortable in my own house when there might be my mom on the other side of the door?

I feel like all the privacy I once had is gone. And what's worse is that mom is going about her day as if nothing ever happened. That what she did and what she made her children feel like was perfectly okay. 

I just...don't feel safe in my house anymore. I don't feel like this is my home. I'm actually waiting for school to start because I want to get away from here. I have a strong feeling Christmas won't be as warm as it used to. I want to take a deep breath, but it's not easy being in a house that's slowly suffocating you.

"So much has happened this year, and especially over the last 6 months.

Some of it's been good:  
  
I graduated high school, started a foundation to help autism centers around the state I live in, got a 4.0 GPA in my first semester of college, became part of a friend group that accepts me, met new people, got an internship in NASCAR, got a car, and improved my guitar playing.  
  
Some of it's been a conglomeration of ""What in the actual fuck?""  
  
My car got hit Saturday night after my family's Christmas gathering, I spent $500 to go see someone I hadn't seen since middle school, which was fine until they canceled our breakfast plans on the morning I was heading back to campus and gave me a 👍 when I said I made it back safely - haven't spoken to them in two months - the girl that was my first kiss blocked me after getting back with her toxic ex, another one of my friends used me to get over their ex when in March I said I liked her, my paternal grandmother's health is declining, lost my maternal grandmother in February, and the girl who posted love songs on Instagram that were directed at me and wanted to date me just blocked me on everything after not talking for 3 days. When we called last week everything was fine.  
  
I just don't fucking get it. How can everything be going so well and then the next second it all seems to go to shit? Why do people not mean what they say? Why do we treat others as if they have machine hearts? I know it could be worse, but not being able to release all the built-up emotion from having your heart pulled and played with isn't enjoyable.

"This is a throwaway account since I don't want this story connected to my main reddit account.

So this starts when I was about 7 or 8 years old, I can't fully remember. It's part of the issue when it comes to talking about all of this. But when I was around that age, my biological father sexually assulted me. While I don't fully remember when and all of what happened, I remember a few details pretty clearly and remember it happening a handful of times until I was around 10.

Obviously, I sorta suppressed that it happened. For years, I told myself it wasn't a big deal or that it didn't actually happen. I distinctly remember being told about private parts and ""bad touch"" in school and thinking ""That doesn't actually apply to that. He is my dad, he wouldn't actually be hurting me.""

However, when I was 12, I was sorta forced to start processing these experiences and memories. My father picked me and my sibling up from school one day. But when we got home, there was an unfamiliar black sedan parked in our driveway. A man climbed out of the vehicle once we parked and started going into the house. My sibling and I were told to go inside. However, both of us could tell something was up. After a while, my father was escorted by the man into our family room where we were waiting. He hugged us both and told us goodbye and that he was always going to love us.

I still loved my father at that moment and it made me confused and I started crying. Then the man, who turned out to be a detective with our local police department, took my father away. It wasn't until later that evening after my mom got home that we learned everything. My father was arrested for SA of a minor after another victim came forward to a therapist.

Unsurprisingly, this blew my family up and we had a rough time after he was arrested. My paternal grandfather got my father out on bail, so my mom took my sibling and I out of town to stay with some friends until the locks at home and everything could be changed. In that time, we were also brought to this organization that supported domestic violence and abuse victims and had to give statements to the police. There were only two things I remember from that statement. One was spotting a camera in the corner of the room the detective was talking to me in. Two was that I was asked a question like ""Did your father hurt or touch you in any inappropriate way?"" and I lied in response.

Ever since the night he was arrested, all these suppressed memories bubbled to the surface. After everything I learned, I knew that all of that couldn't have been a figment of my imagination. They were not false memories. But even knowing that, I also still cared about my father at that point. I also cared about my mom and how heartbroken and furious she already was. In my mind, my father was already facing consequences with one person coming forward. Him and my family didn't need more drama and heartbreak with another confession. 

So at 12 years old, I knowingly lied to the detective and told him ""No. My father never did any of that to me."" And that was that. The only person I have ever told the truth to is my current partner. I haven't even told a therapist the truth as that is how my father originally got arrested and I am not keen on bringing up another whole legal and familial debacle.

I haven't seen my biological father since he was arrested. As I am the youngest in my family, I was left out of any investigation or legal drama beyond that initial statement. So after that, I was just left to continue living my life and trying to support my mom and my sibling emotionally and physically around the house. For my extended paternal family, most of them ended up taking my father's side and supporting him. They would say things like ""He is family"" or ""Blood is thicker than water"" to convince my sibling and I to forgive him. Especially since he ""didn't do anything to us."" The main ones that supported my mom and our family was my Grandma, who I still talk to, and my Uncle.

The rest of the family backed off after a few years, especially as my sibling and I pulled away from them. Eventually, my mom remarried to my stepdad and we moved away from the area. Overall, my life has gotten much better since then. I got a degree, discovered more of my sexuality and gender (the answer is not straight and cis), been working on my mental health, and met an amazing person who I am lucky to call my partner.

Occasionally on Christmas or my Birthday, I would receive a card from my father and my grandfather, but they slowly died off as I grew into an adult. I think the last time my father mailed anything to me was a year or two ago. While a part of me is slightly upset my father and that side of my family stopped sending stuff, I'm generally glad. Everytime I got something it sent me into a weird emotional state. This man and these people were my family for years growing up. I still have fond memories from my childhood that feature these individuals. But I also have grown to never forgive them. It also brings up the weird feelings I have with keeping my own sexual trauma a secret.

All these thoughts and feelings were brought back recently because just yesterday, I received a text message from the area code I used to live in. I have most of the people from my old town that I would want to contact already saved so I was wary. One search of the number confirmed my suspicions and showed it was my grandfather. The text message was an invitation to the family Christmas celebration this weekend. I haven't been invited or received a Christmas card from them in years, so I don't really understand why it is coming now.

At first, I thought it was a mistake. So I sent a general and very polite reply as if it was a stranger who texted the wrong number (which at this point he sorta is). I mentioned I didn't live in the area anymore and I would also not even be near the area over the weekend (which is especially true since I am supposed to be on an airplane at the time of the celebration). However, in the response, he asked if this was [INSERT MY NAME].

That means the invitation was supposed to go to me and he was asking if I could show up. Part of me wanted to just ignore it from there. But as I was commuting to work, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Idk what I was fully thinking when I replied, but eventually I typed out a reply basically stating ""Unless the person you are looking for is a Queer, Nonbinary Adult who currently doesn't want to think about that town anymore, then you have the wrong number"" before I blocked the number.

It felt like finally bringing an axe down on the root that is gluing me to the ground and holding me back from continuing to explore and grow in my life. While part of me is anxious about what I just did, the freeing feeling of being able to finally just cut that family and life off seems to be worth it.

"Okay, so I'm not sure if posting this would break TOS but I've just gotta get this out there.

So, this happened when I was about to turn 16. I was messing around on Omegle while I was home alone. I was just hanging around and talking to people about anime and stuff until I came across this guy, I'll just call him A. So I was having a nice conversation with him, and he asked to see my chest. Now, I'm rather small and if I'm being perfectly honest, I'm skinny. I hate the fact I'm skinny, I don't like my body, and especially not my chest.

So when he asked to see it, I was a little shocked. I asked why, and he basically started explaining how nice my breasts are (despite not being able to see them too well under a baggy shirt). I genuinely didn't know how to feel about the various compliments I was getting about the one part of my body I've always hated.

Now, here comes a part of the story I'm not really proud of and why I can't tell anyone close to me. A continued asking to see my chest before asking to see me in a tank top. I could tell A was rather close to my age, and for some reason, I wasn't completely uncomfortable with the idea of showing him. I don't know why, I just wasn't. I ended up showing him my chest in the process and hearing the pure... excitement? Passion? Desire? I don't know the word, but whatever was in his voice when he saw something I had come to hate about myself, it made me feel good. I was embarrassed, but it felt good knowing someone could get so excited about my body when I never have.

I still haven't told anyone, at least, not the full truth. I've told bits and pieces, like how A was rather polite and was surprisingly understanding of the fact I still had things to do around the house and that me going on Omegle was just supposed to be a quick break before I went back to what I was doing. I'm not sure how to end this because this is ending abruptly, but that's also how the video on Omegle ended. So I guess if anything, it's rather fitting.

A few months ago we had some family staying with us, I couldn’t go into my normal bathroom to take a shower and get ready so I was waiting to get in theirs.

And so i’m like half asleep waiting for the bathroom and I decide to lie down on the open edge of the bed. And after a while he turns over in his sleep and from behind slips his hand into the front of my underwear, or tries to, I quickly rip his hand off and jump up. And he’s still asleep and I leave.

"I hate my family. I’m not trying to be ungrateful or anything, I’m certainly aware that my family and life could be a lot worse, I just… I don’t like them. 

My mom and dad divorced when I was 9, that was really the start of my problems, because before that I feel like my life, particularly my health and family life with aunts and uncles was way better. I mean obviously before that I saw cracks forming, like when I would be woken up by shouting at 3 a.m. when my dad got back from wherever he was, he says the bar but I’m pretty sure he was cheating on my mom. Things of that nature. After she got divorced there was suddenly this shift in how my life was. I felt a gaze from family members on my mom’s side, like there was something wrong with me. I was immediately given this pressure from my aunts and uncles of supporting my mom and helping her through this tough time, even though I was only 9. What was I supposed to do? 

I think that was the first time I felt anxiety, stress, responsibility, things that have burdened me since then. I got really fat after that, I was already a little chubby, not overweight, just a little chubby, but after the divorce it got real bad, I think I was drowning my sorrows in food. That habit and the consequences of that have also carried on to this day, I’m obese, still very mobile and athletic for my weight, probably genetics, but the scale is pretty bad, same with the looks. Y’see, my family is very conscious about looks. My cousins are all shredded, their parents are fit. I am the opposite, and I think that has contributed to the gaze I feel from them. Oh, not to mention I look very similar to my dad. We have a rare hair color and are much lighter in skin tone than my mom’s middle eastern side of the family, so I probably remind them of him, someone they all hate. 

After the divorce it felt like all the love and warmth I felt from her side of the family vanished. I no longer had the fatherly relationships with my uncles, and my aunts seemed more distant. I’ve always lacked a father figure, my dad was and still is absent, but losing them hurt probably even more.

I got really self conscious afterwards. Got separation anxiety from my mom and developed horrible social anxiety as well, I felt like everybody was judging me. I lost a lot of friends and sheltered myself in the basement of my grandmas house that we’ve lived in since the divorce. I think we’re nearing on a decade since it happened. 

Oh my mom got really angry afterwards to, she would always be mad at me for something, so we fought all the time. She’s gotten softer in recent years and I’ve learned to just do my best to go along with whatever she says so fights don’t happen but I think my younger brother and sister (I’m the oldest) will always look at me as sort of a bad guy who always fought with mom. Since I thought everyone was out to get me I shut myself off, and it took me a long time to get rid of that attitude and aura of depression.

I just want to be happy. I want to wake up and go to bed happy. I want to be fit. I just want people to like me.

I want a relationship with my uncles and aunts again. I want to be loved.

My mom says she loves me, and I’m pretty sure she does. She does a lot for me and always takes care of my needs, I don’t want her to think that what she does isn’t enough. But she also forgets a lot of what I ask her, like not to air out all my issues, whether that be medical, grade wise, mood wise, social life wise, etc, to everyone in a 100 yard radius. I don’t need everyone in my house, that being my siblings and my grandma and aunt, to know that I got a C. I don’t need them to hear her yell at me for not having a job (trust me, I’ve tried, but nobody wants to hire a college student that is normally 5 hours away just because they are home for less then 4 weeks on break, sorry to break it to you). She can and should talk to me about those things in private, and I’ve mentioned it a million times. 

Oh and my aunt and grandma that we live with always have something comment to make too. “Why don’t you have a girlfriend yet?” “why are you laying on the couch?’ “Why are you tired, you didn’t do anything today?” The list of their complaints go on.

I’m sorry to rant, I don’t really know if anybody is actually going to read this but I just needed to vent. I love my life, but I hate my life. I give so much love to people around me.

My uncle gave me some of his THC gummies he got from a hemp store a while back, and being crazy me I cut one in half and took one last night. This is not the first time I've taken them, I took them once before and I didn't like it, but I figured I would give it just one more try because maybe I just wasn't being fair.

But this time it was so much worse. It was the worst feeling I think I've felt in a very long time. As soon as the THC kicked in, I felt like I was in a paralyzed shell that was my own skin and I couldn't do anything. I felt like I was in sleep paralysis. It wasn't enjoyable in the slightest, I couldn't relax at all and I couldn't think of a way to help me feel better. Sitting, walking, laying, none of it did a damn thing. 

I felt like I was going to die. I felt paralyzed and that I couldn't think clearly at all; there was nothing I could use to calm down. I thought that the trip was going to kill me. My heart was racing and I thought it was going to explode and I couldn't do anything about it. I had a panic attack during the trip and it felt like it was going to last forever.

TW: Mentions of depression, ending of life

I don't know how to change or what to do. I just turned 22 and am now realizing why my life is different than other peoples: I am an asshole. I always have been. I am depressed, irritable, and angry. Not always and at the same time but most of the time.

I have always had an anger issue, specifically with video games. I've destroyed countless controllers, mice, keyboards, and monitors over the years. I haven't in quite a while due to my lack of interest in gaming in general. I also can have issues with other people, having flown into a rage on one or two occasions. This isn't common because I don't typically interact with others outside of a few coworkers and my two friends.

An example from this evening: I was driving home from work and a fast car flew through a roundabout in front of me, clearly speeding. It angered me for no reason. I thought that if I saw him, I would confront him and be prepared to fight. This is irrational and pointless. I thought about this for 20 minutes. No idea why.

An example from a few years ago: I had a coworker who expressed interest in me. I was semi-interested in them also but I don't date. Anyway, I hadn't heard from her in a day or two and assumed that she was no longer interested. She came by where I work as a customer and was chatting with another coworker. I was furious, and screamed and threw tools around because of this. Seeing her talking to him made me so angry and disgusted that I left work.

Besides the anger problem, I am not interested in friends or relationships. Someone mentioned that I could be asexual but I'm not sure. No one wants to date an asshole anyway. The last time I had any feelings for someone was at least 5 years ago.

Depression has been a part of me since high school. I planned on taking my life twice in the past few years, with a plan both times. I have talked to a few therapists but none of them know of the anger issues. The depression and the anger are a dangerous combination but I don't know what to do. 

Pardon the ranting but I have never written down my thoughts in this manner. My fear is that I will act on some of my thoughts out of momentary anger and ruin my life. I don't really know how to overcome this, or if I can. I've been this way for many years.

"This’ll be rather short, TW for mention of SA

I, 18F, have a brother, 23M who I lived with up until he enlisted about three years ago. We’ve never had a good relationship, mostly because we were never allowed to be together in the same room. That’s because when I was five he SA’d me. I don’t remember the context or what exactly happened, all I remember is being found in his bed with no clothes on and my parents being upset (I was extremely confused). My brother apparsntly confessed to the whole thing but no one ever talked to me about what happened so to this day I’m in the dark. I have other memories from when I was five, so I have to assume the memory is just repressed. Since then I was never allowed to be in his room, and grew up very emotionally isolated from him. Fast forward, I constantly feel the need for his attention. He never says that he loves me or shows any interest in me as a person. I constantly lie to make myself sound cooler and randomly get into conversations with him and try to share things I like with him, but he constantly shuts me down. My parents say he wants to have a relationship with me but he doesn’t seem interested. All of my friends say that his lack of interest is a blessing in disguise, but honestly I don’t agree. Is it wrong that I simply don’t care what he did when I was younger? Is it wrong I’m so desperate for his affection, is that some weird trauma response? My therapist bailed just in time for the holidays so I’m just kind of overwhelmed by his presence with no one to talk to","I wish my brother was more interested in me, but my friends think I should hate him.",18ncfq8,1703126867.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ncfq8/i_wish_my_brother_was_more_interested_in_me_but/,

"I (24NB) have been in a commited relationship with a girl, let’s call her P(24F), for over four years. We met each other at very tough times in our lives and we really helped each other getting better. P is my first romantic relationship, first person I had sex with too.
We are both through some big changes in our lives, career-wise and I recently moved out from the big city we lived in. We are know in an LDR, but not THAT long distance (it’s 1-&gt;3h train/bus ride). We used to live together, now i have my own appartement and she lives with her parents. We see each other twice a month.

I love P and our relationship, I really believe that it’s something to be proud of. We don’t come from families that necessarily knew how to love well, and we’ve been really good to each other.

But here is the problem : I often feel like I’ve been missing out on dating. It has created problems in our relationship, bc I do feel trapped sometimes. P never really made me feel fluttered or any kind of butterflies. It was more of a slowly falling in love thing.
And when I see my friends who get to fall in love and have really passionate relationships, I feel jealous.

About the other girl, let’s call her G(24F). I met her maybe 2 and a half years ago at a house party. We clicked right away. 
P is very secular, she likes to stay home and play video games, she can easily fall into a routine and aspires to a quiet life. 
On the other hand, G cannot stay in one place, she moves around a lot, has tons of hobbies and skills, is very rebellious.
You could say that P is booksmart and G is streetsmart.
G and I became quite close in the last year and grew into great close friends, which makes me really happy. I am incredibly attracted to her.
When I’m in the same room as her, my eyes are glued to her. I can’t explain it, I don’t think it’s sexual I just long to be near her.
When I talk to her I get brainfog and I feel all giggly and stupid. 
I never feel like that with my girlfriend.

It’s so weird bc we are nowhere near compatible in terms of lifestyle or goals but I don’t really want to date her I just feel this overwhelming attraction to her.

Im scared that it means that Im getting bored in my relationship, and I think that it’s true. I love P, but I’m not really attracted to her in that magnetic sense. And I’m scared that I might never get to kiss someone else ever. That I might never indulge in that kind of attraction that i can feel for other people.

"This feels so petty to be this upset about but I am gutted and can’t stop crying ever since I left my mom’s house this afternoon. My dad died on Friday 12/15/23 (5 days ago) after an 8 year long battle with lymphoma. My brother was deployed but was able to get home in time to see my dad before he passed, and truthfully has been carrying out mom through this process. We are all of course devastated by my dad’s passing and have been dealing with it our own ways. My brother is staying with my mom until the end of the month, while I stay at my apartment about a half hour away, and have been over to their house for 6-12 hours every day for the past two weeks. 
For context, my brother is a doctor, in the military, has a nice big house, a beautiful wife and two kids. I’m a college drop out, I don’t want kids, and am a hotel maid. So obviously I can tend to be insecure about my standing in life and his, it feels sometimes like he’s doing better than me in literally every way. Up until now, our parents never ever made me feel like my brother was the favorite, they never compared us growing up and were truly incredible parents that never made either of us feel like it was a competition between us. Until now. 
This afternoon my husband and I were over at her house helping clean up and spending some time with my mom and brother. Out of nowhere my mom starts talking about how mothers have a special bond with their sons (she’s never said anything like this before) and my brother goes “so it finally comes out that I’m your favorite?” And my mom confirmed. Basically saying that she felt more of a bond with him, and that I had more of a bond with my dad. I never felt this way before. I always felt equally close to and loved by my mom and dad, but now that he’s gone my mom feels the need to say that she has had a favorite all along.

"I'm in my early 20s, and am living with my mom and my stepdad at the moment. I used to spend time with my dad until I started hating him when my mom kept telling me that he was a bad man and we've basically gone no contact ever since. We text once in awhile, but they're mostly check in conversations and nothing much.

Sometimes I would look him up online and see if I could find him but to no avail, I know I had his number and could always text but I didn't want to.

My mom recently told me he worked in a company that I knew of and I was surprised that I never knew. Found him on LinkedIn and requested to connect. I don't even know why I did it, or why I was so interested to find him. Dad texts me on LinkedIn and asked for a lunch today...today?! My boyfriend thought I was doing all this to reconnect and maybe meet up with him but that wasn't even my intention at all, I just wanted to have a quick ""haha i didnt know you worked there!"" convo and leave it at that.

I told my mom about it, she explained that he likes taking money from people without returning it and his character is generally just bad..but she said she understood that it's my own father and if I want to meet him that's fine as long as I don't talk about them (my mom, siblings, stepdad, our lives).To be honest, I have an urge to meet him, I know it might upset people in my family, and personally I'm not ready to even though I want to.

"Hi, I like to go by as Alysa on the net. I am a 34 woman. After 21 years, I finally got professional help. I am suffering PTSD. I know others have it worse than I do but, I want to knowledge that now.

First off, please for give me. I might go around in circles.

At this time, I am the oldest, 2nd was my brother and than my little sister.

I grew up as a Conservative Christian. My mother and father divorced when I was 9. My mother slept around while my father was working. He was an airforce man. Sometimes he will be in the missiles fields for 2 weeks and she would bring men home.

I got to the point of understanding what sex was at the age of 6 and knew only mommy's and daddy's were allowed to do it. I did told my father but he stayed with her to keep the family together.

Then a friend started to come. Month later my mother found out she was pregnant. She had him and few months later coming from school, she wasn't home, but my father and my little sister was waiting for my brother and I. Dad explained that both mommy and daddy were going to get a divorce. At the time, I didn't understand why.

Saddly she ended taking my sister and I, leaving my brother with our father. I don't remember how or went he left the state. But mom flew us to go see our grandparents, daddy's was living in the same state our grandparents lived.

On morning, I woken up and mom, my sister, and new brother was gone. She left me there with my grandmother. My guess is she wanted to lighten the load and start her new life with her new husband. Just without my brother and I.

But I got to visit my father every other weekend and one day, got to meet my future step mom and future step sisters. My father was so happy.

Couple years later, my mother wanted me back, but not my brother. I was flown back to her and my sister didn't even know she had an older sister.

Mom was... odd. She would be happy one moment and than snap at you for no reasons. She would wake me up in the middle of the night asking me if her husband and I been having sex.

I know!

She made me sleep on the couch for 3 years to make sure no one was coming into the house to have sex with her husband.

She would make mean comments of things that my siblings and I started to get into.

Than it happen again. I was left with my grandparents but my father didn't know. She took my brother from my father and I wasn't allow to see him.

Year later I was flown back. I finally got to talk to my father and he asked me why I didn't see him? I said I wasn't allowed.

I can hear my father's heart being broken.

And with my mother... It was a rinse and repeat. She would wake me up during the night, make me sleep on the couch, and now staying up past 1am. They were always fighting. Yelling and causing at eachother, while I am taking care of my siblings or she would pull me into the fight for no reason.

After a while, we started to go to church every Sunday. God became everything. Our books. Tv. Conversation. My brother and I were forbidden to watch Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z because it was the devils work.

They started to make me see a therapist and put me on happy pills once I started to hit purity. I was a rack and the pills wasn't helping. They gave me a bigger dosage prescription which made it worse.

I started to get into trouble after talking to the therapist. Everything was taken away from me. Games. Movies. Book. And they found my manga collection. I was left with a fucking bible... guess who had to read it over and over. 

Now when someone throws a bible verse at me, I will counter attack with one too. My favorite verse is Matthew 6.

At the age of 14, I realized I was flirting with both genders. I had a secret girlfriend that I still talk to once in a while. I didn't know the word for liking both genders were. The only one I knew was the word gay or the f slur.

I knew this was seriously wrong with my parents. And I kept it as a secret. I didn't trust my mother or step dad. I didn't come out untill I was 30. My father was supportive but my mother was iffy about it.

At a point I had to say goodbye to most of my friends. One of them, her name is Cassandra Diaz. Reason why I put her name on here, I been looking for her. She move from North Dakota to Arizona. Her parents were super strict too. Both of our mothers forbidden for us to handout. We found ways to see eachother secretly.

Then we had to move. We moved to our step dad's father's house. He lived above a nut case woman and the school was awful. The special education teacher was an old bitch and discouraged me from drawing and told me that I ""need to study and stop drawing trash"".

I started to hang out with the wrong people and I didn't even know. This girl convinced me to spend the night and we snuck out of her house to meet us with some other guys. Men that were in their 20s. They could tell I wasn't okay with the situation I was in take us back to her place.

While all this was going on, my step-dad's father was grooming me. He would walk in while I was dressing or taking a shower. Told me that I deserved better.

In the middle of the night, he sneak into the room my siblings and I was sleeping in, while my mother and her husband slept to the room that was attached to our.

This man touched me and forced me to kiss him! I tried to fight him back. The door to the room my mom was in and opened up. He covered my mouth and told me to keep my mouth shut. He acted like we were talking. After he left and went to them and told them what happened.

Guess who didn't go to jail? But that is okay now. Karma bit him in the ass. Literally! He passed away from colon cancer couple years ago. Mom told me. I told her I don't feel sorry for him because what he did to me. She used the fucking excuse that he was old and didn't  know better. She told me to let it go or I am never going to heave. I don't care! I rather burn in hell. This is the same woman take told me not to say anything or not to tell my father. Or else.

One day in school, I got called to the school office. There was a woman there to pick me up. I told them I didn't know her. They had to called my mother to clarify that she was going to bring me home. The lady did gave me some praise to not go with strangers.

We arrived. Her husband was getting arrested not his father. Years later I found out that they had a violent fight. He ended up choking her. Or so she says.

Mom and my siblings has to stay in this shelter called the Rainbow House. We had to wait for a week for someone to come get us. My grandmother sent my drunken uncle and his wife to get us.

There is more to this. I need a break. I'll make a part 2 soon or later. Depends...

"I work in construction in Manhattan as an Ironworker.. basically modern day slavery, a lot harder but you have an option of what you want to eat for lunch. At the end of the day I was asked to work overtime and accepted. One of my coworkers had sour patch weed edibles, I’ve had my fair share of experiences with marijuana drinking and hallucinogens. Always been able to handle myself. Bit the head off of this gummy bear in the sub cellar basement of one of the biggest skyscrapers in nyc today. 45 minutes into it I was worthless, forgot how to work lost most of my motor skills. Billy g rown men in yellow and hard hard with experience in the industry longer then I’ve been alive casually conversating around me. I scurried out of the area we were working and ended up getting lost in the maze of dull concrete walls. Realizing I’m lost now thru my mind for a whirl. At this point my body went into shock, my mouth stop producing saliva, completely dried out. Minutes later I puked and the width of the projectile was ear to ear. Biggest throw up pile probably ever produced by a human. No water in sight , basically hallucinating at this point looking for a way out . I end up making it up a flight of stairs to the entrance of the building . No strength and bury myself behind mounds of equipment and wooden crates. Closed my eyes and visioned all my life experiences , friends who were close to me, family holidays, childhood moments as if it was a dream in fast forward. Everything synchronized in perfect order, from childhood to adulthood. Split moments slide showing staying in the exact order of a bunch of my experiences. At this point drowning in regret of thinking I should’ve been more and i was the only one to blame for putting myself in this situation.

"I've temporarily moved in with my in-laws and they have a dog who they refuse to train. He basically runs the house, and I've tried to bite my tongue because as long as he's not being hurt, (in fact they treat him like he's their baby) I'd rather not kick up a fuss. Although, I did start training him in secret to sit and stay because he ran out the house one day and almost got hit by a car and wouldn't listen to anyone telling him to stop. 

But one problem is that he has really bad separation anxiety. They're completely unwilling to train him or anything to help him get over it. They say dogs should just be dogs. 

Usually they will take him with them wherever they go, even if he isn't necessarily allowed but some of the places they go to regularly have put their foot down. Often it's because they try to shrug it off because they're a sweet elderly couple, but they let him do what he wants on other people's premises including snatching food and toileting on products so they had to be firm so he's left at home more often than he used to be. When they got him, he had mild anxiety that would start to show after an hour of being without them but they've pandered to the anxiety so much that now he can't be without them at all without exhibiting signs. I know this because they got him shortly after I started dating my partner and I stayed with them every weekend for a period. 

The anxiety behaviour only occurs when they leave the house, so even if I stay home, or my parter or BIL the dog is distressed. They don't know how to handle the repercussions of this and will make amateur mistakes like scolding him for toileting where he shouldn't or making a huge fuss when they come home and when they leave. This just makes him more stressed and more anxious about them leaving for long periods because to a dog, this feels like a massive deal, and he'll associate them coming home after hours with being scolded. 

I feel so bad for him. It feels cruel to put him through this instead of making life more bearable for him, but I have no control. They need to activately partake in this kind of anxiety training and they won't. My family have always had dogs and we've always trained them. We've had dogs that have been abused pretty badly in the past that we always managed to rescue and train until they were healthy and happy.

Fuck I could go on forever about things. Always said I love you first if I didn’t say it didn’t hear it same with I miss you. Selfish sexually, like never did any work. Comments on my fucking sweat. So fucking selfish sexually which is a big deal considering what guy doesn’t want to be wanted sexually especially after all the hard work I’ve done to feel I deserve it. And I wasn’t demanding I ask for every experience once I’ve never tried it and she hasn’t tried anything , no car sex no tying up, no make out with sex like tf is that shit. She kissed with her eyes open for awhile too. Again I’d bring the things but it was not often at all. MASSAGES!! I’d ask her to massage around my scapula not even full back (I’ve managed to wing both of them) I’d ask that countless times it’s a simple gesture and rarely fucking got one she could ask once and I got the oil, why?! Because I loved this selfish fuckwad.
 Now I was considerate of she’s a year younger has her own weight insecurities which again I would always try to encourage her to do things with me and she never would be willing. We go to the beach and she cannot swim I offer to teach her in the pool she makes any excuse to do nothing.
We had each others location because I like to take trips and hike so like to have people that can put together my whereabouts if anything happens, she sent hers and said we could leave them on. Fine with me I want to love one person and have my experiences with that person, I’m not against hooking up with a lot of people I will if that’s all I’m finding. I do pride myself on not being with a lot of people. I bring that up because she really would go to work and go home and be tired all day.never had anything relevant to talk about pertaining to her life, my life or our life.

"I (29F) have been royally screwed over by my family. I feel like a used dishrag.  
I'll start off with the fact that I was raised by my aunt and grandmother in life. I have lived at an estate (as in one hell of a massive house and property) for the past 20 years taking care of them and their property and the cows they own on a separate property. I've also got some horses that I own and keep there for pleasure riding that I absolutely love.  
Due to the nature/size of the property (160 acres of land), I have a very active and busy lifestyle. I do all the landscaping, gardening, and general TLC for the property. When I was a teen I had an overnight job I would do, then I would go to school, and then come home and do some work before going to bed. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. I invested a lot of time and effort into this property without pay, and when I turned 25 my gran offered to pay me a bit on the side to help me out. In exchange I quit my overnight job and eventually quit school (for other reasons) and became a full live in nurse. Both are diabetics with serious health concerns. This worked well since Covid hit shortly after.  
In a passing comment my gran said, I suddenly started to wonder what would happen after if they were to both suddenly pass away. My aunt and gran are 50/50 on the property, they also own a lot of assets and own several houses in the area. However my aunt doesn't have a will, and my grandmother has recently told me that, upon her passing, everything would go towards her son. My father.  
Now you'd think that might be good, except my father is a vindictive, egotistical narcissist who would send my horses and cattle to slaughter just to piss me off. He wouldn't give two fucks if I died except to get sympathy from anyone that would listen. The same man cusses his mom (gran) out and treats her like garbage all the time, and it all goes to him.  
So needless to say, I asked ""what about me?"" And her response was ""I guess you have to beg your father for it.""  
It won't happen. I would get down on my knees if I thought there was a chance to do anything, but there isn't. So I'm fucked. I don't have the money to move out, I don't have a means to keep my animals and will have to sell them. I won't have a home anymore.  
When I got angry at her, she shrugged it off and said ""If your aunt dies first, I'll just sell it all then, so you won't have to worry."" Then didn't understand why I was full blown crying. Why wouldn't you put the person who has literally been taking care of your lives into your will? What have I been doing with my life up to this point then? I invested financially and in time on this property and the problem is they were projects paid with their cards and their accounts. I just handed the cash and they gave me a credit card. I did this with the expectation it would be mine someday and I needed to invest in my home. But no, it's not mine. It will never be mine.   
I've told this to my aunt, and she has become a hollow shell of the vibrant woman she used to be. She would've been on my side, but she doesn't care anymore and keeps saying ""well then there's a reason to keep me alive.""  
It hurts to think that they think so little of me. The fact that I was just expected to be sent off on my merry way. I could understand if my father got the other houses, the investments, hell I'd give him all the money in my savings if it meant keeping my home. But it won't matter. I'm royally fucked and need to get out of here, but at the same time I don't want to abandon them. So I guess I save up money for as long as I can, so that when the time comes I can go somewhere. But I've never felt more betrayed than right now, I feel so used and it sucks. I'm at a loss for where to go from here now. 

I'm not looking for advice, I just needed a good vent because IDK what I'm going to do. 

TLDR: I was raised by my aunt and gran on their massive property, which turned into me being a live-in nurse for them when they got sick. They own 50/50 but my aunt doesnt have a will. Gran's will gives everything to my vindictive father who hates me. I will essentially be homeless when they die and should leave to start a new life but can't bring it in me to abandon them still because I love my home.

"Twice this week I've had two crotchety old men shout at me to ""Get that dirty fucking animal out of here"".

I'm not asking anyone to like dogs.  We don't deserve their hatred or harassment.

The first was walking into my apartment building.  We crossed paths in front of Crotchety Geezer #1.  My service dog wasn't wearing his vest because we'd simply gone outside for him to do his business.  So when we came inside he took a step or two towards the man to sniff the bucket he was carrying.

CG#2 was a resident at the care home my grandmother lives in.  We'd decided to pop in to visit my grandmother for a couple of minutes to drop off a little Christmas present.  Their Bingo game was about to start, so we were heading out when he told me to ""Get that fucking thing out of here"".  I hadn't even noticed him until he started to angrily shout at me.  We were already on our way towards the exit.  He was on the opposite side of the table from where we were, we weren't even close to encroaching on his space.  If I had a spray bottle I would have loved to squirt him in the face like you'd deter a cat from scratching your furniture.

A year or so ago CG#1's wife mumbled ""stupid dog"" as I passed her in the laundry room.  She quickly stopped when I stopped and stared at her, then quickly back tracked and said how much she loved dogs.

My service dog is a standard poodle, he sheds less than I do.  He's bathed and groomed regularly in case we need to go into a hospital, restaurant, or something.  He's too cute for his own good, and he's got way more friends than I do.

He's a psychiatric service dog.  I suffer from chronic pain and was also diagnosed with a Schizoid Personality Disorder a few years ago (basically mild autism symptom), so he helps me keep on a schedule.  He forces me to get up and get outside, sometimes taking him outside is the only fresh air I get in a day.  He reminds me to take my medications, and he helps keep me calm and relaxed when I have to go to the store.  Could I survive without him, certainly, but my quality of life is much greater with him.

If we encounter someone afraid of dogs I will shorten my leash a little.  A couple of my neighbours are afraid of dogs, if I spot them I'll give them a little extra berth or wait in an alcove until they pass.  But even those who are afraid are polite.

What gives Crotchety Old Men the confidence to demand a dog be removed from their mere presence?  They can hate dogs all they want, I just don't care about their issues.","If You Can't Say Anything Nice, Don't Say Anything At All: Service Dog Edition",18na4cw,1703119706.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18na4cw/if_you_cant_say_anything_nice_dont_say_anything/,
"I've been feeling really lonely lately and the fact that I'm still a virgin gets me down bad. I just wish I was a normal person. I work part time at the mall and it's so hard seeing happy couples everywhere and hear my co-workers talk about their relationships. I've been crying every night now and my mum has noticed and is really worried about me. I don't want her to worry or be a burden on her. I'm at the point where all my peers are getting engaged and married, and I haven't even gone on one date. I just want to fade away into the darkness, never to be heard from again. Sometimes I have fantasies about moving to Tibet and becoming a monk, just so I would have a valid excuse for being celibate. I get especially jealous of younger guys that have amazing sexual experiences, especially in college. It's embarrassing to be a 25 year old virgin when there are 20 years olds in happy relationships and having sex all the time.

"Well I'm feeling like literal crap. We've been on state medical assistance since I got pregnant again 4 years ago. Husband was working a dead end job, I was only able to work part time due to eldests school schedule, and we were below the poverty income limit. I know we were very fortunate to qualify for all of our medical care and expenses paid by the state. I became a SAHM after covid, so we became a 1 income household. 

Our middle is now 3, and while undiagnosed medically, we all know he is autistic. We just haven't gone through all the hoops and tests to formally diagnose yet because ""nothing would be different at this point in time besides the label/stigma"". He got at home therapy through early intervention before starting preschool, has an iep at school (developmental delay as his main disorder), along with private speech, occupational, and physical therapy. He has a severe speech delay and sensory processing disorder. Our now 1 year old was just assessed and approved for private speech therapy to start after the new year. He is looking to follow in his brother's footsteps as we're seeing the same patterns.

This last year my husband started working for his dad taking over some farming duties. He got a few raises here and there over the last couple years at his job. That, plus the seasonal income, now puts us JUST over the limit to qualify, so we will lose all of our assistance. We now go from having everything paid for, to having to spend $500 a month for basic insurance through my husband's work. That only covers 90 sessions a year, with it only covering 80%, so we have to pay 20% on top of a copay. After that we have to pay full price for each session. With how many they are both in, we'd pay 225 a week on top of 500 a month. And that would barely last 4 months, we'd have to pay full price the rest of the year, ON TOP OF the cost of insurance.

I feel like I've been on the phone for weeks. Talked to everyone possible (not saying everyone as to not give away my location). Getting the run around or passed from someone because they don't understand the situation. The school can't help, the private insurance just wants our money, everyone at the state seems to have no clue what to do. But they all say the same thing. We just make too much money now. It's unreal. We don't eat out. We each have 2 older cars with low payments. We don't have a crazy big savings account because things always pop up. The ""extra"" income doesn't make a dent in making us richer. It's like we were better off struggling in poverty than now being low middle class and left to drown. 

So now we have to figure out how to come to terms with dropping private therapy. Middle will still get one 20 minute session a week with the school speech pathologist in the classroom. But he will no longer have 45 minute sessions of speech, ot, and pt two days a week, one on one help. I'm totally failing my children.

"I had a very turbulent and difficult childhood and as a result I have no family.

In an effort to rise above my raising I dedicated my life to my husband and kids, so I have nothing outside my home. No friends, no hobbies, just a part-time job that I hate to make extra cash for my family.
This was a mistake I know.

My marriage has not been good for some time now, as my husband seems to have very little interest in me or my needs, and has put no effort into maintaining or saving our marriage. 

We are both miserable. He would seemingly prefer if I had no needs and would just continue to serve others quietly. 
Unfortunately for him, I absolutely cannot do that another day. I’m just not physically capable anymore. 
I want to feel important for once in my life. I want to be the priority. 
He doesn’t want to hear about it, because it makes him feel “not good enough”. 

So now we are done. He is done hearing about my needs. He’s tired of feeling guilty for not doing the things he promised to do.

He’s a good dad. I know they will be okay with him, probably better than they would do with me in my impending situation. 

I know people will say that i’m entitled to some assets ect, but i’ve spoken with a lawyer and after debt is factored in thanks to the cost of living, if we sold everything we would have nothing and our kids would lose their home.

I can’t do that to them.

"I am a 20M and this is the first time someone I am close to has been openly accused of SA. I do not know the details, I overheard my roommate and another roommate talking about it. This was the first time I heard anything it and to be honest, I was shocked. 

I only met this roommate when we moved in which was at the start of this most recent past summer. We have similar interests so we have become friends. The person I know (and I’ll admit I really only know them in a few specific contexts) does not seem like the type of person to do this. They are queer in their gender and sexuality and seemingly are very progressive about things like sex and consent.

I don’t know the details and haven’t yet had a one on one conversation about what happened, but from what I overheard the other night, is that they thought they received consent to do certain acts and their was some kind of miscommunication or the alleged victim misinterpreted it. The victim took it the police but it seems like the police have done nothing about it.

I really don’t know what to do about this. They are my friend and I trust what they say but this so much more serious than any other point where I needed to trust them.

"Believe it or not, I am actually an animal lover. I love pet sitting, I love getting and giving love to all types of animals, even insects. 

But I have been attacked by 2 dogs in the past year, both being aggressive towards the dog im watching.

Today was the worst. 

I had planned everything, what time I wanted to walk the dogs im pet sitting, where I wanted to walk them, how long, etc all in the efforts of avoiding the neighborhood dogs. I had heard stories from neighbors and the family about where the dogs lived and how aggressive they were.

Today the 100 Lbs Golden doodle got loose in the neighborhood on a walk. I did not know until I turned the corner and was met face to face with a collar less dog and a man chasing after him with the leash.

Immediately the dog came running towards the 2 small chihuahuas i was watching. Instinct took over. I tried to pull the dogs to my chest but they are also dogs who are not scared if a fight, and wouldn't let me pick them up.

I won't get graphic but let's just say if the neighbors had not come out to help me, I dont think the dogs and i would have been okay.

I am shaken up. It's not often you have to tackle a 100 lbs dog in the effort to save a dogs life that's not even your dog. I knew this could happen. I planned around everyone's schedules. I walk briskly in the neighborhood so the dogs get tired and aren't out as long. I check outside to see if there are any dogs. I walk across the road to another neighborhood to avoid certain dogs houses.

How are you allowed to own a dog like that?? How are you, as an owner, able to sleep at night when your dog has attacked multiple dogs?

Not only that, after I put the dogs back inside, I ran out to find the fucker and get him to pay for whatever vet bills I recieve. Do you know what I find instead? The same dog, running to attack me. The Mexican in me took over. I whipped of my slipper and yell ""GET BACK, GO HOME, GET BACK"" he charges and I smack tf outta him with my slipper and fist. He bites my hand.

The owner comes driving by, trying to get the dog in the car. The owner hands me literal bear spray saying if he gets close to spray him.

Do you know who got that dog back home? Me. A small female, barely bigger than the dog. I chased him home, spray and slipper in hand, ready for the next attack. The owner only showed me where they lived. I finally am able to talk to the owner after the dog is put inside. I say:

""Give me one reason I shouldn't call animal control right now!?""

He says 

""I've had him in training but it's obviously not working. I will not be taking him on walks anymore."" Some solution for a DOG.

What should I have done differently? Should I have called animal control either way? Should I have cut my walk short? Should I had already brought bear spray with me? Should I have brought a bat too? Perhaps drive to a whole other county to walk the dogs?

It's not just the dogs fault, it's the owners fault. And it's shitty of me to say I hate all dogs and dog owners but I literally can't trust any of you. Even the dogs im watching, although small, are aggressive barkers towards other dogs.

I cannot trust a dog or dog owner again. I'm starting to believe dogs should have stayed as wild animals. This is coming from someone who has always grown up with dogs. It hurts my heart but quite frankly, my hand hurts even more and I'm sick and tired of the bullshit. 

If you have a dog and you're reading this, and you see even a little bit of your dog in this post, get training, get the resources, get help for your dog, or get rid of it to someone who can actually control and take care if the dog. 

Dogs are big commitments, and you're a big asshole if you don't own up to the responsibilities of being a dog owner.

Rant over. Sorry. No tea no shade, please just let this rant be a rant and a warning to others. 

If you do have a dog give them a kiss for me because I don't think I can do it myself anymore.

"I (16F) hate my step-grandmother (40 something F) i’m pretty sure she knows i don’t like her but i don’t know how long i haven’t liked her for. When i was younger about 6 or under me and my brother (who ill called luke) used to go to her house once every couple months for a sleeplover with her son who is two years older than me and one year older than my brother, (ill call him jake) Im also CERTAIN jake hates me, he use to pick on me for the smallest things ever and i still have very clear recollections of these events, one time my step-grandmother took all three of us to the park to play, and we had to walk down a steep hill and i ITCHED MY FACE OKAY I FUCKING ITCHED IT, it was at a spot close to my nose and from behind it probably looked like i picked my nose, jake DID NOT LET THIS SLIDE!! He was walking behind me and yelled out “She picked her nose!!” And i yelled back obviously annoyed by his remark “No i didnt, i itched my face” and this went on for a while before my step-grandmother butted in and made ME apologise to him. This has happened many times where we would either fight, or he’d tell me to do something with both of them to join in (my brother and him were close) and i’d get told of.

Another time that ACTUALLY SCARRED ME, i was sleeping over and i was feeling sick at night so i went to the bathroom to see if i was going to throw up bc i felt that sick, my step-grandmother heard me walked into the bathroom and said “What are you doing” visibly annoyed, so i responded “I feel sick so im seeing if im going to throw up” AND LIKE A BITCH SHE SAID “You’re not sick go back to bed” when i tell you i wanted to punch her fucking face out. I went back to bed and in the morning i forced her to call my mum and dad to get me bc i wanted to go home, i did go home, i know what your thinking “she was 6 at the time she doesnt know what she was thinking she was a kid” NO, i was fully aware i hated this women, eventually i begged my parents to not make me go back bc i didnt like it there, they eventually caved in and never made me go again. But now im older and shes making my life helllllllll.

She always buys me clothes and stuff which ill admit is nice but the stuff she is buying isnt for a fucking 16 year old, ever since i was 14 i hated everything she bought me even if it was for birthdays, xmas or just random occasions she would buy me clothes and shoes or notebooks that had rhinestones, sequence and glitter all over it, stuff that clearly wasnt meant for someone my age or just me in general, my mum told me to just be grateful that she even got me stuff but i wasnt bc i didnt like any of the stuff she got me, all the things she has gotten me over the years just go in a corner of my room never to be touched again or i give them to my friends who will like it or charity. I have her number blocked so i dont have to speak to her thats how much i hate her, she even gets involved in my personal life, and rn isnt the time since im having mental health problems and she just gives my mum “parenting advice” like she has a fucking clue, she has one kid with my grandad and shes all that, not to mention im only related to her son, hes my half uncle or some shit, im not one but fucking related to that women, she married my grandad before i was born after my grandmother er passed away, and i fucking hate her guts (the step grandmother not my actual one)

Anyway thats all, sorry its so long i just need to get It off my chest bc ive been holding this in for A LONG TIME, i cant tell her that i hate her because she’ll just go to MY mum to complain like, complain to your own mum, and i cant tell my mum bc she’ll just shrug me off as being over dramatic, the only people i cant tell are fucking strangers (i dont have friends that would relate bc they dont have a fucking step-grandmother just me) my family is pretty fucking messed up.",I hate my step-grandmother,18n9jmq,1703117989.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n9jmq/i_hate_my_stepgrandmother/,
"Long story short, I (20M) was the product of an affair. My mom had me in our current country with another man while she was working abroad here, while my 3 siblings grew up together in my mom's home country with their dad.

All my life I have dealt with feelings of inferiority and isolation from my mom and siblings. I feel like they all have a bond together that I will never have, because I was born separately from them. I grew up under the same roof as them for most of my childhood, so I call them my siblings despite being only half-related. But they grew up without me. There's a huge age gap between me and them, and a big cultural difference since my dad is a different race.  

A few months ago, I was eating dinner alone at the table with my brother (26M). He's the one I'm closest to and the only one I can truly say feels like family to me, so we tell each other about our struggles sometimes. I opened up to him about this, and how I feel like nobody wants me around. He gave me a half-hearted reassurance that they love me all the same, and I left it at that. But a few days after that conversation, I met up with my sister (29F) for lunch.  

At some point during that outing, she started telling me (unprompted) about how she never saw me as her real family when we were younger, and treated me drastically differently compared to everyone else. She talked about how she would buy everyone food and not get me anything, how I would easily annoy her, etc. She laughed it off, and since I didn't want to make the rest of the lunch awkward, I laughed it off too. But god, its ruined me. My biggest fear all my life, and she confirmed it without me even asking.  

It's already been a few months since she said it, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I don't know what to do. I feel like my mom only keeps me around because I pay a big portion of our rent. I can't afford to go to college, and I work full-time to make ends meet for my mom, so I can't move out.

"I quit my job a few months ago with about 3k in savings. I didn’t have a new job lined up, because it was a hasty decision. I was working with my “best friend” who was actually trying to get me fired the whole time, lying to me, and the whole environment was making me very very very depressed so I quit. In October, I found out my mom somehow accrued $3k in debt in my name, and no matter how many calls I made or what I said they said I was responsible for paying it back. I set up a monthly payment with them, but because of the unexpected bill I ran out of money quicker than I expected. I’ve been applying for anything I can find now, not even something better than what I had, and unfortunately this month I didn’t have enough to pay any of my bills, let alone get Christmas presents.

"I just needed to take a moment and get all this off my chest! I just got back from a trip at Disney World and it was the most magical thing I've ever experienced! I have been wanting to take this trip for years, my dad and I would talk about it all the time....

My dad passed away a little over a year ago. It was completely unexpected (a stroke) and I'm still working through everything but I'm doing so much better than before. So going to Disney World was kind of like my last big goodbye to him! 

It was very emotional for me, but in a way, I felt him all around me during that vacation. I thought about him a lot! Which just made me so happy! I'm so glad that I was finally able to do this, even though I'm sad it was too late for him to go, I don't regret anything about this experience. 

I even got engaged on Halloween and while he was the first person I wanted to tell, I knew that he would be happy for me. My fiancé has been so amazing throughout all of this, we took some beautiful pictures at Disney World that I'm planning to put in frames. 

My thoughts are so scrambled putting it down so I'm sorry in advance but I can't get over how happy I feel. After my dad died, I wasn't sure how I was going to get to this point. And now I'm here.

"I just need somewhere to vent since I know what kind of responses I’d probably get if I told my friends any of this.

I’m 42 and my ex husband is 44. We were married for almost 10 years and have been divorced for 6 years. We have one child together, a 15 year old son.

I loved him with my whole being, love I can’t even really put into words. We divorced because I discovered that he cheated on me more than once and with more than one woman. He’s admitted to it. He’s apologized. We had a pretty amicable divorce, as amicable as you can be in that situation.

He was pretty wild when we first met. I was to an extent but not like him. That was part of the appeal to my 20-something self. I got pregnant, we got married, but he couldn’t completely settle down. He still wanted to go to the bar and get drunk with his buddies all the time, have one night stands with random women. The one responsible thing he did was provide well for our family and he’d try to hold that against me after he’d come home drunk after partying all night, like “I go to work every day. Who bought this house and your brand new car and pays for our kid’s private school?” 

Now, he has settled down some. We get along. There really isn’t any bad blood between us anymore. We love our son who we share custody of. Our son absolutely adores and idolizes his dad. They’re very close. He’s a good dad now. He’s responsible when it comes to our son, provides him with the best of everything, is present in his life, provides guidance and love. 

So this brings me to the current dilemma. 
We’re both currently single. Truth be told, I’ve dated several other guys since our divorce and I don’t have that same spark with anyone like I did with him. It’s not a matter of self-esteem. I’m probably in better shape, health wise, than I’ve ever been. I know I have things beyond sex to offer a man. He convinced me to essentially be friends with benefits. Sex with him has always remained the best sex I ever had. I’ve never been friends with benefits with anyone before. I probably wouldn’t even consider this with anyone else. I’m having so much fun with it. He’s really fun to be with, always has been. He’s funny, we laugh, nothing is serious between us and it’s been great. 

Our son walked in on us in the middle of…doing what friends with benefits do. It was his time when he’s at my house but he wasn’t supposed to be home. He came home, he found us, and he’s very upset about it. He’s sat me down as if he’s my parent and told me all of the reasons why this isn’t a good idea, that dad cheated on me, that we cannot be in a relationship and he’s worried about what will happen when his dad breaks my heart again. Kind of surprised me with how much I often think he just wants to grow up to be a mini version of his father. I feel bad, he’s distressed, he’s grossed out, but at the same time I’m not sure that we should stop what we as adults choose to do because our son doesn’t like the idea. 

Am I a terrible mom if I essentially say thanks for the input, but I’m the adult and will do what I want? I have no problem being the adult with my kid and while we do have a good relationship I still act like his parent.

"As I write this I can only imagine you all thinking this is a scam or a hallmark movie but I assure you it's real. I am having a hard time processing and need all the input. Stay with me it's long. Changed names for obvious reasons. 

My husband Troy, 48 found out he has daughter who is 28 and has 2 kids he knew nothing about until yesterday! Let's call her Suzie. We will call husband,Troy. 

Background: He is 10 yrs older than me. We have been married for almost 6 years.  This is both our second marriages and don't have any kids together but we raise our blended family together and all the kids get along great and life was great until we got these Facebook messages. Tory doesn't have Facebook and have limited engagement because I don't care for Facebook. 

In October, I got an out of the blue Facebook message from Suzie asking if I was related to my father in law. After talking with husband decided to ignore it because of scammers. Then yesterday my sister in law (Jessica) got a similar message except this time the message from Suzie mentioned she was looking for her bio dad. Jessica texted Troy the screen shots but didn't respond to Suzie to not get involved because who knows if it was really true.  Troy reached to out to Suzie on my Facebook and got her number. After chatting a bit getting a minimal back story and with out a DNA test it feels 99% a match. 

According to Troy, the story lines up with his past.  His first station was in Arkansas in the 90's. He enlisted at 19, first station at 20. He was young, dumb and partied like most of us do. He knows its a possibility because of his past behaviors. He doesn't recall Suzie's mom at all. He swears he always engaged in safe sex but let's be real, that's not always the case. Shit happens.    

We bought my father in law a 23 and me for Christmas 3 years ago. She also did a 23 and me over the summer to start looking for answers. That's where she was link to my father in law and she reached out to get more information we assume my father in law didn't respond to any messages she sent because he Marley know how to work his phone let alone Facebook messages. We look at her Facebook and what do you know she is a spitting copy and paste image of Troy. 

Suzie explains to Troy that Her mom, let's call her Becky, was living in the same area as her fiancee was also stationed at the same base as my husband. We have no info for that fiancee so we dont know if they knew each other. Becky found out her fiancee (Billy Bob) was cheating on her so she went out got drunk and cheated on her Billy Bob with my Troy and multiple other men. (Obviosuly not my husband at the time). They were 20 at the time. Becky find out she is pregnant but knows it's not Billy Bob's but doesn't know who the father is.  Becky stays with her cheating fiancée for 4 years and Suzie is told that is her dad. That was until Becky and Billy Bob were fighting one day and at the age of 4 Suzie found out that was not her dad. Becky screams for everyone to hear to Billy, Suzie isn't even your daughter."" This lead Suzie to always want to know who her dad was. Whenever she asked Becky she would lie or gaslight Suzie about who her bio dad was.  She has a strained relationship with her mom because of this and many other issues. She grew up with her moms gusband as her dad and had a great relationship with the dad she was raised with. However still felt the need to find her real father. 

So now I stuck and don't know how to feel. My mom gut and my empathy is saying, Bring her in, get to know her, give her the family she is yerning for and deserves. And the rest of me is saying, I wish this would just go away and never happened. She can stay there we stay here and it goes not further than knowing who he is. She explained to him she wants him in her life and he wants his as her children's grand parent. Troy is open to getting to know her and I am on the fence.

"Hi. I am an affair baby. No, I’m not an entitled brat who thinks everyone affected by my parents disloyalty should love me because it’s not my fault. But let’s make something clear, it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t ask to be born as a shameful reminder of what my parents did. 

Surprisingly, my dad’s family stayed together despite his infidelity. I questioned all throughout my childhood why my siblings, people who were supposed to love me unconditionally, hated me. I always knew they resented me, even if they didn’t say it.

I spent my weekends at my mom’s house who wasn’t married. She was always honest about how I came to be. It wasn’t until I was 13 that I really understood what happened. I’ve held anger towards my parents ever since. 

I grew up surrounded by people who were only nice because of the understanding that I was blameless. Because of the way I was born, I didn’t get a family who could wholeheartedly accept me. 

Before I renounced faith, I would pray to god to take me away and give me to a family I could actually belong to. When that didn’t work, I tried ending my life in hopes God would have me reborn into a conventionally happy family who’d love me cause I was born under the right circumstances. 

I know the people affected by the situation have no reason to love or accept me. But I’d rather they stay away from me entirely than be passive aggressive and so obviously angry at my existence. 

I didn’t ask to be here, and it took me a while to really understand that I don’t need anyone’s affection if they aren’t willing to give it. All I can do is move forward and find people who can look past the shame of my existence. I know I have no right to the same love my family holds for each other. I’m different in a way that just can’t be fixed. It was a difficult thing to realize at such a young age. 

I know my situation is unique and not every affair baby has my same experience, I do not speak for us all. Some do not even know that they are products of affairs and keeping that from them leads to confusion and resentment. I was lucky enough to know it all my life and have to time to process it and understand what it means for the people in my family. 

To everyone dealing with situations regarding affair babies, please do not be guilted into being in their lives. I believe I’d be better off emotionally if I wasn’t surrounded by people who so clearly hated me but tried not to show it.",No one talks about how Affair babies are affected by the cheating,18n84ax,1703114003.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n84ax/no_one_talks_about_how_affair_babies_are_affected/,

He kept apologizing and saying he just needed to feel something and that he hasn't had a woman in years etc. I just went silent and I picked up my stuff and walked out. I contacted the office that I had an emergency and needed to sign out (after hours) and the next day I called and told them what had happened. 
They took me off his schedule. I feel relieved but I also felt like I was so useless and pathetic. I let him harass me because I froze. One of my friends told me I should've bitten or attacked him for doing that to me but I'm not a fighter and I also don't want to lose my job for hurting someone. 
The thought did run through my head but I was too scared to do anything. 
I just need to let this out cus I only told one person and their response was I should've chose violence. 

I still feel so gross and icky.

EDIT: Thank you so much to those who gave me reassurance, the kind words and even similar stories that had happened to you. I wouldn't wish this on any body and its definitely horrifying to have happen. I didn't respond sooner because I've been working and then I shut my phone off for a bit just to process things since it finally hit me pretty hard. 
I told a few of my close friends and told my bf what happened because I needed an outlet and everyone has been so supportive and understanding. My bf just held me and told me it wasn't my fault and he's not upset I didn't tell him at first because I was just trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I appreciate you guys and this has helped lift alot of that guilt. 

I don't wish harm on my ex-client, I hope no one else has to deal with what I did. I hope he gets the help he needs and understands his actions were not right.

"My other account got banned where I asked this before.

I have a very good memory. Not quite photographic, but nearly eidetic.

I have phantom memories that keep resurfacing. I have gone through counselling, but even they don't have a solution. They only try to help with the issues these flashes of the past raise. They don't even know how to deal with how ""accurate"" they seem to be.

They don't involve any sort of physical trauma (i.e. no sexual abuse). Although, I do remember vividly the time I escaped that.

Short story..

I remember damn near everything. I had an episode of alcohol abuse. I had counselling. I still remember everything that I ""perceived"" as stuff I had done wrong.

"First of all, English is not my first language. Sorry for the mistakes. 

To clarify a couple of things: I don't have a job, but it's because my mom doesn't want me to work because she thinks it will interfere with my studies.But sometimes I take random quick job applications and earn some money to save and pay for study materials.

For some context;  I (20f) am my mother's second daughter, and I have two brothers, A (27f) and B (14m). We all have different dads, and my mom is not married to any of them.  Still, it's well known that she resents my dad more than any of her exes. I have no relationship with him, and my mother always had full custody. There has always been favoritism towards my siblings, and I have always been the black sheep. I've always known this, and every time I bring it up, my mom downplays my feelings and makes me feel stupid for having them. Long story short, in February I will begin my fourth semester of university. I go to a pretty expensive university, and my semester costs almost 5 million. I have a 15% scholarship, but it's not a big deal. I'm on vacation, and I have some money saved to buy a new phone (my old one broke and I'm using my mom's phone).  Sometimes I go out with my girlfriend during the week, and I only ask my mom for what I need for public transportation. She always gets angry about it. That has led us into a lot of problems recently. 

Today, I asked her for some money to buy some hair dye. My sister owes me money for taking care of her daughter, and I assured my mother that I would pay her back when my sister paid me. But she began to humiliate me for asking her for money, claiming that I am inconsiderate and wasteful. I admit that I didn't react well, and I wanted to defend myself.  So I asked her if she didn't want to lend me money, to return the money I lent her.That made her get angry and take her phone away from me.  Like I said, I've been using hers because mine was damaged, and I have all my information on her phone, so I wanted to get it back, but she said she was going to pay me, but I forgot about her phone and the information I have in it.

When I calmed down, I wanted to talk to her, and since I knew I could get upset, I wrote what I wanted to say in a letter.  I'll leave the letter here, because it would be difficult to summarize it: ""I know that if I say things out loud to you, we'll probably end up fighting. I don't know how to express myself, and I always end up colliding with you. First of all, I want to start by apologizing for being rude. I felt attacked, so I reacted defensively. What happens to me is that lately I feel like everything about me bothers you. Every time I tell you I'm going out and get 6000 for the transport, you get upset with me. I'm not asking you for money for anything more than a bus, and yet you argue with me about it. Then you start saying things about college, and honestly, I feel guilty for even studying. Sometimes I even start to think that it would be easier for you if I just didn't study and got to work, because, to be honest, every time you start complaining, it's like you're saying that I'm a burden to you. As if it were easier if I had stayed with my dad to save you all the money you spend on me. You told me to save and that's what I've been doing with the money I have from university, because every time I spend it, you tell me that I could have used it for something more important. So, then you tell me to spend it in me, so you don't spend money on me. I know I go out, but when I go out I only ask you for the bus, which is not much. I don't like being locked up in the house here, and it seems that it bothers you that I go out from time to time. I don't go out every day, 2-3 times a week and that's it, and I don't ask you for food or anything like that. The other day, you made a super offensive comment that if I had a male boyfriend instead of a girlfriend, he would give me money.  And that made me feel like you wanted someone else to take care of me. Plus, you made me feel like you were unhappy with my relationship. Again, this is just to tell you how I feel every time you argue with me about money. I wouldn't like to be a burden, and sometimes, it seems to me that you think that's what I am.  From time to time, I even think that you don't like me, that you wanted a second A (my sister), and I'm nothing more than a disappointment to you.  Again, I apologize for how I behaved, it wasn't the best. And after thinking about why I acted like that, I just came to the conclusion that I feel bad and I took it out on you. Sorry""

I ended up crying while reading it in front of her, and I thought she would understand. But after listening to me, she just got up and left. She ignored me completely.

In highschool I had the best grades of my class, I was accepted to every single good university of my country but my academic life was all I could think about. I have never been to a party, I have never flirted, I have never traveled without my parents and honestly I hate to be around people because I am so used to being alone.

"At the start of this year I cleared the first 2 stages of a Big 3 interview. 

Then something happened in my personal life that just catapulted me into misery. Weeks of laying in bed, missing classes, ditching friends, doing nothing but crying. I got the email for the third stage and I was in disbelief. I started preparing but my emotions were all over the place, my mental state was still down the hole, and I was just not feeling anything positive. 

I requested to reschedule my interview and they very graciously did. Then my point of contact reached out to me for several days, and one day he kept calling almost every other hour to finalise the interview. But I was just numb. I would see his name calling but I’d just be lying down with tears streaming down my face. 

11 months later, I regret it so much. I missed an opportunity I’m not likely to get again. I’m doing much better mentally but I don’t know if I’ll qualify again. Sometimes I want to reach out to him and apologise. 

To make matters worse I remembered this because I saw the same applications close again this year and I realised that’s two cycles I’m out. If I apply by next year, I’m two years older than fresh.

"I (21M) have been with my GF (21F) for about 2 years. When we first started dating we would have sex all the time and gradually this started to reduce to weekly, every other week and now barely once a month. She was my first but she’s been with with 2 other people previously.
For context, we both go to uni, we’re in our last but one year and both of our courses are very demanding. We started having sex less frequently about a year ago and it’s becoming less frequent since. She says she doesn’t like thinking about sex when she’s stressed, which is fair, but lately it feels like she’s always stressed. I try to be there for her and I think I do a good job but it’s very draining on me and I don’t know how much of myself I can give. Over the summer we lived together and she was not as stressed as she was during the semester but we still barely had sex. Few months later and it’s the same situation, if not worse. 
Whenever we are in a situation to actually have sex she prefers to cuddle and take naps which is nice but we do this all the time now.
Im not sure what to do because I’ve spoken to her about it and she more or less told me to figure it out (to be fair she was half asleep). But I’ve been put off talking about it and don’t even think there’s a point. When we did talk about it we had sex the next day but I kept thinking she was doing it to make me happy as opposed to because she wanted to. 
Now she’s most likely to have sex with me only after she’s drank or smoked a bit which makes me feel bad. 
I’m becoming very frustrated with this and don’t know what do to. I don’t want to break up with her because apart from our sex life, everything else is going great. I would consider myself a good enough looking person and more often time when I go out I notice girls staring or even flirting with me and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted. I don’t think I will ever cheat on her but it is even more annoying knowing I could have sex more often if I was single.

Edit
Also wanted to add that we finished our finals in Friday and I was traveling on Monday so I got a hotel the Sunday before next to the airport because I live fast and would have to wake up at 2am and go on a 4 hour bus otherwise. She came with me and everything was going well but we forgot to bring condoms. We went to a gas station downstairs for snacks and when I brought up buying condoms she said she didn’t feel like having sex anymore. I know I’m not supposed to expect sex and I honestly have stopped completely, which sucks btw, but that still hurt a little bit.

Edit 2
Just a few points I’d like to make
1. You’re right I will talk to her about it again when I come back from holiday with my family.

2. When we do have sex she finishes most if not ask the time

3. Ive made her feel relaxed multiple times and I plan dates, chill nights all of that so she can relax but I never do that thinking I’ll be able to sleep with her. I do it because I love her and want her to relax. That being said there’ve been times when we’d go out have a great time, she’d ask if I want to have sex when we get home, I say yes, we get home then she falls asleep. It happened way too many times for it not to bother me.

4. Aside from our sex lives she’s a great GF and I feel like I can talk to her about anything knowing she’d be supportive.

I thought it was a temporary thing &amp; maybe he’ll grow out if it &amp; learn accountability or realize his faults but no. Fast forward to 3+ years later and I still get blamed or scapegoated or just plain disrespected if something doesn’t go his way.

This past week we were carrying some objects (not heavy at all) and I accidentally dropped MY cup on the gravel &amp; he called me a “stupid bitch” loud enough that if someone were to walk by they could hear it. He’s done this in stores, he’s done this in restaurants and in multiple places. People look at us. Yes there’s 2 sides to every story but if my partner makes a mistake I SUPPORT him and don’t make him feel stupid. I don’t get that in return. 

Yesterday as I got off of work at 10pm not even a second after i clock out i get paragraphs of constant belittling and saying “he’s the man of the house and things will go his way” mind you this “man” cant pay a bill or be a respectful partner. I was nothing but kind, and respectful all day mind you I was working and can barely be on my phone. He’s not working right now for the past few months and has nothing better to do than send me paragraphs about how “we” need to be better and how I’m a piece of shit , how my parents should’ve raised me better etc, he used to say worse things and etc.I almost cried this morning looking at the texts from last night because he knows what to say to get under my skin plus i’m going through some bs at work right now so i just wanted to be held and be told it’ll be okay and reassured i’ll be okay but nope i’m told i’m a pos and i should’ve been raised better.

He’s been sitting and scrolling twitter and playing games all day when I’m at work doing applications for him when i’m able to be on my phone(because he won’t and i need my partner to help me and he just won’t apply whatsoever he has the app downloaded and he’s signed in he just won’t apply) I’m drowning and unless he starts applying we are going to fall behind. I get texts like “IM THE MAN OF THE HOUSE THINGS WILL GO AS I SAY” &amp; “silly of you think i’m disrespectful and rude when that’s all you are ”  but all i asked him is if he’s going to do this interview i set up for him virtually. I called him disrespectful and rude because he was cussing at me and catching attitude over the phone when I can’t defend myself because i’m there to WORK. I’ve tried telling him please don’t fight with me at work please it makes me anxious and you get really so i cry and i don’t like crying in front of others sometimes . He also says ,without me ever saying anything because i’m just scared of being homeless atp &amp; losing my dog, “I’m not lazy, i’m so much better than you, i’m smarter than you, you’re a piece of shit and i’m not, you were raised shittty like your parents, im better than you” mind you i was sitting there in silence. We could’ve been talking about bills and this comes up.  Its always a comparison with him and he always has to come out on top even with his friends unless he’s blaming someone else then the attention shifts to the blamee(i,e me) These thoughts are all rushing back to my head bc our anniversary is coming up, It’s a new year and i’m bout to be 25 that frontal love is crazy‼️‼️😔. Anyway, He never says happy anniversary first I always do and when i try to say “hey today was our anniversary you didn’t say anything in the morning or texted it at all” he says “I was waiting for you”. You’re telling me in the past 4+ years every year he waited for me to say smth first🤨 ?? He couldn’t say “hey babe happy anniversary ilysm!” first for once to even show he thought of me?  It makes me sad because I’ve let him use my new car he didn’t help me pay, I bought him what he wanted, I was respectful, I missed so much because he would get mad.

I initiate everything I ask him on dates, I try to plan stuff FOR him, I tell him i’m gonna do these nice things, I even planned my own xmas gift. he gets mad at plans and he finds a way to pivot that idea i had that he was “okay” with over text  then  go with something he wants when in reality my first suggestion was what he wanted all along&amp; he’s such an I TOLD YOU OR I KNEW THAT OMG he’ll say that for anything when in reality he was as lost as you were and didn’t tell you shit just let’s you stay lost , He steals my jokes I tell him that he doesn’t laugh at and tells them to his friends he lies about his employment to his mom but I know she knows.

I'm 24 (M), I graduated in 2021, my first day back from university my close friend OD'd. He had opened up to me in particular, I didnt help a much as I knew how. 

The guilt and grief made me end up in a mental hospital abroad whilst visiting my father as I couldn't stop panicking and having assured death fears. 

I'm already on antidepressants due to eating disorder at 12 and a really bad mushroom trip (20 grams) at 20. 

My grandma passed on my graduation celebration, 

A month ago my sister tried to kill herself by running infront of a 16tonne lorry, me and her got incredibly close past two years, we've lived together at home mostly alone. 

My sister lost her leg and has had tremendous brain damage, seeing her everyday is difficult. 

Now this past Friday, my father has had 3 strokes in his brain, he lives abroad and I'm now with him as he is recovering.

I feel like I'm this ragdoll stretchy toy holding everything together, I had to leave my job and now work in a much nicer part time job. 

I've had so many sweet and lovely things happen too recently. My dad talks normally, thinks normally, and hasn't been permanently serverly damaged which is a miracle. My sister is alive, they told us from the start to say our goodbyes, I decided to believe that she'd live and she has. 

I'm really strong sometimes, I know I am, but I no longer know where to gather strength. I have most days where I'm just positive, not manic, but seeing the positive in everything, cleaning for my sister and laughing, going to work smiling and laughing. 

I just wanted to vent, and thank you so much for giving me that opportunity. Your presence though online is felt. 

Is there advice that I can focus on, I haven't seen my friends in months, I still haven't gotten any professional help as I keep getting signposted.

She told me to pick her or the baby and I chose my daughter. We broke up during her pregnancy. She gave birth and she stayed at the hospital for 5 days and then she left us. I stayed with her the entire time she was at the hospital because I was scared of her bolting or just doing something crazy. I’m glad I stayed with her because she tried leaving the hospital after 24 hours of the C section, she kept harassing the staff and begging them to let her check out. To be honest she did seem physically healthy to be checked out but I know hospitals have their protocols.

The whole time I was there, I thought she would change her mind once she gave birth but I was wrong. She didn’t say anything nasty about our daughter and she didn’t do anything nasty but she was just emotionless. I guess I’m shocked because I’ve just never seen a woman be so emotionless especially towards her own baby that she carried. She was specific on her instructions to the midwife and told her she didn’t want to hold the baby after it came out and to just give it to the child’s father. Even though midwife knew our situation she still pressured her into breast-feeding and at least giving the baby some milk. I forgot what the medical term was that she used, but there was a term starting with the letter C (I think correct me if I’m wrong) newborns need that after they are born and GF refused to give it to the newborn. My GF really just wanted to pop the baby out and bolt. She only held the baby twice and that’s only because she had to since I wasn’t in the private room 24/7

I feel like Reddit is going to ask me if she’s financially involved and no she doesn’t pay child support. She doesn’t make really any money to begin with.. either way I don’t want her money and I don’t need her money.

"Only 27 years on this earth, and I feel like I've completely failed and fucked up. I'm feeling extremely hopeless in my situation (which is not that bad, I'm aware that I should be grateful but I just can't kick this feeling).

I hate my job, but it pays better than anything else I would be qualified for. I can't get loans to go back to school, and even if I could, I have no idea what I would actually enjoy. I am so unfulfilled that it physically hurts. I'm burned out and just don't care anymore. But at the same time, things are impossible financially and I cannot just quit or change jobs either, can I? Financial stability, or happiness?

I've also gotten in the worst shape of my life physically and I am constantly in pain, struggling to do basic tasks, I'm tired and have no energy. I'm sure burnout isn't helping these things either. I go to the gym consistently and am working with a naturopath to get well again but I'm constantly mentally stressed about food intake as well.

Mentally, I'm no better. I've been very interested in true crime and into some morbid things on here and now I feel fucked up from shit I've watched and can't forget or get images out of my mind. I just feel like a weirdo idiot for that, although I'm clearly not alone in the interest.

I know this is such a woe is me post but I just don't know how to get out of this state of mind. I have a job, I have a nice home, I have a great partner and the best cats. So much to be grateful for right? But I just feel empty regardless. I'd say that I am completely numb, but really I am just deeply in pain constantly. I would never take my own life - although I have ""tried"" a few times in the past. But I often wish I could just give up, I do not want to live this life. If this is it for me..I do not want it. How the fuck do I turn things around and become the woman I envisioned myself to be?

Prices go up, product sizes go down, rent is always increasing, houses are basically unattainable, and there always seems to be endless ways for big companies or the government to squeeze more money out of us. 

I just hate the idea that I'll be living paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life, even with a degree and a career, with most of my money going towards income tax, rent, bills, council tax, various insurances, and other things I have basically no choice in paying if I'm to live successfully in this society. Welcome to adulthood I guess! Maybe I'll have things to look forward to every year, like a vacation or christmas, but once those are over you're back in reality.

Not all my friends are like that, but there are a few. I don’t think they’re bad people, just stuck in their own worlds. They’ll help you if you ask and can be very caring. On the other hand, it also feels like they tune out if the convo isn’t about them or their interests/opinions (not always but often.)

They’re genuinely very friendly and I respect a lot of their values, so I want to talk to them about it instead of getting annoyed and distancing myself.

I want him to feed me and let me put on some weight.

It is a fetish and I understand that there are some health risks that come with weight gain but I’m willing to just experiment to see if it’ll make me happy.

"I had this huge falling out with a friend early into high school. She didn’t want to be friends anymore after my behavior turned toxic and I had a insecure attachment with her. I was super young and stunted emotionally from physical abuse at home, this combined with puberty made me not ideal to be around. With retrospect i can see the ways i messed up, but at the time her no longer wanting to associate with me DESTROYED what was left of my mental health and I did attempt to kill myself (she never knew this, it failed obviously and was more a cry for help than a ‘real’ attempt). Safe to say we talked a total of one time for the rest of high school, i was super ass hurt and never looked at her in the hall ways. 

Fast forward to today it has been probably ten years sense we talked last and i moved back to near where we grew up, and ive been seeing her at the grocery store. She even talked to me (unaware it was me), about my dog who was going potty in a patch of grass near the store. I recognized her voice right away. And reverted back into those old patterns of ignoring that i knew her. That would have been the perfect opportunity to say “hey we know each other and have a huge super complicated past.” But we just walked silently into the store. I went into denial that it was her, because i didnt get a good look at her face so thats how i justified it. But i seen her again yesterday walking with her mom. I knew that inside the store, and with her mom, that there would be no way she/they wouldn’t recognize me. I panicked hard and dipped into the nearest isle and b-lined to the other side of the store. Unsure if she seen me.

 Im a different person now. I love myself so much. I have buckets full of self confidence, and feel at ease when i do most things. I have a husband and a dog, Im renting a house and taking care of my disabled father. Im 100% adult. And im sure she is too. And now it feels like im going to start seeing her more and more. Im going to have to talk to her. Because i dont want to do the shit i did in high school, and just look forward/ignore her. It feels so fucking childish and rude. And if i am an different person, shouldn’t i show this off? It is something to be proud of, being in a spot to be a bigger person. And who knows. Maybe we could get to a place of being okay with each other. Yesterday was not the day to say hi, i was super pissed at my husband and already feeling awful. I just couldn’t…but i will.

we had talked about trying things over text (one of these being hitting during sex) over text we discussed how were both interested in trying this, but never specified or communicated directly when we were going to try this, because i assumed we would have an in person conversation about it before we were to do anything pertaining to hitting because we never had before.  the next time she was over we were having sex and and all of a sudden she hit me in the face really hard. i genuinely was too shocked to even react. we didn’t have a safe word set up because i did not think we would need that until we started doing these things, and i was not prepared to start doing these things the day this happened. 

i feel like she should’ve had an in person conversation with me about wanting to try this before we did it in person? i am assuming because we texting about wanting to do it she assumed i wanted to next time i saw her and that’s why she did it. if she were to have asked in person about trying it before we had sex that day, i would’ve said no because i just wasn’t feeling like it. i have been very clear about needing clear verbal consent during sex before she touches me or tries something new in the past, and she has listened, so i’m very surprised this happened.",my ex hit me during sex,18n3tyg,1703102731.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n3tyg/my_ex_hit_me_during_sex/,
"I easily feel guilty and have always been very empathetic, even for someone like my dad that has done so much wrong. He was pretty abusive growing up.

I feel like the holidays would be easier to get through with my siblings there too but at the same time I respect why they are opting out of seeing him.

The first time it happened I was kind of shocked but then justified it by saying that he’s not used to having sex yet. But a year later, I just don’t understand. 

It makes me feel soooo undesirable and like he thinks i’m gross :( I’m a very hygienic person and previous partners (I asked) have never noticed a smell or anything so I don’t understand.

A couple of months ago, I tried to talk to him about it and explain how it made me feel but he just shut down and refused to talk about it completely.

"I went to the ER this past summer in Berkeley for intermittent epigastric pain I've never experienced before (I didn't have any pain the day I went in, just as a precaution). After many hours at the hospital, they decided that since my troponin levels were rising and wanted to keep me overnight, but at their other facility in Oakland who specializes in cardiology. So they got AMR to transferred me in a gurney in what was about a 10 minute ambulance ride to the facility in Oakland. At that point, I still didn't have any pain in my epigastric region, I was just exhausted since it was past midnight and I've been in the ER since the early afternoon. Everything turned out fine in the end, and I learned the next day that my troponin levels were just barely over the limit, but it was wasn't anything urgent at the moment. A little over a month later I received the bill and it says that the ride cost $12,038.69. How is this possible for such a short ride?

I'm still working with my insurer and AMR to get my costs covered (it's currently under review at AMR for a Payment Holding Status with the help of a rep from my insurer), but is there any way to get them to lower the costs? Like is it a mistake? The only ""help"" that I got from the reps at AMR is to submit a Request for the Release of Medical Records, which I did, so I can review the breakdown of the charges. I did some light Googling and I've scene complaints on Yelp and BBB about their exorbitant costs, which were around a few thousand dollars, not 12K. How do I go about making noise about this? How do I get them to lower the cost?

"There’s a clip circulating where a man vehemently tells a woman that does OF that she offers nothing more than sex. I’ve only watched it once, but that’s the gist of it. 

He puts this very eloquently, and I’m sure the reason it went viral was because so many people agree with it. The problem as I see it are two things:

1. There’s a better way to have went about it than saying it the way he said it on a podcast. It wasn’t only to embarrass her for the possibility of a viral clip, but he also did it to pander to the young men who consume a lot of this type of  content. I would say that he’s actually doing much more harm than her, even if you agree wholeheartedly with what he’s saying. The harm is that more men will, not only have his mindset, but look at women as a whole as he is looking at her. Young people, and people in general, have a hard time separating things and people, and just grouping them together because it’s much easier to do that. Demonizing a whole group has never helped progress society.

2. If you are on the other side of this and loathe everything this guy stands for, then you are contributing to a culture war that was set up by design to further drive a wedge into society. I’m convinced that a lot of what goes viral is strategically pushed up algorithms or even manufactured to get us all to hate each other. We think we’re nothing like the group I mentioned in the first part (angry young men) but if you’re falling for the same propaganda videos, you’re only the other side of the same coin.

"  
Long story story I dated my ex bf for 1.5 years. He was 23. He broke it off with me a month ago due to being in different paths in life? And it felt sudden. He had just told me that he wanted to talk and work on some things so it sounded like a more serious convo. But in his head he was going to end it, messed up right? When I went on the first date with him things felt right, he came off as serious and respectful. Didn’t do or say anything to make me uncomfortable. Asked when he could see me again. And the rest was history. I met his mom like 2 weeks in and he made it official 3 weeks in. We hung out a lot. He met my family I met his, went down to his hometown for the holidays etc etc. He seemed so serious about me! Would speak on our future and future kids, marriage, etc. And my stupid self fell for it and believed he was serious since he would say these things. However as the honey moon phase died off a bit I saw he was a financially unstable guy, in debt, who started doing less for me. The guy who I had met didn’t seem to be fully there and present with me anymore. Would make snarky comments to me and sometimes get angry with me quick over stuff like how I drive or how I do something. Wouldn’t help me much around my apartment etc. I started nursing school in august and ever since that things really declined. He pulled away from me and I don’t feel like he understood this would change our dynamic, as it’s a new priority in my life. But so was he. So I find out yesterday he apparently would tell me he was going to play poker which he was on nights I would be studying and this bartender girl told me he would flirt with her at work etc. They never did anything though and she got a bf a month ago and deleted him. This hurt, what he thought ended on good terms changed. I told him, unleashed my hurt, and the first thing he said is he should’ve ended it months ago and in his head he was going to leave me in a few weeks anyways. I was speechless. I told his mom as his biological dad he never met cheated on his mom. He told me he didn’t want to be like his dad. This is all to say I feel disgust… he showed little remorse even before I found this out just towards me. Seemed so happy to get rid of me as if I hurt him? I did nothing to him except have other major things in my life to build a better future. He took it to heart from the beginning. What do I do? I feel so numb I can’t cry anymore. I vent to people and I’m sick of hearing I deserve better. I thought I was gonna get better, I took a chance on someone who told me to trust him from the beginning. I should’ve known. I feel broken inside and outside, I can barely smile. I feel alone even with friends and family, it’s an indescribable feeling. I gave him so much and he didn’t appreciate shit. Fml  
  
I really thought I was giving a different type of guy a chance, like it would lead to a better outcome but I’m wrong. I was his peace and comfort, I took him in when he was new to this city, but yet he doesn't seem to be struggling without me.  
  
I’m also an idiot for sleeping with him post break up when he wanted to meet up for more closure. I just wanted his comfort. It’s stupid I know. I’m so ashamed of who I became. It went from him chasing me to me wanting his validation again or comfort. Again I’m sick of being told I deserve better that’s not changing anything. What am I doing wrong??? I went from being wifey material in his eyes to him regretting he ever said that about me. Again he made me the villain while he was in the wrong! People are insane, and it scares me. You can do everything right and give someone all your love and they can dispose of it like trash. I hope karma is real.  
  
I was always included in his plans, until I wasn't. he declined jobs to stay here in the same city as me because he didn't want to be ""Single"" but did not mind leaving me in the end, the confusion is a killer.

"But I also fucking detest it. 
This is such a stupid whine but I have made 7 different types of fudge for gifts this yule. Seven. Vanilla. Strawberry. Raspberry. Raisin. Blueberry. Dark chocolate. 

They're great gifts, and people always love then. That's the bit I love. Seeing someone enjoy something I've made with love and care. 

It is just SO time consuming. Fudge isn't something you can put on the oven top and go to when it needs attention. Like a needy toddler, fudge needs your WHOLE ATTENTION all the time. 
It can burn in a second. It can thicken in a second. It can ruin in a second. 
That is the bit I hate. Standing over a bubbling pot of hot sugar, condensed milk and butter and just praying to any deity that's listening that it won't bubble over and/or burn me. When it burns you, it keeps burning. It is like sweet, tasty napalm. Then it's the beating. I don't own a stand mixer so it's by hand. The sheer burn of my arm is enough to put me off for life. 

My husband thinks I should open my own fudge business. I'm pretty good at it. We'd call it ""What the fudge!"" 

But I just cannot do it for work. I cannot add it to my list of crafts to sell. I just can't. 

Whine over. 
If anyone wants any damned fudge, keep me in the mind for next year. I just made my last batch and now my forearm muscles look like I've been lifting weights for the past decade and it is purely because fudge, especially as it thickens, is like stirring bloody concrete.

"(21M) Back in summer, I decided to go to University a few cities away to get a more authentic college experience. We weren't able to fund any available on-campus living arrangements, so we had to rent out a room in a 2x2 apartment that was fairly pricey (averaged around $1500 a month in total), but manageable for my parents, as they said...

But while I was away at college, things have gotten pretty rough at home: my Dad, Grandma, and Dog have all had to undergo various types of survey and medical assistance for health issues, with my Grandma in particular having the most costly of problems due to arthritis and scoliosis rearing their ugly heads in the months I've been gone. My Dad and Dog's medical expense have been one thing, but my Grandma has had to have multiple doctor and hospital visits, including MRI's and emergency service visits, which are obviously very taxing money-wise. And things aren't looking too much better right now in her case; my Mom had to take an extended leave from work to become practically her full-timer caregiver, and right now my family is weighing whether or not to send Nana (Grandma) to an assisted living home or keep her here, both of which are incredibly costly scenarios.

Things have been really tough on my parents; and honestly, I think I've made things even harder for them.

I wasn't enjoying university as much as I'd thought fir a variety of reasons, so I decided to come home and continue pursuing education at Community College for the time being. Unfortunately, there have been some complications regarding the apartment we rented out: we weren't aware that property doesn't allow tenants to end leases early should they choose to move out before a lease term is up (my parents thought this was the case when we decided on the apartment), and unless we're able to find a replacement tenant, they're going to be stuck paying $1500 a month for an apartment I'm not using until May, which considering all the other financial woes happening right now, isn't exactly ideal.

My parents have told me to not worry about it too much, that it was their fault for not fully understanding the terms of the lease and to not worry about things outside of my control like all the medical stuff that's happened. But I still feel like they're going to be on hard times because of my decision to move away. I'm trying really hard to find someone to take over the lease to the apartment so my family doesn't have to pay for it, but I've had little luck so far (it seems like there's a bunch of other students also staying at that apartment place that're also trying to re-let their places, and apparently the place doesn't have the highest reputation). I've also been looking into getting a job to help pay for the expense of the apartment (at my Mom's request), but I'm not sure how well that's gonna go either: we only have two cars right now (third one was sold after I went to university) that both of my parents use for their jobs, so my options are limited to stuff in biking distance, and there really don't seem to be many available jobs for someone like me to begin with (my only past job experience is working parking at a Haunted house attraction last fall; that means I'm probably limited to entry level positions and retail, which there don't seem to be many of available). Plus, I'm going to be doing full-time college come January (granted, it's probably going to be online classes due to the aforementioned transportation situation, but it's still gonna be time-consuming), so whatever jobs I look at have to fit with my schedule. I really want to help my parents out, but I feel like there's so much working against me.

All and all, I just feel guilty. I really regret choosing to got to University and saddling my parents with an expensive apartment that's most likely going to make their financial situation even worse and I feel guilty that I can't help them more than I think I feasibly can. They've been through a lot these past few months, and are probably going to go through a lot more in the months to follow, I just wish my decisions didn't factor in to that. I hate that I may be contributing to making their lives harder.",My parents have it really rough right now money-wise and I feel like it's partly my fault.,18n2xe6,1703100410.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n2xe6/my_parents_have_it_really_rough_right_now/,
"~ TW: ab•se, r•pe and sui••de

Okay, so, this is a throwaway and i will be hiding names for privacy. I will call my friend “Beans"" and my partner “Muffin."" Recently Muffin and I decided to confront him after the months of difficulty I had with him.

Brief context of my history with Beans. He was friends with my ex, who was verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive himself. Ex introduced me to his friends and removed me from everyone I used to hang out with by spreading drama and lies about them trying to abuse or use me and him being the only “safe” person I knew. This worked and I cut most contact. Once I realised what was happening, I left ex, Beans was on my side. Ex told them all that I was physically abusive and that he was terrified of me. Eventually I blocked them all after providing evidence that he was the abusive one and showing them evidence of his sexual abuse and being met with death threats from a friend.

After this I started hanging out with Beans since he blocked them all and was being empathetic. He started to touch me up and I was uncomfortable with this. Second time meeting him he invited me to his and his partners flat so that we can have food. (I am autistic and suffer from multiples EDs so he knew that I struggle to eat in public) I ate my food and said we should go before long. More touching me up occurred and I told him I didn’t want sex. After about 20 minutes of pouting, being snappy, acting like I was leading him on and refusing to go because the day didn’t go “how he expected” I eventually broke. I let him do what he wanted. This wasn’t my first time being used like this and I was numb to it and just wanted to go home. This wasn’t the last time he did this, he even raped me multiple times. When I called him out on all of his bs I was emotionally manipulated with him making threats and saying he would hurt himself. I felt obligated to suck it up and ignore my own feelings.

I finally caught back up with some of the old friends and Muffin was one of them. I almost got myself into a tough spot with my ex and almost let him manipulate me into meeting up with him. This was after he had done something horrifically unforgivable to me that I cannot help but relive this horrid 'season of magic and giving.'

Well... time cut a couple of days and Beans confessed the feelings he had for a while to me. I’m considering a relationship so finally told Beans to back off. Doing so broke me as he did the same again but worse. He claimed he deserved me as he helped when I was suicidal, and threatened to end himself if I did this and broke his heart. This time I wasn’t having any of it.

This was months ago, me and Muffin are now happy together but it was still messing with me. It was haunting me and I was mortified that I was used. I was furious that Beans fucked around behind his partners back... Well, Beans’ partner has been hanging out with him more and he was acting completely oblivious to our history, which was destroying me, I hadn’t eaten a meal in 4 months and have an eating disorder. I had barely slept more than 2-3 and a half hours a night and when I got to sleep, I cried myself to sleep. Muffin had been talking to me about it for 2 weeks and we had decided to make things right. We drafted a message to talk to Beans (can post in comments for context if you wish) to get him to tell his partner, as me and Muffin were both victims of cheating and the guilt was a lot for me as I have been through a lot of other stuff too. Well, we prepped screenshots to send to her in case Beans refused and after a full meltdown from me, Muffin decided to send it.

Beans argued against it and tried to guilt us again but eventually after us not bidding or taking his empty suicide threats lightly he told her,  knowing it was either that or we tell her and she finds out he's a lying shit. She said it was unfixable and Beans gave her space and asked for space after threatening me to end his own life once again. I felt no guilt or empathy. He made his bed; he should lay in it. He knew the consequences of his actions and if he was too much of a coward to face them then he shouldn’t have used or abused me. I tore them apart and since have felt nothing.

This was a couple of months ago and now he's become a nice guy and he's acting entitled to other women's attention and complaining and crying to me when they have partners or don't give him the attention he wants, and I want to slap him. I want to slap him twenty times over. He's selfish and he uses people so he doesn't become ""lonely"" but I feel like he doesn't deserve a partner. He needs to grow up... BIG TIME! I want to tell him that he's heading towards being just like my ex and he needs to give his head a wobble but he doesn't take me seriously. I REALLY want to slap him. I destroyed his relationship and he still hasn't learnt?! I'm angry but feel hollow.

"what the caption says, i have no friends to talk to about this so i’ve officially succumbed to talking about it on this app. i look for no advice and not even a comment, i’m simply just a teenage girl finishing high school who has absolutely no REAL friends.

i have “friends” in real life, but we never speak outside of school. i had a somewhat social online life at one point.. but never an actual friend to rely on. it was always just men sweet talking me for a few minutes, and then asking to see my body. i’ve never had a real best friend or any close friend. i’ve never had someone that i can constantly go to just to talk. to ask about their day, or tell them about me, does anyone in this world even know my favorite color? my favorite food? will anyone ever care enough about me to ask?

i stay on my phone 24/7, yet it’s always dry. the closest i get to a message from someone is snapchat holiday snaps. it’s sickening and it’s made me lose motivation for everything, just a few encouraging words could be all i need to get back on track and fix my schooling and personal family relationships. i just need someone to remind me that it’s going to be okay and be genuine about it. i just need someone to care about me.

i’ve put up with this for so many years, but with it being near christmas and seasonal depression hitting everyone.. it’s so difficult to find a reason to be happy. sure i have my family, but even i have a strong feeling they don’t care about me the way they perceive, i’ve always been the emotionally unstable/anger issues child, but is that my fault? is it so wrong of me to be angry all the time when i live this constant cycle? my parents don’t even look at me with love, it’s just pity. 

i have no plans for after high school, i don’t want to leave my home and live alone and be even more miserable than i already am. i rather kill myself, which is kindly what i’m leaning towards. i just wish i weren’t so afraid about whether or not it would hurt.

"Though not what most people mean when they say that.

Three years ago I left an abusive relationship. I found out from the police that my girlfriend was a prime suspect in the murder of the partner she had told me was her father (the age difference was large enough this lie was easily believable). It was our anniversary, and two days before I had been looking at engagement rings.

Over the course of two hours I discovered that the only thing she had ever been 100% truthful about was her first name. Everything else was some mixture of untruth. For the first three years I had known her she had done everything possible to present herself as attractive to me, to manipulate me into a relationship, and she ultimately succeeded. She was a master at cold reading and managed to collect, infer, and dig out facts and minutiae about my life in such a way that I had no idea she was doing it until I thought she was my soulmate. All so she could have something on the side. For two years she had been slowly wedging me apart from my friends and family and she had almost succeeded in separating me from everyone else in my life. The last time we spoke I was wearing a wire, but I could never get her to admit to anything.

It's been over three years. I moved actoss the country. I threw out all our pictures, most of my stuff, I considered changing my name. I didn't want *anything* she had touched in my life ever again. I've wanted to move to another country, but never had the money. My life fell apart. I considered taking my own life. I went to my doctor for help and they told me to grow a spine (yes I reported her). I understand the concept of 'ongoing consent' in a way that I never thought possible before. Sometimes the mere memory of her face can stop me in my tracks like a punch in the stomach.

But, after years of quiet reflection and self work I've been finally starting to feel normal. I have a new job I really enjoy and I get along great with all my coworkers. We were out for drinks after work last week and I was talking with some of them I got to talking and the story of how I ended up on the coast came up, and everyone was shocked.

Ever since, I haven't slept well. Talking about it with people I know has been like taking a lid off of everything I thought I'd dealt with. I realised in that moment that despite swearing off if relationships for the time being when I moved here that I want to find someone, and I'm ready, but the last time I was single and didn't want to be, Bush was in office. And people tell me 'oh you're such a great guy' 'you don't deserve that' which is true, but, I don't know if it'sthe kind of help I need.

She was, by far, the absolute worst relationship I had ever been in, but even as an outlier she was part of a pattern. That's why I stayed single for so long, and now I'm scared that there is something genuinely repulsive about me on the inside, and no matter how much work I put in, no matter what I do it will never be enough. That I will either end up with someone who will mistreat me, or I will be alone.

I planned on moving out of state back to my parents as Adam had broken up with me over a misunderstanding where he thought I was cheating on him. I wasn't but I came to find out Michelle started messing around with Tex. I kept this info to myself as I didn't want to be homeless again. Months later, though, I had come to the decision to find my own place rather than stay with my parents out of state. Around this time, Michelle was facing eviction for non payment of rent.

"So it's a problem of a long distance cross-border relationship. We've met online in 2019 and quickly clicked together, so I've planned to travel to her country to meet her and to figure what to do from this point. However, the understandable worldwide issues of 2020 prevented me from doing anything about this until 2022.

At this point starting from 2020 I've been sitting home until general lockdowns were lifted up in 2022. Meanwhile we've been talking a lot on messaging services, and I've been kinda helping her to manage her abusive housing situation, and generally being supportive. Been buying her stuff to support her meanwhile.

By 2022 she managed to escape her housing situation, found a new job and was telling me that she would like me to move with her, been choosing a new rental place contingent on me moving with her. Jokes about a new bed, choosing bed frame with my input, saying stuff about like me taking my PS5 internationally, etc. This is where I kinda perked up, I was absolutely not against moving with her, however she also treated it without understanding the immigration system. The immigration system of her country is absolutely awful, the only reliable method is through marriage; other available methods are unreliable and are either a lottery with a 1.4% chance or a specialist visa lottery with like a 10% chance.

So on my first visit (multiple months) I've floated up with her that in that regard, we would need to marry and do a whole immigration process for me. And here everything went amok - stunned silence, and then saying that she would like to ""fool"" around and stuff about being polyamorous. I answered that I'm not against that, and that she can do that even if we're married, and it can be contingent on that. Outside of that, we had a lot of fun. But still, it was obvious that she really didn't understand all my immigration problems.

We kind of kept on a relationship. On next long visit in a middle of this year we even travelled together to another country for tourism and back. Since that we've talked a bit. Stuff happened like she actually avoided introducing me to her local friends, etc. Slowly less interest, more distancing, she stopped calling me a ""gf"", etc, and stuff. At that moment I've also told her that it's very hard for me to keep up with her. Everything is okay, we've never had any big conflict really, and so I've travelled back to my country with the plans of more visits.

However, a week ago this kinda ended. We've discussed our relationship and arrived at that she's now seeing me more as a friend than anything else, and just wants to remain friends now.

I absolutely understand that it's standard relationship stuff when people mellow to each other, and I cannot and should not, and never will control her desires and stuff.

At this point I've been personally and emotionally invested into the relationship so much, that staying just a bit of a long-distance friend feels absolutely awful. I absolutely do not know how to process this grief now. Been crying a lot, considering that also my disability (I'm not telling what is it) is kind of played a role in this. And I am absolutely hating my country of living now at this point too, felt like a rug pull. Just wishing to be at least a local friend to her, but even that is now impossible. I love her so so so so so much.","My girlfriend [29F] wanted me [34F] to move in with her, but refused to do anything that simplifies it.",18n0z0t,1703095563.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n0z0t/my_girlfriend_29f_wanted_me_34f_to_move_in_with/,
"Her name was Sashimi, a short haired siamese. Everything was fine until recent Saturday. She didn’t finish her dinner, low engery level, sleepy. She still followed me around the house. 
Monday morning, she skipped the whole meal, didn’t even bother to look at it nor left her bed. I scheduled the vet appointment at 6:30 that night and my boyfriend brought her in since I was at work. They ran a blood work and said come back tomorrow for the results. Told my boyfriend to keep and eye on her cause it looked like her blood level was quite low by looking at her gum. She was tired, I tried to hand feed her, she still came to me when I called her name.

Tuesday morning while getting ready to go to the vet again. She tried to hide under the couch. She couldn’t even stand up straight, she fell down when she tried to walk. We came to the vet and they said her red blood cells level was extremely low. And we saw blood coming from her anus. The vet said it was probably internal bleeding. She needed to go  to the emergency vet clinic for transfusion to keep her stable. From then they will do other tests to see if surgery is needed. 

My vet gave a call to the emergency place to check if they can take us in cause I asked them to do so. I wanted to bring her to emergency. They came back with a quote from $7000 to $9000 for the transfusion, if surgery, ultrasound and other test were required, it would be add-on on top of that 7-9000. They did require me to pay $7000 upfront. 
I didn’t want to lose her, but I don’t have $7000 ready on hand at that time to spend. I asked and they don’t accept installment payment. They don’t accept dividing payment to small portions. At first they said it’s going to be expensive, I thought the worst would be $5000 and I can definitely try to make it happen. But it was minimum 7000. We ended up not going to the emergency. The said the best to do for her right now was euthanized so she didn’t have to suffer in pain. Better than letting her bleed to death.
The vet said her situation was critical and she won’t be able to make it in the next 12-24hrs. And the chance of recovery if we decided to go to the emergency wasn’t that high either (I don’t know if what they said was true, or they just said that to make me feel better for deciding to say goodbye).

So it happened. I had to put her down.

I’ll live the rest of my life in guilt. I wish I had enough money to save her. I wish the emergency clinic accepted installment payment. I wish they had financing options. What if I decide to go to emergency clinic anyway? What if I beg them to save Sashimi and they can help me arrange payment? What if I didn’t decide not to go? What if I decide differently? I hate myself.
I was about the buy her Christmas presents. I planned to go hiking with her next summer cause she was very active and loved being outdoors. I planned to go to see the northern lights with her next year. She was just 3.5 years old. She had a long life ahead of her. There was so many things we need to do together. She didn’t deserve this. There was so many things she hadn’t seen. There was so many I wanted to do for her. She deserved more, the best long 18 years life. She was just a baby. I should’ve kept a closer look  at her. 

I’ll never forget the way she looked at me in that last moment. I don’t think I can ever forgive myself. I don’t think I can ever overcome this.

"My fiancé and I recently got engaged and I couldn’t be happier. 

We have a beautiful home and my kids live with us 50/50. Their dad and my fiancé get along so well. I couldn’t have asked for a better family dynamic. The only problem is my fiancé’s horrendous kids. 

A (7) is my fiancé’s daughter and is the most annoying human I’ve ever met. The kid never shuts the hell up and is constantly acting out for attention. She recently got suspended from school for refusing to listen to her teacher and screaming in the middle of class. 

Anytime she’s around I have to constantly remind her to wipe her nose, wash her hands, clean herself after she uses the toilet, put away her dishes, not throw her clothes all around the house, not fart on people  and keep her hands to herself. When we’re out in public it’s the most embarrassing experience. I have to remind her she’s not allowed to pull stuff off clothing racks, climb on counters, etc. 

B, his son is just as bad. He’s 6 and has been kicked out of every daycare/ school he’s been to for physically hurting other kids. He’s kicked, punch, spit on teachers and is the most disrespectful brat I’ve ever come across. The kid will be an inmate by the time he’s 14. 

A couple months back I sat my fiancé down after an incident involving my kids and his. I was direct and told him,” me or them.” To my shock he chose me. After giving their mom full custody we’ve been able to build so much in a short amount of time. 

My business is growing and his job is giving him a huge promotion. Our future is so promising so I have no idea why he wants to ruin it. 

We agreed his kids wouldn’t come to our destination wedding because we feared them ruining it. We agreed to keep our kids separate for the safety of my children. He really gets how horrible his kids are. 

When he brought up us going to Dallas with his kids I lots it. I began screaming about how I can’t handle spending a special day with people like that. He broke down and said he needed to spend time with his kids because their mom has open DCFS case. Apparently she doesn’t bathe them and lets them do whatever they went when they want. 

I feel for his kids. I really do. I just can’t bring myself to have our holiday ruined by them. 

My fiancé haven’t talked today and it’s starting to worry me. 

I feel like my world is falling apart.

Edit: yes I’m upset his kids want to come to Dallas. His possessed son has lunged at my 3 year old because he had a toy he wanted. I refuse to let some violent spawn from Satan around my children.

"I don't know when it started, but for a while now I have been having a problem with strangers sitting beside or in front of me in any open environment.

It's not like I resent them or their presence or anything, it's more like I have this uncontrollable urge to look/peek at them.

Like my head would turn towards their direction, and I would have to forcefully turn it to another side so that it doesn't look like I'm creepily peeking at said stranger. It would go on and on until my neck is starting to hurt from all the resisting.

I don't know about the stranger, but if I were in their shoes, I'll probably wonder why is this dude kept turning his head towards my direction for a brief peek at me?

And I'm also actively aware that they might be feeling that way because often times I would find myself in situation where the stranger (and sometimes their friends) will start looking my direction with curious looks on their faces. Idk but they probably were thinking I'm creepy AF.

I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I hate it whenever I'm doing this at a crowded restaurant. So I would always try to pick a less crowded restaurant/cafe, or a table where I'm facing a wall or a window, in such a way that no unfamiliar faces will appear within my field of view.

I don't think I have any social anxiety. I'm a fairly extroverted person who can socialize with groups of people just fine. But idk man, every time an incident happen, I felt so bad about myself.

"Yeah sorry for the title, but I really just don't even know how to name this post so bear with me a little lol

So during my life up until something like last year I had never been much confident. I wasn't overly self conscious, nor I had too much trouble getting to know people and making friendship but I did have certain insecurities.
I wasn't some kind of quiet kid, but I wasn't too exuberant either. To better describe it: I wouldn't have problems talking to other people, but I wouldn't be confident enough to, say, get in the middle of a dance circle or take any kind of spotlight.
I had some friends, but just a bunch. 
And then idk, but something changed. I began actually liking the way I looked. I actually had built some kind of confidence. I started to actually be outgoing. Hell, I even started to talking to girls and all. 

And not just that, but my life feels a lot more fast paced. A lot more new experiences, especially good ones that I kinda missed out on. But also more things to worry about, as well as more things to look forward to. 

To put it simply, it's like my life used to be a lot calmer and much more slow paced in every aspect: friendships, school, love and my future career. 

Now, I don't dislike this at all. If anything, I like this current version of myself a thousand times more than how I used to be.

"After college, I got an apartment with a friend. I hung out with him and his girlfriend pretty much constantly. I broke up with the girl I was seeing back at school, plus was in a new area where I didn’t have other friends. I was always the third wheel but we were always hanging out whether it was at the apartment or going out to eat or movie or whatever. In hindsight, it was a bit weird but I’m also not sure the two of them liked being alone together.

Fast forward a year. We’re still spending tons of time together. I start dating someone. The four of us hang out often, but I’m spending a lot of time alone with my new girlfriend. My buddy’s girlfriend gets jealous. She sends me some messages telling me that she likes me and wants to pursue something with me. I reject her for the two obvious reasons (my GF and she’s my buddy’s GF), but she wasn’t really my type anyway. We’re good friends though so I’m polite about it. I say something like “I don’t think that’s a good idea because of our SOs” instead of “No f-ing way, I think you’re garbage for even asking”. 

I know I need to tell my friend so I take screenshots of the messages, but don’t tell him right away. I never had to tell a friend this before and didn’t know how to deal with it. I was also trying to decide if she’s serious or maybe she just misses all of us hanging out together as much. Trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and maybe she wouldn’t actually cheat on him.

A couple days pass and I haven’t told my friend yet. He goes out of town for work. I’m home watching TV and his girlfriend comes over. We always hung out and she had her own key to our place, so completely normal. She brings up her messages and reiterates that she wants something with me. I’m telling her no and then she gets down on the floor and crawls towards me putting her head between my legs.

I literally leap off the couch and leave the apartment. Get in my car and call my girlfriend. “What are you doing? Washing your car? Oh, let me come help.” I tell my girlfriend most of what just happened. She didn’t particularly like this girl before, so this didn’t help.

My friend gets home the next day. I know I need to tell him but kind of difficult to tell your buddy that his girlfriend tried to go down on you. I let days pass and find myself avoiding both of them. The two of them break up a couple weeks later. I was relieved, but felt guilty for not telling him. I suspected he knew something was up, which made it even more difficult to bring up (why didn’t I tell him sooner?). I felt so bad that I never talked to him about why they broke up or even which one of them called it off. I just wanted to avoid the whole confrontation in case he knew that I hadn’t told him. 

This happened years ago and I still feel bad about it. We don’t talk anymore (unrelated, and yes I’m sure).

"I'm well aware this is going to rub some people the wrong way, but here it goes -

I really dislike it when my family offers to give me things second hand. It mostly comes into play when I'll mention something about needing a new piece of furniture for the house, or that I need a new type of clothes (ex. I need a new sweater for work) or that I'm looking for something in particular.

Almost 100% of the time, they will say - ""Oh! I have that and I can give it to you!"" In the past, I would sometimes take them up on it, and then end up with an apartment or house full of old stuff. If I say no, it's starts this whole negotiation process where I have to say no repeatedly like I'm trying to cancel a subscription service and talking to customer support and they are trying to upsell me lol

I appreciate that people want to help me out, and it's usually coming from a good place - but the part that bothers me is that it gets to the point where I don't have the ability to pick out things that suit my own style, or pursue my own likes because my family tries to foist things on me the second I say something. The other problem, is once I take it - they will automatically buy something new. So everyone always gets new things, and I well....don't because at that point I either have the responsibility to trying to figure out how to get rid of it or don't have the space.

It's also happened multiple times where I'll invite them over to my house - if I don't have something or enough of something, they will just pick it up a thrift store or estate sale without asking me if I want it and bring it over. Even when I've told them that I already had plans to pick it up and I have a specific kind or style in mind.

I have a nice job, make good money, and want to buy things for myself! Occasionally I buy used, but sometimes I like new things. I have my own style, likes and dislikes, and don't want to always feel guilted into taking something. I don't feel like it makes me a jerk to say no because I want to express my own feelings and pursue my own aesthetic.

The part that frustrates me the most - if I give it away later on, then they get really upset if I don't have it anymore. Or worse - they will ask for it back 5 years later like my house is freaking long-term storage for everyone.

I know it sounds like I'm out of touch, like I'm ungrateful, but really i don't think a perfect cGPA will even satisfy me. I see my issues, I have been to therapy for years, I genuinely try my best to resolve these inner conflicts. 

I'm scared. I have no one to talk to. I'm scared my cGPA will drop. I'm scared I'll be alone forever. I'm scared no community will want me. I'm scared I'm not an attractive hire for employers. I'm scared I'm lost, and it's too late to turn back. More importantly, I'm scared because deep down, I hate myself. I hate myself so much that all of these failures serve as evidence that I don't deserve to be loved.

"I'm very insecure about my physical attributes. I'm a 5'2"" adult male. I'm very weak physically and I don't know how good I look, but based on the fact that I have literally received zero compliments about my looks, I'm guessing I'm not very attractive.

I try very hard everyday, to not give a fuck about how short I am, but it is very hard to do when literally all my life, I have been mocked for how short I am. I don't know what's funny about it, but my family and friends find it amusing to say that I am very short, I'm a toddler, I can be easily overpowered by a kindergartener and how I will literally have no relationship because girls don't want to date shorter guys.

I don't act offended or hurt around them, instead I laugh with them, cause acting hurt would instead give more power to them. 

But, I would be lying to myself if I tell that I'm not bothered by it. It isn't under my control. I know that the world will not stop for me because of my height, but it hurts. And I think it gets reflected in my confidence.

Also, I'm extremely weak for someone my age. This is because I stopped playing sports and running when I was in grade 9. But, this doesn't bother me because I know that if I workout, I can probably be a lot stronger than I am.

"I female 25 discovered that my ex boyfriend male 26 had been cheating on me for 5 months, I was really devastated and felt a lot of rage inside me, especially after buying him a new playstation 5 since he wanted one but couldn't afford it. I was saving up a lot of money to buy him the console with some games.

We've been dating for 3 years and living together for a year and a half, I immediately kicked him out after his side girl messaged me apologizing not knowing that he had a girlfriend, I didn't believe her because I trusted my boyfriend a lot but she came with receipts. They were a lot of messages where he flirted with her and sent n**ds, I was disgusted, really disgusted.

The worst part is when I confronted him, he didn't even try to deny it and called me boring, he insulted me a lot, saying I was no fun and he deserves better. I was really enraged and for the first time, I slapped him, he was shocked so was I, because I was never violent with him and always tried to solve things quietly but he made my blood boil.

I started screaming at him that he doesn't do anything around here and never paid rent because he's a lazy jobless piece of shit who can't even bother looking for a decent job, at one point I mentioned how he will never get the ps5 that I bought and return it soon to the store, he looked like a deer in headlights. 

That bastard, he immediately changed his attitude and acted sorry, started apologizing and crying, saying he never meant to cheat and promised he would make it up to me. He's a disgusting pig, he never cared for my feelings, he only cared when I mentioned something he wanted, such hypocrisy.

I wasted no time and kicked him out, he's still sending me a lot of texts filled with apologies and even an ugly photo of him crying, I told him to not waist his time because he won't get the ps5, we're done then I blocked him.

I won't take the ps5, I already have one but I remembered that my parents were  planning on buying it for my little brother, the plan was going to be them buying the ps5 and I will buy the games for it with an extra ps store gift card but looks like I will give my parents a call and tell them there's a change in our plans for my brother's gift.",I discovered that my boyfriend is cheating after buying him an expensive Christmas gift,18mxa1j,1703086257.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mxa1j/i_discovered_that_my_boyfriend_is_cheating_after/,
"To make a very long story as short as possible, my sister (32F) and I (29F) have never had a great relationship. I grew up adoring her and always wanting to be around her, and she grew up calling me ""stupid little idiot"" and doing her best to ignore me. She was my father's favorite and wasn't afraid to happily accept her place and rub it in my face on occasion. 

The favoritism extended to my mother and her family, and I spent 29 years living in her shadow. She never tried to defend or protect me growing up, and often seemed to enjoy my tears when she told me of yet another gift dad had given her and not me. 

It's also worth noting that my father physically, emotionally, psychologically, and sexually abused my mother and I, but only subjected my sister to the emotional side of things occasionally, usually in the form of guilt tripping and manipulation. 

For the longest time I tried to figure out what was wrong with me and so great about her, but I never could figure it out. Besides the psychological damage from my childhood and a less than attractive face and body, I can't tell what's so wrong with me. No one wants to explain it to me either. 

 In 2020 my mother's health failed in a big way (congestive heart failure and emergency open heart surgery), and my sister refused to visit my mother before or after her surgery. My mother could have easily died, almost did die a few times from intense complications, and has not been the same since. During her stay I regularly lied to my mother on my sister's behalf, trying to ensure that she didn't know that my sister really was ignoring her. I kept begging my sister to come see my mother, but she refused. 

During this time my sister also refused to give me a ride to the hospital that was 30 minutes from our home, and I had to teach myself how to drive to be there for my mother (I don't have a license). I also had to drive myself to the ER when my stress migraine lasted longer than a week. That night I texted my sister begging her to help me with my mother, and she left me on read. I considered that to be my sister fully abandoning my mother and I, and decided enough was enough. I would cut her out of my life once and for all. 

When my mother finally was able to come
home after several months, I became her full time caregiver. I helped nurse her back to relatively stable health, and finally told her the truth about my sister. She was heartbroken, but eventually expressed missing my sister. I wholeheartedly encouraged her to have a relationship with my sister regardless of how she'd mistreated us, and she eventually did. If I hadn't been encouraging they never would have spoken again, and I don't know if my sister knows that, or if she'd care if she did. 

Recently my mother had asked my sister if she'd want to fix our relationship as all she's ever had to do is offer an apology and some accountability for her actions, and my sister blew up at my mother and threatened to not speak to her again if she mentioned me again. She had apparently decided that I was a monster somewhere along the line, despite her being the one to act like one. 

My sister moved far away recently, and my mother had me buy and mail her and her spouse Christmas gifts because my mother isn't capable of a lot anymore. I did, even happily wrapping the gifts, and texted her the tracking info so she wouldn't have to worry about it. She texted back ""ok"" and nothing else, and that really upset me. It just reminded me of how things really are, and that no amount of kindness from me will ever change her attitude. 

It hurts to know that my sister thinks so poorly of me, and that even a simple, kind gesture or text from me is enough to piss her off. I mourn our relationship, and mourn the fact that my infant daughter will never meet her aunt. I wish I had an easier time accepting who my sister is, but it hurts and I don't know how to move forward from it.","My sister hates me, and I've decided I hate her too.",18mx4e2,1703085860.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mx4e2/my_sister_hates_me_and_ive_decided_i_hate_her_too/,
"I was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma in my early 20s. It was a very aggressive form of cancer, but luckily (if you can call it that), it happened to be a particularly treatable subclass of NH lymphoma with a really good prognosis. Did chemo for 8 months. It was brutal. In-patient for 5 days at a time, spaced out every 3 weeks. Long story short, I made it out the other side okay, and have been getting PET scans for the last 5 years which all confirm I am indeed in remission. My oncologist considers me “cured”. Hurray lol

Fast forward to now, I’m in my late 20s (about 5 years later). I went through a rough breakup about a year ago, and I started smoking cigs occasionally on the weekends. Occasionally became daily, habitual use. This has been going on for close to a year. My friends know and have not been too judgmental (breakup situation), but all expect I will quit soon.

I’ve kept it a secret from my family. They would be so disappointed and upset with me. Frankly, I am too sometimes.  My intention is to quit, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Sometimes I feel like I was so lucky to escape a dire situation, and now I’m self-sabotaging and provoking a chance at a cancer relapse. Makes me feel guilty and incredibly stupid. 

Besides getting this off my chest, guess I’m also wondering if anyone here has known folks in a similar position, or if you randomly know about how likely it is that I have re-given myself cancer after smoking for about 10 months (given my prior medical history). Most times I am doing fine, but definitely have some nights where I am paralyzed with fear at the possibility of going through all of that again (or worse).

"The house is always spotless whenever her house keeper comes over. My mother compulsively cleans. Last year I moved down the street from her so I’m around her condo quite often. On multiple occasions I’ve come into the house to find the housekeeper watching TV during her paid hours. My mother doesn’t like to see the bad in people and she always leaves her condo to “get out of her way”. I can tell the housekeeper is visibly annoyed that I am around because she can’t just chill on the sofa like she used to. Do I say something to her or just let their weird little codependent relationship continue? I think my mother believes she’s being charitable to a friend. But that woman is not her friend. She’s her employee. maybe my mother is missing something culturally? due to the fact I was married to a Filipina woman, with a fleet of Filipina friends, I’m very familiar with what passive aggressive “politeness” looks like.

"Hi everyone, I (23M) just wanted to know if I should feel guilty. My girlfriend (23F) has always had a bad relationship with her family. Mom being emotional and physically abusive, beating her up multiple times like ripping her hair out during physically attacking her and kicking her in the chest. Yelling at her, calling scum and sick. 

Saying she’s ungrateful and that her younger brother is the favorite child over her. Saying that she doesn’t like her, and doesn’t r because she looks like her dad who she hates. When she cries, if they hear her, they tell her to shut up because she’s too loud and can wake her younger brother up who’s 5. Such things as that. Since I came into the picture when I attended UCLA and started dating her, her parents and her relationship got worse. Her mom threatened to get me hurt by her family because she didn’t want her daughter getting any ideas running off with me. Just things got even worse since I’ve been around, 2x more emotional and verbal abuse, 2x more physical attacks. 

Parents say she should be lucky that they give her a place to stay and make her pay cheap rent, and that she has barely any responsibilities. Since then, she’s made this decision to get away from them and move to New York with her jobs manager helping with this process and I kinda feel guilty and responsible that she came here, and basically will have no family. They told her she has to be out the house by November 2024, and she can’t live with them since they’re moving to Texas. 

I’m the only person she has and I just don’t know if it’s my fault and if I’m making her life worse now she has no one but me.

My boyfriend (30m) and I (29f) have been together since 2019 it wad a whirlwind romance to say the least I've known him high school and always had a major crush on him in high school. We got together and everything was great he had a kid from a previous relationship and so did I. About 8mo after starting our relationship we moved in together everything was good then he lost his job and then covid hit and everything went to he'll. He did get a new job right around the time covid officially became a thing like I think maybe 2 or 3 weeks before the shut down and he was essential worker with the job he was in. I was however laid off because I was not in that shut down we found I was pregnant with our son. So I stayed off of work and collected unemployment because I have a high chance of miscarrying very easily and my job was very hard on my body I didn't want to risk a miscarriage and my work let me stay off of work. Well during that time I didn't know it but my boyfriend started to gamble I paid most of the bills with my unemployment and didn't pay attention to what he was spending his money on I see now that was obviously a mistake. Well around August of 2020 I developed a blood clot in my leg due to the pregnancy so I had to technically quit my job so I could no longer collect unemployment and my boyfriend wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I should've seen the red flags there I should've realized he just wanted to make it so I couldn't leave him. Over this time he because very abusive he punched me in the face and locked my tooth out. He would choke me until I almost passed out I found out later he was also smoking meth which is probably why he was so violent all the time because when he didn't have money to get anymore he would go through withdrawals. Well Dec came and I had our son. Things were alright there but he was still gambling and I didn't know because he was still paying the bills for the most part. He was still pretty violent but I learned to avoid what triggers him for the most part. Fast forward to 2021-2022 he started stealing from stores and I'm not talking like food I'm talking like HUGE lego sets so he could sell them for money so he could gamble more because his gambling got so out of control he was no longer able to work and gamble while still paying the bills. Then he lost his job then he found a job and 3 months later got fired then found job got fired from there after 3 months then found another job and you guessed it got fired. He went through at least 6 jobs in less than a year. He was also caught stealing many times he now had a felony record. In sep of 2022 I found my mom dead on her floor then a week later it came out my daughters father was molesting his 2nd cousin then a week later my cat died. Now I know the cat dying seems insignificant compared to everything else but it was just added to the pile of shit that my life was. My boyfriend was gambling constantly I couldn't pay bills we almost got evicted many times our power had been shut off our phones had been shut off we couldn't pay for groceries now I'm sure you're asking why I didn't leave well its not that simple unfortunately I had and still have no income I'm a stay at home mom I have no family who will help me the only person who would help me died. I did get some money after my mom passed away but my boyfriend gambled it away. Every last penny he gambled it away. I was left with nothing and I fell further into a depression and I'm still in a depression. Now his stealing did catch up to him and he was sentenced to 60 days in jail in May of this year and wad released early he spent 45 days in jail I believe. He got a good paying job and he actually stopped gambling he was doing really good for a while then he started to gamble again and he's still doing it. I haven't been able to pay any bills and he just doesn't care he blames me saying that my anger is why he gambles but he never stops to ask me why I'm angry. He doesn't care that I'm drowning because I always have to help him and hold him for his actions and his feelings but I'm never allowed to have feelings I'm drowning and I don't know what I can do to make things better. I can't just leave its hard to leave when you have no income and 2 kids. None of my family will help me and his family just enables him which makes it worse.

"My(32F) bf(32M) and I have been together for a little over 2 years now, before we dated he was engaged to this girl who I’ll call Anna(27F).

Him and Anna met while he was in the peace corp in South America where she is from, they only dated for about a year, he proposed to her just 5 months into the relationship and from what I’ve heard from some of his friends he was completely head over heels for her, they broke up because she said she was not ready to leave everything and come to the US with him and she was just afraid of them not working out and she would be stuck and they were too different, etc; he was devastated, he told me that was the most depressing time of his life and it took him almost a year or more to fully move on from her since he tried to get back with her after a couple months and she told him she didn’t want to get back with him and she had met someone, she met this person after they were done and he believes her.

Now this all happened in 2018, fast forward to the present after he “moved on” they kept a civil relationship since he said he now understands he was asking too much from her, etc, and she is just a good friend apparently she was also a foreigner to the country where they met so they were all they had and it created a bond that lasted after the breakup.

Everything was fine with that until she moved to the same city than us 8 months ago, one of her best friends lives here and she moved in with her, she told him about it about 5 months ago and he asked me if I would be okay with all us hanging out and I said yes because I trust him and he swears they’re just friends, well I met her and this girl is a very typical attractive looking Latina, long dark hair, nice body, etc, she’s also super nice and I genuinely think that at least from her there’s no feelings towards him, we’ve hung out a couple times and she befriended some of our girlfriends that are also single.

My issue started about  a month ago when one of friends brothers met her and asked her out, when he found out Anna was my bf’s ex he decided to ask him if he was okay with it since they’re friends too, he said he was okay but somehow I feel he wasn’t, I noticed he was jealous, a feeling I’ve never seen in him, his demeanor and attitude and even his mood changed after that question, well this guy and Anna have been on a couple dates by now because they seem to get along well and my bf have completely stopped hanging out with that group of friends, he is avoiding every encounter where he knows they will be.

Before anyone asks yes I talked to him and he said it has nothing to do with that and he’s just not being in the mood to go out.

I think he still has feelings for her somehow, I mean he proposed to her after 5 months, it took him more time to move of from her than they were even together for.

"I am 25F. Ever since I've known myself I have felt weird regarding sex. I have this constant feeling of being molested at some point I just don't remember anything specific to sexual abuse. I want to dig deeper into this feeling because it's beginning to affect my sex life. I disassociate and I get panicky sometimes. I just can't get out of my head. I feel very ashamed. Usually I have to get drunk or high to enjoy the sex and to reach the O faster. 
I remember I started to sleep with my sister at the age of 7-8. Before that I slept in my parents room with them on their bed. Usually I slept against a wall, my mum in the middle and my dad on the end. Alot of the times I would wake up to them having sex, the bed moving, the smells, moaning and panting and their hands accidently touching my arm etc. I remember being shocked the first time but after i would just cry silently and pray for it to end and literally roll into the space between the wall and bed. I remember wishing i could just fall through the hole so i can disappear. Usually when they're done my mum would roll me back towards her and hug me tightly because in her mind i assume she was scared i rolled off the bed, but in mine, all i could remember is her being sweaty and me feeling gross.
At 5yo i remember being very interested in figuring out what sex was, i knew they were having sex i just didnt know what sex contained. This led to me and a girl my age experimenting and touching each other and this haunts me to date. I worry if maybe I unconsciously molested her however I didn't know about consent at that age. And I feel very guilty to date.
Recalling these memories in detail now are so cringey and it's so weird because parents having sex should be a normal thing but yet it makes me feel horrible just remembering the sounds etc. I think this is why I disassociate during sex, because so much of it makes me remember what they were doing and how I felt at that young age that it just creeps me out and I ruin the mood. Could this memory be why I feel this way now? How do I move past it?

"Its not really bad so don't assume a really dramatic story. Its just a weird habit. I'm with my girlfriend since high school and we're both 23 now. They say that ""Opposites attract"" and in our relationship its definitely true. I was always a bit more nerdy. I'm not that interested in sports and only do what one person should do to stay healthy. I also work from home. My girlfriend on the other side is into sports and she is not only taller but also much stronger than me. 

I don't have a problem with that but she has a weird of showing off to say the least. Its the way she kisses. Even though I kinda like it not gonna lie its also a bit scary sometimes. Of course she doesn't do this in public but when we're at home and she wants a kiss or I want a kiss she lifts me up and carries me to either the bed or the couch depending on the room we're in. Then she gets on top of me, pins my arms over my head with one hand while grabbing my throat with the other one and then she starts kissing me all over my face. Its confusing sometimes because she also does it before having intercourse so its not easy to tell if she wants to have sex or just eat my face. This goes on for about five minutes before she lets me go.

Even though I like it its kinda scary sometimes because she enjoys that WAY too much but I let you decide if its weird or not.

"So I(33F) went on solotravel this year and met a guy (25M) I found super attractive when I had dinner, while he was dining also alone next table. I must confess he was one of the very few guys I met in life that would turn me on immediately, I could feel the same from him. So that night I ended up in his hotel room, as we were casually talking I noticed his jewellery, as he was describing it he mentioned it was from his gf, he stammered and he turned his back at me...then it was the time when things went uncomfortable. 

I started having a moral crisis in my head and lose my mood, but he pretended he said nothing, and suggested showering together. I refused and wanted to leave while I was debating in my head what would I do? Should I go ahead with him as I was leaving in a few days anyways or should I just run to the door as he wanted me to stay over. Confronting was out of the question as i had safety concern. But as he approached me and landed a kiss, I felt gross, it was deeply from my body and mind that I felt ""ewwwwww""!

I told him let's end it, and he turned all mad and nasty blaming me for not trusting him, and tease him, and slapped on my butt claiming it is a punishment, I quickly grabbed my stuff and left the place as I didn't feel safe anymore, he caught up at the door and asked me to go back, saying he wouldn't do anything. My first instinct was : fuking leave the place. So I left.

Afterwards I had a hard time getting over it, was I wrong? And what could I do better?",Am I a turnoff?,18mvnqe,1703081951.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mvnqe/am_i_a_turnoff/,
"Throwaway and I refuse to tell anyone I know so I’m putting it here. 

I was turning right onto a main road from a stop sign. I stopped at the line before the crosswalk. I looked right, looked left, looked right again, looked left to wait for the car on the main road to pass, looked right again and as I was starting my turn I instantly stopped when I saw the guy and hit him head on. I’m always checking so much before I go I have no idea how I even missed him walking down the street let alone get close enough to be in the crosswalk. He appeared out of nowhere. He flipped me off but I barely tapped him and said sorry a billion times and he just walked away without saying anything. 

I’m kinda scared and never want to drive again after this. I can’t imagine what would’ve happened had I not checked a bunch in the first place and didn’t notice him at all and kept going.

"Apologies if this gets confusing.  Im not a good writer and on mobile. Fake names will be used cause, obviously. I feel dumb for saying this because I'm almost 29 years old, but I've felt like this for a long time. Mine (f 28) and my sister Sarah's (f 31) parents divorced when I was 10 and she was 13. Our dad had such a bad temper my mom's daughter, my half sister Rose, (f 36) decided to go move in with our grandmother before I was even born. When I was 13 my dad remarried my stepmom, Beth. She had no kids and due to my mom having a hard time financially, Sarah and I moved in with dad and Beth. Now, to be clear, I never disliked Beth. I actually LOVE Beth now. But back in my teen days we didn't get along. Once Sarah turned 18 she moved back in with our mom.  I ended up getting SENT back to live with my mom because I got caught shoplifting. It's alright though,  I never wanted to leave my mom's. Anyway, it was soon before I was sent back to my mom's that my dad and Beth announced they were having a baby. I was SO EXCITED! I had wanted a younger siblings since I could first talk! And soon enough my little brother Hunter was born. Everything was good enough as you could expect. I lived 2 hours away but when Sarah and I visited my dad on the weekends he always did stuff with us. And he always called us now and then. Once I turned 18 my little sister Ruby was born! I absolutely love these kids! But, I feel like my dad has forgotten that he has adult kids too. Once I graduated high school he stopped calling as much, checking in on both me and Sarah, spending time with us. I ask him multiple times about this and he says things like ""you know I'm here if you need me"" and ""you're adults I figure you're busy"". I mean, I see my friends on Facebook spending time with their parents. Back when one of the spiderman movies came out i was expecting to go see it with him because weve seen EVERY SINGLE midnight premiere. Its always been a special bond we have.  But instead he took my brother and didn't even invite me to join them.  He responded to this with ""don't tell me you're jealous of a kid?"" I wonder if I'm blowing this out of proportion.

"I, a 15 year old trans girl can safely say that dealing with these 'people' in high school is single-handedly the most draining thing that I've ever had to put up with. All I want to do is exist and yet the vast majority of my classmates have a problem with it. The ratio of being called a 'he' to a 'she' is so unbalanced it's unreal, and I don't even remotely look like a guy (I've never been misgendered in public.) And, it's happened 2 times in front of teachers, yet nothing was done about it whatsoever.

I truly don't understand what is so difficult for these 'people' to treat another student with an ounce of respect, it takes more effort to purposefully call a female-presenting person a 'he' than it does a 'she', especially if you've NEVER spoke to that person before. Hell, even a new kid who got in with the popular boys refers to me as a 'he' despite the fact I've been transitioned longer than he's been at the school itself.

Also, probably important to note that this isn't a case of people readjusting to my preferred pronouns, I've been out nearly a year and was very often absent before that. I'm not a hot topic at my school either. My social presence is about as noticeable as a nice smell at a gaming convention.

"i am so tired

i have let down myself and all the dreams and aspirations i once had, I am still young (16m) but i have done short of nothing in life. I feel as ive always been a side character in everyone else’s story, Never ever had really close friends whom i had good inside jokes with never really perfectly fit in always had to mould myself to sort of fit in, no one really likes me or hates me i just sort of exist. I feel bad about my mind i have gotten addicted to jacking off and cant get rid of it no matter what i do, and i want to get better and ive given it so many attempts now that it just seems pointless and hopeless, I know this may sound cliche and crazy to you older people since im very young but i really sometimes wish to end it all, i am not a good son even when i try to be i end up being rude, annoyed and secretive to my good parents who deserved a much better son who isnt so indifferent and rude and is just a burden, I am not a good person either im jealous, self obsessed ,a narcissist, rude, pompous perhaps and idk and i want to change all that desperately but it seems nothing short of impossible since about a million attempts end up in me relapsing, giving up and being a b1tch. 

i want to do something great be someone great and i used to be able to believe that i will and that i was special but this life keeps shootingthese difficult shots and i keep taking them and bleeding and one day i feel ill just bleed out
i have never been able to give something my all
i always give. up prematurely and idk i am lazy too. Though ive been good in school and stuff but im just losing the point of it anymore like what the fuck does it matter if u get an a or a + or a b or u fail (always been a straight a student ) 


i have a major exam next year its my countries law qualification exam sort of and it determines the college you get i thought i really wanted to be a lawyer i was sure as fuck but now its just eh im confused and definitely scared asf seeing my competition people without any preparation giving the exam are getting scores that the top 10 scorers of this year had when attempting the question paper and im even scared to attempt this years paper because in my mind it is a measure of my capabilities and my chance to get my desired college and i am utterly lost i cant sit for an hour without going to the dark place in my head and i cant stop overthinking and ive never ever cried which may seem weird but i probably cried last time when i was 5 or something but i always want to let it all out but i just dont. And i just keep being a softie and let myself go into my anxious depressed self and just give up easily now theres not much in my life to feel good about as the things that are good are the people im letting down by not doing my work. 


I had a girlfriend last year whom i ended the relationship with for some reason i cant remember it was messy , we still talk sometimes and idk if we should as it might distract me from my goals and it’s difficult to be in this new gen z world without letting broken ideologies influence you like social media paints as all girls always cheat and stuff.  idk what im saying this is the first time ive ever put what i think into something
also ignore my bad english ik its bad.

Multi-hour FaceTimes doing homework and getting sidetracked by conversations, playing computer games together for 5 hours at a time. We became best friends. Then we hit a week where everything went wrong. Our friendship was almost lost forever, but he gave me a second chance. He found out, through me, that I had feelings for him but I’ve told him I don’t feel them anymore. He’s broken up with his girlfriend, the day I told him how I felt and explained that I couldn’t be his friend, but has continued to say he has no intentions towards me, and I genuinely don’t have intentions towards him.

"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together for almost 8 months, and it's been amazing. We're each other's firsts on several things.
 
It's not uncommon for us to have days where we're not really actively doing much but we just hang around, cuddle and talk. Recently we had one of those days, but something was different. Normally we talk about silly/funny stuff or telling stories and recalling memories, either of us together or from before we met. Some days we're feeling a little more serious, and we tend to talk about things going on in the world, or thought-provoking questions and such. But yesterday, we got much more personal. I guess we were feeling vulnerable, we both opened up about a lot of things and talked for hours and hours.
 
At one point I was reminiscing about my childhood cats who've passed away. When I was finished, I saw my bf get a bit emotional. I hugged him and he said he got reminded of his own childhood cats, I could hear his voice break as he was talking. I'd never seen that side of him before. Later in the evening I asked if that was the first time I'd seen him cry. He said it wasn't quite crying with actual tears, but it was close, and he was really emotional. I asked if he just normally doesn't get very emotional or if he's ever suppressed it, but he assured me he hasn't done that, just that he's usually a pretty calm, pragmatic and positive person so it doesn't happen often.
 
It felt really comforting to know that he felt safe and comfortable enough with me to show that emotional side of himself, and I told him as such too. We continued talking until well after midnight, and it really made us understand each other and get closer to each other. I truly felt heard and understood when I talked about my own things, I even told him things I'd never told anyone before.
 
Normally on the less serious days I talk more than he does, but today it was the other way around. At some point he apologized for talking so much, but I assured him that I had no problem with it and wanted him to keep going. He told me that he's happy that I want to listen to him. Even though we'd also talked about some much heavier topics than other days, by the end of the day I felt really good, almost like I was lighter, it was really cathartic. I laid in his arms after some good times (wink wink), and I just felt so amazing, mentally and physically, that I teared up. Tears of joy running down my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I felt like that in my life. And I want to shout it out into the Reddit void.

"(Sorry this is so long, I hope you wil read) 

I (23 F) wanted to mention first- I know the right thing to do is confront my dad, but it has it been so hard for me to justify doing it. I told one of my brothers and we have discussed things to do, and we had trouble deciding if us getting in the middle will do more harm than good. My parents have a terrible relationship - I honestly think they are only staying together because of financials, and I have a small hint that my dad knows about this and is only staying while they finacially support my younger brother through college and myself through grad school. They have 3 kids including me and we are all 21+ and moved out/ in college. My mom is a heavy drinker and that is a whole other issue that has caused a ton of turmoil in our house. I have confirmed my dad is not cheating- I’ve endlessly snooped his phone, have his location and he works a ton and only goes out with my mom in our town.

Anyway, after I graduated college I moved back home and there was one week my dad went to go pick up my brother from college and was gone for a week and my mom went on what I can only describe as a bender while on her time off of work. I just know the drinking was more extreme than usual because my dad isn’t there to make judgements or start fights. I got super curious why she would stay out after work and then one night she did not come home which was extremely out of the ordinary. She said it was a “work meeting”, but I can see right through the lie. Sooo I snooped through her phone and at first I didn’t see anything suspicious until I saw what’s app. 

There was a contact labeled “Maria” but it was a man’s picture. First thing I saw my heart dropped and it was classic cheating texts like “ when can I see you next ” and more disgusting shit. I scroll more up there were full sexts and when I got even further there were even pictures of my mom on our own house and he was taking the picture and I was so beyond disgusted that a strange man was in our house before cheating with my mom. 

But this was not nearly what made me want to throw up. I know I should I have saved myself and stop digging but I was too deep in. I see a string of messages where when I left for college and she’s texting him saying she found my old vibrator (whoops. I wondered where that disappeared to) and he started saying some dirty things and that was the first thing that grossed me out so bad. (Do not worry. I never saw that vibrator again) 

THEN…. I see a screenshot of my instagram and the picture was a bikini picture of me…..

** I am not gonna lie… I post some thirst traps on my instagram because I am a confident young girl, I know I look good, and I am allowed to post whatever I want. 

And yes, I know there are creeps on this internet, I don’t even get bothered by thirsty men dms but the most sick fucking part is that my mom sent the screenshot to him and wrote “look at my daughter, she has an ass like mine.” 

…….. first of all…. No you dont.

But he responds some creepy shit and like hollering at me saying give her my number and bull shit and my mom goes “hahaha stop that’s my daughter” 
Besides the fact that she sent it to him, I was beyond disgusted and hurt that she was making a joke about this. I blocked my mother from seeing all my social media and put myself on private and sifted through all my followers. I literally can’t look at her the same and I have been a massive bitch to her ever since which is very out of my character. 

This happened some time ago and of course I feel so horrible for this but we did have held off confronting my mom or dad, only because my family cannot get turned  upside down at the moment. But I have still been deeply disturbed by specifics and comments about me. 

And though I said I have a slight feeling my dad could know about my mother’s infidelity …. My dad is very protective of his children and If he knew about the disgusting conversation about me, that man should fear for his life.

Can I get some advice on how to approach this? Especially how to deal with this sick feeling I have. I still love my mom but the resentment I have grown is super unsettling. I want to know if anyone has advice for are other ways of going about telling our knowledge of this information without creating a hostile environment. In no way do I want to never have a relationship with my mother, she would die for her kids and she loves us I know this. But she is being tremendously selfish.

also nursing sounds like a fucking drag n I don’t want to go to uni indecisive I want to be sure

i was thinking maybe doing a career in business but idek I just don’t know

i don’t have the right grades to go to uni so I have to do an access course and I have to decide now because I only have little time to complete the access course and apply for uni b4 uni starts again next year

I’ve done so many quizzes and things on what career path is best for me but I still cant decide

My ex boyfriend of 2 years (19M) broke up with me (19F)  like some days ago and doesn’t want me to be at his birthday when he invited instead a junkie girl (she was even addicted to heroine) he knew at a party like 1 month ago, a friend of her he doesn’t even know, and his long-distance best friend.
They will go to an event and their program is to take drugs all night long, and since I quit geeking some time ago, I feel my presence would be out of place.

In reality I can’t find an emotion who suits to describe what I’m really feeling, a mix of angered thoughts and confusion.
I don’t know what I did wrong to deserve a similar treatment, being treated as a perfect stranger, then a random girl (to be clear she’s in a relationship of 4 years) he became friends with in like one month preferred over me. because our relationship was deep and very important to both of us.

"As far as I can remember, I've wanted to die. The first time I remember actively thinking about ending my life I was 8, standing in front of a mirror with a screwdriver to my throat and wondering if that would do it. I've always told myself that I would end it before I was 30, which I just turned this year.  
  
 ""Think about the people who love you."" This only makes me more angry. I'm so resentful of the fact that I have to literally mourn waking up every morning just because my loss will make people sad for a few months. They might have some kind of guilt for awhile, but they will get over it. I am not important enough in anyone's life to leave any kind of lasting impact. The only thing that's kept me alive is the thought of my family's reactions, they've always been really violent and I'm afraid that it would result in my dad killing my mom. But now, he is very ill and won't be around much longer. After that I don't have to worry.   
  
 ""It's selfish"". Shouldn't my life be the one thing I should be allowed to be selfish about? No one else has to live in my brain. I can't look at a picture of an animal without wondering what happened after that picture was taken. Did it get hit by a car? Maybe it's elderly owner passed away and it's being abused in its new home and all it wants is its old owner back. Or passing a child with an adult on the street, what if they're being trafficked? I have no way of knowing and they never get out because I couldn't stop it. I can't do anything without being afraid of how my actions might affect others. What if I hold up the line in a  grocery store and the person behind me ends up in an accident that they wouldn't have if they had left earlier.

"I'm in my late twenties and recently moved in with some new people, one of which is in their early twenties. Texting them ends up being really emotionally draining because they are just so blunt and don't use any appeasement language at all. When I talk to them I get on with them really well but messaging at all is just terrible for my emotional wellbeing.

 I'm not 100% sure if this is a generational thing, but it seems like a lot of people I know from that age group text like that, and my own personal issues with being anxious when I'm not able to establish tone means that it's quite difficult when nothing is used to indicate I've not annoyed them. I had a similar thing with my parents formality while texting but they're in there 50s so it makes sense with the time difference.

It might be that my roommate is just a secure emotional individual, I know that I'm not so possibly it's just that, I use emojis and change the messages to be as kind as possible because I feel like shit when it's not done for me and worry about the other person being upset at me if I don't.

I'd like to know other people's opinions, whether you're in either mine or my roommate's age group I'd be interested how you feel about it.

"Let me preface this by saying I in no way condone SA, I myself have had to deal with it before and I know how bad it is; I also know that I might get a lot of flak for this, and I'm willing to take it just to get this off my chest.

My (18M) friend (18M) who we'll call James was SA'ed by someone while he was drunk at a party the other day. I was not there, however a few of our friends were but were preoccupied while it occurred. James was very drunk and the guy lead him away from the party. He texted me after it happened and he had somewhat recovered to tell me what happened as our friends dropped him home. Here is where I start getting conflicting feelings. James has a major problem with sensing danger, and it's gotten worse since he started drinking at parties. He tends to get himself into very dangerous situations then not realise until it's too late. He told me himself while I was looking after him once while he was drunk that he does this for attention because otherwise people won't notice him. I checked in on him today, and he's really not doing too well, but he wanted to be alone so I gave him a bit of space and went to go check on our friends that were at the party with him. They were really mad at James, and when I started to confront them, saying they shouldn't be victim-blaming him, they told me what actually happened. Turns out that the entire night, even before he started drinking, he had been very openly flirting with this guy, grinding on him, sitting on his lap, telling him that he wants to f\*ck, and my friend even got a video of him yelling at this guy from across the party to SA him. Our friends spent the entire night trying to pull James away from this guy but he kept going back to him. All of this, mixed with my knowledge of how James acts and the video evidence made me almost doubt James. I don't doubt what happened, I just don't know how to feel about it. I know exactly what he's going through right now, and I know how bad it is, but all of our friends have repeatedly had to pull him out of dangerous situations and he keeps putting himself back into them. I don't want to admit it to myself but I have a feeling in the back of my mind that feels like I blame him.

"I made a post a while ago about some shitty behavior from my husband. This post is a semi-update and another rant. 

He got fired a couple months ago. He told me it was from being excessively late all the time and apparently he yelled at his boss and the owner. He didnt elaborate much and honestly I was too furious to even care at that point. The damage was done and there wasnt going to be a second chance. It was a really good job with great bosses, great pay, and good benefits. 

There was never a conversation that he would lose his job if he didn't start getting to work at a certain time. In fact about a month before he got fired I came home in the middle of the day to grab my phone charger. It was like 1pm and he still hadn't left for work. I asked him if everything was ok and he said it was. Lmao it obviously was not ok. 

He's also lost his car. His license, registration, and insurance havent been valid for almost 4 years at this point. It would cost about $600 to get it all sorted and he always claimed he just didnt make enough to take care of it. Car kept getting towed for invalid tags at $160 each time. His folks are graciously allowing him to keep his car at their place for the time being. I tried to help him fix it at one point and got him insurance but he let it lapse. 

So here we are 2 months post firing. He cooks sometimes if it's easy, sometimes he does the dishes, and sometimes he takes the trash out. That's it though. I honestly dont even think he is looking for a job or if he is he definitely is putting in the minimal effort. However last night he stayed up all night playing video games and jerking off. I got up at 4am to start a 16 hour workday so we arent homeless and that's what I woke up to. I'm sure he will sleep all day without a care in the world. 

Definitely think I'm done at this point. This is the second job hes been fired from in the 7 years we've been married. I'm tired. I can clearly see where his priorities are and our livelihood definitely isnt one of them. 

Not sure why I'm trying so hard for someone who doesnt give a shit. I deserve better than this and I'd rather just be alone than with someone like this.

"So, as the title says. Not really looking for advice as much as I need to get this out. Throwaway because my friends know my main Reddit account. 

When I was a kid, there was this girl in my class named “Emma” (not her real name). Emma was diagnosed with autism at a very young age, and the school administration (we were a private international school, not in the US or UK) knew about it. Her older brother was in my brother’s class, and he told the guys in his class who all told their younger sisters and the whole school ended up finding out. 

Emma was severely bullied. One girl made up a rumour about her that she physically could not smile, when in fact Emma had a very beautiful smile. She was ostracised, mocked, and everywhere she went someone would be cruel to her. I was bullied too, but at the time no one (not even me) knew I had autism. In my case it was your usual “oh she’s a nerd, she’s weird” stuff. Nothing anywhere near as bad, but it didn’t do my insecurities any favours.

I really liked Emma, and it was a shame that we got separated in our classes and hardly saw each other. Whenever we did see each other, we’d hug and smile and catch up, and I loved her to bits. We ended up going to the same university, and every time she’d see me in the library or walking between classes, she’d light up and run over and give me this amazing hug. The last time I saw her, she wanted to get into graphic design and was working on her portfolio. 

I was scrolling my phone one evening when I saw the news posted on the university Facebook group. Emma had passed away. Nothing happened, she just didn’t wake up that morning. I was devastated and broke down that night. Grieving was difficult, but I’ve always been private with my grief. I don’t like posting about it or sharing it with distant acquaintances. I spent the following two years watching Emma’s childhood bullies talk about how much they loved her and how much they miss her. They would post photos of her and write walls of text about how she was their best friend, when I know they terrorised her for years. 

Now I’m 25, and while I can’t access an official diagnosis because of where I live (and the costs), I’m very confident that I’m autistic. I’ve scored fairly high in every autism screening test I’ve done for adults. Autism has explained every single difficulty I’ve ever had in my life, including my sensory issues. On one hand, I’m glad I never got diagnosed as a kid, because then my bullies would’ve had more to bully me for. On the other, I wonder if it might have made my life easier to have a diagnosis. None of it matters now, of course. 

More than anything, I wonder if Emma could see it. I never understood why she liked me so much, but maybe there was something subconscious I was doing that made her feel seen. I loved Emma so much, and I still love her. I think about her a lot and I hope she’s smiling a lot, wherever she is. 

I’m sorry for the dreadfully long post.

"The last time she broke up and blocked me was out of nowhere actually. As I said before she could get mad and block me even we were having a good time. I called her that day. She seemed very distracted, had her laptop with her WhatsApp notification sounds and also texting someone on the phone. After the accidents during the first year, I never had issues with the cheating, so I didn't think anything of it. I just told her I'll call you later. I always feel when something is wrong with her but she was denying it. Few hours later, I tried to call her again but she did not pick up and told that she was studying. So that day I was not able to talk to her bc she was mad at me. Btw I had my cousin T over but he was staying at the hotel. Before he arrived, I removed all her pics from my room bc he didnt know that we were talking. The next morning, I texted M and wanted to call her. She said that she'll talk to me if we won't fight and I said I was not gonna anyway. Then she asked where T was(she knew he was visiting me, but he was at the moment). I joked about it and told her that dont worry he saw your pics and already knows that we are dating. It was just an innocent joke. She immediately said ok bye and started blocking me everywhere. I texted her from about 10 different places and she just kept blocking. She responded once that I betrayed her and so on. She knew that it was a joke. Also I forgot to mention that T's mom was suspecting that we are dating and asked me about it several times. I always denied it and M even had like a small speech to tell her to convince that we are not dating. I even did that too for her but hee last words were that go talk to T and her mom and so on. I was just really confused and still I am.

"Throwaway because don't want my friends to find out about it.

This story goes back to 2020. I(20m) had a gf(18f) let's call her M and cousin(18m) called T.

Me and my cousin T were close all our childhood. T and M were family friends. My and M's families know each other but not that close. So, I knew that there was a girl like M never knew her personally. There was a story that M and T kissed and had a childish relationship and were caught. M's mom is very strict, so M and T stopped talking for some time. 

In 2020, M added me on social media because she needed her playstation to be fixed and T told her that I will be able to do that. It was the time I got to know her and then we created a group chat with 3 of us there. We talked like this all summer and towards the end of the summer my cousin told me to start dating M. At that time, I never had a gf before, so it was my first time. I asked him that you had some ""relationship"" before and that you grew up together. Wouldn't it be strange for you? He said that it's all good and she is the girl for me and so on. I forgot to mention that before this conversation with my cousin, M seemed really interested in me and was texting me everyday. Of course T knew about it and he was okay with that. That was the reason he told me to date her.

So, I told M that I liked her and wanted her to be my gf. She immediately agreed and we started dating. After we started officially dating, M and T were talking nonstop. I mean 24/7. M could hang up on me saying that T is calling her. T was her first priority. After 2 months, T said the he still has feelings for M. I was shocked. I was asking him why would he do something like this and mess up with my emotions. He said that he told me to date her because I was sad and lonely and he couldn't see us together anymore. He was just saying that I don't like that you are dating and to break up. Eventually, it was M who broke up with me. After few months, M and T were trying to ""date"". T was very toxic towards her and it seemed like he didn't care about her. It was just his ego that couldn't accept me and M dating. After M and T's relationship didn't work out, M reached out to me just as a friend. I, young and dumb, still loved her after that. I gave her all my support. We both stopped taking to T.

M and I were talking like we are dating but she did not want to accept for some reason that I'm her bf. It went on for a year and she got close with T couple of times during that year but I still was there for her. After a year, she finally told me that she was in love with me and wanted to date me. We started dating but she asked me that no one should know about us.

We were dating and it was not that easy. There was no respect from her sometimes. As her parents were strict, she had some set of rules:

1. We can't meet anywhere(later I'll tell how we met)
2. I can't call her anytime I want(but not when she was away for the uni)
3. No one can know about our relationship(this rule was set later)
4. Her notifications for me will be turned off and so on.

I was following all the rules except for calling. I could call her and she did not mind but if there was a slightest risk of her mom seeing my call which was not because of me, she would start a big fight. I knew when I could call her and this risky would happen only in 1 out of 100 calls which I could never know. It may seem like it was one sided relationship bc she could always call me and I was responding the second she texted me. And it also was short long distance relationship. We live in one building and cant meet bc of the reason I mentioned above. But there was a time when we met like 5 times in 2 weeks when her parents were not home. It felt like she was getting colder over the time. Less initiating anything. Once I stopped talking to her bc she did not give value to any of my problems. She told me that I was childish.

I was very loving caring to her but the only there was only one bad thing I did to her(maybe even not fully my fault). Once, I called her and her mom saw my name on her phone. Her mom threw her phone at her face. She had a big bruise under her eye. We did not talk for 2 days and I couldn't stop crying for her. She told me I ruined her life and her parent would take the phone away and not let her go to the university. Actually, non of these happened but I was really scared for her.

She was getting very emotional too. She would block me after the slightest fight we had. I never tried to fight her. I'm the person who want to communicate and solve the problem. She is the one who needs the space when she's mad. I tried both solving the problem immediately and giving her time. She usually needs a day or so but if I don't reach out to her she could go a week without taking to me. There was a time when she was getting mad bc I was telling her to eat and sleep(average caring stuff). 

I'll go with all the good stuff now bc obviously there's a reason I miss her to this day. Personally, I did everything I could to make her happy. I was always there for her. I never failed to text her good night for the 3 years. I missed it once and she was worried that something happened to me. I was helping her with her studies. I was making cute tiktok edits for her and so on. Her pics were hanging on the wall of my dorm room. She was on my wallpaper. She was also doing small cute gestures for me. Like making cute wallpaper pics for me and creating spotify playlists. She was choosing outfits for me and so on.

"I'm 18. I told myself I was never going to install those shitty flirt apps again. But I did, because I'm addicted to it. Yesterday, I went to a guy's house to have sex. I risked my well being, the safety of my house. I was happy there with my family but for some reason I felt the need to have body contact with someone so I did. 

I only realized he had some acnes around his mouth after some time. They were separated one from another, it doesn't look like herpes. He told me they were just acnes that got worse because he scratched, and that he always makes tests and is clean of diseases. But I deep down know that I cannot believe him, I cannot believe anyone in those shitty apps, this is why I hate them but I can't get rid of them. He asked me if I wanted to keep having sex and I refused, he was cool about it. I didn't do oral sex nor anal thanks God. 


So, now, I have mouth ulcers. Our kissing was very intense, and took sometime, around 10 minutes of kissing, so I think the inner ulcers could've been made by friction. But I'm still freaking out.

"I’m a teen about to visit my grandparents and I am very worried. My grandma is a sweet, nice (albeit conservative) woman, but my grandpa is a drunken materialistic man. For context, we are all Vietnamese, in my culture, unfortunately, the man has all the say in the house. Since my grandpa is an alcoholic man, what he says goes doesn’t react nicely to criticism.
As far as I know, he has been drinking all his adult life, long before I was born. However, when I was a child, I didn’t notice any problems. In recent years, he gets into arguments with my dad every new years, and I’d usually cower on top of the stairs eavesdropping. Most of the time, my grandpa is demanding money.
My dad recently told me that my grandpa feels he’s owed money to raise him. When my dad went abroad for university (an extremely large privilege in 2000s Vietnam) my grandpa did not send him money, or help applying, or help with housing as he wanted my dad to work in the government. From then, my grandpa demands back the money needed to raise my father (from what I know, about $50000).
My grandpa goes out drinking everyday, sometimes my sister and I would have to go to the streets at midnight to go find him. In addition, he’s also suffering from some sort of complication from a previous brain surgery. He gets seizures a lot, they’re scary. My grandma is usually the one who has to take care of him. Despite her taking videos of his seizures, my grandpa still continues to drink.
In the previous visit, my father and grandpa got into an argument about money again. My grandpa received a car from my dad as one of his “payments”, but he doesn’t like it and is now demanding to return the car in exchange for 1 billion VND($43500). My father wants to work on paying him back then never speak to him again.
I am scared because my grandma says his drinking problem is worse, he drinks on average a case of beer everyday. I genuinely think that my grandpa wants my dad dead this time. My grandpa is a fragile, immature man. He worked in the government and is a corrupt man, manipulative. He is very sweet talking until you disagree.

"Never posted before. I have never fully expressed how I feel and after holding it in all of my adult life, I can’t anymore. I feel helpless, worthless, and I wish I wasn’t here anymore. I feel like I’ve never known a moment of peace. I’ve never felt safe and I don’t think I’ve ever felt truly loved by my parents. They don’t even deserve to be called that, honestly. For as long as I can remember, my life has been turmoil. Parents got divorced soon after I was born. My dad got full custody of me when I was young. My dad has been extremely irresponsible my entire life. My whole childhood consisted of us getting evicted because he would decide he wants to spend all his money on whatever women he was dating at the time. I lived in constant fear (and still do) that he will just get bored and stop paying the bills and we’ll be homeless again. When I was 19-20, he got an apartment for us to live in and we were there for less than a year before he started his shit. He decided to disappear to Dominican Republic to flaunt his money. He left me alone at the apartment. I stayed at my now ex fiancé’s house because I didn’t want to be in the apartment alone and I came back when my dad was due to return. I come back to an apartment that had no electricity or water. He stopped paying the bills who knows how long ago and just left me to fend for myself. I had no way to contact him either. So I ended up packing what little things I had there (the previous time we got evicted, he moved all our stuff into a storage unit and of course stopped paying that and all of my belongings were probably sold or thrown away) and moved in with my mentally abusive ex. I didn’t hear from my dad for another week and all he said was that he’d be moving in with my grandmother. Never once he asked if I was okay and where I’d be staying. He never apologized. At 23 I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. At this point my dad was still living with my grandmother and he didn’t have a car cause he stopped paying that too. I didn’t have a license because I had no one willing to help me learn how to drive. My dad had no interest. So I was stuck trying to find rides to and from treatment. Eventually my treatment took a turn for the worst and it wasn’t working so I had to go to Hopkins for a bone marrow transplant. After the transplant, I had nothing but complications, to where they told me I had to live within 5 miles of the hospital just in case something went wrong. So my dad rented a townhouse near the hospital for us to stay in. This entire time, my doctors told him that the house needed to be spotless due to me having no immune system. They told me I could not cook or clean. But I had to anyway because my dad is disgusting and doesn’t clean up after himself. I’ve had to clean up after him since I was a child. If I didn’t, he’d leave the trashcan full, never changing the bag, just stuffing more shit on top or around it. He would leave dishes in the sink until they grew mold. Trash and filth everywhere til the house was filled with gnats and flies. I had a complication with my transplant that led to me having huge ulcers throughout my GI tract. I was bleeding out and they couldn’t control the bleeding. I at one point died due to hemorrhaging. Not sure how long but after they brought me back, they put me in an induced coma for almost two weeks. Looking back, I truly wish they didn’t bring me back. I wish I signed a DNR. Or I wished my body was simply too weak to wake up from the coma. It was a slow recovery. 2 years. I had to relearn how to walk and write. My dad eventually bought a house and I moved in with him to make sure he’d take care of himself as he was going through a kidney transplant. He is currently totally fine but still a lazy disgusting human being. He never stepped up and he’s still the same as he was when I was a kid. I constantly have to clean up after him, I constantly live in fear that he’s going to lose this house like he’s done with every other place we’ve lived. I can’t afford to get my own place otherwise I would have a long time ago. The stress is killing me. I have been so sick this year, being out of work for a week at a time twice for pneumonia. And now I think I’m going to lose my job because I’m extremely sick again. If I lose my job, my dad wouldn’t help me with any of my bills. He only cares about himself. My mother is no better. She’s never consistently been in my life. She disappears and shows back up when she wants something. There’s so much more but I can barely see what I’m typing as I’ve been crying so much. I just want to give up. I’m tired of living like this. Feeling like this. Why couldn’t I have good parents? I feel like if I did, I wouldn’t feel like this. I’ve never known a happy life. I’ve never had an easy life. It has been traumatic from the start. I don’t want to be here anymore.

"I (29/M) always imagined the life I want is that I have a bigger friend group, and being able to go to festivals with friends, travel, and enjoy life, welcome the new year. Another year has passed, I still have the same lack of friends from high school (group is getting smaller, and hadnt made any new friend since then). These buddies are also living their lives now, rarely open to meet. I still do not have a girlfriend to celebrate Christmas and new years. I had a longterm relationship before, but now years feel the same.

I am currently working in IT. I started a new job not so long ago, because in my previous place I did not develop at all, I did not have any friends from work, etc. Now I started a new job a few months ago, but I see some similar red flags. All my colleagues are almost 50, they are not open to hangout etc.

I have hobbies besides work, like crossfit and gym, however was not able to make friends so far.

I have tinder dates and stuff, but feel like my life is struggling. I work, workout, getting tired, repeat.

I can change companies but, feel like I am stucked at this point of life now.

Always struggle to find out where to celebrate new years eve, who can I travel with.

I was even seeing a therapist/coach, because I said okay the problem should be with me. Other people dont seem to struggle like me in life. But the coach said, I do mostly everything right, and my personality is open for new people.

So I really don't know what to do, I feel I don't get anything from my work, hobbies, that can be a social circle.","I don't know how to fix my life. Working in 9-5 feels like a wrong direction.

I know that it keepted happening till the age of 8. It happened over a decade ago, and I have no proof, making matter worst it happened in another country. They were trusted friends.

"(First post here/ on phone, sorry for typos) TL/DR at bottom.)


Over a year ago, I had attempted to say hello to God after a particularly rough depressive episode. Without getting into too much details my mom was able to prevent me from doing something stupid just before anything happened.  

After a few hours on call with the suicide hotline to prepare to get me direct help the following week. I went to inform my friends why I was suddenly gone. At first they seemed to actually care and worry, with messages on how they would be a shoulder to cry on and ear to listen and all that stuff. And though it was nice, I still had self loathing from the incident. 

A couple weeks went by and they messaged me less and less,  and I didn't game with them. Nore did they check up on me despite going dark as I tried to collect myself.  Part of me felt guilty to hang with them because of the worry they must have felt when I admitted what happened,  and I felt like I didn't deserve their time. Eventually I decided to tell with who was my second friends.  Let's call them P. I sent a message stating how I felt a little left out and upset that no one had reached put to see if I was still doing OK. In response they seemed to have  a flip as they said it wasn't their job to watch over me or check in on me. And no, I obviously wouldn't say it is, I personally would have messaged every single day and night to my friends if they had just expressed something such as attempted suicide.

While this was happening, in another DM I had tried to contact my first friend lets call them C,  the one I had known the longest. They had told me that they were to busy to talk with me. Not that they could talk later, just that they were too busy. So while I contemplated how much C valued me as a friend I was having a fight with P over how I was not talking with Them so they could fix me, just so that I could talk with a friend. After multiple back and forth and insults of how self absorbed and attention wanting I was. This ticked me off and out of emotional logic, I decided to end it with P, and sent C and ultimatum, if they could not treat me as I would expect to be treated as their life long friend. Then we would either have to freeze our friendship or pit it on hold. In response they were suddenly free not only to talk to me, but to call me directly. And they expressed that this kind of talk was manipulative and they would not let me talk to then this way. And that if I was going to be like this then yes they would end our friendship, but they originally stated if I was able to get myself psychiatric help then they might consider re-opening the friendship.

This news broke me in such a way all I could do was mutter to them in response.  They stated that if I needed to talk. Then they would be there. And I needed them. I needed to know what they we're thinking and why they hadn't checked on me. And to me it seems it's cause my suicide attempt drew too much attention. 

It's been about a year and a half, and so many of my thoughts,  or memories,  or even pass time activities are plagued with memories of my friends. It feels like poison to my soul. For months I was wishing I was faster then my mother so I would have at least died knowing I was still their friend. They and the rest of the extended friends all blocked me a month after the incident when I tried to update C that I was in counseling,  as I was under the opinion that they would at least be willing to get updates. But they made up their mind, and never intended to be a friend with me again. 

I've lived the night over and over again a dozen times wondering if I really was at Fault, and if i really was selfish in my thoughts.

"Hi, i'm a 24M and have a GF (20F). We are dating for 2 months of today but i am constantly anxious in this relationship and life. 

To clarify some things up front, my GF is the type of girl every man looks at when she walks past them. I was, until a couple of months a go a fat dude, so low self esteem etc etc. Now i lost 95 pounds and i get complemented on a weekly basis by males and females about my appearance. Another important thing to notice is that i had a very very bad relationship where i tried to off myself. (Didn't work, luckily, also not only the relationship made me feel this way) And i was single for about a year prior to this. 

So now back to the part that makes me anxious. My weightloss has made me anxious and very happy at the same time. I just love how i feel better but on the other side, people that didn't want me around when i was fat are now constantly trying to get involved in my life. This is also the way how my gf and i met, i posted a gym pic, she slid in the dm's casual stuff. At the start i didn't want to go in a relationship because i knew she was 'to pretty' for me. But she chased me for about 6 weeks before i finally had strong enough feelings for her to start a relationship. After that, i got anxious for all guys in her dms, all eyes that are on us when we go out and all males who jump at her when i go to the toilet or whatever when we are partying. The more the relationship goes on, the less i care and that anxious feeling dropped. But now it's a total other reason to feel anxious. Every time something like that happens, i say it doesn't affect me, but then i just distance myself. I find myself putting my phone on 'do not disturb' every single day when i'm not with her. I feel myself just trying to ignore the things that happen and then i get anxious with every mood swing she gets when i'm not replying. Last night i just came to the conclusion i should leave the past behind and try to focus on her and my new appearance. 

The reason i'm writing this is that i'm just trying to push everything off my chest and then leave it behind. Because we are finally starting to know each other well and leaving the past issues behind as much as possible. I finally start loving myself in the mirror and that's a feeling i want to keep as long as possible.

No need for sympathy, no need for advice, thanks for reading and remember, the change of losing loads of weight is not always positive and after the physical hard battle, the mental battle continues every single day. Calories are my enemy, overthinking is the devil.

"So I was cleaning out my grandmas desk today to try and get all files situated after her passing. I stumbled across a drawer that was full to the brim with birthday/anniversary/you name it cards. 

About halfway through the drawer I found a card that had my name on it. Which was odd but she reused quite a lot of envelopes so no big deal. Wrong the card was sealed. When I opened it up I found a a birthday card. Meant to be given to me on my 17th birthday…6 years ago! But there I was today sitting with a birthday card from my grandma a week after my first birthday without her. 

I won’t lie I laughed at the situation I found myself in but found myself crying as I read the paragraph she wrote to me. It basically said that her love for me started the moment she found out my mom was expecting. And that her and my grandpa had loved me for 17 long years and would continue to love me even when they were gone and to always remember that. 

Which had me ugly crying because we had a complicated relationship. My high school years weren’t easy on us. But that card really proved that her love for me was infinite just like she said.

 She always did say our loved ones send messages when they need them.

"My partner and I have been together for about a year. I have never had problem with weed or against it. I knew since the beginning that he smokes weed and I’m okay with that. But it seems becoming a bit problematic in our relationship. 

He smokes weed daily, 3-4 times a day and maybe even more than that. It’s not about the money. It’s about his personality, if he smokes so much, he becomes distant from me, he wants to be alone most of the time and play video games (the video games is not a problem for me at all). 

His job is a mess too when he smokes so much. He doesn’t have energy for anything. Only doing basic things at home. We don’t live together. 

He admitted some negative side effects of the weed. Such as paranoia, anxiety goes very high, he is very distant emotionally and mentally with people around him and he is not motivated doing things that he likes.

When he doesn’t smoke, he is the most loving, funny and caring partner. I miss him a lot. We have good communication though. I told him my concerns and he accepted that the weed affects us a lot. 

I’m just sad seeing my partner suffer from weed like this. I will not stop supporting him to take a break from weed because it affects his life in very negative way. 

I really hope he gets better soon. I love him so much.

I don’t want to leave him when he is not in a good state like this. I just want to be there for him and support him. That’s the only thing I can do. I’m sad when people seeing my partner negatively but I believe in him and I will not give up on him. Because I know, he will not give up on himself.

"I (20m) am in the army on a rotation in Europe. Over thanksgiving we had a pass and me and 2 friends stayed a long weekend in a larger city near by. I told my wife I was going to sleep, but we went to a bar instead. She found out and we got in a pretty big fight about it. We went to a party for a near by college one night and I got extremely drunk. While I was sitting, a girl (25) came sat by me. We talked about college and the things she did at school. One thing led to another and I kissed her. After the kiss, I don’t remember much. From what other people told me, I guess I was begging this girl to come back to my hotel but she refused. I don’t remember how, but I guess I had her follow the friend I was with so we could talk on his Instagram since my wife knows my password. The next day, we downloaded an encrypted messaging app and gave each other the codes. I told her it was because my normal social medias don’t work. We talked on those for a few days but it was pretty mundane. Just getting to know each other. The day I got back to post, I started feeling pretty guilty. So I called my wife and asked for a divorce. 

She asked me if there was anyone else and I told her no. I guess that was a lie, but I told her that I just no longer thought we were mature enough for a marriage since that’s why this all happened anyways. She was confused because other than the fight we had a few days prior everything was going fine but I still just couldn’t tell her. I blocked her on everything except for text after that because she was blowing up my phone asking questions. I kept her number to help her get on her feet after I told her this. 

The next day, another girl I had messaged before messaged me again. It was a girl who asked me about linking up before, but I told her no because at that time I was married. This time, she messaged me after seeing I had taken my wife out of my social medias. We talked for a little and I told her we are getting a divorce because I wanted to explore being polyamorous and dating multiple people, which was not something my wife would be ok with because when we got married we agreed on monogamy. 

After talking a bit more, this girl started really trash talking my wife. Saying that she was just trying to lighten my mood and get my mind off of “possibly still loving her.” I told her I wasn’t ok with it and blocked her. 

This made her mad and she dmed my wife screenshots of our entire conversation. My wife messaged me and said “I understand you’re a “free man” now, but please tell your girls to stop sending me screenshots of them talking to you. It’s not helpful.” 

Since she saw me mention polyamory in that conversation, she talked to me about it. She told me she would be willing to try that life style if that’s what I felt I needed and she just wished I had talked to her about it first. One thing she said was that she needed time to learn about and accept this, and during that time she needed me to hold off on talking to other girls and end conversations I’ve already started. I was more than willing to do this because I love my wife and I really did want to make things work between us. 

We talked about everything and for a few days she was too different. She didn’t try to start many conversations, wouldn’t show her face on FaceTime, she talked to me differently, and it was stressing me out. I told her I would take back the idea of polyamory and that I only wanted her. She was shocked and asked if I was sure I would be happy and I told her I would try to be. 

Over the next few weeks, things seemed smoother. She even seemed happier with me than before. She was sending me tons of pictures and videos of herself when I asked and she was willing to talk about anything that I wanted to talk about. Then, I got drunk one night while my crazy ex was messaging me. I never asked for them, but said ex sent me nude photos. In my drunk mind, I saved the photos to my eyes only. I don’t know why I did it. But right after, my wife was having a hard time getting a video I wanted from her to send to me so she suggested logging into my Snapchat and just putting that video in my my eyes only herself which I told her she could because I wasn’t even thinking about what I saved. She confronted me about it and I explained I was drunk and it was a mistake. She asked when I saved them and for some reason I lied and told her hours ago. She clocked that and told me that if it really was hours ago then I wasn’t drunk when I did it. But she also told me she knew it wasn’t hours ago because it says when the photos were saved. 

Things went back to normal just in time for one of my “friends” to tell his wife about me kissing the girl at the party, and his wife told my wife. She send me the screenshots and as those 2 days went by, I was able to deny it. But my wife reached out to the girl from the party. She knew who it was because I sent her a screenshot of me telling her that we couldn’t talk anymore. Not only did the girl tell her about the kiss and the begging her to go back to the hotel, but she told her about the messages wed been sending for the days before I called for a divorced which my wife didn’t know about because I told her we only started talking after I called her that night.

My wife decided she would stay with me, but things are different again. She drills me with questions and anything she feels is a lie, she asks the other girl. After the last time I said something to her that wasn’t fully true, she told me I was on my last chance because she has given me far too many already. 

Now, I’m flying my wife out over my Christmas pass to visit me in Europe. She doesn’t trust me to go out anymore because of all of this, which is understandable. I also am dying to see her and spend time with her and this way she’ll be here for Christmas, our 1st anniversary, and her birthday. I’m excited but I’m nervous. She hasn’t been eating because she’s trying to loose weight fast, she won’t show her face on FaceTime until she’s done her make up, she doesn’t joke like she used to, and even she is nervous to see me. I’m just so stressed about this and don’t know what to do anymore. I won’t divorce her myself because I was the one that made the mistakes and that is for her to decide to do. I also love her too much and I don’t want to leave her.

So, we started talking and we got very close very early lik I was one of the few people she genuinely liked talking.
After sometime we started holding hands and she just one day said "" You know I love you right ?"" she was my cousin's best friend and used to say it to him too but she didn't meant it that way and I replied with an I know and we slowly started saying I love you.

We started going to the roofs looking at stars, talking about the moon and other stuff.
 
Then I got into a college and had to go we kept talking on text one day she told me she had a crush on me and I said I had one too.

Our relationship was going as if we love each other but couldn't date cause we didn't want a Long Distance Relationship.

She started dating someone but it didn't affect what we had at all and we would still flirt like a really down bad flirt.

I went to visit her she wasn't dating anyone at that point so we made out as we had been talking about it and it was my first kiss we went forward but not too forward.

I came back to my college and she started going to a college in her city and after two three months she started dating someone else but we we still the same.

I went to see her again and we kissed and did stuff but she was seeing someone at the time I didn't feel good doing it but she said That what she was doing is wrong but she's only doing it cause it's me she would do this with anyone else. My friends told me to enjoy it as we were there for 3 days and I did.

After a month two month or so she tells me her bf found out and he's giving her another chance and she asked me what to do. I told her if she would do the same for him she should go with him.

After this our talks were fine but we had a fight one day that she isn't tasting me enough or not even calling I needed up saying sorry as I said too much but it wasn't that much an dshe wasfine but our talks declined so much after that.
One day she tells she wants one space and I should give her some time and I did, I was shocked as that never happened before but after two days we were back not in the same way something felt off to me.

Than after two weeks she tells me that she feels guilty about what she did and can't talk me while dating her bf so she will block me from everywhere cause she just feels guilty.
I immediately called her she told me the same thing as above and it ended with me in tears while she was doing a thing where she shuts off her feeling so she can't cry. She said she love the bf more than me and yeah since we both did stuff she feels guilty talking to me. 

She just ended a 2.5 year friendship or relationship whatever it was just like that and it's been like 2 days and I just can't take it I don't feel anything sad but when the flashbacks come it hurts the time we spent together was precious.

Only one of my roommates (F20) stopped to wait for me. I tried to put my card into the ATM machine but it was broken so we decided to go to the next closest one which was like 3 minutes away from us. We crossed the road and continued to walk, we were too busy talking and laughing when suddenly one old man (M around 53) stopped us. He looked really surprised and asked what brand jacket I was wearing. I didn’t expect someone to ask me such a random and strange question, but I answered. He continued to ask me with the same surprised tone from where I bought it, what size was, for how much and when. I answered his questions and he begged me to take it because he was looking for everywhere to buy it but it was sold out and he needed it as soon as possible because he needed it for a photo shoot and he promised to give it back as soon as the photo were taken. Usually I can get sacred very quickly and if I was alone I would probably run away, but I looked my friend and I whispered to her that I’m scared, but she smiled at me and said back that it was nothing serious and scared. I told him that I’m not going to give him my jacket like that, but he begged us and asked us to go with him and to wait him in his car if we wanted. I was so stupid, but after a seconds I was in his expensive car on the back seat with my roommate. 
He drove us to the mall, and he explained that next to it in the building is the office where is the photoshoot, and he ordered us to stay in the car and wait for him. “For our safety” he didn’t turn off the car and give us his company magazines I quote: “….to not get bored….”, but before he exited the car he asked us if we can drive. I told him that I can drive automatic car, because I have one, and he SMILED like a freaking creep and said: ”After I finish I have one job offer for you then!!” 
We waited around 17 minutes. In the magazines that he give us we saw his photo and we searched for information on internet, and everything was kinda believable? 
After that, he came with my jacket (I’m sure that’s mine because I had my lipstick in one of the pockets and it was still there.) but he had disappointed look on his face and told us that the jacket was too small because the model was higher than me and it wasn’t useful. He asked if I’m interested to model with it AND OF COURSE I REFUSED, surprisingly he was okay with it and started to talk how he wanted ME TO WORK AS A DRIVER for his company. He wanted me to take famous people from the airport and drove them here HE EVEN WAS READY TO GIVE ME THE CAR KEY “….to see how can I drive.”. I refuse again and he give me his number and made me call him, so if I change my mind to call him. My roommate on another hand asked if she can be a model in his company and he took her number too.
After that he drove us back to our apartment. I got really scared and I blocked his number and everywhere that I could find him on social media.



My question is, should I be concerned or scared and is it possible that he could be the person who he claims to be?



UPDATE: I convinced my friend to block him and never to talk with him again, but today she received a message from him on WhatsApp (even though we blocked his number.) asking why we blocked his number and that I quote:  “I don’t want the jacket anymore.” and that he thinks it’s stupid that she don’t want to be model in his company anymore, but he will “accept her decision.” and we thought that this would be the end…

BUT she said to me that when she was on her way to work she saw his car driving past her. 

I’m starting to get really worried, I even searched for tracking device in the jacket but I couldn’t find anything…I only slept for a 3 hours because I started to get paranoid and I don’t know what to do anymore…","I got into a stranger car, because he wanted my jacket for a photo shoot and he offered me a job…?",18mpz94,1703061696.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mpz94/i_got_into_a_stranger_car_because_he_wanted_my/,
"I never had bad allergies until about 4 years ago. for some reason right when I got with my boyfriend my allergies just became so severe and even debilitating at times. 

even when it's not severe I still have the little nose feelings that inevitably cause my eyes to water, then I have to blow my nose and the process just continues to repeat which become *very* annoying after dealing with it for more than 3 days in a row with severe allergy attacks in between. 

my house is extremely dusty, so I know this doesn't help. I can dust at 7am and by 7pm there will be mountains of it on every surface once again. I don't know what to do about that and it only adds to my frustration. my boyfriend thinks i'm over-dramatic about my allergies but I think he's simply never had to deal with it like I have, and if he did then he would be just as upset over it. 

when it's bad— it's *bad* as I stated it gets to a debilitating point. it gets to a point where I am literally not ever not blowing my nose. I will go through BOXES of tissues in a single day and have to start using our rolls of toilet paper and then use rolls upon rolls of toilet paper as well. (which makes them worse and then i'll switch to a towel) 

I recently went to the ER and was prescribed an anti-histamine for general anxiety. (didn't work because I have a literal anxiety disorder) but it did help with my allergies. the only thing is that it also would make me sleep for 16 hours so what's enjoyable about not experiencing allergies when you're asleep through all of it, only to wake up and have allergies once more. OTC drugs don't get rid of them, just lessen them. and my nurse friend said most prescribed allergy medicine is going to make me drowsy. it seriously feels like there's no solution and it actually drives me mad.

"So this morning, I(14m) was about to have peanut butter and jam oats, (I know its not the best thing ever, but I like it.)

My grandmother wanted to eat a pb+j sandwich, which is all well and good, but she puts butter in hers, which is ok, but then she put the knife with butter into the jam, which ruins it for me personally. I overreacted and shouted at her to stop, which was pretty rude of me, and she reacted fairly justly.

I explained myself, then she got all defensive about it, accusing me of only doing it because I like correcting people, I was pretty hurt by this, and just ate something else. I didn't want to cause drama, so I asked my mom to give me money, to go buy a small jar of jam so no grief would be caused, she also berated me and said that it was a waste of time and that I should just 'remove' the butter(dont know what that means) I got mad and just went to my room where I am now.

Then she says I better spend more time getting to know him …implying that he will be the only one to have a family someday. Am I overreacting that I find her extraordinarily rude and unkind ?

"29M, with a wounded inner child, social anxiety, horrible self-esteem and experiencing increasingly frequent depressive episodes. 

It basically started when I was about 11 years old. I was bullied and teased every single day in school. On top of that, I can't remember one time my parents gave two shits about my mental health. All they cared about was grades grades grades. Plus my mother forced me to take piano lessons by an intimidating teacher.

When I was 12, I really liked this girl. The only problem was that she hated my guts. She rejected me openly and everyone teased me for it. The same thing basically happened the following year with a different girl. These experiences burned into my head the impression that this is how girls would treat me if I ever approach them. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming everyone with two X chromosomes for my mental state, thanks for understanding.

Being heavier than the average Malaysian kid, I was also teased for being fat. I've had serious body image issues since then. I'd only drink water during meal times at school in hopes of losing weight. 

In 2009, at the age of 15 my family and I moved to Melbourne, Australia. Starting school here was a nerve-wracking experience due to what I went through previously in Malaysia. Fortunately the students were mostly friendly. Unfortunately I was already carrying mental baggage without knowing it. I was already developing anxiety, I just didn't know such a condition existed back then. 

My teens and 20s were wrecked because of the bullying I experienced during my formative years. I'm trying really hard to hold back tears writing this. While everyone says I'm a social person, I feel otherwise. I'm constantly exerting effort to appear normal in social situations. I keep finding excuses why others would be repulsed by me. I feel like everyone is out to get me. I've built a mental prison and I really want to get out of it.

Just thinking about what I went through makes me sad and angry. If those dickheads didn't exist, I wouldn't be in this predicament. Basically everything that's gone wrong in my life is because of them. People say ""let go of the past"", if only it were that fucking simple. Fuck this shit.",What happens in childhood runs deep. 29M,18mphm7,1703059652.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mphm7/what_happens_in_childhood_runs_deep_29m/,
"Throwaway account because I feel like I need it but nothing particularly bad. Also excuse me for the English mistakes! 

I (20M) feel like I became a sad person and I don't think I will get over it before a few years.
What I mean by ""sad person"" is that I don't feel anymore the bliss of life for things that would have make me really happy before. The world is dull, the colors I see are faded. 

This is exactly the way I hate the most to be, unable to appreciate what I have (while I am REALLY lucky). Especially because I have always been a happy person, I experienced lot of sad days but the happy days we're always here and that's all I ever wanted. I don't care how worst things can get if I find joy in some parts of my life, but the emptiness is unbearable. 

To add a little context, I spent last year studying in Paris after a year in another city (not where I grew up) where I had plenty of friends. The year was awful, I pretty much did nothing. Like, nothing at all. I spent one year in my studio, almost with no social interaction. Now and then I went to see my girlfriend with whom I was in a long distance relationship but it quickly became awful to deal with (neither of us were made to that) and we finally broke up before summer.

Now, things are clearly better! I moved again in my natal city and live again with my parents and my lil bro. I can see all my friends that I missed so much. I play music, do a lot of sport, travel pretty much every month to a new country for a little week end. I have a life I would have dream of last year! However I feel almost no joy (sadness is here tho) in it. 

I confessed that to nobody before but Paris fucked me up on a different level. I hate to admit that, but I am a so ungrateful person, and I just want to get over it. 

I wrote this partly because I felt the need to assume that but also because I wanted your advices to get over that. Thanks you!

"my upbringing made me base my self worth with my academic performance. i am a pretty good student, always finishing semesters with A’s and B’s, but my mother could never settle with that. i was always made out to be the worst child growing up(i would get yelled at and physically punished until i was 19 where i would just overload myself with classes and work so i wouldn’t have to go home)  just because i couldn’t be a straight a student. even though she was so strict i didn’t even have room to be a bad kid. i wasn’t allowed to hang out with friends or go to school events such as sports games/dances. i was left home alone a lot expected to keep myself entertained with whiteboard math and practice work books (they would take the computer chord and tv chord even though we didn’t have cable anyways lol). i did my best but i mean im human i struggled in some classes and had to figure out a lot of things on my own bc i didn’t have anyone to help me with my homework . my mom only talked to me about school,college or what i wanted my future career to be about she never cared to get to know me as a person. 

i was kicked out in 2021 because i couldn’t stand to be controlled and torn down everyday so i started making my own decisions. growing up when we would fight i would always tell her the day i move out she would never hear from me again besides a monthly payment i would make bc i feel like kids should take care of their parents any way they can once theyhave the means for it. my time apart from my mom allowed me to reflect and come to an understanding that no one ever taught her how to be parent,i can’t be too upset and i know her intentions are well. i started to feel guilty for shutting her out but also that doesn’t take away all the pain i felt when she would come for my character,humiliate me,deprive me of childhood experiences and made me feel worthless.

fast forward it’s 2023 her and i have a better established relationship now that we don’t live together and i’ve worked towards being more understanding. i am back in school for a career change (pta to dental hygiene) and every time i get a call from this woman it is about how much money am i making, what are my grades,  am i studying enough. 

she called me today asking me how i did on my finals and i snapped at her bc we already had this conversation on monday. she got upset and said why am i making her feel bad for caring.

i don’t even know what a regular mom-daughter relationship consists of or what to even talk about with her besides academics. i feel like we don’t know each other at all since she will only hold a conversation in regards to that and i spent so much time avoiding her as much as possible.

so as the final option,  I tried to ask my 'best' friend for 200$, just so I could afford to refund the money I already spent, and planned to pay it back to them when I'm able to do so, but they just say sorry and say they don't have money.  
But the thing is, this 'best friend' is filthy rich. I heard that he just spent 4000$ on his motorcycle, and I also heard he just bought a new building (around 500.000$) for his apartment business, and opened a new restaurant business too, but yet he was somehow unable to lend me 200$. I'm not even asking for him to give me 200$, I ask him to LEND ME 200$ and suddenly he can't afford to do so.  
I don't even feel sad, I just laugh at how utterly ridiculous this situation is. it seems all the time I spend with him when he still struggling when he starts up, and every time I try to cheer him up, or being there when no one else does is worthless in his eyes.

There have been a lot of men harassing me when we go out and after someone we know touched me very inappropriately in an intimate area of my body without consent and someone else verbally attacked me, he was being very protective and I feel so safe with someone who can protect me by using their words and asserting to people why their actions aren’t okay. Another guy opened my car door when I was fixing my makeup in my car outside the bar and the way he handled it was so calm but also firm and protective. I feel so safe when someone can be nonviolent and assertive and protective. It’s such a sign of strength, loyalty, and restraint. I feel so cared for because he pays attention to me and he understands why certain things are triggering &amp; he actually cares instead of just thinking I’m overreacting and dismissing my feelings. 

He listens to me with such compassion and care and the way he makes love to me is so magical. Our sex is so perfect, it’s so sensual and tender and close.

"Today I noticed an annoying fact about most of my exes: they love to lie. I’ve just recently gotten out of an abusive relationship, and I noticed this in her while we were together. She would slip in little lies here and there to her friends that made me seem like a horrible person just to get sympathy, and sometimes in an attempt to cheat on me even though I’m polyamorous and would have been fine with her having other partners. It’s so crazy to me, because this is the same girl who would yell and scream at me to “just get over” my ptsd and often told me how annoying me having depression was to her, even though I bottled most things up to avoid doing just that. And then there’s the ex that contributed to my ptsd, and that I had almost forgiven until I saw a comment he posted on Reddit stating that I had forced him into an open relationship and used him for money. This is again crazy, because having an open relationship was actually his idea after I told him that I had realised I was into more than just men. I hadn’t planned on doing anything about the realisation, but he insisted I go on dating apps and explore my sexuality. Secondly, this man said I was using him for his money when we didn’t even share finances after six years together, our first date was at a fast food restaurant and I was the one who paid for it, and one time he refused to spend even a dollar on me when I had literally no money and just wanted a cold drink.

"I've known a guy with ADHD since April, and we've been seeing each other regularly since then, and i guess we're starting a serious relationship.

The issue isn't the attention deficit itself, but the fact that he doesn't realize that most of his mistakes in our relationship stem from issues relates to his ADHD he hasn't dealt with since childhood. 

For the past few months, we've been long-distance because he had to work abroad. Despite warning me initially that he struggles with communication and is a mess via messages, I didn't expect it to be THIS bad. I know he's making an effort for me, and he's not distant only with me but also with everyone else (even his own mother). However, I can't help but get upset when he leaves me on read for DAYS in the middle of a conversation, only to return as if nothing happened, asking about my day. 

Another issue is the feeling of being forgotten. I understand that many people with ADHD follow the 'out of sight, out of mind' rule, and I try to empathize, but it hurts to think that while I miss him every day, he may not remember I exist unless I remind him. Obviously, he doesn't outright say, 'Hey, I haven't thought about you at all this month we've been apart,' but actions speak louder than words. Even though he occasionally says he misses me and wishes we could be together, I know he does it to protect my feelings, not because he genuinely feels it.

"For context, my boyfriend and I were already friends (same friend group) when he met his first love. We weren't close, but I witnessed how he fell in love and how they ended. They didn't become boyfriend/girlfriend, but he did fall in love. He moved on after 8 months and started liking me, but it wasn't serious. Around September 2022, we both started flirting as a joke, but he eventually started to like me around November, and I started to like him around December. I didn't know he liked me in November because he confessed that to me around February 2023. Although if this was the case, I vividly remember him sending messages about not yet getting over his first love in December 2022, like he was relapsing. Around Feb 2023, we both confessed and became boyfriend/girlfriend in May 2023. I also have retroactive jealousy, but I am almost fully recovered from this, not until we talked yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

About the title, yesterday, we both had a conversation about his past relationship. I asked him genuinely if he still thinks about her or their memories. To my surprise, he said yes. He said that there are times when he sees something related to their past, he would remember her and their memories, but it does not affect him whatsoever; he just remembers. He also gave an example: whenever he listens to this specific song, he would still be reminded of her. It's not like he misses her; he just remembers. This is because it was his favorite love song before, and he dedicated it to her then. He clarified it with me that it still applies until now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that he has a past, and it had a big part in his life. But I can't help but feel really hurt when hearing this. He is my first love, but I liked many people before him. I dedicated songs to them, too, but in every love song I listen to, I would always correlate it with my boyfriend. I am not mad at him since I understand that he has a past, but is it understandable that I am really hurt how he is still reminded of his past relationship sometimes?

a couple months ago i met someone through a mutual friend and we were hanging out at a super small gathering hosted by said mutual friend. we hit it off really well. i didn’t mention to him that i had a boyfriend. he offered me a ride home later that night, we hooked up in the car, blah blah blah. i told him about my boyfriend at that point.


we saw each other around uni for a while after that, we’d hang out in between classes and stuff. we became pretty good friends, honestly. my boyfriend knew that i had become friends with this guy and he was really upset with me at first (just for being friends with him; he doesn’t know that he and i hooked up). he seems okay with it now, but he would probably kill me if he found out. like actually genuinely kill me.

"(Fake Names of course)

My (36f) older sister (43f) Gina does not freaking listen to anything. I love her, but she thinks she knows more than everyone and doesn't listen to any advice and gets burned. Every. Single. Time. 
I'm constantly her go to to vent and unload everything in her life.

She's had 4 divorces. Has 3 kids by 3 different men (all were while married to each man). You'd think she'd learn to document during a divorce and custody issues, but no. She's already lost 1 kid because the Dad turned him against my sister. 

I warned her to go back to court with the text messages that were on my nephews phone of his Dad saying stuff about my sister that wasn't true. But nope she knew better and her precious boy knew she'd never do that. She had court documents proving everything his dad said was false. I told her to show them to my nephew, she refused because she didn't think he was ready. (He was 15) it's been years since he lied in court for his Dad and his Dad got full custody. He's an adult now and still refuses to talk to my sister or anyone in our family, including his older brother. 

She goes completely petty with her divorces, she even takes all the food in the house when she moves her stuff out, drags court on for over a year over possessions, but refuses to realize custody is more important than a dang livingroom suit. 

Her youngest son (13) is having the same mind games played by her soon to be ex-husband. Plus he's put her through alot more I'm leaving out or it wouldn't be anonymous anymore, her soon to be ex husband (sbx) his a cop, he assaulted my sister and police did nothing about it. 

I told her today to sit her son down and tell him the truth of everything because his Dad is lying to him over stuff that's easily proven. She refused, saying her son would never believe the stuff her sbx was saying. 

I got mad. I've already lost one nephew and I don't want to loose another. So I told her that I didn't want to hear anything else about what her sbx is saying or doing. Not to call me to vent or talk and I would tell her I told you so this time when my nephew turns on her too because she's too freaking stubborn to do something so simple as show the truth to him. That if she ""knew better"" then why did she already lose a child.

She started crying, called me names and hung up. I'm not even mad, honestly I feel relief and peace for the first time in a long time. 

I didn't realize the stress and knots I was in because I've been so worried over my nephews. (13yr Olds) Father is not the best guy, and is mentally unstable and has been for a while. 

I feel bad for my nephew, but at the same time a weight has lifted off my shoulders. 

I know tomorrow my phone is going to blow up once she runs to our Mother and other siblings. But at this point, I've been LC with everyone else except our other sister and Gina since January. Going LC/NC with Gina just sounds peaceful. 

(All of my nieces and nephews have phones and I talk/text to them all [except the one] daily, I might be LC with our brother, but no matter what we all agree on the fact no matter what happens between us the kids are not apart of it. And are free to talk/text any of us anytime as long as we leave them out of our problems and not push any opinions, religious, or political issues on them.)

We are back home for the holiday season, (we go to school 10 hours away), and I just need to vent about this. So we came back home together, (from the same town, go to the same university). So my mom welcomed him to stay at our house and I was excited bc I thought this meant him and I could sleep in the same bed, which in the past, was not allowed. Well no. She isn’t allowing us to sleep in the same bed, or room. Her reasoning was that it made her uncomfortable, so I asked if we could stay at his house then, atleast for a couple nights. She said I couldn’t. She said that’s even worse as she won’t be able to know what we’re doing and that she won’t be able to make sure we’re in separate rooms.

"This is from a burner acc

So today me (15y, M) got a “beating” I know I deserved it because I was being straight up stupid. Before I continue I need to tell you guys my routine, I get up to go to school by my parents 
   then after school I walk over to the bus stop to go home (city bus btw since I’ve always been using it and our regular bus is too far from where I live and never comes) (which takes about 40 minutes to get home) I have no brothers and no friends since they all went to a different high school.


Where I live isn’t a “good” place a lot of gang violence, fights, drugs all of that basically not the best place to live.

I’m going to say this right now after winter break which starts in like Dec. 21 I’m moving to my friends school since the school is so far from where I live.

Okay back on track 

Today was going to be a good day since my best friends birthday was today and we we’re going on a double date, excited to go home the bus comes as I get on there’s a lot of people like always. Me looking for a seat so I didn’t have to sit down there were these group of kids. 4 guys, 2 girls.
So the 2 guys that were in front had their feet on the seat and they wouldn’t move this was definitely my first mistake. (Provoke them) I wasn’t about to deal with this and this kid would not move his feet so I put my backpack on the chair and sat on his foot. Then the group was being all mad so I got up and just said “we’ll move your feet then damn.” So I just hung on the bar, then I don’t know where this led to but they asked me where I was from. 

I’m going to note this (if I had said I wasn’t in a gang it probably still ended up bad)

I said “north” this is where most “ghetto” part from where I live and I do live north “are you in a gang” this was super super stupid of me but I said “yes” but from what I thought if I said yes I probably would’ve gotten respect or something 
I ended up saying I was in their rival gang and they were pissed but I didn’t pay attention to them bc I just wanted to sit down and the bus was crowded. But I threw up a “gang sign” which was me just moving my fingers around. They were mad but started messing with me actually and I knew I messed up. They started messing with me and yelling at me or something one of them was trying to get up and the girl was in his way tell them to stop and chill out and turns out that girl and I have a history since we went to the same middle school. Then it just got worse after that the dude who got up smacked me across my face and I was in shock but I still stood my ground and just stood there because I don’t even know why but then all 4 started trying to get that slap in the girls started recording. Then one of them got my nose and it started bleeding and I just didn’t know what to do.

I told my friend and he was panicking so was I, then the bus started getting less crowded and a man told me to sit with him and then I kinda lost it i was like “I’m not in a gang can y’all chill I was just playing around” and they were being still mad or something and the man was like 

(“okay you guys can chill y’all did what y’all did” “he was probably trying to fit in”) 

then they threaten him but they didn’t do anything.

Luckily they got off and one of them tried to hit me again and I blocked it. The man was asking me what happened and I told him he was asking if I had any older siblings, friends. Then it was an awkward 20 mins back home.

I love my girlfriend. So, so, so so much. She is amazing. But we live so far away. I’m in Canada, and she is in Australia. We’re young, early teens, and have been together for just over a year, as of November 30th. She is the love of my life, but I don’t know if this relationship will work out in the long term. She’s said she wants to stay in Australia, and I want to stay in Canada. I am terrified of Australia and I swear that God took every single dangerous creation they made and put it there. But she has a lot siblings that she is close to, and would want to stay there. As of me, I can’t handle the heat, bugs, whatever. I want to meet up with her so much. I love her more than I love myself. I am a person who needs constant reassurance and such and she has always given that to me, but I know this won’t work. Our interests are very different and we’re so far away. The only thing we really share is Stardew Valley. She doesn’t get super excited like I do and on calls, I feel awkward. I just want to be with her in real life. I want someone to hold me, hug me, be here with me, and I cry at least three times a week hugging a pillow and trying to pretend it’s her. I love her and have even sent her nudes, like shirtless pictures or just completely nude, and she’s sent me one before. I feel comfortable around her and she’s even made me conflict with myself if I’m rosesexual or not. I am sexually attracted to her, but I know an intimate relationship can’t happen long distance. It’s just frustrating for me to finally find someone who loves me, and that they’re so far away.

Got to the point that she asked him to go to couples therapy bc he clearly wasn't getting it and he refused to go back. That conversation basically ended with him essentially saying he'd rather get a divorce than go back to therapy. Then said he needed to think about things. I got a like 12am phone call to come home bc my mom had a panic attack so bad she couldn't open her hands and she went to the emergency room bc she's a stroke risk. My boyfriend drove me overnight to go be with her. My dad the next day confirmed he wanted a divorce it was a mess. Like 4 days later I get a text from my mom that they're not getting a divorce they're working on things. Now a few weeks later I call my mom to ask a question and ended up catching her at a bad time. She tells me that she found out a week or so ago that he had been having an affair for months with said coworker. The coworker is 25 my dad is almost 52. I'm 21 my sister is 24. My parents have been togeth +30 years and were high school sweethearts. Disgusted to say the least. There's so many factors of it all and I'm dreading going back home for the holidays I don't know how to handle any of this.

"I cannot understand this girl I’ve sorta kinda been seeing. We work together

We officially were seeing each other for about a month. We went on several dates, had sex, all in all it was going really well and I could see us becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. She’d mention meeting each others families and whatnot. Up until about a month ago when she just stopped returning my messages. Which was strange because she’d text me every day. Finally she told me she doesn’t think she can date quite yet because she needs to heal from being cheated on by her ex. I told her I understand. She said she wanted to be friends and maybe down the line pick up where we left off. I said sure. One thing about me is I’m very loyal even when I shouldn’t be. 

But she is hitting me with the most confusing mixed signals I’ve ever ever received. We still talk, but only if she initiates conversation. If I text her she just will not answer it. But on days that we work together, she will text me after. Like clockwork. Again if I text her she will not respond. She won’t text me on days that we don’t work together. 

On thanksgiving, at 1 am, she randomly texted me how badly she missed me and how she wishes I was laying in bed next to her. That she wishes I was holding her. That I left a t shirt at her house that she keeps under her pillow. 

The other night, I offered a ride home from work and she accepted. We talked in my car for like an hour. We hugged each other in a really tight embrace, and she put her lips on my neck. When I got home, she told me that she really wishes that she’d ask me to stay over. I told her I would come over and drop everything at any moment if that’s what she wants. But to that she didn’t answer. 

I just don’t understand. I don’t know if she likes me or doesn’t like me. She tells me she misses me and wants me to lull her to sleep but then she won’t even answer my message. Also, I don’t really understand because if you are telling me you want me over, what is stopping you from having me over?",I can’t understand this girl,18mle5w,1703044970.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mle5w/i_cant_understand_this_girl/,
"Ok, this is probably the least serious petty thing to do. But I (24m) have a friend (24m) who I have a weird...thing with. He says that he has no interest in me, which i can perfectly respect and compartmentalize, but he literally gives the most mixed signals I've ever experienced. I feel like I'm going insane a bit and ngl after months of this I'm kinda getting emotionally worn out from the push and pull. Not even in a romantic way, the friendship itself is also a bit of a mess. 

Anyways, I always like to give the best presents I can for someone - it's important to me. Knowing what they'd like best is part of it - my mom isn't into gifts that much, but appreciates spending time together &amp; words, so I've certainly had her ""present"" be just a sweet letter or taking off work to spend the time doing whatever she wants the whole day or whatever for birthdays. My dad is a big acts of service guy, I've given him a ""gift"" of doing projects for him in the past. It's what I like to do.

My friend, from what I can tell, the best present I can give him is something that:
1) a lot of effort is put into
2) strokes his ego.

I was planning on making something for him from the book he's written (he's written &amp; published a book - actually, 2 books now! Which I do genuinely find that something he should be proud of &amp; want to support), bc I'm a fairly creative person myself. I was thinking of drawing something as his first ""fanart"" for Christmas, and then when his birthday rolls around a couple weeks later, have a little like, embroidery hoop with a quote either from one of his books or a book/song he really likes. 

Anyways, he's been blowing me off for the past weeks for no reason at all. It's hard to find the motivation to put so much effort into gifts for someone who keeps pushing me away. Mind you, this is right after being so perfectionist about his Christmas present towards me (in a way he clearly had no problems with the rest of his friends) he requested more time &amp; also a whole interrogation on what I like best (""I know you would *appreciate* anything, but I want to get something you'd *love*""). He invited me &amp; only me to celebrate new years with him &amp; his parents. This is roughly what I've been dealing with since the summer.

He...doesn't actually like ""scary"" things for someone self-proclaimed Goth and put some pretty sick character designs in aforementioned books. Anyways, a bit angry at him, I decided his present was going to be a drawing, sure, but of one of the creatures in his book thats pretty gruesome - basically an animated corpse being held together with chains that run throughout their body. His ""offical"" art of them don't do them justice, probably bc giving them the full horror they deserve would make him squemish &amp; he'd never draw something that ugly either. (Tbh I've always found the concept super sick - I actually like horror). 

Like. He's going to almost have to be touched from the fact Ive done this in the first place, but also hate the drawing itself. I'm not pulling my punches. To get that ego boost of artwork made by someone else for his work, he has to confront the visceral disgust I hope to invoke. It's a bit mean, especially as its purposeful on my part. I mean, obviously Im only doing this bc its low stakes and I do still want him to feel loved, even if its admittedly with teeth. 

But god. If he wants to play games, I can play too. I'm damn good at games.",I'm giving a slightly malicious present to my friend for christmas,18mlbe6,1703044751.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mlbe6/im_giving_a_slightly_malicious_present_to_my/,
"Preface: interpersonal relationships with men have always been challenging me from past trauma. 
I fell in love a few years ago - it was accidental. I wasn’t looking or even the least bit interested. 
A little while ago my world collapsed when I found out he was married - his reaction? Let me gaslight the fuck out of this girl. He begged me for more time, explained that it was complicated and I believed him - even giving me a timeline to make moves towards being with me. Now I can’t believe I trusted him. It was all lies. 

Before anyone calls me “stupid” or “ignorant” or wants to reiterate that I lack morals and I’m a deplorable human - believe me, I’ve already said it to myself and probably in way worse than Reddit ever can. 

I feel ruined. Disgusted with myself. I cant sleep - can’t relax. The pain of imagining what could have been when you really thought you loved and trusted someone is all consuming. 
I’m furious that I was a part of it, distraught - cant turn off my brain. 
All I do is lay in bed and sob over what I believe life could’ve been. All I ever wanted was a healthy happy family - and a partner to create that with. I really thought I would be with him. 
He knows all the pain I’ve gone through, but didn’t give a fuck that he would cause the greatest one of them all.

"Summary: I cheated on my wife (12 years of marriage) and we got divorced. We also have 3 kids together who now live with their mom, and I live 7 hours away because of work. And now, I’m still talking to the girl who I had the affair with. She’s pretty amazing but I know there is no future with her and I just like the companionship. 

I consciously knew what I was doing when cheating. I knew how it could blow up my marriage and haunt me in the future, but I did it anyway. Didn’t even consider how my wife or kids would react. I was a real bastard at the time. Looking back now, I had some mental health issues (severe anxiety and depression) and just wanted to feel alive. Hence the affair. I was looking for something to ignite me physically and emotionally. 

I’m not using mental health problems as an excuse for what I did to my ex-wife and kids, but now, a year later, I feel absolutely terrible and guilty. And everything I do is worthless. I’m really throwing myself a pity parade. The guilt and isolation (even when chatting with my current GF) is unbearable sometimes.

There is no chance for reconciliation and I get along with my ex-wife okay-ish to coparent. But I can’t erase the good times we had. Please note: she’s moved on and I don’t blame her — I screwed her over emotionally. My kids are young so they are resilient and just know their dad doesn’t live with them anymore. I do miss kids A LOT!

My question is, why can’t I get over something I clearly did to myself and my family? At the time of the affair, everything seemed on point. I was unhappy trying to find a solution and I found it. Or I thought so. Now I feel like I can’t find that connection again and I feel like an asshole when I tell dates I was the reason my previous marriage failed (they would eventually find out if it got serious anyway).

I have no financial burden, my kids seem happy, and I have a great job. Seriously, why do I feel like a piece of shit and I just can’t bounce back from these feelings. Sorry about my rambling… it’s just crazy how I knew this post-divorce mess would happen and now that I’m facing it, my emotions don’t want to step up and let me move on.","I cheated, knew what I was doing, ended my marriage and now I can’t forgive myself.",18mkgyw,1703042137.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mkgyw/i_cheated_knew_what_i_was_doing_ended_my_marriage/,
"I miss him so much. 
My (24 F) boyfriend (27 M) of 8 years proposed to me about a month ago now. After a few weeks of bliss, we got into a big argument and he said he needed a break for months. I said okay because I was mad but still wanted to marry him. After no contact for a few weeks, I reached out and asked him if we could talk. We did and he said his feelings have changed since proposing. During our argument, I reminded him of someone who was abusive to him in the past and he finally told me about it. I’ve been beating myself up because I never wanted to hurt my biggest love. It was stupid and I know words hurt. I lashed out when I shouldn’t have. We’ve been texting every now and then since then but we decided we will have a decision this weekend on if we’re together or breaking up completely. I don’t want to lose him. I know I can’t force him to love me but fuck does it hurt. I just want to hold him and care for him again. I’m worried he’s going to break it off completely when I can’t see my life without him. I miss him so much and I love him so deeply. I don’t know what to do

Edit;
A lot of you are asking what I said;
The proposal was beautiful but when we had talked about it before, I had told him a few things that were important to me. He didn’t do them and after he cancelled plans on me, he went out with his friends for 8 hours bar hopping. He wasn’t communicating with me at all, I got mad and told him through text that I wish he did it differently and heard me when I said those things were important to me. I told him his communication sucks and that I wasn’t as big of a priority in his life because he would cancel a lot. That getting engaged made him “too comfortable.”

This was the text from me and he shut down ever since then. I know I hurt him and I know that I was hurt when I sent it.
“No you know what, I haven’t said anything about the engagement because if anything it’s what you wanted. I never expressed wanting to stay at that hotel or go to the beach. That was all you. You didn’t take into account of anything I said I wanted for our engagement. I talked about getting engaged for years, apparently even when you didn’t want to get married or marry me. You couldn’t say anything, you had the worst communication, and you again have been worse with me ever since then. I’m not a priority to you and even in our engagement I could see that you only thought of what you wanted. I have been at my breaking point with you to the point where I have to ask if this is something that is going to continue. And honestly, if the relationship keeps going this way, no”

Thankfully the second sprained ankle and wrist I was an adult so I could take myself. When someone a few doors down had a gun and shot it at someone’s house, and I, only 10 years old, ran down the street back home, neither she or my father believed me. When I accidentally cut my ankle and knee badly while shaving on two separate occasions respectively neither she or my dad came to help me while I screamed for help, instead they screamed at me for crying, for asking for help, and when 40 minutes later they saw how bad it was they did not apologize or help me.

She screamed at me when I wanted to wear shorts under my graduation gown (that no one would have even seen), but let my brother do the same two years later.

"CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE

I (19M) have had quite a rocky start in life. Born in poverty with no father figure as he died just before I was born and a mentally unwell, drug addicted mother, unemployed and claiming welfare/child maintenance with 3 other siblings. We never really knew where our next meal would come from, but she always made sure we ate (thanks mum). Since I was the youngest child which made me an easy target to pin blame on, something (usually money) goes missing? I stole it. Something gets broken? That was me, usually this would end up with me getting punished... Maybe my mother hated me or something, who knows? 

My childhood wasn't great how do I know? I can't remember most of it and the things I do aren't good. We moved around a lot, never in the same house for more than 2-3 years, introduced to sketchy men who my mother decided to date. One of which we moved countries for and was over £30,000 in debt to some Hells Angels for drugs, but when we bailed on him, I was pulled out of school for ""home schooling"" at one of the most crucial times in my social development. So when starting secondary school I didnt have many, if any friends and was bullied a little. Nothing bad, only name calling from students and teachers alike. My brother SA'd me, it hurt (we were both minors at the time) and being the idiot 11 year old I was, I didnt say anything. This fucks with my head even today, but I don't hate him for it, I pity him for being so mentally ill. 

At age 13, my mother decided to end it, hanging herself with no explanation, leaving no note. This FUCKED with me so hard because it happened after an argument we had ending in me telling her: ""I hate you."" This put a burden of guilt on me which still hangs in my mind today like a sticky coating I can't scrub out. I went into foster care with my brother (15M). Our first ""carers"", two slimy business partners (which im fairly sure were operating some kind of scam) used us for cheap labour, such as pulling weeds from the horse fields with a pair of gloves between us, sorting products into groups in the thousands and lifting the hull of a catamaran while he used an engine hoist on the opposite side (that shit was heavy, why not leave it built and in the dock? I still feel it in my back occasionally). They often went away for weekends, which gradually turned into weeks here and there. It got to the point where the local authority stepped in and took us away. We were then placed with two carers who were nice enough, but never included us in holidays, family gatherings, meals out, etc. It was like we weren't even there, essentially just ghosts. I closed myself off, not talking to anyone about my problems, although I did make friends in my new school, I don't really talk to them often these days. 

As is the running theme in my life, shit never works out. Due to covid I got given very mediocre grades which does me no favours. After my brother moved out at 18, I was thrown out a couple years later at age 17 with no explanation. With nowhere to go at the time, I packed my bags and moved into supported living which was everything but supportive. The people I moved in with were very confrontational, as well as quite intimidating (the man was 6'4 and like 300lbs), they would find any opportunity to argue with or shout at me. My PA(Personal Advisor) came to the house to have a chat with me about how I was settling, being a good host, I made him a cup of coffee. Boom, that was the first mistake since I didnt buy the milk or coffee they started an argument about how I should've asked if I was okay to make a coffee for him (what the fuck?). A sock left on the bedroom floor? Argument about cleaning. A small burn on the carpet from a zippo related incident? Police called on me for ""trying to burn the house down."" Luckily i wasnt arrested or charged with anything, but this scared me. So many more small incidents to argue about. At this point in time I was working a dead end job, working 60-70 hours a week stress through the roof, so I started smoking (I wish I hadn't). With the added stress of this guy pressuring me with vague threats like ""You should probably start looking for a place to live."" I quit my job as there was no chance I could afford to rent in my area even with the amount of hours worked. So I moved away to live with my eldest brother. As you've probably guessed from how my life has gone so far, this was also a bad decision, but this time from me. I decided to asked about our family, as I know nothing about us. Turns out Him and I are full siblings and the other two are only half, both with different fathers. I decided to reach out to our fathers parents. They flat out ignored my message and told my brother that they highly doubt I was related. 

I blew through what little savings I had amassed, just over £1000 in about a month. I've had a couple jobs since moving in with him which ended disastrously, although I started dating an amazing woman who means the world to me (yay something good finally happened). Which brings us to today. I'm putting in so many applications, attending interviews and getting turned down, trying to get new skills and certificates which so far has resulted in nothing. I don't have that sibling bond with any of my brothers or sisters I've seen with my friends, but I wish I did. I'm beginning to lose hope for my future, but I will keep my chin up for my woman and in case luck finally smiles upon me.



TL;DR I complain about how my life seems to always suck, even though I try so hard to make it not, despite this I'm still hoping for a better future.

"My coping mechanism for reality is an overwhelming need for progress. It drives me in life in the form a desperation to survive with overwhelming disadvantages in a cruel and dismissive reality.

I also hold a competing belief that any negative thing that happens to me in my life is due to some factor that I haven't accounted for or some risk that I willingly took.

This leads to a synergistic sort of belief where I want to survive yet I feel like I'm to blame for my own disadvantages and ""uncontrollable"" factors which then increases my desperation and obsession to improve even more because I'm constantly being blocked by these ""controllable"" disadvantages.

It creates an endless need for progress in me. Life is harsh and I get desperate to move forward and then when faced with obstacles, I feel accountable for them, and so I'm fueled even more to make progress because I feel like I should have done more.

This is why I ultimately find it hard to do things just to do them. Even eating tasty food or rubbing one out is to feel good so I can sleep or feel good enough to focus and make progress elsewhere. It was the same with drugs before I got sober. Same with sex. It all feels like a stepping stone for progress.

I've always had this in some form since I was a child. Any stressful, traumatic, or even happy experiences can only be rationalized and re-framed as stepping stones for some greater plan.

"I’ve crashed my car enough times that I’m not allowed to drive it. Mind you I didn’t completely pay for my car my mom pays in installments. Nonetheless it has loomed over me and my family treats me differently because so.

I never really tried in highschool. I was/still am smoking weed heavily. The weed definitely killed my drive and by the time senior year came around my family basically had to apply for college for me. Whilst applying I almost didn’t get into any college as I did everything late. (I.e sending over my transcripts and talking to school counsel for etc. this stressed my family out more and through it all I had the same feeling of “eh if it  happens it happens”. I got into a university near me and had my first semester in august which ended in January. All in all I’ve failed 4/5 classes. I’m not interested in my major and tbh I just didn’t care.
 It’s not like I don’t care about the money or that I didn’t do any work. A lot of stuff happened where I couldn’t acces my assignments that mixed with my procastination just did a lot of damage. I didn’t tell my sister or my mom that this was happening. They already berate me enough for being lazy and I didn’t want the added stress of them breathing down my neck while I was also failing. So now here I am Christmas break waiting to tell my mom I failed the fuck out of my freshman year.

Not to sound like a pick me. But I’ve been contemplating suicide since middle school. And it’s starting to look like more and more of a reliable option. I know my family will be sad but I honestly don’t care. If I can end the stress of life and the worries about my future with one action. What’s stopping me? What other people feel? Maybe I’m just a maxed out selfish lazy person but I’ve never had any goals or careers taht interested me. No hobbies nothing at all. The only thing that I can kind of do is write music. But compared to an average tiktok im worse then average.

"I’m the oldest child and have one younger brother who is three years younger than me. We grew up playing together while our parents were at work, but one day we just started to fight… A lot. From what I recall, it was mostly me being annoyed by him by little things which I feel is typical in a sibling relationship. However, it just kept getting worse. My parents were strict with me. They also had more expectations of me. They expected me to always take care of my brother, tutor my brother, do his chores, drive him, and be on-call for him. Now that I’m 23 and looking back, I realized I took this all out on my brother. He’s a good kid. I couldn’t fight back against my parents because I was scared of them getting angry with me, so I developed an attitude with my brother and that led to a strain in our relationship. I wish we were closer. We talk when I initiate conversations but he’s very reserved when we’re home for the holidays. I have a better relationship with my parents but not my brother. There is always this awkward tension when the four of us are together, so our family time isn’t that great. It’s usually me and my parents talking, and my brother on his phone completely disconnected. I feel negative, down, and sad about it. 

When I’m with people other than my family, I’m very lively and positive. I love being able to be there for my friends and with my friends. I rarely have an attitude with them. 

All this really is to say I wish I hadn’t pushed my younger brother away. As an older sister, I had the upper hand in crafting our relationship and I screwed up because I took all the anger I had from my parents’ expectations out on him.",Im a different person when im with family vs friends,18mjka9,1703039414.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mjka9/im_a_different_person_when_im_with_family_vs/,
"We(M23 and F28} met a few months ago, but we had our first date on the 1st day of this month. 

On the 3rd day I was already living with her. She was going through some problems, she's borderline and was in crisis and I was helping her. 

Last Wednesday I went back to my place, but we still saw each other on Thursday and Friday. On Friday she really wanted me to go with her to a concert, but I'd have to get up early on Saturday and that would be an expense I didn't want to have. She said it would be quick, she'd only see one singer and we'd go home, but I still didn't want to. 

We weren't dating and we each had our freedom, I knew she was seeing other people and I was too. As she doesn't have a cell phone, the agreement was that she would borrow someone's cell phone to text me when she left to order her Uber. And I waited, but she didn't show up until I went to sleep.

At 5am I woke up to a call from her. I saw that she had tried at 3am, but it wasn't enough to wake me up. On the call she said she didn't know if she was going home or to an after-party, so I told her I'd go back to sleep and when she decided she'd call me.

I woke up to go to class and she hadn't replied, her mother was texting me asking for her. I explained the situation and her mother became extremely worried. I sent a message to the number she had used to contact me and I was blocked. Her mother also got in touch and nobody answered.

I went back and got in touch with his family, apparently it was just some random guy she asked for his cell phone while out and about and she blocked me, the guy had no news. 

She got home at 4pm. I called her and she said ""I'm single and I was enjoying my life, I don't have to give any satisfaction"". I just said ""And your mother was feeling ill because of it"", then hung up. 

She went to talk to her mother and I sent her a text saying I was going to stay away. And I mentioned something: that her mother suspected her of using hard drugs, that she should be careful what she did. Her mother had been in contact with me all these weeks and had always commented on her fear that her daughter was using hard drugs. 

That was enough for her to have a psychotic break and end up in the psychiatric emergency room. When she got there she was talking about nothing, I calmed her down and when she finally calmed down she asked me to be her boyfriend. She said she didn't want anyone else but me, that it wasn't worth it if she was going to lose me and that she loved me. 

Anyway, when she finally calmed down and was released, a car from a private clinic for addicts arrived and forceful took her away. I went along and the whole time I was trying to reassure her. 

Her mother put her in an addiction clinic. An addiction clinic is 15 days before you can make a phone call, if the patient cooperates, and 1 month before you can start receiving visitors, under the same conditions as the phone call. 

6 months to get out, since it's her first hospitalization. 

I know it's not my fault, but I can only feel like it is. I could have gone with her on Friday and none of this would have happened. I feel really bad about all this and about the things I witnessed during the hospitalization. I felt weak because I couldn't do anything at the time.

The hospitalization took place on Saturday and I wrote this piece on Sunday. Today, Tuesday, I'm still trying to deal with it. 

I still feel the guilt, but it's no longer the thought that's dominating my mind, but rather the thought of missing her. I feel empty and I'm on repeat listening to the same depressing songs. I can't find the strength or the will to do anything: read, watch, study or work. 

I've never been through a situation like this, I've never had a problem dealing with break-ups, but I just don't know what happened between us. Are we together? I don't know if I should consider a proposal from someone in a psychotic break. And I'm selfish, I keep thinking about the possibility that during this time she only approached me - and liked me - because she was going through a bad time and that now in the clinic she'll be cured and won't want me anymore. 

I just wanted to talk to her, to find out if she still wants me. And if so, to make it clear that I'm going to wait for her and do my utmost to show her my company, whether by going on visits or calling. No matter how far the clinic is (3 hours to get there and 3 hours to get back).

Her mother is very fond of me because she knows that I was there looking after her daughter for a few weeks and said that I have free access as if I were family to visit her when the clinic gave permission. She'll keep me informed of any news, but so far the only news I've had is that she's fluctuating between being calm, understanding her situation and becoming aggressive because she doesn't want to be hospitalized.

I can't talk to my friends about how I feel, because there's details about her private life that are only her business. These mixed feelings are only drowning me, I'm feeling a void and I don't know what to do..",She was forceful put in a clinic for addiction/mental health issues,18mjjf4,1703039341.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mjjf4/she_was_forceful_put_in_a_clinic_for/,

"tl,dr; I (29, agender) am filing divorce from my husband (36M) of almost 9 years after years of gaslighting myself into believing everything was fine and now I feel resentment about living a lie for so many years and want to cut him out of my life but I can't and I don't know how to deal with any of it

I was 19 when I met him, he was 26. I was lost and struggling with my mental health and wanted desperately to get away from my parents. He was a ""nice guy"" who worked with me. His family is super religious which was a little weird for me at first (I'm not religious at all) but they all seemed so warm and welcoming. Despite the rocky relationship I had with my mom, I think deep down part of me was hoping that if I married a nice man and had a family she'd be proud and maybe we could fix things between us. I did have feelings for my husband. Looking back, I think it was more of a strong friendship/respect feeling than romance, but back then I didn't know the difference.

I was his first everything. He had never kissed anyone, never been in a relationship, all that. And it wasn't like when other guys say that - he legitimately told me he was saving himself for marriage and just never found someone he thought he'd want to spend time with before me. He introduced me to his family almost immediately. I got to know his older brother over chats about the Bible, babysat his nieces, practiced speaking his first language so I could talk to his mom, I went to his church and sang with the choir. It felt nice to feel accepted. He and his family started talking about us getting married within 2 months of us starting to date. My mother tried to warn me. Our relationship was incredibly strained due to childhood abuse and neglect so I didn't listen to her.

He said he wanted to live with me but we needed to be married before we could cohabitate. We signed the papers on the 1 year anniversary of the day we met. It all happened so fast. I learned very quickly that he did not know how to do \*any\* household tasks. He couldn't cook anything that wasn't microwaved, he didn't know how to do laundry, our first apartment didn't have a dishwasher and if he tried to do dishes, I'd have to rewash them because he'd leave grease or bits of food on things. It was frustrating, but I told myself that marriage means sacrifice, so it's okay and I could just do more housework. He always felt insecure about the fact that I made more money than he did, but I just reassured him that it was okay, I'd do what it takes to be a good wife. Deep down I knew things were a little off, but I figured with time it would get better.

Over the years we lived in the same patterns over and over again. I'd pick up his slack, he'd try but often struggled to help in a meaningful way. I'd beg him for more. More help with the housework,  more help with the bills, eventually more help with the kids. I felt like it was all brushed off. We tried the therapy thing. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and he was diagnosed with depression. I sought therapy, I tried medications, I did what I could to try to get better. He lived in denial and did not try to get help for himself. I was making his appointments, I was calling everywhere and everything. I had to literally go in with him because he would just tell the therapist he was fine and didn't know why he was there. I eventually gave up. Threw my energy into the 2 kids we had and just kept praying maybe one day it would feel better, even though I still had that nagging feeling that something was wrong.

In 2017 I couldn't ignore some of the feelings I was having and came out as non-binary. He was shocked. I thought it would end our marriage, and that thought didn't make me sad. That should've been a red flag, I ignored it. He tried his best. His family (and mine) never really accepted me, but he asked me to help him practice using my pronouns and calling me his spouse instead of wife. It felt good. I still felt off, but thought it would get better. It was one of the first times I felt like he was really on my team.

But that didn't last. In 2019 he quit his stable full-time job to try to open a business without fully consulting with me about it. We had no savings. He used his last paycheck to open an account and purchase accounting software. I worked extra hard to try and keep us afloat while he lost money consistently and failed to build a client base. I kept thinking ""well it's for better or for worse, it'll get better...""

At the end of 2020 we ended up moving 16 hours from my home town where we lived to be closer to my parents has his mother had moved back to his home country and we wanted to stay close to people who could help with the kids if something came up. I discovered a local queer meetup that I started going to every month. It felt so freeing to be around people who understood. Those people helped me understand so many things about myself. I talked about the ways my marriage didn't feel right, and instead of telling me to try harder like our church friends did back home, they asked me what I wanted to do. They let me talk openly about my issues and helped me work through them. I started understanding all the ways my marriage was not healthy. I'm so grateful to them for giving me that space. The more I thought about my feelings, the more I understood what that weird little feeling I had was - I wasn't really attracted to my husband. I am attracted to women.

I came out as a lesbian to my husband in 2022. For a while, I honestly considered just staying married to him and not ever doing anything about it. I cared for him and thought I could just suppress my feelings. But something changed. Suddenly all my friendships were under the microscope. He started to get more controlling. He used me coming out as an excuse to not do anything around the house or look for a job. I finally decided to break it off. Ooooh boy. He lost his shit. He was never physically abusive, but the emotional abuse got intense. We had to stay living together for a while since I was waitlisted for affordable housing but couldn't stand the thought of continuing to pretend to be a loving partner. He was constantly demanding that I explain. To an extent I didn't blame him for being confused. I was incredibly confused and felt blindsided myself! He would guilt-trip me into giving him money or taking more responsibility from him because he couldn't take it. He would not go to therapy. I recommended he try to make some friends and even watched the kids during his time to allow him to go find a hobby or group to join, he wouldn't do it. He was constantly crying and demanding I comfort him. Cycles over and over. Me telling him I can't keep doing it, him refusing to get help, me giving in.

1 full year and 1 day ago, I was approved to move into income-based apartments. He moved into the same apartment complex, walking distance from me.

He kept laying on the guilt and I unfortunately let him take advantage of me, ""for the kids."" He asked to use my car to do delivery app work until he could find a job, without telling me he was instead using it for rideshare work 24/7, damaged it, and wracked up an absurd number of miles while still claiming he wasn't making any money and couldn't afford to fix it and would come take groceries out of my house because he had no food. I didn't want to fight. I was emotionally exhausted and just let it happen.

I went back to school, got myself in to more therapy, kept working on myself and trying my best. I got a good job. I met a girl and she's so fucking incredible it makes me wonder how I ever thought I could love anyone the way I love her. The kids are adjusting and I'm trying to be a better parent to them than I had growing up.

My husband, nearly 2 years since we broke up, is still convinced I am coming back, and cycles through levels of anger and depression that he expects me to comfort him through. When I try to put my foot down and set a boundary, he blows up. He cannot and will not move on. I've tried everything. I told him to get therapy, he won't do it. I told him maybe he should move to be closer to his mom or brother but he said he would not go without the kids and I don't trust he could actually handle parenting full time without me. Everything in me is screaming that it is not going to stop until he is out of my life permanently but I know that's never going to happen.

I hide my anger, I hide my resentment, I hide my shame. I want to run. I want to disappear. I want the world to stop. I want a time machine so I can go back and slap myself in the stupid 19 year old face for not seeing the red flags. I want to ask him why the fuck he at 26 would even look at a 19 year old as someone he could date. But I feel like there's not much I can do and I'm just going to end up stuck with him in my life no matter what I do.

"It all started as a simple crush when we were thirteen years old, we knew each other since we were children (small town) but we weren't very close, I only became friends with them when we started going to the same high school, they was fun, pretty, interesting, it just felt natural to have had a crush on them, I often fantasized about what it would be like to tell them my feelings, it didn't happen as I would like it, a former mutual friend found out about my feelings and decided to go tell them directly without consulting me. In the end they told me that they didn't feel the same way and I told them that I was okay that it wasn't that big of a deal and that we should continue just as friends.

So I just sucked it up, got over it and moved on or at least I thought I got over it, a year later I start datingsomeone else, they also dated other people. Fast forward four years, they becomes one of my closest friends and we even sometimes joke about my ""childish crush"" on them, so one day we are with a group of friends at a party and we are talking and laughing about something I don't even remember and they asks me to wait a second because they are going to get something to drink, and it is at that moment, when I see them walking away while I smile like an idiot that something in my head clicks and I say to myself, ""shit, I love them"" not like a simple crush like when we were just getting close, not like anything I had felt for anyone before, I realized that I loved them, I desire them, like someone who has a designated room in my heart, like someone whose very existence has made me smile like a fool, like someone who I can imagine in five, ten, or twenty years and would still occupy a place in my chest, loving them the same if not more than now, unfortunately I also realized how much I wanted to kiss them, and I spent the rest of the party worrying that I'd do it on an impulse, or that other people would notice the way I start to look at them.

Currently, almost three years have passed since that revelation and I have learned to live with these feelings. I had hoped that after I moved from my hometown they would diminish, but they are still there. Every time we meet again during the holidays, I can feel them like a silent heartbeat behind a door, at this point, the thorn in my chest already feels like a part of me.

I don't think I'll tell them, not in the near future, maybe never, we don't even live in the same city anymore and I see no point in telling them, I don't expect anything more than what we currently have, I just sometimes allow myself to fantasize, think ""What if?"", but I know that I would never act on that.

"Okay, time for some backstory. This girl, Clara (21F) and I (25M) dated for about 3 months earlier this year. After the breakup, we tried to remain friends, but we just kept hurting each other emotionally, so I made the decision to go no contact.

 Some time later, I unblocked her number and socials, and she reached out to me. She basically told me that she had broken up with her new BF and wanted to see how I was doing. I made it clear that I wasn't looking for a relationship with anyone, but would be open to again being friends. She would constantly tell me that she still loved me and had strong feelings for me. We had sex a few times during this period, while reinforcing that things would go no further. 

She then tells me that she had been talking to another guy and wanted to start a relationship with him. I wished her luck and happiness. She then tells me that she'd probably be forced to stop talking to me by her new BF, because of the feelings she had for me and her wanting to respect the new relationship. From this point, our communication pretty much trickled off. The only times I'd hear from her were when she needed emotional support because of problems with her new BF. 

A few days passed without any word from her, and I reached out. I basically asked if this was it, so I knew what to expect going forward. She tells me that she had been to the ER for abdominal pain, and when they tested her urine, it came back positive for chlamydia. I had slept with someone between my last time being tested and hooking up with Clara, so I told her as such. She told me that she had slept with new BF, so it was unclear who transmitted the STI.

The morning after this convo, she informs me that she had gotten the ultimatum that she expected. The gist of what her message said was, ""I love you so much, and I'm sorry for anything wrong that I did to you."" I responded, ""Someone who truly loves you won't try to control you,"" and blocked her on everything. 

Well it turns out that I forgot to block her on Instagram, because she DMed me later that night to tell me that she decided to leave her man. She told me that she wasn't going to be forced to choose between her friendships and relationships, and that he was using ""manipulation tactics"" (ya think so?). 

I told her that I needed some time to think about how I felt and what I wanted to do, moving forward. She told me that was fine and to take as much time as I needed. 

The next day, I messaged her to ask a question, only to find that I was blocked. I unblocked her number, and attempted to call her, only to be sent to voicemail. I'm extremely confused as to what happened with her, and I guess I'll never know.

"Hello Reddit I’m (33 F), my husband (35 M) is gay, and possibly has been cheating on me for over a year. I'm finding so much evidence right now and it's honestly shocking. I can't believe how blinded I have been by love. Even as I sit here holding the divorce papers I consider that this might be a mistake, that he might actually love me, that all the messages are jokes. Or faked. Denial is a strong and difficult emotion. I find myself grieving our courtship, our marriage, everything. My friends are his friends and vice versa. I don't know how to go forward. I'm so blinded by sadness, anger, and guilt that I don't know if we can have any sort of relationship after this. But I feel like I can't let him go. 

Despite his flaws, he was the most caring man I've ever been with. Letting him go is one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do. I know it's for the best, but it's hard to accept right now. Hopefully one day we will be able to get on good terms again, and I hope it's soon, but until then this is the situation. He's going on tour with his band and I'm staying at home. We've decided to take dual custody of our animals, and I will be taking care of them until he returns. With this comes taking care of our shared home. We were so happy when we put down the first payment, ready to be husband and wife, envisioning our futures together. Or at least I was. I don't know what he had in mind. 

I don't know if he thought he could hide this from me, or get rid of it entirely, but whatever it was, it did not work. For those asking, the confrontation went as follows. When he returned from clubbing with his friends last night, (or so he says - we don't have each others locations, because I've never had a reason not to trust him, and vice versa) and I asked him if he enjoys being married to me. He said yes, he does, and asked what the problem was. Then I pulled out my iPad and opened the photos. I showed him the screenshots of his conversations, with his band mate, who i found was the person he was cheating with. 

Both parties were aware of the implications of their clandestine relationship, and made no moves to stop it or consider my feelings. I let him see that I had discovered his affair, and he began to sob into his hands. I calmly asked him if he was gay, to which he replied that he didn't know. I explained to him that I want the truth. So, finally, he told me the truth. He explained to me that when we first started dating, he was in love with me. He claimed he still was, but in a way he didn't understand. 

He explained that he had always known he was gay, but really did fall in love with me. Somehow. He thought this ""cured him"", in a way, (which I told him not to say, as despite what he thinks of himself and what he's done, homosexuality is not an ""illness"" and therefore cannot be ""cured"") He then explained that he was happy with me for the first two years of our marriage. Everything then was genuine, the down payment, the kids, everything. I started crying at this, because I really did believe him. I knew he must have been genuine, because we were both the happiest we'd ever been. Everyone had said so. 

Then he told me what changed everything. Last year, his band had a new bassist join, replacing their old one. He said he had felt no attraction to the man at first, but knew he was different. Something was different. Through sobs, he explained that they had kissed after practice one day, when they had gotten drunk, celebrating the successful play through of their newest song. 

I stroked his hair and told him it was ok. Though I was hurt, I could tell he was really going through it was well. From there it had progressed, and he fell for the other man completely. He told me he still loved me deeply and that we had a bond that could never be broken. I understood this. Soon, he said, he began sneaking out of the house to go see this man. I'll admit this is where I started crying. 

Our house was our safe space for so long, and I thought I could trust him, trust that he was next to me in bed every night, offering support even in slumber. (for those who will most likely be wondering, I am a very deep sleeper, and therefore did not hear anything.) He told me he snuck out mostly on days where I didn't have to go in to work, so he could stay the night and wake up with his paramour. This made me sob even harder. I've always valued mornings, and I loved waking up next to my husband. 

I then realized I hadn't noticed the mornings he wasn't all the way there, and seemed more tired than usual, and now they all came flooding back to me. There were so many signs I missed because I was in love and in denial. We hugged and sat together for hours, discussing what would happen, which I already detailed above. He explained he really is in love with this band mate, and that he treats him well. Since this is the case, I can't bring myself to cut him off completely. The smile on his face when he talks about the other man is radiant, reminiscent of one he used to give me. 

My only hope now is that he remains happy and doesn't get his heart broken. Mine is broken, of course, but I've gotten so many apologies it feels like it'll be ok. We slept in the same bed for one last time, just cuddling. I realized how much more comfortable it was when there was no pressure to perform or prove something to one another. Again, I trust we can move forward with this and lead our own lives, it's just very difficult right now. I'm happy he's finally able to be himself, even though it shouldn't have happened this way.  

Throughout the past couple days I've been torturing myself with signs I've missed. How many things do we brush off when it comes to our partners, rationalizing it as overthinking or overanalyzing their actions? Lots, from what it's looking like.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the kind comments. I'm realizing I was a bit too nice to him, but I think the shock played into that. About the comments about this being fake: I assure you it's not, I just have a certain style of writing. Reading it back, it does sound quite flowery but it was reread and edited multiple times as I wanted to make sure this made as much sense as possible. I will be taking people's advice and trying to not contact him for now as it is quite painful but I do hope we can become friendly in the future.

"I don’t know who to turn to for this, I don’t even know what to think right now. I just need to hear that I’m not crazy and that it was weird. My (19f) younger brother (13m) and I were playing headbandz on the couch and we were joking around and laughing and stuff. I had been guessing my turns very quickly and when I would win he would playfully hit me in the stomach. This time I won very quickly and he was laughing and acting shocked saying I cheated but he throws himself at me and gets on top of me pretending to hit me kind of hard when all of a sudden I feel him grabbing my nipple. Then I try to push him off but I feel him getting me from behind and I see him visibly grabbing both my breasts with his hands and that image won’t get out of my head. At that point I wasn’t pretending to tell him to get off, I really meant it, but he won’t let go. He finally does and I’m still in shock so I try to keep my cool. All these other moments this past year when he’s pretending to grab my arm or pinch me but goes straight to my chest come flooding to my head. In those little moments I always make excuses like oh maybe it was an accident or something like that. But this time I saw it happen for way longer than an accident and it really didn’t feel like it. I feel really weird and really grossed out. I don’t know how to feel. He’s my younger brother and I had a hand in raising him even when I was a child myself. But since that happened it feels so weird and I can’t even look at him right now. My boyfriend told me I have to tell someone, I don’t want to tell anyone, especially not my mom because it would break her heart to know what he did, he’s still young and I don’t want that image stuck in my moms head for the rest of her life too. Idk what to feel right now. This is like the sixth time I’ve been sexually assaulted and I don’t want to keep dealing with this, especially by my brother who I cared for a lot.

Edit: hey everyone, I have no idea what a copy pasta is, I assume you guys mean I’m copying something for clout or shits and giggles. But hey I just got fucking assaulted and I didn’t lie about it, I know that’s pretty hard to believe but it happened. My brother is also taller than me and is heavier too, I’m 5’2 and he’s 5’6, which is why by some people’s logic that I will not fight him or why he was able to grab me and molest me at all. 

Edit 2: I took everyone’s advice. I asked my older brother (21M) to have a talk with me to my younger brother. At first he laughed because he realized what I was talking about and got uncomfortable that I confronted him. I explained to him that what he did was wrong even and that I was his sister, that even if I wasn’t his sister he should never grab a girl there without her consent because it’s gross and incredibly wrong. My older brother at first was livid and started calling him a bunch of names, but I told him to stop (even if he deserved it) because I wasn’t trying to make him feel bad, I was trying to make him understand that he shouldn’t do that again. I think when I’m ready, I’ll get my older brother to help me tell my father. I’m glad I spoke about it, because I know now I wasn’t crazy and if I hadn’t I didn’t want him doing that behavior on other girls; at the end of the day I don’t want other girls to go through what I went through five times prior. I was 12 years old the first time I got assaulted, and I’m deeply ashamed it happened again especially by someone who I would give a kidney to. Thank you everyone who encouraged me to confront him.

Edit 3: apparently it’s my fault I got assaulted by some men in the comments so let me clarify a couple of things. I was wearing a bra. I was wearing a thick shirt. I’ve been sexually assaulted six different times by DIFFERENT MEN OF ALL AGES NOT JUST MY BROTHER SO I THINK I KNOW WHEN TO RECOGNIZE THAT IM NOT OVERTHINKING OR OVERREACTING. I’m deeply disappointed in some of the men on this subreddit. You will find an excuse to ridicule me, instead of trying to want to correct the actions of my younger brother so he turns into a better person.

"Hi Reddit! Ummm I just really need to vent, it’s hard talking to people in person. I’m worried about my relationship, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year now. Lately, we’ve been having some arguments. I know they happen cause of me. I’m bad with my words and they usually start whenever I decide to just say whatever the fuck I want. It hurts and I’m afraid it’ll strain our relationship. He helps me through it but I can’t fix myself. I didn’t have a good relationship to look up to growing up. My dad beat my mom and my sisters sometimes (including me not as badly). I have horrible bipolar disorder that stems from the abuse and I was depressed and suicidal but was two/three months sober before meeting my boyfriend. But back onto the topic. It’s been happening so often before bed and my boyfriend tries to reassure me that we’re okay and that we’re only like this because of holidays (our jobs deal with holiday rushes, me working in retail and him in grocery it’s been very busy due to the holidays). He tells me that he’s here with me every step of the way but it’s hard to believe. Before meeting my boyfriend, I was talking to this ex and he told me all these promises until he ghosted. I know my boyfriend is nothing like him but hearing it from him scares me that this relationship could potentially end. Me and my boyfriend already talked and had a serious talk but I’m just not sure everything is fine.

"I always say, I’m fine, I’m ok, I always place a mask over my face, a fake smile and a laugh that seems real but I know is fake. I don’t like say I in stuff it makes it seem like I’m selfish or obnoxious, but I guess when you have feelings there’s a lot of I’s. I never like to complain or tell people I’m not ok, I know others are going through so much more shit than me and I shouldn’t complain. I have a mother who loves me (I think), a roof over my head, food, snacks, an education, “friends”, but I still feel not ok. I was abused by my dad’s ex fiancé, he enabled it to happen, I was depressed and suicidal at 13/14, told by people who I called friends to kill myself and to stop stalling. It took a while before I could actually get a little peace. But I never had real peace, I had these demons in me, demons that I fought for so long and I lost so many times and won some more. There’s still demons I have to face but I’m getting closer. I thought I was safe, then that safety was ripped away, I’m tormented by the things that happened to me and I hope that I one day won’t be.

I write too. At the moment I’m slowly writing a dark story, I like to write, it brings me to a place where the laws of reality aren’t real, I get to create them. It makes me somewhat happy, but once I stop writing, that feeling of dread, sadness, complete and utter loneliness.

I know I shouldn’t complain about my life, others have it way worse than me, but I’m scared I’m gonna snap, everything that I keep bottled up, locked away, every ounce of pain, sadness, anger I feel, i want to say it now because maybe talking about it can help.

"Fair warning, this will be all over the place and potentially hard to follow. 

I am at a loss for what to do. I feel like I’m making headway in one part of my life, but then another thing starts to spiral. Then when that one is taken care of, another thing starts going. I feel like I just can’t catch a break, and I know therapy is the answer but I suspended my service for it back in June because my therapist was going on maternity leave. Now that I really need it, I can’t afford to start it back up and insurance doesn’t cover my form of therapy (I use BetterHelp, because it’s easier and I’m more honest with myself and my therapist behind a screen, sadly). 

To start, back in August, I had made arrangements with the mortgage company to get caught up on payments. I’ve been paying one and one-third payments every two weeks in order to get caught up. Tomorrow is my last payment, but last month, hubby got a call from the mortgage people saying we’re still 2-months behind. Idk what’s going on there, but I will call them tomorrow and confirm we are caught up and set up automatic payments to start in January.  Things mellowed for a few months, though the stress of knowing that we aren’t paying certain bills because we know of the loopholes (they legally cannot turn off utilities after a certain date in fall, or before a certain date in spring in our state), but we know they’re behind but we can’t pay because we’re making extra payments on the house.  

It’s mostly the last week or so that has gone down the shitter… Saturday, my 14 year old daughter was given a citation for retail theft, which is something we will end up paying, but she’ll be doing manual labor for us. But on top of that, she skipped school and has a “you can’t do anything to me; I’m invincible” attitude, which I intend to break her of. But then yesterday, after work, on my way to pick up my other kids from school, I look over at another vehicle in traffic and can clearly make out the face of the scum bag that SA’d me in high school. I feel like I handled it well in the moment, but now it’s starting to weigh on me again. This is the first time I’ve seen him in roughly 10 years, so it came as a shock. My first thoughts though, were “you were strong enough back then to handle it, you’re stronger now, he can’t hurt you.”  That got me through the first few hours, but then flashbacks and thoughts started coming back.  No one in my household is respecting me as a parent (speaking about kids. Hubby supports me as a parent and guides me when I need his help). I’m the parent that’s quick to anger and yelling, but lately I’ve just been keeping my mouth shut to keep the peace when hubby isn’t home. I’m feeling worthless in my own home, and I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. I’m sitting here in my kitchen, in tears because I just don’t know what to do anymore.   No intentions of self harm or anything like that. Just hopeless at this point.",At a loss/hopeless,18mhfba,1703033111.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mhfba/at_a_losshopeless/,
"I met this girl around five years ago at the university courses. We were never close but always kept in touch. Two years ago she was in an accident and suffered a serious injury. Her hospital was 20 minutes away from my house, so I decided to visit her. After that, we chatted nonstop and became very close friends. I was telling her about everything that was going on in my life, she was sharing a lot too.

We were really happy when she was let to go home for a week, closer to the new year. She was still in bed, but so much better. I was extremely happy to see her on the mend, and I couldn’t wait it for my new friend to be around to have all this fun we’ve been planning. She was finally out in spring. I was shocked at how quickly she was back after all. She couldn’t walk or be out for long, but she was finally getting that taste of freedom she was craving. She even found a boyfriend and it all seemed to be really working out for her. 

And that’s where everything spiraled quickly between us. First, I started noticing how she was copying me in little things, like listening to my music or saying ""my"" words. I explained this as just normal behavior of friends, we became so much closer and therefore were into each other's interests. 

Things got a bit worse when this extrapolated to her taking pictures in the same poses as I did, trying to find the same clothes as I did, make-up, etc. Since the old time we had a joke that we are the same, bc there were a couple of funny stories related to us doing the same things without planning. But then she started using this joke to explain everything she did. It pissed me off because she was basically behaving like me. With my words, my clothes, my intonations. She also had quite a following on social media, and I hated seeing how she was praised for basically being ME.

I wasn't so sure of her copying until I shared an idea of bleaching my hair. After a week I told her, she bleached hers. I was trying to convince myself that it was just me being childish and we weren’t 10 years old anymore to be fussing around this pity question of copying. I was justifying it because I supposed she might be recovering from her trauma like this. So I let the girl slide with this and have fun.

The last straw was when she brought me a gift for my birthday. It was a portrait of me, as she said. But the problem was, the portrait had short bleached hair and bleached eyebrows. It was just like she looked at that moment. I showed the painting to some of my friends, and they all agreed it looked nothing like me. At this point, I was boiling.

What was adding up is that turned out, she had cheated on her bf. I strongly condemn that. I’ve distanced myself for a while. When we met again in the winter, she was so different. I felt like something was off, and though we hadn’t seen each other for a long time, I wasn’t even comfortable sharing. She then said she was fighting with jealousy towards other people and how they live. I raised my brow as if the statement had come out of nowhere.

This spring I’ve had my first thoughts of ending this friendship. She was almost unrecognizable, all she was talking about was how she was trying to make her bf buy her Cartier bracelet and take her on vacation. That sounded just plain delusional. I mean, you were supposed to be crazy not to see it was so much bigger than what he could’ve afforded to buy. Every time we spoke it was like a torture to listen.

Spring has ended with her buying the same necklace as I have. I was honestly taken aback by this because it’s significant to me in some way. It’s nothing too original, but I bought it on vacation with my parents and it held some meaning, I was wearing it almost every day. When she bought the same, it was obviously not a coincidence. I can’t explain, but suddenly my favorite necklace wasn’t even on my neck anymore.

I've distanced myself yet again for the whole summer. We met up this fall and she has told me everything she did, which included cheating on her bf again, then leaving him for the guy she cheated on him with, and cheating on that guy also almost immediately. All of that was yet again sprinkled with that money topic. During this talk, she also mentioned some things I’ve said previously about my personal life. What concerned me is that she remembered every detail and tried to make parallels with her decisions. I was uncomfortable with the way she presented my words, almost like she had them written down and learned by heart.

Since then I’ve been passively keeping our conversation alive and sometimes texting her if I need anything. It’s hypocritical, I know. Almost everything she does or says annoys me.I realized I still keep her around because she has some qualities I really appreciate in people. She is the person I can call in the middle of the night if I need anything, she is the one to go and support me on my doctor's appointments, and she is the one driving to the middle of nowhere to help look for my dog that ran away.

Recently she had an incident in her family. I supported her and while we were talking she started crying and said that she was asking for my forgiveness because if she was ever copying me, it was because she was so jealous of my life, that she literally wanted to be me. None of that sounded healthy to me, at all.I don’t know what to do. I still feel angry about her trying to twin me, even though I see the root now. And even though I know she is a great friend, I can’t separate this from her personal life and the things she’d done. I can’t be friends with a person who is always creating drama and intrigue around them. It’s exhausting. But I can’t let myself dump her, because I know somewhere deeper she is that girl who I met in the hospital, and I know how genuine and nice she can be.

I dont care what anyone says but in my opinion, when a girl truly wants you its really not that hard to tell. There is a look that they give that just screams their intentions and this woman was giving me this look every time she left. I wasn’t really making any moves on her because I could kinda care less whether or not there is a girl in my life (or my bed), at least in the romantic/sexual sense, so I just kinda noted that there was that attraction and kept going about my business.

At this point I figured I might as well start flirting with her because, at the end of the day, she is a beautiful woman and sometimes you just gotta respect that and let them know.

**TW:** SA, stalking, &gt;!death!&lt; wishing.

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought I would need to write all of this. I never thought, in fact, that this would happen at all. I (25F) have at least 4 of the last 10 years of my life in therapy, just to be able to heal from the trauma that my ex-boyfriend (he with 18M at the time, me with 15) created in my head, from all the mess that he made of myself, from all the shit he submerged me in.  
When we met each other, both of us were young and stupid, besides the fact that I was incredibly depressed due to the death of my brother. I was, in fact, thinking about dying every day, just as my brother did at his own time. I tried to show myself stronger than I was, though, for the sake of watching my parents well and not to give them another burden, besides of the weight that grief can give.   
I suppose that made me more vulnerable in front of people like him. For the sake of the story, let’s call him Cal. Cal was everything I didn’t know I wanted in a man back then, if I ever was able to discern it at such a young age. I was naïve and romanticized the idea of the first and true love, and thought I found it in Cal. And he was perfect in the beginning, or that was what I thought.  
Would I been older and wiser, I would’ve known that wanting to fuck with someone just to “take off her first time and make it yours” (as he said) it isn’t true love. I would’ve known that finding out where I live with no more than vague indications it wasn’t care, but a danger. I would’ve known that insistence to “no” is isn’t persistence in the name of love, but sickness and disrespect for your partner.  
I should’ve been wiser and told him “No” in the very beginning but, as I said, I was young and incredibly stupid, disturbingly hurt.  
So, we started a relationship that lasted for what were the worst 9 months of my life. Like a monster, each other, we created and gave birth to my absolute worst nightmare. I’m not talking about a baby, but a way of living. A way of living based in the fear I felt for him. He never wanted to left me alone, he wouldn’t allow me to be alone. I had no right to privacy or friends that weren’t his friends or even male friends and companions in general.   
I thought he loved me and comprehended me, that he cared for me, and interpreted all of those horrendous clues of obsession as love. He went to my school, crossing all of the city, to take me home, just so I wouldn’t meet other people. He forced me then to answer all of his messages when I was at home immediately, so he knew I wouldn’t be talking with other guys. And if I just dared to refuse or ignore him, there would be at least 50 messages in my voice mail. Let alone the fucking single time I fell asleep while talking with him and still appeared connected in whatsapp. I has 350 fucking messages. 3 5 0.  
He never hit me, thought he didn’t need it. He already terrified me enough. He still bite my cheek once, strong enough that he left a bruise and I had to lie about it. He also broke my phone once, throwhing it again the wall because he -with the password he forced me to give- found out I had a male friend.  
Those were, I could swear, the worst fucking nine months of my life. Let alone the time he SA’d me in my own kitchen, or when he sympathized with my family enough to convince them not to forbid his entrance to my house once we broke up.  
I admit I should’ve spoken but, ¿have you ever felt actual panic for your life? Because he let incredibly clear that I wasn’t anyone’s but his. That he would do everything to have me back I dared to leave him. But I was wickly deteriorating. Something in my brain changed due to the repetitive psychological mistreatment, and my emotions just… shut down. So I left his ass.  
I wish that was the end, but no. He stalked me for over a year, if not more, once I dumped him. He appeared in my house and my parents, who didn’t know of his abuse history, let them in over and over even when I begged them not to. They just wouldn’t listen. Nobody did.  
So I changed schools, but he was still there, appearing in the entrance every time I got out of my classes. He was there, making friends with people from other classes, spreading lies and bullshit about me, telling things I never did just to ensure I would never have any kind of support from my peers.  
I could swear that I thought of dying every single day. Every day of that year-ish, I woke up with this heavy weight in my gut, telling me there was no escape. I was so naïve and lonely and terrified. Even now, when I’m 10 years older and kind of wiser, I get anxious and frightened every time I think about it.  
So, long short story, he then found another person to stalk, I guess. There was necessary more than 500 calls, 700 messages and 3 threatens of going to the police and get a restraining order just to take it back from me. I would’ve never done it due to panic for the consequences, but I needed to make him believe I could. I was so fucking terrified, I never was able to fully talk of what happened, let alone to tell my parents about his true colors. I handled almost every bit of pain in my back and carried on. And he disappeared from my life.  
But then, suddenly, in a particularly stressing moment of college, everything came back to me in a shocking wave. All the memories, from one day to another. Can you believe I’ve completely erase the SA from my brain? Like it didn’t exist, like I wasn’t hurt. But oh boy, I was.  
Then I crumbled and had to take therapy. I needed to, since the shock was so fucking strong I could barely talk. Years have passed since then, and I can’t still tell from my mouth that I was raped.  
Today, 10 years later from the worst time of my life, I get to finally know that he died, exactly one year and a month ago.  
I don’t know what to feel, how to feel. My hands are shaking, and my voice trembling and I want to cry and scream and hit the ground with one foot. I dreamed with him not being able to hurt anyone again so many times, because I’m so sure I wasn’t the only one. His manipulative and narcissistic ass could make wonders in you if you were flying low. I really hoped that he would die, I dreamed of me knowing and crying of happiness and spitting in his grave because he fucking ruined an immerse part of my existence.  
Even to feel nothing would feel better, but no. I’m incredibly angry, because he didn’t pay for nothing. One knife in the gut -the cause of his death, according to his dad- doesn’t make shit for all the pain and fear that he caused. I’m pissed of because he not even apologized, he wasn’t even able to recognize the stalking, the raping, anything. Because to him, anything was his fault.   
And worse of that, I’m so angry to myself because I can’t comprehend why I’m crying so loudly. I’m angry and sad and hurt and just hoping I would have never met him. He was the kind of people that go around just causing despair, just trying to fit in your life to suck up your energy and discard you. He was the kind of people who are just pure evil. And even though I fucking hate him to my core, I can’t help but to feel sorry for him, and I don’t know why.   
I hope he’s burning in hell, even though I don’t believe in such things. But, even with what, I would’ve hoped even more an apology from him before he passed away. I’m relieved that he won’t be able to hurt anyone, ever again. But then, I just would’ve loved to not being chosen to hurt in the first place.

"TW: Pregnancy loss need advice

What is your opinion on this pregnancy loss story?

How should I view this situation? 

Please. I genuinely need to talk to some people here. 

I love my partner very much. We have been together for years 

My long term partner found out she was pregnant

She was having seriously bad cramping for a few days and then some normal pregnancy spotting.

She went to an unplanned sexual health clinic at 7 weeks but was told the embryo was 6 weeks and had no heartbeat.. was offered induced medical miscarriage pills and she took them after only one scan. No follow up scans. 

I don't know how I should feel.

She told me she would never have done it if there was a heartbeat ( the ultrasound showed no heartbeat )

Part of me feels that we could have waited longer to take the pills just incase..and that we should have followed up as ive heard it CAN be too early to confirm at 6-7 weeks if they see a HB.

I am in shock.. 

She was in a lot of pain... How should I view this situation? 

I can't live with myself if I know we ended the pregnancy but she said she felt ok taking the pills cos there was no heartbeat found on the ultrasound at 6 weeks when she was 7 weeks since LMP

There was no heavy bleeding but there was a lot of pain ( stronger than period cramps ) 

She seems absolutely fine..but I'm in turmoil. That was my child too.

She says she was in pain and that there was no heartbeat at the ultrasound and she would not have carried on if she had found out it had a heartbeat.

Was she morally justified to take these pills given the information she was presented but this was at a private clinic not a doctor's office? There was no follow up.

Honestly I love this girl but this changed me. I'm anxious 24/7 now",TW: Pregnancy Loss,18mff13,1703027515.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mff13/tw_pregnancy_loss/,
"I became a dad at the end of December 2022 and it was and still is one of the best gifts. It's hard sometimes but the love I have for our daughter is something I had never felt before.

Becoming a father was amazing personally, but financially it's been tough. During maternity we were making a loss each month and since my wife returned to work we now end the month on 0 which is at least a bit better. Unfortunately, that means we never eat into the debt we racked up before. We are very careful with our outgoings and don't eat out except for our anniversary. We also cancelled subscriptions to streaming platforms. 

I'm employed as a videographer and have been able to work with legendary athletes which has been exciting. I'm pretty sure my friends think I earn a lot just going by who I work with sometimes but if you factor in unpayed overtime the wage is barely above minimum wage. And to clarify, I'm not a junior in my department, I get sent on the priority shoots and am valued by my manager. The payscale across the board is low because of the access we get to high-profile individuals. The big bosses know we need this access for our portfolios. 

My commute to the office is 2hrs each way, so I spend 4hrs travelling to and from work when I'm not abroad. Unfortunately, the job I have is one-of-a-kind in my region and gives me access to high-profile athletes which in turn helps my portfolio. However, when I became a dad, I realised I needed to take control of my time and earnings.

So, in January 2023 I began my mission to start my own production company. I worked every second I possibly could identifying potential clients, projects, etc., while also making sure to be present as a husband and father. This combination is probably the hardest thing I've ever done. 

I tried to limit my outgoings starting my own business but had to spend on some essentials which obviously added to our existing debt. I researched and then reached out to about 100 businesses and made sure to speak face to face when possible. Twice I reached verbal agreements with some big names but once I got home and sent them the next steps, they never replied and to this day I haven't heard from them, even though they said they wanted to work with me. I've reached out countless times, but nothing. 

In case you're interested in what I was offering, it was to create video advertising campaigns. As I said before, I'm not a junior. I'm experienced and am trusted with high profile campaigns for major international brands. I know what I can achieve for my clients.

I'm deliberately not mentioning any names of athletes or brands because if one of my colleagues randomly saw this, they'd know I'm trying to leave the company. If that got out I'd lose the big campaigns I work on. 

This year has been exhausting. I've experienced a lot of rejection and it hasn't put out the fire in me. I still want to create visually stunning AV campaigns. I also would love to create documentary films. 

I feel like I've got a lot of unused potential but need to be patient. I know I will succeed in the end but after a year of rejection I needed to write this down and get it off my chest. 

I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar.",Spent 2023 working like crazy and got nowhere.,18mfce3,1703027329.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mfce3/spent_2023_working_like_crazy_and_got_nowhere/,
"Hello. So I don’t really remember how long my partner and I have been together. It was a slow gradual thing, we went on one date and said “let’s keep going on these until we don’t want to anymore” and that’s what we’ve done. If I were to guess then maybe 7 months. However I’ve known him how 1 1/2 years. 

When I met him he didn’t actually talk, I was told he was “too simple to” and that “talking to him would just piss him off” so because of that I respected what I perceived to be his boundaries. We worked together so while I would see him everyday I’d only ever tell him hello if he looked really down and he’d nod back. Fast forward about eight months and we’re put together to work on something and I felt awkward not talking to him. He has a severe speech impediment but I never got the impression he didn’t want to talk. In fact he acted shocked when I asked him about himself. 

Background on him. He comes from a severe underprivileged family. His mom had his oldest brother at 14 and had eight other children with his father. They lived in a three bedroom house for a couple years but mostly traveled around looking for places to go. Him and his 5(the oldest was 30 when he was a child) shared a single room and would pick corners to claim. They pretty much ran wild and only got parented when his ill could manage don’t get me started on his father. Everything he’s ever own was meant to be shared. Everywhere he went was in a pack with them following behind. If he made a friend they would scare them off. The last time he talked to someone of the opposite sex was in middle school. 

However tragically his mother fell I’ll in highschool causing him to drop out and be her full time caretaker. His brothers dropped out promising to do the same but played video games a room away while he would hold her while she coughed. One day he overslept and she was gone, everything was gone. The house they finally got, his mama, all his stuff and his dad magically had a new girlfriend. Of course his dad wasn’t all bad, he offered to let the boys live with them, in a truck parked in her backyard while using the lawn as a bathroom and the hose as a shower. After awhile they got him and his brothers a little Christmas gift, one way plane tickets out of the state. And we’ll that’s how old boy ended up here. 

He got a job pretty quickly but never could get enough up to find a place, especially since only two out of the four boys agreed to work. If he refused them money they sell his belongings, threaten him physically, steal his card information and bank log in. Six years of this until the other working brother left the situation leaving him alone with them. Until we became friends.

Idk how to describe it but after our first conversation (small talk) I began to notice things about him. How he wouldn’t eat if other people were around, how he was clearly thinking but seemed stressed if prompted to talk. He took unpopulated routes around the building to avoid bumping into to people. But mostly importantly how fucking intelligent this guy was. He would find little tricks to make his work go faster and seemed to be able to fox ANYTHING by just taking it apart. To this day he makes fun of me about knowing I was watching him but I was just fascinated. The people who worked with him for years said he’s too stupid to hold a conversation but yet is clearly somewhat intelligent. 

That’s when I started conversations more. I wanted to know everything about this hidden gem of a human. At first it was about astronomy and nuclear physics but then he opened up to me. He never came out and said it but I asked him if he was homeless and he didn’t deny it. Que months of phone calls, months of financial abuse from his family. Months of betrayed trust, months of holding our breath but we finally got the call today. No more sleeping outside, no more fighting with his brothers and family for food. In fact we sent those jackasses packing when they stole his money in front of me and tried to play me like an idiot. It’s not in a great area but it’s a start to a long life. I want to cry this beautiful person who’s been through so much heartbreak can now finally have some peace at knowing where he’s going to sleep.",After spending his entire life in and out of homelessness my partner(25NB) is finally getting a place,18mf5xv,1703026849.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mf5xv/after_spending_his_entire_life_in_and_out_of/,

And I use Google Translate for half way, cause my English isn't good enough. It's the reason why my written seems so odd. Sorry for mistakes, guys.

He was in trouble at work, and he didn't have any money. She was working online. We talked with her for days on end, and the more I got to know her, the more I loved her. 

I didn't even like his presence in my apartment. I knew it was wrong, but I forbid him to enter the kitchen in my apartment. I don't know where and what he ate these days, but he only came home to sleep and wash. And he was grateful to me anyway for the roof over his head.

The first time we slept with her was in October. Then another and another. And in December, he came home and finally caught us. It was stupid, like in the movies. When I came out of the bedroom, he was sitting on the floor and crying like a little boy. I used to think I'd feel guilty if he found out. But I didn't feel anything.

"Hi, first time posting (and on mobile) so I apologize for any errors. I guess I’m just looking for a place to vent. I don’t want sympathy or advice. I just want to say what I’ve been holding onto before it bubbles over. I’ll try not to make my rant too long.

I (28f) am disabled. I’ve been disabled my whole life but didn’t know until my adult years. How, you may ask? Simple, I’m a woman and doctors have tendency to not take us seriously. There are some good doctors, and after many years I have built up a good team of them. But unfortunately, by the time I did get my team, it was too late to reverse any illnesses or damage to my body that I have. So here I am, unable to work, fighting for disability, training my new service dog as my other gets ready for retirement, on the brink of a breakdown.

Some context, I live with my brother. He finances everything for both of us and my parents help out financially when we need it. I do have an attorney now to help with disability so I have my fingers crossed that I can have my SSI within a year. But at the beginning of November our apartment gave us a notice of non-renewal. When I called them to ask about why they weren’t renewing a lease with us, they said “we just won’t be renewing the lease”. I started to look up the laws. In my state, the landlord nor the tenant have to give a reason for non renewal of the lease. We’ve been given until January 31st to be out or they will file for eviction. We don’t plan to get evicted. So I started to search for an apartment. Unfortunately there aren’t many options in winter. And the few options in our budget get taken pretty quickly. We’ve already spent over $300 in application fees and still don’t have a place. I’ve even had to report a few places to the fair housing act for denying us because I have a service dog.

Yesterday I went to view another apartment. I was excited for this one. The tenant who used to live there was also disabled. So there was already a detachable shower head, an handle to help get in and out of the shower, a raised oven and a couple other things. I thought that luck was finally on our side. I came home, talked about it with my brother and we quickly applied before he left for work. About two hours ago I got a message from the apartment manager asking me for papers for my service dog. That’s not unusual, I responded that I can send him a copy of a letter from my doctor. It’s just a simple letter stating that I am disabled and need a service dog. I know legally I don’t even have to give them that, but I find it makes it a little easier. He then called me and started to say he needed my dogs papers. I was confused and said that I had a letter from my doctor. We had a brief, and confusing, back and forth. He said that only ESA’s get letters from a doctor, that a service dog has registration papers and certifications from their trainer. I explained that there is no federal registry nor does our state have or require one (and to my knowledge only one state does have and require a registry). I also explained that service dogs do not have to go through a training program. I trained my first service dog and I am also training my second. He argued back, said I didn’t know what I was talking about, called me a liar, said I was abusing the system. Usually I am unbothered by this. But his tone held such disgust towards me and was very accusatory. After calling me a liar again, he quickly said they would not go through with leading to us and hung up. I was upset and more hurt than I’d like to admit. I’ve had other places turn us down because of my service dog before, but they were never so rude about it. I text him a link to the ADA’s sight about service dogs and the laws about them and protecting them. I added that I hoped he would learn the laws, thanked him for his time and wished them luck finding another tenant. He doubled down in his text, calling me a liar once again and just being rude. I chose to not interact anymore but I did file another complaint with fair housing.

When my brother gets home from work tonight, I’m going to talk to him about our backups. We’ve had backups in place within the week of initially getting the non-renewal letter. I don’t want to keep looking for a place to rent. I can’t keep arguing with people about my disabilities and my service dog. I’m too tired. People look at me and think I’m just a fat, lazy, entitled young person. They don’t see my illnesses and disabilities, how could they? They’re invisible disabilities. Our back up options were that I either moved back with our parents (they offered) until I get my SSI and then I move into a disabled community and my brother can live by himself. The other back up was I go back to our parents (temporarily) and he stays with our uncle (temporarily) until renter season is better and we can hopefully find a place. But now I want to bring up the option of me at our parents, him at our uncles and us saving everything we get for a down payment. I don’t want to keep looking for a place to rent. We can afford to buy a house. His credit is good and mine is average. It’s something we have talked about over the last two years. We just always pushed it off. But I don’t want to keep arguing with places just so I can have a roof over my head. It shouldn’t have to be this hard. And I’m just tired.

"Hi,

I thought it was a silly story to tell so here it goes.

When we were Kids my sister was really mean and one Christmas she told me Santa didn't exist. 

The thing is I kinda already knew I just never talked about it… but for some reason, I got super pissed and cried… I acted like she“shattered” my world(I always was an easy cryer I don't know why I cried seriously)… why? Principle? Because she wasn't supposed to tell me. Confirmation he wasn't real? Who knows? 

I never told her even when she rubbed it in my face later on by saying if I didn't told you Santa didn't exist you would probably still think he's real? You know stupid thing siblings say(teenage years)… For some reason, it just fired me up more to not say anything. 

We're grown adults now I wonder how she would react if I told her. I am trying to think of a way she would bring up the subject again to see if she remembers.

She coming to Christmas this year and it's been a long time since we didn't have Christmas with her back home so maybe that's why I am thinking of that.

BTW! I think I already knew because I noticed Santa was Grandpa… booming laugh and drinking beer… lol!!!

Thank you to whoever read this and for letting this silly thing out of my chest…",My Sister Still Think Shes The One Telling Me Santa Wasn’t Real...

"I (24f) graduated highschool in a fairly small town. Most leave town after graduation to go to college, including me. A few years ago I got a job in my small town, but still lived in a neighboring college town. My coworker (18f) goes to my old highschool and is currently a senior. A while back, she was telling me about this crazy older girl that was trying to date all of the Seniors and Juniors. Kids 16-18 years old. She was told that this girl was 19 or 20, which she still thought was weird, but when she told me the name, I realized that she graduated with me. Said perpetrator is (25f) and completely crazy. When we were in highschool, she was always posting on facebook about the boys that she liked at school and she was tagging them in the posts too. As far as I know, none of them ever returned her feelings, and that was seen as weird but she was also a kid and no one really thought much of it.  
  
Well come to find out, she did something to end up on the sex offender registry. No one really is clear on what she did, but she was there up until a couple years ago when she got taken off somehow (I don’t really know how all of that works, but I thought it was a notable detail.)  
  
She never left our hometown, and since almost everyone her own age left town, she started trying to date the younger boys. And as the younger boys get older and leave, she goes for even younger boys. Currently (as reported by my coworker) she is snapchatting with Sophomores as young as 15. Snapchat is where she does all of her business. She flirts and begs them for attention and does a lot of things that are definitely groomer behavior. The kids that she talks to all think it is hilarious to mess with a 25 yo woman and get childish reactions. She will post on her snapchat story crying and talking about how fake everyone is and how much she misses specific boys. She is not shy about it at all. She also offers to buy people food, clothes, and shoes if they will hang out with her. Which is not only sad and pathetic, but also classic groomer behavior! That's another reason that the kids let her flirt with them and everything; she buys them so much stuff. She always wants to pick them up and drive to a neighboring town to shop, or go get dinner with them, and she gets mad if they tell her no. She will snapchat girls their age if she is suspicious that they are all hanging out without her. She gets mad about who they ask to high school dances, or who asks them. A month or two ago she created a private snapchat story, added all of the boys to it, and posted nudes (or at least very very revealing pictures… I am a bit unclear on that part) in the story. It was screen recorded of course, but the kids think of it as a huge joke. They are kids.  
  
The police have been called on her soooooooooooo many times. Nothing ever happens. At this point the police are very familiar with her, and we don’t think that she is all there mentally… But this is a crime isn’t it???? Or at least the first steps to one! The problem is, we have no evidence of anything illegal taking place in person. But if this was a 25 year old man talking to a whole bunch of teenagers, it would be treated so differently. I have no idea what my place is here. I have zero evidence to give to the police. Not only that, but they have already been involved. I also don’t really know the extent of the law and if any of this is illegal or just immoral. Basically I don’t know what, if anything, there is for me to do about it. I have texted her but she has since blocked me. Anyways. That's all I guess (throw away account)

"Okay this is gonna be a weird post so buckle up.

My mom and I have a semi-strained relationship. She has always been deeply religious and a little conspiracy minded. She listened to a lot of Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura when I was a kid and went right down the 9/11 -&gt; QANON pipeline. 

Growing up she was quirky, but it was fine because she had a rich social life, hobbies, kids to raise, etc. But then COVID hit and I think she went a little off the deep end. She started spending a lot of time online listening to Youtube prophets with weird names like ""Liberty Turnipseed"" who predicted end times and claimed to be divine healers... her entire social life became (and is still) going to these religious revivals where people cast out demons and sell DVDs or whatever. 

This progressed into my mom claiming a healer cured her of her partial deafness. Allegedly, God told her to visit the boardwalk, and when she did, there was a man praying so she spoke to him and he healed her. She claims her doctor has confirmed she has regained 70% of her hearing back. I was, and am still, very skeptical about this. But overall we've (meaning my dad, brother, and grandma) all been happy for her. 

So at one of these revivals, one of these asshole grifters told my mom she is also a prophet and healer- he can just feel it. My mom obviously ran with this and has decided she is both. She's predicted a bunch of stuff relating to Trump, Biden, end times, wars, etc. and none of it has been true. She has claimed that God sends her messages by waking her up at night- the time on the clock is a message correlating to a Bible verse. She keeps having ""prophetic dreams"" and giving us cryptic judgement or concerns. We all humor her because we figure it's harmless, however, it's caused a sincere strain in our relationship with her. If, for example, I ask her for advice, she will only suggest I pray on it. If I recommend a new show to her, she will scoff at it because she only watches Christian programming (she was never like this before). 

So I've been experiencing severe knee pain for three years now. It comes and goes and seems to have flare ups.  My car also broke down and was totaled out. My grandparents helped me with a lease, but my parents are not aware. They still don't know I have a car (I have my reasons for this).  

About a month ago, my mom called me. We chatted and she told me she had the strangest dream. In her dream, I had a car, but I had had it for a while and just had kept it a secret. I was instantly weirded out by this because I have been incredibly careful to hide this from them. My dad used to be a detective so I instantly wondered if they had somehow looked up my registration or something? But she said in her dream I was driving a red truck. I am not. I brushed it off. 

But then something else happened. I visited my parents after my finals this semester. They picked me up and we had dinner and I mentioned my knee pain and how it had really been bothering me lately. My mom offered to pray over it to heal it. I agreed because I figured it's harmless and a kind gesture. So she did. 

Well it's been two weeks and I have not experienced ANY knee pain. Literally, within an hour of her praying over my knee, it stopped. Now, I don't want to be dramatic- the pain had been winding down a bit already.  The worst it has ever been was literally during my final. After, it hurt a bit, but not quite so much. Dinner was the following night. So I have considered that maybe the pain was already disappearing and it was just a particularly bad flare up due to a really stressful semester. It only really hurts if it's been bent for 45+ minutes, so I'm usually pretty careful to avoid situations where it would be painful. But I've tested it for my own sanity and it just isn't hurting. At all. She's also done this to a friend with cancer and his tumor did actually shrink. 

So now I'm clearly a little spooked. I'm tempted to lie to her about my knee so that she doesn't become more deluded. But now I'M starting to wonder if my mom is really is a fucking prophet and divine healer. Someone please set me straight. I never thought I'd want my knee pain back. Idk what to do.

"Today I got paid a very good amount of money (Approx. $100) after working for some time on a project for a friend of mine. I never really thought about getting money for it and as soon as I saw the money in my bank account I became very sad and felt inferior and anxious and I don't really know why, but I just feel like crying now. It almost feels like I've stolen them and have a bad conscience.

I often get calls from people, close friends and acquaintances who needs help with making, repairing, designing, planning almost anything since I'm sort of a jack of all trades you could say since I have an obsession with learning new stuff and skills, but I feel really uncomfortable charging any money for it and I'm so used to not getting any money for it that it just felt so wrong to finally get it.

I've only recently managed to force myself to ask for money only for the cost of materials (paint, phone screens etc.) but even the rare times people ask how much I want for the actual time spent I only say ""It's ok, you don't have to pay me"" or ""pay whatever you want, it's no big deal"" etc. Why do I feel this way about getting paid? I'm pretty broke and could really use the money, and I never half-ass anything but I still feel like I don't deserve to be paid for it.

"my boyfriend is currently suffering from what we believe is topical steroids withdrawal. its not eczema per se, it’s withdrawal symptoms from using a certain type of cream containing steroids, which is worse than the condition the cream was being used to treat. TSW can take years to heal from, my boyfriend has had it for about 7 months. it basically destroys your skin to the point that it can no longer produce moisture or natural oils, causing dry, flaky, burning, itchy red skin, sometimes with like pus and open wounds but my boyfriend doesn’t suffer from those.

i love my boyfriend. we’ve been together for about a year and a half, and i’ve loved him since the day i met him. he is the most beautiful person i’ve ever met, both inside and out, and i know he’s the only one for me. i’ve been trying so hard to help him for the past 7 months, but this condition works in stages and flare ups, and just seems to constantly be getting worse. he can’t go 5 minutes without incessant scratching, can’t go 10 minutes without putting on moisturiser and is in constant pain due to his dry skin. he hasn’t been showering often, and barely leaves the house. we can’t cuddle, can’t be intimate, i can’t even kiss him on the forehead anymore. anywhere he goes he leaves dead skin in his wake, to the point that i have to change my sheets every time he sleeps over. 

my boyfriend is a husk of the man i used to know. every time i see him i feel like crying, but i keep it together because he’s in more pain than i am at the end of the day. i can’t look at pictures of him from a few months ago without breaking down, because i thought this skin was bad then but it’s nothing to compared to now. the moisturiser he uses is greasy which is a major texture issue for me (autism), so all his clothes are greasy, everything he touches is greasy and it makes me feel disgusted. i want to make it clear that it’s not him i’m disgusted by, it’s the situation, but of course the brain links these two things together and it’s causing cracks in our relationship. 

i cannot deal with the constant scratching, the fact that i can’t touch him without it hurting, everything i do seems to hurt him and it feels like i don’t have a boyfriend anymore. when we’re together, it feels like i’m with a man who has my boyfriends face and voice, but acts nothing like him. when he’s not in as much pain, i catch glimpses of the man i used to know and it breaks my fucking heart. i constantly miss him even when he’s right next to me. it hurts me when i’m with him and it hurts me to be without him. i feel like i’m mourning someone who’s still alive. 

the other day he asked me if i’d ever thought about breaking up with him because of this because my frustration(?), it getting obvious now, and the truth is that i have, not because i don’t love him anymore, but because it physically breaks my heart to be next to him. i miss my boyfriend, i miss how he used to pick me up all the time, i miss going on dates, i miss how we used to play fight, i miss how we used to go outside and do things together, i miss how we used to cuddle, i miss how he used to laugh and smile and dance and i miss being intimate, i miss when he was able to just do things without it being such an effort, i miss him and his personality and the man he used to be. it kills me to see him in pain and i know i’m being selfish but i just don’t know how much longer i can pretend like everything’s okay, how many more times i can look away so he doesn’t see the tears falling. 

i wanted to suggest that we see each other less because i just can’t handle it but the worst part of this is that none of this is his fault. i can’t suggest this, i can’t break up with him because why should he be punished for having a condition? but our relationship is not the same as it was. things are so suddenly different, and as this condition can take years to heal from, the end is probably nowhere near in sight and i just don’t know how much more of this i can take. my boyfriend is my whole world, he’s my soul and the reason i get up every day. he changed my life for the better and i wanna do the same for him but it’s so hard seeing the man you love wither away in front of your eyes. he’s a shell of himself and i can’t keep pretending that nothings changed. 
the only thing i want is for him to get better so we can go back to normal but every time i see him he just seems worse. i don’t know what to do anymore.

"I just wanted to share how my year has been so far. Just to write it all down. 

Sometimes I feel like it's been a bad script from a TV show. I was pregnant in 2022/beginning of 2023 and I had the best pregnancy. We had all the scans and ultrasounds and everything was great and nothing out of the ordinary was ever found on the scans. I had hardly any negative pregnancy symptoms apart from being tired. My due date of 31st January came and went and no baby. We had ordered a birthing bath and the plan was to give birth at home. On the 31st, I had a last ultrasasound at my midwife's office and again nothing was wrong, the baby was in the correct position and it was just a waiting game. She made an appointment for me at the hospital for one weeks time because I was 37 and it was safer to induce if the baby hadn't come at 41 weeks. 

One week later and no sign of our baby wanting to arrive so we went to the hospital on the 7th of February for another ultrasound and maybe they'd give me something to induce labour. That's what we thought would happen. What actually happened could've happened in an episode of grey's anatomy (which I had binged throughout my pregnancy).

On the ultrasound they found something that shouldn't be there. But the doctor doing the ultrasound didn't often do ultrasounds so she did the classic 'I'm just going to ask my colleague to have a look and make sure what I'm looking at is what I'm looking at'.

What they were looking at was a 7cm by 7cm mass in my baby's left kidney. They strapped me up to a monitoring machine so they could measure my baby's heart rate. Her heart rate was too fast and they weren't yet sure what the mass was and they were worried it would be too much for her heart if she was born the natural way. So a few hours later I was gowned up and wheeled in to the OR with my wife at my side. It was to be a c section. 

My baby was removed (born?)and held up briefly to the plastic window seperating us and was then whisked away to the room full of doctors next door. My wife went with our baby. I was shaking so much from the cold/shock.

Turns out it was a kidney tumor. She had to stay in the NICU and I was wheeled in my bed to see her later. It was very surreal and nothing felt very real. It didn't feel like my baby was my baby. Nothing made sense.

The next day we found out that we would be traveling to a different hospital that specializes in pediatric cancer and tumors. Cancer. It didn't feel true. I had the most perfect pregnancy, all those scans and nothing ever found.

We traveled by ambulances to a different hospital in a different city. Actually I had to go to a maternity ward in a hospital that seemed stuck in the 1980s and my baby went alone to the specialist hospital next door. My wife stayed behind to gather clothes we would need and drop our two older kids off at a friend's house. 

Anyway this is very long, when our baby was ten days old she had the tumor and her left kidney removed. My wife went into the OR with her and was with her when they put her to sleep. I couldn't do it, I was so scared that it would be the last time I'd see her. But it wasn't. Waiting for that phone call from the surgeon was the worst. She lost a lot of blood during the surgery but she made it. The surgeons looked exhausted when we spoke to them.

 When they examined the tumor they also examined her dna and incidentally discovered she has a mutation in her dna (msh6) which means she has a higher chance of some types of cancer when she's older than 35. I did a DNA test and I have the same mutation. I already had my first colonoscopy and after I'm forty I'll have yearly uterus checks. My dad just found out he also has the same mutation.

Now things are going well, our baby is doing well and the only things she has is an impressive scar and her blood pressure is too high so she has enalapril. That can happen when you only have one kidney.

It still sometimes doesn't feel real to me, like we're all characters from a TV show or movie. And sometimes I get too much in my head and stop talking. But it was a very strange year.

Legally his owner is my partner’s ex gf, she got him a dog as a present during their relationship only because SHE wanted a dog and to leave him a few months later with said dog to tend to. 

During those few months she’d never really educated the dog, let him off leash during walks, enabling him to sleep on the couch and the bed. When she left, it was hard on my partner, he fell into depression, like curtains drawn all day, not going out, no visitors and living alone in their house with the dog which brought him comfort as a last memory of his lost relationship despite not being a dog person. It really screwed up more its education. 

It has bitten a few people. It all happened before I knew them, one who didn’t know how to handle a big dog therefore pushed its buttons, a friend of my partner who entered the apartment alone, a kid who ran towards the leashed dog (scaring it, now it only got out with a muzzle) the worst was a 5/6yo kid, they had been playing all day (more or less in the supervision of my partner and the kids dad) it only took a second for the kid to grab the dog’s ear and the dog to snap and bite the kids face. The kid’s alright now and neither parents filed a complaint.

Despite all that was mentioned above, my partner is really attached to the dog. I, too, grew fond of it and vice versa. During the pandemic, when I moved in with my partner the dog spend all my online classes with me, sitting next to me day after day so much he became one of my teachers mascot. We were living in an apartment at the time so I tried to rectify the leash problem by going out quite regularly and it worked a bit. It’s not allowed to sleep on the bed anymore but has its own bed next to us and mini couch downstairs. I try to play with it every day since I’m a stay at home mom now.

We quickly moved into a house with a backyard (better for the dog) and have a garage turned into a tattoo studio. My partner is working from home and  I worked for 3 years so nobody would be at home with the dog during most of the day. It would bark non stop even when we’re in the same room as the dog when my partner is welcoming customers. If it hears people speaking in front of the house it’s barking like crazy out of the blue, it would even growl/bark if it hears a car door slam.

I always tried to get it to stop all of that, by any means (being friendly, firm, explaining to it that it was nothing, rewarding it for not reacting…) my partner would looses it and lock it upstairs, much to my disappointment.

Now we welcomed our daughter she’s 4months old and still isn’t accustomed to the dog barking in the other side of the house or even its nails clicking on the ground. It’s waking her up every time. She’s a Velcro baby therefore it’s a big win when I manage to put her in her cot but her sleep is still very light. I’m the only one caring for her during the day, I’m tired all the time and with the dog being this clingy to my partner it’s driving me crazy. I can’t stand hearing it whine for him while he’s working or smoking outside (when it’s inside it wants to be outside and vice versa). 

Since the pregnancy the dog is not listening to me anymore, it wants nothing to do with me, only listen to my partner and wants to be with him. When I get to be alone in the mornings I drink my coffee and smoke outside, i let the dog out for it to get its needs met outside but it only wants to be with my partner so would whine again and again not moving around or elsewhere or it will just lay in my path and not move.

I now fear for my daughter when she’ll be able to crawl and walk even if I will teach her to be gentle with the dog I don’t want the dog to snap at her. For now the dog is mostly indifferent to her like it was with the kittens. Now the cats love the dog, sleeps with it plays and annoy it sometimes it has never bit them.

I’m still attached to the dog but now it’s bringing me more problems than before. I’m basically just waiting for it to die and I’m not going to be sad or anything. I’m upset for thinking that and I feel like a heartless monster.",The dog is ruining my life,18mckry,1703020088.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mckry/the_dog_is_ruining_my_life/,

I'm currently 26 with nobody in my life that would give a shit whether I breathe or not. Working a dead end job.
Everyone either left or has died. 

I used to have a goal and that was to support my family and friends. Now that goal ultimately being taken away am not sure what to do. Sure, some things I can say were not my fault. I can't bring back people back to life. But I also am so socially inept that at some point people just leave. 

At this point I feel nothing but a loser. I didn't develop basic skills and experience anything as a teenager. And at this point it feels like that boat has sailed. In fact, multiple boats. Social skill boat, romantic department boat, forming friendship boat. 

I just don't want to feel so sad. I cry sometimes. At night. A 26 year old grown man crying out of loneliness. How fucking pathetic. I don't know what to do, where to start. I just don't want to feel as sad anymore. I would much rather not feel shit at this point. Just nothing. Serves me right.

We are on vacation abroad with my wife’s(f38, m39) family. We have 3 children (6, 5 and 3), day before yesterday we took a walk to the hotel back from the restaurant after dinner. My wife, her mum and sister were walking about 15-20 yards ahead of me, father in law, brother in law and the kids. It happened very fast. A guy was walking across the street and he started running towards my wife&amp;co brandishing a knife, found out later it was a knife, I just saw his hand raised at first. My mother in law and sister in law were walking near the road closer to the running man. I heard a yell and I saw my wife pulling her sister and mother behind her. Father in law and I started running and yelling and brother in law stayed with the children. Another man closer to my wife also started yelling. I think the attacker got scared or something and he changed direction and fled but he was barely feets away from my wife and had already started slashing twice at least. It all happened within seconds.

Nobody got hurt but everyone was shaken. When  I reached my wife and she almost fainted in my arms. It took a while to calm everyone down.

Now two days later everyone seems fine even though there is still something looming. My wife is cheerful, I however haven’t been feeling well or able to look at my wife. I feel a mixture of fear and anger. She has been asking me if I was alright all day and trying to kiss me. Now she asked again and I exploded crying and yelling that she was reckless and stupid. That neither her mum or sister had three small children and that she was selfish not thinking about me and them if something happened to her. She started crying and said that she didn’t think and it all happened so fast and I said exactly you didn’t think.

Now she is heartbroken.

"I know the title is boring, but I'm not sure what else I could add to it to make it more interesting. 

So some context, in early September, I(19F) met this guy(20M) through bumble and we really hit it off. I thought we had a great connection and good chemistry, and it didn't take long before we made it official and exclusive. 

When we got into the relationship, I prepared it by telling him that I was going through a lot of health issues at the time. I had just gotten an MRI done due to suspected pinched nerves, but turned out I had over twenty lesions on both femur's and my pelvis. Because we didn't know quite what it was, but I could've been something very bad, I told him that I might have a form of bone cancer, though I wasn't sure and that was just what my step mom speculated. 

He said he would stay with me even if that was what it was, and I was happy with him from that moment onward. Time skip a few weeks, I had an appointment with major hospital in my area that confirmed the lesions to be caused by something called Ollier's Disease. This disease causes cartilage to form inside the bone, rather than bone marrow, which weakens the bone and can cause pain. While it isn't cancerous, if left untreated and regulated it can become malignant. I had a surgery scheduled for the 15th of November to clean the cartilage from the bone and replace it with a titanium rod. 

During the time between the diagnosis and the surgery, I had a falling out with my father and his family and moved back in with my mother (The situation was caused by the fact I was dating this guy, had I broken up with him it probably wouldn't have happened). In the end this was a good thing, as my father has been notoriously manipulative and abusive since I was young, but I moved in with him thinking he had changed (he had not, I admit it was a stupid half baked decision at the time, and regret it now). 

So, leading up to the surgery, I was basically living with my boyfriend. Everytime I would mention I needed to go home, he would get upset and basically beg me to stay, even if I had classes or appointments the next day. He almost made me miss seeing my brother off for deployment, and had I not worked it out with my mom I would have. 

Anyways, I stayed with him consistently up until the day before the surgery (Nov 14th), I told him I needed to go home since the surgery was the next day, and I would be staying with my mom for recovery since she knew everything that was going on and she had a one story house while his was two story. I wouldn't be able to climb the stairs. He insisted I stay anyways, saying he could take care of me and what not. I told him I couldn't, and he seemed irritated with me up until I left. I asked him if he would come visit me when I was out of surgery, as I had numerous times prior to this (I counted at least 8 times I asked him before the surgery, and he would always come up with some kind of excuse as to why he might not be able to, but said he would try). He gave the same excuse as previous times, that he wouldn't have the car (which he shares with his mother) to come and visit. Even outside the fact that I would be getting out of surgery at around 7pm and his mom gets home at 4:30pm, the hospital is about 5 miles from his house.

Anyways, I went home and night and everything went smoothly. The next day I get to the hospital, and before they took my phone to lock it up with the rest of my things, I texted him asking if he would come see me, he said he would try to. 

When I came out of surgery, everything had gone smoothly, and I was just loopy and in a lot of pain, which some major anxiety since I didn't know where I was. The hospital staff went to get my mother to help calm me down so I could answer a few questions. Once that was finished they took me to recovery, at which point I asked my mom if my boyfriend had shown up. She said no, and that she texted him to tell him I was out of surgery, but that he didn't respond. 

When I was fully coherent, I texted him and asked if he was coming to visit, at this point feeling a bit annoyed I had to ask so many times over and over just to get half assed excuses. He told me that visiting hours were almost over and he wouldn't have time, so I asked him if he could come the next day, and once again it was the issue with the car. I brushed it off and just focused on recovering so I could go home. 

The next day I was discharged at around 3pm, and slept for the most part for about two days after. 

Over the next few days, if I talked to him, I didn't ask about him coming to see me, since I knew he would make an excuse. 

Yet somehow, about 4 days after my surgery, he had the audacity to ask ME, to take the 40 MINUTE DRIVE to see HIM. His excuse? Back pain. I had my leg sliced open, a foot long metal rod and two pins placed inside my bone and was barely out of the hospital yet he asked me to drive over to see him cause of back pain. 

I was a bit baffled, but rose tinted glasses had me agreeing, and I did in fact go see him. Despite the fact that I was in excruciating pain when I lifted my leg, I still went. 

The moment I got there, I regretted it. 

His whole room smelled like cigarettes. I knew he had smoked them in the past, but had told me he stopped and instead was vaping (which if you're gonna do one or the other I preferred vaping). I asked him about it and he ADMITTED to smoking a cigarette. Obviously I was upset, and about ten minutes later he claimed it to be a joke. 

After that day I started to pick up on things. Major codependency, being secretive, heavily drinking. My breaking point was when the day after Thanksgiving, when me, my mom, and step dad were having a smaller, personal dinner together, I asked him to come over to eat with us. He agreed the night before, but then day of said ""I think I'm just gonna stop by for a few to say hi and see you, then come back home."" Which quickly turned into ""Never mind, I won't have enough time before you go to your grandpa's, so I'll just stay home."" 

We weren't leaving for my grandparents until 4 or 5.

It was noon. 

I gave up at that point and let him do whatever. Over the next few weeks, I stopped making an effort to go see him, since I wasn't getting the same in return. 

I recently broke up with him, and he tried to claim I was being shitty because ""Ever since your surgery you've been acting different"" even though the ""difference"" was I was recovering from a major surgery and needed his support, but he wasn't giving it. 

Now I'm wondering if I was being shitty or not, though everyone in my personal life says I wasn't and he was using me. (Over our relationship, I spent upwards of $1,000 on him in gifts, food, vapes, and alcohol, because im a people pleaser and he knew how to exploit that. He never spent a dime on me)

After a semester at college, I had failed everything as well with no motivation to go.

I decided to move 5 hours back home so I could save some money instead of paying rent + other expenses every month.

"I feel awful. For context, we have an 8 year age gap. I'm 16, she's 8. I spent my childhood being physically and emotionally abused. I have anger issues due to this trauma, but I'm fairly decent at keeping it cool. I always harm myself, never people I care about. At least, never my friends. My parents stopped physically abusing me when my sister was born. Well, a few years after. MY dad pulled my hair a few months ago, but that's about it. My sister never gets hit. She's spoiled. It makes me angry. She's an iPad kid who has no manners. Regardless, I never wanted to be the type of person to hit a kid. I don't believe that makes a kid better. It traumatizes them. I know this. I was taking care of her today, letting her play on her iPad with reasonable breaks. However, when she got back on, she started getting heated at some game. I told her if she continued acting the way she was I'd take it away. She kept yelling at the game, so I took it away. She put up a big fight. I eventually got it. I didn't hit her during any of this, I just wanted her to cool off. She kept yelling at me, begging me to give it back after I repeatedly said no. I even called our dad, and he just told me to make her take a nap. After the call, she kept yelling. I regret what I did. I had enough and slapped her and hit her head, hoping she'd stop. She didn't. She just started sobbing louder. Obviously. As I'm writing this she's still sobbing and screaming. I don't know what to do. I'm an awful sibling, I know. I just needed to tell someone, ANYONE. I didn't want to open up to any of my friends, because I know I'm in the wrong. They're gonna lose all respect for me. I just didn't know what to do. I never meant to continue the cycle of abuse.

"So I was with my ex bf for a little over a year. My parents are very Christian, both are baptised and view sex before marriage as bad. Well I’ve done the deed a few times with my ex, he’s the only one I’ve ever been with and it took a lot of guts for me to leave him. He was becoming more controlling as time went on and all the times we’ve done the deed, he’s manipulated me into saying yes despite knowing that I easily say yes out of fear because of my dad mentally abusing me when I was growing up. I know now that he was using me because eventually I would’ve been looking after him (he’s disabled according to the law) and working a full time job, all while trying to maintain the house, cook and clean and be a submissive wife in his eyes. He would try to push his opinions on me, I’ve witnessed his temper, his selfishness and he literally puts his best friend first. His best friend (and the friend’s girlfriend) did something really nasty on Facebook, started slandering my name despite knowing I’m a good person and my ex bf told me he told his bff to F off and i stupidly believed him. Until a month later when I found out they were still chatting and hanging out, that’s what broke my heart. Then a few months later I got covid and realised he didn’t care about me because he ignored me for 2 weeks and I remembered all the times I was unwell when I was staying with him and he never looked after me. Yet I looked after him while he was unwell. Wasn’t happy with him, so I told my parents everything but the dirty deed, as I’m scared to see their reaction. I know it’s considered the R word because it wasn’t really consensual if your manipulated into it. I don’t want their opinions of me to change, if you were to ask they’d say I’m innocent minded. So I’ve got to figure out how to tell my mum because there’s no way I’m telling my dad. I just want her to understand that it’s my dad’s fault that i got stuck in that stupid relationship, if it wasn’t for him mentally abusing me from a young age up until I was a young adult then I wouldn’t be so vulnerable and so easily manipulated.

"Just for context. I’m 32 now. Amab individual.

This is a long story so get ready.

When I was a kid maybe 5 or 6 years old my mom worked really long hours. I was mostly a latchkey kid growing up, but during this time my sister was taking care of me and watching me.

We got along really well aside from the typical sibling rivalry stuff. My memory is pretty fuzzy about this situation but one night my sister wanted to talk to me about something while my mom was at work. She told me she wanted to tell me something that was a secret. She taught me how babies are made and told me the truth. She said when two people really love eachother they have sex. Then she told me she wanted to try it with me because she thinks it’s really fun.

I won’t go into further details but it happened to me.

I think it happened multiple times before it stopped. She told me some really gross stuff about her fantasies and told me some other things too. I thought this person loved me so I trusted her. Turns out I was groomed.

She told me not to tell anyone and that mom would get really angry if she found out. I kept that secret.

Her friend also molested me too. It happened twice. Once in a room of people (who didn’t do anything for some reason) and once when we were alone.

I didn’t understand that what happened to me was not ok, I was lead to believe it was normal and I what was happening was a good thing. I feel disgusted typing this.

I grew up in a very run down apartment complex and was very poor. Imagine the movie Gummo, that’s how I lived. I always had dirty shitty clothes cause my mom didn’t care or couldn’t afford to get me nice clothes. She never paid attention to me. I was alone a lot because my sister would “forget” to pick me up from school. I started walking home by myself since I was 8 years old. 

When I say this place was fucked. I saw a lot of crazy shit. I used to hangout with these two brothers and one of them tried to molest his sister inside of his house. The neighbors were drug addicts and I used to hangout with their kids, both younger than me. The daughter would always get excited to see me and one day she tried jumping on top of me over and over again. The brother said she was trying to have sex with me. One time I was hanging out with the neighbor kid and an older girl who lived at a house over the fence hopped over it. She pushed me down and started humping me very aggressively (clothes on) and I couldn’t breathe.

They were all probably abused too.

Dad was never around cause he’s a dead beat. Hit my mom so we had to leave. I don’t know him to this day and he never calls.

I tried to tell my mom at age 14 what happened to me and she took me to the police. I wasn’t ready to talk yet so I said nothing.

I cut my mom off at age 24 cause she wouldn’t believe me anymore. She still kept this abusive person in her life even though she’s a gaslighter and manipulator. I confronted her through text when my mom was in the hospital and told her what she did to me, that she took my innocence. She told me I was crazy and needed help, that I’m a liar, and that she can’t imagine anyone making up such a gross lie. I told her if she ever talks to me again I’m going to call the cops and get her kids taken away. She got her kids taken away because she’s a meth addict.

I was an alcoholic for most of my 20’s. Drank to escape. I didn’t know myself and was so lost in depression and trauma. I also think I have autism and ADHD (I never look people in the eyes when I speak to them, I don’t drive a car cause I’m scared, and have tons of sensory issues/triggers).

I quit drinking for about 4 years and have gone to therapy for a few months during this time. I learned that I repress my emotions because of the guilt and shame of what happened to me. I’m worried that I’m bothering people and that people won’t love me if I talk about my trauma. Turns out it’s because I didn’t love myself.

I thought about reporting my sister even to this day. She’s an awful person that deserves accountability. But I have a niece who’s 19, autistic and schizophrenic. She was also hurt by someone she was living with. I don’t know why this is has to happen. It hurts me to know that. I don’t want to tell her the truth.

I talk to my mom now but our relationship feels distant. I don’t have any family.

I’ve had relationships that were healthy during this time and most of them know about what has happened to me. I can talk about it sometimes.

I went through a breakup 2 weeks ago where I still really love this person. I just couldn’t be with them anymore because we were having problems. They were harmed too and it kills me inside.

Makes me really sad that someone I love so much has had this happen to them. Or anyone really. It takes away your innocence, it makes you feel hollow. It makes you feel alone.

Right now I’m thinking about drinking again. I’m really depressed and I hate the winter time. I feel really alone and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared I’m going backwards in all of the progress I’ve made in my life. I have a lot of family trauma, fear of abandonment, fear of not knowing a lot of my family (on my dads side) because my dad walked out on me, and I just don’t know what to do.

I've been homeless, abused by manipulative exes, ignored by my family to focus on her, lost my entire life to my husband who cheated on me, and I've wanted to be closer to my family, but all I hear when I visit is complaints and negativity. I offered to teach her to play piano, and guess what - she's traumatized over music because a band teacher told her she has to play the notes on the sheet music.

She's too traumatized to look things up online because her teachers were mean and didn't teach her anything and learning new things triggers her.

Her knee is ""messed up"" and she's going to physical therapy, but walked in the mall (very briskly - I had issue keeping up) for an hour getting things she wants with no issue. 

She asked for specific things the other month and when our mother drove around town to get those specific things, my sister said she didn't actually need or want them and it was a test to see if she'd do it. Makes me furious... 

She's a parody of anyone who has had to deal with real issues and it makes me so frustrated. It's because I have trauma that I have to do things for myself. No one was there for me at my worst, and she takes support for granted. I remind her that our parents can tell her to move out any day and it doesn't phase her.

Our parents are always calling me asking me if I know what they can do or what anyone can do, and my mom keeps telling me she can't hear that she was an awful mother much more.

Were they perfect parents? No, of course not. But we ate together as a family, never went hungry, had doctors and dentists and transportation, money to support our passions and interests if we discussed them, Christmas as a family, no swearing or yelling or throwing things or hurting us...

They died exactly six months apart. The only 'original' family members left are myself and my father (71). I also have my daughter, and my sister-in-law, and my niece. The young girls are doing okay for the most part; they are young enough that they aren't fully aware of what is happening. But I can see the exhaustion and depression in my father's eyes, and in my sister-in-law's. Its the same look that must be in mine. 

I know there is nothing to do but just keep going. Thats all we can do, because nothing will bring my brother or my mother back.

But each day, I just want to give up. I just want to stop, and lay down, and do nothing. If I didn't have my daughter, I absolutely would. I can't handle seeing the people I love in this much pain, and I can't handle feeling it. It feels like it will never get better. My whole body feels worn down to the dregs. My head is empty.

But my kiddo needs a mom who makes her childhood fun, and special. So I keep going. Fuck, I don't want to. But she deserves it. ",I feel like I am about to break.,18mbdwh,1703017086.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18mbdwh/i_feel_like_i_am_about_to_break/,
"I was woken up at 2am by my “sick husband” who couldn’t stop groping me. I didn’t want to be touched but I didn’t want him to feel to rejected to avoid a fight. For 2 hours I lay there pretending to be asleep as he moans with intensity and asked if I would wake him up to a back rub and even asked me to give him a hand job (because I said I didn’t want to get sick so I didn’t want sex)

I feel disgusted by my husband and upset that even though he is “sick” he didn’t go to bed until 1:30am. Colten woke up at 4 and its hard to tell a child that I have to leave for work but daddy cant wake up because he went to bed so late he wont get a healthy amount of sleep. I had to go to work by giving my 4 year old a phone and a bowl of cereal.

What made it worse as that I lay there for them 2 hours being touched when I didn’t want to be touched gave me flashbacks of my uncle attempting to rape me. It brought the uncomfortable feeling of recalling the exact feelings I felt as the event unfolded and the memory of it still makes me sick. Everyone I have told about it knows that I blamed myself because I told him that he was my favorite uncle but I have never told anyone the extent of why I placed blame on me.

I recall that when I visited my dad I had a bedroom upstairs and shared it with my sister who is only 11 months younger than me. However instead of sleeping upstairs I choose to sleep on the couch. I remember when bob walked into the house, drunk, reeking of bear and slurring his words. He woke me up as he laid on the couch I was on, but his head near my feet so his feet was near my head. I can’t remember everything we were talking about until he started asking me why I hated him. I lied and said “no you are my favorite uncle” why? Because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings but I did hate him. I remember as a child I would hide underneath the sink from him and spit at his face. Why I hid I don’t remember. But I always got a bad vibe from him. I always assumed it was because he smelled like hogs and he never showered. Maybe there was more but I don’t recall due to my young age. This memory was of me being around 6 years old.

I remember that night Bob he came in drunk, asked me if I can turn around and I said I was to comfortable to move. I said this as a lie because I remember feeling uneasy. I remember having a bad vibe. I feel like I even have a memory of him groping my legs, hugging them with his legs wrapped around them, but not sure if that is made up in my head after my dad has told me he did that once to him. It might have happened or it might be an added imagination when recalling to the traumatic moment. At some point I remember he turned around and was to close to me for comfort and I don’t know how it happened but next thing you know he was attempting to make out with me. Like full on licking my face. I remember pulling away and sitting up and holding his shoulders and repeating “bob I am only 14” but for some stupid, stupid reason that is not when I left. And this is the part that I have never told anyone because it makes me sick at the memory. I remained on that couch and attempted to go back to sleep… but he still had other things on his mind. It wasn’t until the second time he attempted to make out with me, with his body on top of mine and him trapping me under, pressing on me and licking my face again, is when I rolled away to escape. I remember running upstairs and promising him I will never tell anyone. I don’t know if he heard me or cared. He never attempted to follow me or call me back. I blamed myself for having a feeling it was going to happen, for it happening, and…. Only I know… for staying after it happened and allowed it to continue. Why… for some stupid reason I was thinking I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Even though I was scared and terrified, I was worried about how he would think. I remember attempting to wake my sister up first and she was too loud. I didn’t want Bob to hear me specially when I knew I just promised him I wont tell anyone. So I woke my cousin Andy and then me and him together woke up Stephanie. We made a pact that we where not going to tell anyone and I was super scared and couldn’t stop shaking. However the next morning bob was going to take my sister, Stephanie and I home on a hour and a half drive. Stephanie ended up speaking up and said the truth on what happened for she was terrified. My mom didn’t know anything happened until 5 years later but that is a different story.

Last night as I laid with my husband I was to scared to move, to scared to speak. I didn’t want to be groped or have sex but I thought if I made to much movement that he would force himself on me. He has never ever attempted to rape me and this is not a legit fear I should have had. But he has been overly horny and been expressing his desire. His sexual moaning towards me for moving my foot freaked me out.

to make matters worse I have been complaining in marriage counseling how late he sleeps, how he keeps getting up late, and he lied and said he was only late dropping our son off at school twice but I recently found out it has been 5 times because the school sent me an email. last night even though he was sick he didnt fall asleep until 2am. this morning he woke up, dropped off both the kids at a babysitter that gets paid by day, went home and went back to sleep. Just Sunday he was pancaking about how important his job is and how he can't miss work... yet even with no fever, no vomiting... just feeling off after going to bed at 2am.. it now justifies why he can skip work and even pay 50$ for a self sufficient 8 year old to go to a babysitter so he doesn't even have to interact and just go back to sleep.

"We noticed a weird 1-2x a day cough from our dog last week and noticed on Saturday that his lymph nodes were swollen, like the size of a marble. We went to go see a movie and came back and he was extremely lethargic and started crossing his feet to move, so we took him to an emergency vet. $1.5k later and we got a diagnosis that it's large cell lymphoma but they didn't have the equipment to discern if it was type B or type T.

Monday we hit the phones frantically calling and no oncologist in a 50 mile radius had any availability until Jan 2nd. I know that's not a long wait but for something like this I'd much prefer to act as quickly as possible, especially with the impending holiday coming around. On top of that, it was very frustrating talking to front desk clerks. One lady was particularly rude and said ""I can't make appointments appear magically out of thin air."" Like I know we were pushing to get our dog seen but the snark wasn't appreciated. Luckily there was a cancellation and we're taking him in tomorrow.

My wife and I have taken turns crying and holding each other. This boy is just so sweet and such a light on our life. He's the kindest, most patient, and the most considerate dog I've ever had (I mean if we say while playing he stops to check on us, he takes food gently from us, he'll cuddle us unprompted if we're sad or sick, etc). Reading stories about large cell lymphoma on here and various websites is a sad journey. I was looking for a sliver of hope, but most stories end up sad where they had to put their dogs down in a matter of weeks or a few months after treatment.

Regrets flood my mind: regrets of not walking him more, not taking him to more parks, not playing with him as much because I was ""tired"", no impromptu car rides, etc. I just regret so much that I didn't do with him. Equally my mind is flooded with thoughts of him not being home when I get back from work, his bark to let us know about literally any car that comes in our cul-de-sac, him booping and giving us kisses when he's bored, him playing tug and cuddling with his brother dachshund (who is in the process of going blind due to a genetic disposition), his cuddling style where if you try to cuddle him he'll get up but if you're patient he'll lay his head on your leg as you sleep.... I'm going to miss these things very much.

He's literally so healthy in every other way. We thought we'd have him into his teens, but it looks like that might not be the case now. I know he was loved and had a wonderful home with loving parents. I knew it wouldn't last forever but holy fuck I wasn't expecting things to end so abruptly. We wanted him to be around for our first child, to help our next puppy learn the roost of the home, etc. He's such an integral part of our life that we are not ready to say goodbye yet, not so abruptly.

My wife and I have no doubt we'll do chemo treatment. Luckily we have insurance to help with reimbursement for treatment. Every day I can squeeze out with my boy without him being in pain or suffering. He deserves the best and so we're going to try and give him that. He's a Heinz 57 dog and it's hard to discern what he actually is. We ordered a DNA + Health test (which too late for the health test but it was on sale so w/e) to get his heritage.

I'm pessimistically optimistic about remission and longevity. I'm hopeful that we can give him more time with us but I'm also equally pessimistic with reading anecdotal evidence from others who have already experienced this.

Just to show how cute he is, here's a pic of him: https://i.imgur.com/yNPSm0Y.jpeg

Fuck cancer and fuck whatever caused this. I love my boy with every fiber of my being and I'm feeling deep mixtures of anger and sadness (and a lot of disbelief).

edit: I'm also not saying that I'll force him through pain for the sake of our sadness. If worst comes to worst or he wouldn't have a lot of time regardless of treatment then we'll of course do the humane thing and make his time as comfortable as possible and then put him to sleep when its his time. But I'm trying all my options until we can get to that point.

"I'm at a loss. The man I was dating and I was falling for left me for the second time a week ago and I spiraled into panic attacks and not being able to perform well at work.

This job is at a top tech company and I had a 1 year contract that would have turned into permanent in February. Because since mid November I have been a mess, because the first time he left me I started to get severy anxiety, I was informed today the company won't renew my contract. 

A lot of things have happened in my personal life, my grandma died, I got out of a 5 year relationship at the beginning of the year and I just pushed everything aside. When I met the man that left me I thought unconsciously he was my safety net, invested so much effort in the relationship only to be dropped at the minor inconvenience, because I requested a little bit more of commitment.

I am just so lost, I don't know what to do, where to go, I live alone in a city as an expat, it can get incredibly lonely and dark. I have never been so low in my life. I worked SO hard for that job, 6 interviews in one of the tech top companies in the world. I lost it because a man rejected me. I'm such a moron. I lost my great salary and I'm so afraid about my apartment that I bought last year. I'm actively looking for jobs now.

I'm in therapy now and with medication. Please tell me everything will get better. I feel unlovable, a failure and everything in between. I can't shake this hopelessness and sadness for two weeks now.

"I(28M) have been insecure about my penis since I was a teenager. I developed a porn addiction at a young age, around 10 years old. So when I fully grew and my penis wasn’t as nearly as big as I had seen online, it made me feel inadequate. I later on found out that I was about .5” less than average, at 5”. 
Later in life, I found my now wife(26F). Everything was great and our relationship was amazing, except for our sex life. She had been with 3 guys before me, all above average. They were able to make her ‘finish’ with just their penis, however I could not.
I have always been into working out, so I wondered if there was a way to use any exercises or stretches to grow my penis. I did some digging and found some stretches and exercises that would do just that. After 3 years of training and researching, I have grown 2.6” in length and 1.4” in girth. I’m finally happy with my size and my sex life with my wife is now amazing. She finishes every time, sometimes multiple times and my confidence is at an all time high.

"This is a throwaway that I have used for a mental health advice post. I don’t want my main associated with this story as I have some identifiers on there. 

Ok so this is going to be rather long, I’ll put a TLDR down the bottom. I’m currently working through a plan with my therapist but I feel like I need to get this out because it’s been eating me up. 

For context: I (25F) have always been close with my dad, we were best friends and would always do fun things when I was growing up. My parents split when I was 6 and I resented my mum for it, she was vocal about her dislike for my dad and I didn’t like that. 

Onto now, I’ve just had my first baby. I’m back at work (supportive but hectic environment) and a culmination of everything landed me with extreme anxiety. I was overwhelmed and started to analyse my life. 

I started to reflect on my own goals as a parent, my own childhood and what I could do differently… which is where everything went wrong. I started to realise that whilst my mum was vocal, she was vocal because my dad was turning me against her, she was seeing it and trying to stop it but he’d call her manipulative. 

Throughout the years, I was taught the value of my intelligence (from both parents). I was encouraged to learn and would always be studying something with my dad, I was so proud to ‘take after him intellectually’. I began putting my mum down, TO HER FACE. Not calling her stupid, but implying that her intelligence was somehow inherited from her time with my father…. Something I believed somehow? There’s a lot more but these are some of the things that are really killing me about it. 

After having a baby, I started to really see my mum. Something went wrong with my dad and I went completely NC with him just after having my baby. My mum was there, just there. Whenever I needed it, she was there. 

I won’t explain everything she did but she saved me from homelessness during that time and crusaded for a rental on my behalf, I don’t know where we’d be right now without her. 

I’ve recently apologised and started to talk to her about the things I’m realising but it’s *jarring*. I hate that my reaction to her is immediate disdain when she feels vilified (fucking rightfully so). I don’t know how to resolve this internal battle I have, I’ve based large portions of my life on assumptions that I’d established with my dad’s guidance and now I don’t know what I can trust.

"I realized it when I drew a picture of my first memory, where I had just had a nightmare about ants in my bed and jumped out crying for her. She came upstairs fiery angry screaming at me to get my ass back in bed and to stfu then left.

So anyway, recently I drew a picture of little me and a black fiery figure of her. And then it clicked.

For a long time I had a recurring demon with black bony frame and red eyes when I woke up paralyzed. It took a long time for it to get to me, months if not years even. 

At first it was somewhere in the far corner of the room, then got closer and closer. I was so scared of it, even though I knew it was a hallucination. But it was so ominous and insidious.

From across the room, to under my bed, to seeing its claws on my bed reaching for me. Then it grabbed my foot, and that's when my cat came to my rescue and got me out of it!

But the next time I woke up paralyzed the demon was crouching on my bed, on my feet just grinning and that was the pinnacle of dread for me. 

Then it lunged at me, and the whole bed shook and I felt like I was spinning and getting clawed and it was a long and confusing whirlwind... 

But it was the last time I ever saw that demon again, because I felt that it couldn't get any worse than that. I've had sleep paralysis since, but with different ghouls.

But I recently drew that picture and realized that that GD demon was my mom, and all of those ""attacks"" happened in my childhood room and it all makes sense. She's a narcissist from a bad life herself.

"So my ex was a weird dude, and one of the things I NEVER understood was that whenever I went to the bathroom during nighttime hours, if I was more than a few minutes he'd come looking for me.

And I mean, he'd literally get out of bed at 2AM and come looking for me.   To ""see if I was ok"".   I was... always ok.  I was... pooping?   But worse than that was that he wouldn't actually announce that he was looking for me, he'd come hover outside the bathroom door and like, nervously tap EXTREMELY SOFTLY on the door.  So softly I would usually just freeze in confusion - what was that tiny sound?   Is... is somebody at the door?

I'd call out ""hello?""  and he'd finally make himself properly known, and say something like ""are you ok"" or ""what's going on""

I'M TAKING A SHIT, BRO.   That's what's happening this time and EVERY OTHER TIME YOU HAVE DONE THIS WTF

I'd beg him to at *least* knock loudly.  Like ok you're ""worried about me"" wierd but whatever so can you at least knock loud enough that I'm not confused and freaked out by a faint floor creak and a barely audible scratching sound?   ""but I don't want to bother you"" he'd say.

"Hello beautiful people! 
I want to vent and need help! 
I’m at female who’s 23 years old. I dated my man for three years then my dad who’s an alcoholic split my family last year. My mother who was tired of my dad moved to texas with my sisters (to her family) and left my dad here with me. My dad told me you either go with me or get married to him. I had no other choice but to marry my current man. We got civilly married and then my dad got the help and went to reconcile with my mom to texas. I loved my man so I said fuck it I’m at age and I really love him. I wasn’t ready to marry but hey it is what it is. A year after me and my man been good, simple adult stuff paying bills and working. Then… I found him cheating with his ex and two other females. I found them on his phone. For what I know he just texted them no in person stuff. I found all that and went off on him because I left so many things for him, for him just to cheat on me like WHAT. He begged me to forgive him that his ex was just trying to get back with him but he was saying no and the second girl was just a friend and the third was an only fans girl. I was so close to leave him and I was so pissed. I am a female who bakes and cooks. I clean for him and everything. But I saw that he really did feel guilty and I felt bad. I forgave him but told him, one more time and I’m out. Time goes by us working and stuff whatever. I’m baking a cake and at the time my man worked at night so he was sleeping. I got a piece and took it to the room so he could try my cake. As soon as he got up and started eating, I got this feeling in my stomach. I asked for his phone and acted like I had to recover an email. But in reality it was too check. I checked and yes I found something. I found he had the only fans girl and this blonde friend of his. I BLEW TF UP!!!! I got up and started packing my stuff. He mentioned that he was wrong that he shouldn’t have the only fans contact and would yell that the friend was nothing else. They would just talk. I told his whole family and they got on him bad because I do so much for them like cook and stuff for him to just cheat on me again! I didn’t know if to cry or feel horrible for me. I was just in shock. I didn’t speak to him for at least a month. His parents spoke with me and told me that they didn’t want to lose me but if I wanted to go with my parents it was ok. It got to a point where the guy wouldn’t eat and was super out. I felt bad and forgave him, made him delete Snapchat and he promised me that nothing like that would ever happen again! 
Well, a month after that a fellow ex of mine followed me and we been talking as friends. He changed a lot since and suggested to buy me food and send me money whenever I needed. I liked that because no one has ever done that to me. He knows about my man who cheated and hates him for that. I told him I’m in a relationship so I can’t be too lovey with him. My ex always mentions that he’s gonna wait for me. Well six months after that, we see each other without my man knowing. I drive to his house and he made me dinner(NOTHING HAPPENED). It was just a friendly thing. I told him no several occasions. Lately I’ve been getting very fond of him sexually and he mentioned to me the other day that he wants to make love with me. He sent me a nude and all I gotta say is that HES BIG. I want to but I feel guilty. It’s just going to be sex nothing else. But idk. But then again my man did cheat two times.

"TA account (:

My partner works in a fine dining restaurant. Has been working there 5+ years. I have 9-5 remote job that is extremely flexible. I have benefits. I have PTO. They have been working in this industry since the beginning of working life and I believe it will continue their whole working life. 

I’m not used to this kind of work so sometimes I don’t understand why it can only be a request off and why it  is hard to take vacations. Their pay is fine, but it does cause stress because if they are sick or take an unexpected day off it could potentially make or break the week for them. I am more so looking for advice on how to be supportive to and for them when times get tough at the job. It’s the holidays so you all probably know that it is shitty for industry folks. And this week, we were trying to plan holiday things and an attempt to take off a couple days didn’t work out and it really disappointed me because I think I’m starting to get worn down by us having to put things on hold sometimes for the job.

"I tried, I really did. I really, *really* did. I can't change my body or the fact I'll never be able to satisfy a woman with a 4.5 inch dick. She deserves bigger and better.

I've always struggled with depression about it but that's sort of waned in the past few years, I more or less stopped thinking about it but recently with some convos with my sister's friend I can't move past it anymore.

I dislike the fact that society has conditioned women of all ages to lie about their preferred size, which seems to larger than average, so their men don't feel bad about it. Men shouldn't feel bad about it, but women should be allowed to talk openly.

My sister's friend (21) told me she wasn't gonna lie, and that she doesn't know a women that likes or prefers smaller than 6 or so inches, the size I told her I was previously. She talked more about it than I had really asked, but she told me some things that hurt to hear.

I went on reddit and tried to find varied opinions but none of them seemed honest and filled with guys, so I went to a few women-centric places to see what they were saying and it was eye-opening.

They were honest. Like actually, brutally honest and I liked that. Some of it was meaner, but I think they were more fed up with shit men than anything, doesn't mean they were liars.

Hundreds of upvotes from honest women. I didn't care about the more shamey posts, I just cared about the facts: sex, including penis size, is very important to women and they're sick of lying about it to appease men.

From what I could gather the sub was more focused on women fed up with men being trash and treating them bad, so that was in my mind too.

It didn't change much, they still said they'd pass up a ""perfect"" guy if he wasn't large enough, so to me I feel like I shouldn't really try. They also revealed that women who claim to hate big dicks just haven't had a lover that was skilled enough with one, or they'd change their tune.

I learned about the spots I'd never be able to reach, and how oral and fingers really aren't the same. They threw around terms like ""low-value"" and ""high-value"" men, and the highest value was a guy with a big one that could *also* do the other stuff. That sealed it for me.

I cried a bit for a few days, but then it sort of went away when I realized there's a way out other than sleep, and I'm taking it before January. I'm in Canada but doubt I could get assisted, but I guess I could try in private. I more or less plan on making it look like an accident if I'm able to.

"I grew up in a sheltered, religious upbringing and never dated a girl. Always engrossed in my coursework, I was never into dating. I was taking summer courses recently and had random roommates. After class one day, I came home and walked into the house. I grabbed a drink of water and headed upstairs to go shower. As I was walking up the stairs, I started hearing slapping noises and panting. I hurried up the stairs and stood outside a random guy's bedroom. The door was cracked. I slowly opened the door. There was a naked guy standing at the foot of the bed turned away from me and thrusting his hips forward. My body froze and I just stared. He adjusted his position, still facing away from me and I saw a completely naked girl in front of him. She was at the end of the bed facing away from him on her elbows and knees. He kept thrusting into her by grabbing her hips from behind. They were covered in sweat and with each thrust, there was a wet slapping sound every time his hips collided with her ass. Her cheeks would bounce, her boobs would jiggle, and she would let out a soft moan. I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. Something kept me in place. My face started to flush and I could feel my penis get hard in my jeans. I've heard about sex before but only through classes and other friends. I never thought much into it, but seeing it in person like this... it felt carnal and raw. He kept pumping into her for a little while longer. Occasionally, he would lean over and squeeze her boobs or smack her ass. The way he just took control over her was so delightful to me in a way I could not explain. Her flesh bouncing with each thrust, her triceps and quads flexing with each thrust, and her breasts jiggling suggested that she thoroughly enjoyed it. The frequency and depth of his pumps increased. She started to moan louder and he started to grunt. Eventually, he pushed her onto her stomach and climbed on top of her. At this point, all I could see of her was her butt and legs. He inserted his dick inside her vagina, rested on his elbows, and started to pump again. He would stop occassionally, turn her head and kiss her in a very passionate and sloppy way. He eventually shifted to resting on his hands and really started to thrust into her. The bed started to bounce with each thrust and the couple would come up off the bed at times. With one big thrust, he planted himself firmly inside her, let out a grunt, and his entire body shook. They were both breathing heavily and he just laid there, firmly inside her. After a few seconds, he started to rise. I quickly closed the door (but not completely shut), and quietly walked down to my room. I sat on my bed completely shaken up by what I say. I took my pants off and stared at my penis. My underwear was wet, the tip of my penis was wet, and I was sweating and red. All I could think of was how primal it all was. The wet slapping sounds. Her muscles flexing. Her boobs jiggling. Her ass bouncing. The sweat. The way he grabbed her body as if he wanted her. The way they acted like the only thing in the world that mattered was the next pump. I was shook! I'm embarassed about going to my friends about this, but is this normal? Is this normally how sex is? Was she really enjoying being dominated? I'm embarassed for staring like a creep, but I just could not look away. I've never experienced anything like it.

"My mom has always been an angry person. She will complain about anything, scream and start a confrontation.

Today I went to the mall and got some cakes for the whole family.(mother, father, brother and me). She got angry because she hates the cakes (without even trying them and there are 4 different types of cakes) and I ruined the holiday for her. She thinks I did it on purpose to make her feel bad.

And this is what she does every time. A few months ago she complained her TV is small and she can't read the subtitles well so I got a new TV for her. It was not crazy expensive, but it was a new smart TV from Samsung and I paid 25% of my salary for it. She made me return the TV because she hates it.

I am doing well in everything except for finding a partner. 

I was in a relationship for 6 months back in 2022 but that ended due to the fact that her mum was very pushy on getting us to get married. Sadly she ticked everything for me and the best woman I've dated.

1) Divorced women who are not over their ex or still traumatised because of abuse. 
2) Women matching with me and then do not reply on apps. 
3) Picky women thinking that a better man will come. 
4) Women stating that it's the best date they've been on then ghost me. 
5) Women wanting revenge because I rejected them. 
6) Women willing to cheat on their partner. 

When I find someone I like or want to get to know more then they just ghost or leave.

"I've been a mostly obedient, quiet child all my life. Perhaps people-pleaser may be accurate in some situations. I tend to avoid conflict or hold grudges because it's too much energy for me, which I'd rather spend on my hobbies or improving my life. I'd say my life isn't as  ""loud"" like other people surrounding me, but I've grown to be content with it. At least, that's what I thought.

Whenever I listen to friends' stories, they're usually trauma-dumps or emotional moments. Abusive/neglectful parents, unjust treatment from strangers, mental health issues, etc. I'm always open to listen, perhaps give advice if they ask for it, and generally just say, ""Anytime!"" when they thank me for being there. 

What frustrates me is that there are things I can't touch. Family issues are for family. You can't really just call the authorities or counsellors to deal with the problem due to fucked up, complicated web of relationships. As much as I want to whisk away those I cherish who are hurting, I'm just a broke college student. When I see them crying, I feel helpless at what I should do. I've searched up enough to know, like maybe hug them or offer reassuring words, but it still feels a bit awkward to me. I usually offer silent companionship. I'm honestly surprised that I have a wish to nurture, deep down. I'm not too familiar with empathy, afterall.

What IS power? It's the ability to have others move as you wish, or for you to do anything you want. It's in the air, never static, and compounds. 

I've promised to myself that I WILL gain that power to do what I want. The path isn't and will not be easy. There are times I must be someone who I'm not. But while they laugh over their problems to cope, I suppress my anger and helplessness to smile along with them, to reassure them.

Right now, I don't know if I feel guilt or pain because I can't directly make their lives better. I know I shouldn't, and just let them find their own paths. I also have my own family to care for, and resolve my own issues. So for now, I guess lending an ear is all I MUST do, no matter how much I want to punch bastards in the face.

"Throwaway since my wife knows my Reddit account. I'm happily married, and while I won't say everything's perfect (because I don't think that's ever the case), I love my wife, and we have a good relationship.  
Last night, I had a dream where I met a women named Mara. In the dream, she had somehow gotten integrated into my group of friends during her trip to the US where I live. She apparently lives in Holland. In the dream, I was out with Mara and my friends at a big arena. We were either there to see a concert or a sporting event, but I guess it doesn't matter. My wife was there at times and not at others (dreams are weird). Anyway, I remember Mara stealing glances over at me. We didn't even talk much at first, but we'd make eye contact and eventually it led to us spending time together away from the others. I remember my feelings for her growing quickly, and she soon expressed she felt the same way. We would steal kisses and hold each others' hands when our friends weren't looking. It felt like having a relationship in high school or something when everything is so new and exciting.  
Eventually, we snuck off and got more passionate somewhere away from other people within the venue. We were about to have sex when we got caught by some security guard and taken to a back area where they started reprimanding us, and we begged to be able to stay and see the show. I remember not actually caring about the show, but I begged because I didn't want them to separate me from her. I knew she'd only be there a few more days, and I wanted to spend every second with her. They took pity on us, and we were reunited. We held each other through the entire show, and our whole group went ice skating outdoors the next day. It was a beautiful day out with snow falling lightly, and we held hands the whole time. While we were skating, we talked about how we could keep seeing each other living in different countries. We even discussed my moving out there or her looking for jobs where I live. It was crazy since we'd only known each other a couple days.  
One of the things that struck me so hard was the depth of love I felt for Mara. I love my wife, but how I felt in the dream is like nothing I've ever felt before. I woke up, and the feelings of love I had for Mara persisted. I felt it in my soul, and it gradually was replaced by sadness that she's not real and that I don't get to go to Amsterdam and be with her.  
I have no clue what to make of all of this. Realistically, I'm not going to blow up my whole life because of some dream. I still love my wife, but I've felt weird all day. I'm questioning if the love I have for my life is ""real"" or if I'm supposed to feel about her the way I felt about Mara in the dream. I almost wonder if I'm settling, not as compared to Mara specifically but as compared to feeling the kind of love I felt for Mara. I was so disappointed when I woke up. It all felt amazingly real, and I miss Mara as insane as it sounds. I've felt off all day and haven't really been able to focus on my work.

"Hello Reddit,

You probably get a lot of posts like this everyday, and I can't guarantee this one is going to be any different, but I feel as if I've thrown away years of my life being undisciplined with school and work. On the surface, if I told someone my academic profile, they would tell me I might have impostor syndrome, but I know how little work I put into accomplishing the things I have in my life. In elementary school, I was tagged as one of the smarter kids in my school - I spent most of my time in class doodling unless the subject on the board interested me(and it actually did a lot), then I would usually raise my hand and participate. I never took notes, never wrote down upcoming important events, never kept a planner, usually did my homework in 10 minutes. My teachers said I lived in chaos(but I was perfectly fine). I don't feel as if I'm good at everything(actually I think I'm bad at the majority of things), especially being focused and organized - but I do have some strengths. If I enjoy something, I can consume just about everything on it, and retain that information for years. Some examples are with basketball, which I got interested in maybe around 3rd grade - I spent years just memorizing players statlines from random years, career-highs, awards, everything. In high school, I became interested in US History, so I practically memorized all of that too(not just on an APUSH level, I ended up competing in US History Bees and qualified for the international history competitions). I have a lightning quick recall, and used to play Quiz Bowl for my high school team and college team. My memory has always been my strong suit, and if I understand something, I usually can remember it forever. Despite having these strengths, I wasn't a particularly good student in high school - I was in all AP classes, and went to a pretty notably competitive school, but only could maintain a 3.7 unweighted(which I know sounds snobby, but always felt like it was drastically below my potential). Even when it came to studying for the SAT - I just couldn't muster up the effort to sit down and do a practice test until the day before the exam - I did a total of maybe 3 TOTAL hours of prep for the ""most important exam"" in high school and just went in and took it(and got a 1560, which is a great score, I admit, but I feel like the point of the SAT is actually to test how well you can practice studying, not the actual content).

However, I think I started abusing my memory early on in my life.  I can't muster up any energy to study, or do things that aren't mentally engaging. On the outside my profile seems great to some people, but I'm starting to realize the flaws in it. Coming to college, I've been doing two majors and a minor(all of them in the STEM space) and I do have a lot of work, but I still feel too lazy to grind. I think what I'm realizing is that I can't just coast on my memory anymore. I have a high gpa in college, somewhere in the 3.9+ range, and I've accomplished the things that I wanted to, but I'm realizing I'm just not the person I need to be if I want to live up to my potential. I still spend maybe a max of 2 hours studying for an exam(that's if I don't go to the lectures), if I do go to the lectures, I'll spend maybe an hour. I only started realizing this stuff lately - how damaging it is to my life. I know I can coast by, maybe find an okay job, but unless I start being disciplined and dedicated I'll never accomplish the things that I could've. I started dating this girl recently who is extremely studious, and she gets good grades(better than me in high school and maybe around the same in college, with equal difficulties in majors probably). I know it shouldn't make me feel bad, but it's the first time I've been with someone who really just dedicates everything to accomplishing the things they want, and I admire it but it scares me. It makes me feel kinda inferior, she might just be smarter than me and more dedicated, and I don't know if I can live up to what she wants. I tried for a month to be disciplined with studying the way she is - she studies four-five hours a day reviewing her subjects(at least based on what she tells me). But I couldn't keep on with that. I want to find a way to be disciplined and keep my mind engaged before this cycle of laziness consumes me. The way I see it, when I was a kid, my laziness didn't hurt me, as I've grown older my bad habits have started to chip away at certain things(my GPA, accomplishments). I realize now that DISCIPLINE is the main purpose of life, not intelligence. When I tell my friends this stuff, they kinda scoff at me - on the outside, I present as a sharp individual but I don't think someone intelligent would've wasted their potential the way I did. Any tips?

My older brother is a recovering addict and has been sober for about 6+ years that I know of. I have never known what drug(s). He was with his now wife through it all. My parents always supported him and even enabled him throughtout, while taking care of me and my younger brother. 

I do not have a close relationship with my older brother. We do not casually text or call. I vaguely remember him driving me to appointments or dance classes before I was old enough to drive, but thats about it. 

He picked a fight recently with my parents that resulted in him telling my parents they (my brother and SIL) need no contact. My parents were blindsided. They have seen my niece about 4 times since she has been born in Feb 2023 they live 25 min away. My brother and SIL have been cold ever since she was born and says we have been too “pushy”. If my parents were to ask about the baby they would respond with one word answers.

"Parents(60) continously buy allergy inducing products and places them all over the house. I've had countless occasions where I've had to be taken to the hospital because I could not breathe. They would always tell me it's because I drank a milkshake or ate cheese. Since I moved out, and because I'm a pig, I continued to drink milkshakes and eat cheese, but I could live just fine. 

However when I go visit home at my parents request, my respiratory system just seems to fail. I told them it's the flowers, pillows, blankets etc that is triggering this. My mom would say ""ok she'll keep it in mind"" but the next time I come around it's the same story. Today I had an episode where I could hardly breathe, left the house to get some form of relief and when I got back I asked them why they had not replaced any of the allergy inducing stuff, they acted surprised, as if they've never encountered this situation before. My dad was about to make a joke, to which I said If he made a joke about it, I'm gonna lose my shit. He made the joke. So I lost my shit. Then after I lost my shit they told me I need to watch my behavior because I'm being disrespectful to them.

Now, no one cares about the fact that I'm borderline suffocating and need medication. All the matters is that I'm a disrespectful child that needs to watch their tongue. Even if I try and get back to the topic, there's no use, because all my mom talks about is that I'm bringing ""negative energy"" to her holiday and damaging her mental health. 

Earlier this year I had a fallout with my mom which was building up over many years due to her inability to deal with any conflict situation or criticism. Invalidating the feelings of anyone else, and accusing anyone who tells her how her behavior makes them feel of attacking her character. I temporarily cut her off and went no contact. This was one of the most peaceful times of my life. I feel I need to do this permanently. I plan on doing that in the new year when I go back to my own apartment on the other side of the country.

Update: went to the doc today. I have allergy induced asthma. Got an injection and an asthma medication/pump. I should be able to last till I can bounce.

"I was born and raised male a little over fifty years ago. I knew that I was different from other guys as early as my teens and not interested in the same gender specific things. I believe I am also bisexual but never acted on it. AS a result, I had kind of a identity crisis back then because it was a much less tolerant time. I basically just repressed it all and tried to pretend I was confused because I was a teenager.

I've been married for over 20 yrs with a kid in middle school and nobody in my world would suspect this of me. I'm also getting older and it's hard to pretend and keep playing this role of what a typical guy is supposed to act and look like and I have less and less interest in trying to keep being that person for the sake of others. At some point it will likely reach a head or a point of no return. I don't know what the solution is there, probably therapy to determine the right course and navigate the potential fallout... which I anticipate would be huge.

So on to the point of my post...

I travel a bit for business and got the idea that if I am in a town where nobody knows me. I can experiment a little and take baby steps! I was at an outdoor mall and just wandered into some women's clothing stores. I wasn't trying to pass myself off as a woman and doubt I could do it successfully as I am 6'5, middle aged guy with a semi-fit, dad bod.

Anyway, I picked out some rather subtle things that I liked, nothing crazy or too expensive because I wasn't going to keep them when I got home. Also got some makeup although I have no idea what I am doing or what to buy so I kept that subtle too.

Walking around this way was exciting and empowering at first and then I noticed I was getting attention but not really in a good way. People would look and then look away. Elderly people and teenagers were the worst! Elderly folks would just blatantly stare agape, like I walked into Sunday church services naked. I had a group of teens, guys and girls, start snickering, pull out their cell phones and one of the girls did a looong obnoxious eye roll.

I started getting nervous around groups of young men and homeless people as I had a few of them shout things aggressively a few times and sometimes follow me for a bit while doing so! I was used to waking around and being invisible and anonymous, now my head was on a swivel. Places where there are groups of drunk men, like walking around outdoors near sports bars when there is is a big game is not fun either!

The most accepting people to me honestly are college aged women. They have really been the only ones who simply react like I am fine as I look, that I belong. They don't do double takes or look away after catching themselves staring a bit too long and they certainly don't harass me!

It really gives me empathy for women that I never had before, because this was never my experience. Just walking around with all of this unwanted attention and feeling unsafe and constantly needing to be on guard just so that you can dress and present yourself in a way that you want to! Also, the more feminine I look, the more vulnerable I feel and less willing to be confrontational to defend myself!

If I am home and looking like I normally look, I no longer have any fear because nobody sees me as a potential victim or someone they think it would be a good idea to harass. It's amazing that I don't even have to THINK about it, it is just an automatic switch based on how people are reacting to me. 

After experiencing both, I am sad that women can't really have the option of changing into a guy for a few hours convincingly and being able to just walk around and have everyone give them space and basic fucking respect.

"I (21F) found out that Ferrero Rocher caused my parents to lie to me for over 15 years. 
I’ve been suffering with constant allergies for the past few weeks, which took me to take a test to find out what was causing it. I found out my parents LIED TO ME FOR OVER 15 YEARS by saying I was allergic to nuts. That happened because mum loves Ferrero Rocher and these are expensive on the country I live. The lie got out of hand and i ended up avoiding all kinds of nuts during my whole life. I have been deprived of hundreds of recipes because my parents didn’t want to share this fucking chocolate with me. Is it even good? I feel betrayed and manipulated and feel like I’ll forever resent Ferrero Rocher. Should I just try is at an exposition therapy or sm? I’m absolutely sure it won’t kill me this time.

EDIT: GOOD EVENING LOVELY PEOPLE OF REDDIT. I am overwhelmed by the empathy over my delicate nut situation, so I’ll answer some questions that were brought up :) 
1.  WHAT ARE MY ALLERGIES? 
• I took a sensibility test that evaluates 221 different types of food allergies. I had an expression of IgE (actual allergy) for a few, including: prawns, cucumbers, chickpeas and curry. Once I got the results, I rang my mum questioning about the nut allergy: which led to the immediate confession of the said crime. I wouldn’t even remember the Ferrero Rocher if she didn’t mention it! 
2. DO YOU HATE FERRERO ROCHER?
• I don’t actually resent Ferrero Rocher hahahah only for being good enough to driving my parents to lie for so long! I am sorry, I understand it sounded weird. 
3. My parents are not monsters, I just grew up poor &lt;3 I understand that my mum had only a few things to enjoy during those days! She apologized a million times and I forgave her! This became a funny story for us to share :)

"Hey there! I'm not exactly sure how to properly type this down, but I just wanted a place to just say something to someone just to get it off my chest.

I don't want to sound like in whining or whatever, but as the title says, I'm just kind of... tired. I've been looking for any kind of job that I could do from home for almost the whole year, and I've found nothing. I don't have much experience, so of course I'm going for entry level jobs. Yet, I either heard nothing back, or it was a rejection email. All that combined with being behind on paying bills and helping pay rent, it just started to wear my down. I've gone through my resume quite a few times, constantly adjusting it to show that I am capable of doing the job.

Though, the reason I'm making this is because my landlord is sueing my mom because she is 2 months behind on rent. That alone broke me, but it's also the fact that today is her birthday. I didn't want her to have to deal with anything, but before I could even get her some kind of breakfast meal or something, those papers were there. I don't know, I just feel awful because a big part of me feels it's my fault she's even I'm this position. Like I'm not trying hard enough and even my best isn't enough.

"This is such a distant and traumatic event that my mind created blanks about what had happened that day as a defense mechanism, but overall is a core memory for me. My mother had never beaten me until this point nor did she ever after.  
  
I was a boy of single-digit age, barely 9 years old when this happened. It was summer vacation and all our bunch was at our grandparent's house, as was tradition. This season was extra special as my youngest aunt was pregnant.  
  
I knew no sin, I was just watching TV seated in our super-tiny TV hall. I was seated on the chair diagonally opposite to the corner of the room where our Box TV was set up. There was a doorway without a door just behind me to the left.  
  
Fate would have it my big-bellied Pregnant aunt had to walk through that doorway into the TV hall. I was unaware of this, I let out a very deep yawn and stretched my arms with great strength, and hit my Pregnant Aunt on her stomach with my forearm.  
  
I do not know what exactly happened next, my mom entered the picture when she must've heard my aunt scream, my aunt was maybe speechless but was sobbing uncontrollably. I might or might not have confessed that I had hit her, so maybe she figured it out, all of this happened so fast.  
My aunt was crying uncontrollably, my mom had become so furious she lept at me and beat me so badly, that she couldn't stand the sight of her poor sister in shambles.  
  
My poor dear aunt she loved me so much, she said it was no fault of mine and that she had sneaked up behind me and I was oblivious to this all this while she cried ugly. I was crying so bad too, I was so guilt-stricken that I had hurt my aunt and was also pleading my mom to stop beating me I knew nothing. My mother felt so accountable for what I had done to my aunt, she was crying furiously as she slapped my face up and beat me.

I’m glad i will be gone it’s total freedom and libration from my reality that is hell. I would rather have my family hold on to hope im still out there than face that I’m truly gone. I’m gonna do everything I can to cover my tracks. Everyone I have talked to about the meadow I told them a false location and then they go to looking they will be 50-60 miles in the wrong direction.

I (22F) recently graduated from a STEM field in May and am now in medical school. I moved back home to live with my parents. My older brother (25) just graduated college as well, but in August. 

I DESPISE him. I can’t stand him. He took 5 years to finish school.  My parents have always treated him like he is Jesus, meanwhile myself and my other sibling are tossed aside. 

I hate to say it but I hate that I never got to have my graduation to myself because of him. I hate that I never got a graduation party because my parents “didn’t want to hurt his feelings” because I’m graduating earlier than him. 

When he moved back home in August, he had to follow some simple rules- move his stuff out to a storage unit, don’t drink on weekdays, and no partying. He has done none of that. They have been asking him to move his stuff out of the garage so I can park my car in there… but he hasn’t done it. They have been asking since August and now my car is getting damaged from the cold.  He claims he’s going to join the marines, and take the officers exam in January, but he hasn’t been studying at all, has not worked out, and parties on most nights that he is off. 

I hate that he can get away with everything. It literally doesn’t matter what he does. He didn’t even want to come home in August, screamed at my parents inside a restaurant about how he doesn’t want to follow their rules to come back home… and they still let him come home, because “he doesn’t have anywhere else” 

Honestly I am looking to go NC with him when he leaves, and when I eventually move out. I am so tired of being so angry at him for (I guess) just being himself and not hustling. I’m tired of him being the golden child. Whenever he walks into a room, my parents only focus on him. 
He’s done a lot more, and caused my parents and I to be in therapy for years because he got arrested, but they don’t care.

"The girl I am currently dating used to get around, and I know this because she has been very transparent with me about it. Most girls I feel like keep that part of their history as secretive as possible, but almost from the beginning she was telling me these things as if we had known each other for years. I think it was her way of testing me and how committed I was going to be. Now, I am not here to shame anyones life choices or decisions, but she's definitely one of those girls who lived by the motto of, ""tomorrow may never come, so I am going to enjoy today."" Another version of that is ""Jesus died for our sins, so why aren't you sinning."" She used to work in the catering industry and the number of men I keep finding out about is gut wrenching. Not to mention because of her attitude on life, she has gotten pregnant twice by two separate men, both of which she decided not to keep the baby. I feel like a fool sometimes for being with her, and yes, while the sex is out this world, she makes me feel everyday like I am the best thing that has ever happened to her. Our relationship in many ways is perfect, but it's those details of her past that make me anxious and worried that her partying days are not truly over. I am going to be entering the next decade of my life in a few short months and am worried that I am investing too much into this girl, even though when I try to remove myself mentally from her, I just can't see a life without her, and I know (I hope) she feels the same way.

"I have this uncle who was struggling financially; he was in a really bad place; he had no job, a ton of debt, and was just an inch away from being homeless.   
Then, my parents, blessed with their kind hearts, decided to shelter this uncle in my business building, which happened to have a spare room, without my consent.   
This Uncle lived in my building for free for almost 3 YEARS without paying a single dime, not even chipping in to pay utility. Well, I never expected him to pay since he had no money to begin with anyway. 

I already made peace with the situation....Until Yesterday. :)

My mom told me that my aunt told her when she visited my town she would rather pay to sleep at a hotel than live for free in my building. I asked why, and my mom explained that my UNGRATEFUL UNCLE told my aunt that when he lived in my building, he kept finding maggots falling from the ceiling, and no matter how much he tried to clean it, the maggots kept coming.  
No, this Uncle never informed me anything; he did not even thank me when he left.

I was pissed because first, he told the story to my aunt, who was incapable of keeping any secret to herself; I don't know how many people she had told the story to already; I live in a country that strongly believes superstitions, building that labeled as cursed never good for business!  
Second, I already checked the room thoroughly, and there's no crack in the wall or the ceiling; if there were a lot of maggots, as my uncle described, my building would already infested with flies!  
I even had to spend a month sleeping there two months ago because I had an argument with my mom, and everything was fine. There were no maggots or mosquitoes in sight!

I don't know what my uncle's motivations were for spreading such a nasty rumor like that; I pissed and fed off; I told my dad about everything; I also told my dad there's no next time, I don't care if that uncle sleeps on the side road I could never accept that ungrateful POS again.

When my partner is in a good mood, he is among the most loving, engaging, and passionate people I know. That is who I fell in love with. But when he's in a bad mood (which is 80% of the time these days), he's so hard to talk to (he speaks badly about himself and only rants about what is currently bothering him. He doesn't talk about anything else.). The conversation always circles back to how badly he's feeling, how much he hates his job/life, how much he dislikes his roommates, and how much he doesn't like himself. That is all we discuss, and I can't stand it anymore. It just bums me out so much. I'm so tired and want to talk about anything but the negative aspects of HIS life.

I end up alone with his fiancee, we then start talking about house renovation and things, and that's when she said to me ""i don't know how we are going to make room for children in this house"", i was surprised as i thought she didn't want one, telling her what her fiance say to us at work,

She then admited to me that she wants one, but she can't see herself having some with him because he doesn't help enough with household chores. (which was funny to me as he's always claiming he's the perfect man)

"I (24F) just got married to the love of my life (24F) last week, and, as the title says, did not invite my mother. 

For some context, my parents got divorced when I was 7 and I lived with my mom until I was 18 and moved out for college, but my dad was always around and a very present and loving father. 

My mom was always religious and that started to take a toll on our relationship when I started to gain a little self consciousness and critical thinking, which made me question a lot of things that were done and said in the church. 

Needless to say mom did not like that. When I was 13, I figured I had a crush on my girl best friend and confided in my mom about it, so she started taking me more and more to church, and the youth group leader would pray for me to be healed from the sin/illness of homosexuality (their words). I would fast and pray during the nighttime and go to church 4x a week and ask God why He made me this way and why was I like this and please heal me and please don’t make me go to hell. A lot of religious trauma happened, as you can see.

When I was about 15 I just gave up on trying to fix something that was not supposed to be fixed and accepted myself as I was, but pretended to my mom that I was fine and God had healed me and our prayers were answered. In the meantime, I was applying for colleges near my dad, so I could live with him when the time came (he’s an atheist, and has supported me and my sexuality since day one) 

When I was 19, I came out to my mom and, as I imagined, there was a lot of screaming and crying and hands thrown at me, she said I was a sinner and she would absolutely not support that, and that when I had changed my mind, I could contact her. 

Losing m mom like that was an excruciating pain and I have not healed from it yet. I missed her every single day but I would not give up on who I was to satisfy her wishes and prejudices.

I didn’t change my mind, i’m still gay and we hadn’t spoken until a couple of days ago. My wedding was beautiful, my father walked me down the aisle and said he was proud, my stepmom (who has been in my life since i was 11) made a pretty speech and said she was so happy for me, my siblings were all there and it was such a wonderful day for me and my wife. 

Fast forward to the day before yesterday, a number I don’t recognize calls me and i’m surprised to hear my mother’s voice on the other line. She asks me how i’ve been and we make a little small talk before she asks me why i hadn’t invited her to my wedding. She sounded very hurt and sad, and I said that since she hadn’t contacted me in so long i imagined she wouldn’t want to be there. She said she had done a lot of thinking in the past couple of years and missed me, but wanted to give me space. I told her that she told me to contact her only when i changed my mind, and I didn’t. she went on saying she was so hurt to not be involved to such an important event of my life and she hadn’t known i was getting married until she saw my aunts instagram story, and she was devastated that we grew apart like that.

Now I don’t know what to think. I miss my mom a lot, but i thought she didn’t want to be around so i just did as she wished. Should I have invited her?

My fiancé (26F) and I (26F) have been together since we were 13. Like many other couples, we've had our fair share of ups and downs but it was mainly when we first started going out as although we were 13 we were still immature, and we thought we knew best. As we've got older whilst we've had some arguments it's mainly been great. 

In April of last year, I finally popped the question to my fiancé and asked her to become my wife and she said yes. Personally, I don't understand why weddings are a big deal all I care about is that I'm here, my bride is here, our set of parents, and our siblings are here on our wedding day and we say I do.

My fiancé's father informed us he was paying for the wedding and told us how much the budget was. We can afford a wedding planner but my fiancé said she wants to handle this herself and she's been planning the wedding ever since. The first thing she sorted was picking out our wedding dresses. 

She wants a big wedding and since she started planning I just don't recognise the woman I fell in love with all them years ago. She's become bossy, rude, strict. We went to look at decorations for our wedding and the shop had the decorations she was after but in a different colour as the colour she wanted was out of stock but the shop keeper who was lovely explained that these are the decorations we're after but it's in another colour as the colour she wants is out of stock but will be on time way before our wedding. She threw a hissy fit and only calmed down once we got home.

I've tried to ignore it for so long but I'm not sure if it's due to the fact I lost my mother two months ago, six months before our wedding but I can't cope with her being a bridezilla and now it feels like my fiancé is a completely different person, almost like her true self.

"I (28F) and husband (27M) have been together since high school and married for 3 years. We have 1 child (toddler). MIL always has had my husband wrapped around her finger, the voice in his head. 

For reasons name changes and not revealing toddlers gender.

I always thought everything was fine between my husbands family and me. However that all changed when I got into therphy for past trauma. 

MIL  always thinks everything is about her or her son. If I or anyone says anything she immediately thinks it is about her or her son when it isn't. Recently, My toddler (who will be callled B) is currently unwell and I said to my husband that I will get B their 4th jabs once they are better because getting the jabs will just make them worse and it is not fair on B. Was all fine until MIL contacted my husband and told him B needs their jabs now or they will die if they don't have them. (Wtf). My husband got worried and booked a appointment without my knowledge then told me to date to take B. I was like why are you listening to your mother that is bs. 

Moving onto now. I've been in therapy for almost 2 months and it has caused a rift between me and MIL. My moods and mental state is up and down and I'm in a fragile state. Because of this I go to my family home which is my safe space as requested to my therapist. MIL freaking out and went off on my husband because she doesn't get to see toddler much because I'm not going round there enough. Understandable because it is her first grandchild. Me and husband explained I am trying my best to be round as much as possible however I'm not comfortable round there while in this state for some reason. Husband agrees he will take toddler to see MIL and FIL without me. Fair enough.


All is fine. Recently I posted a FB post about how I am going through therphy and how tough it is for me and how I'm trying my best for B sake and husbands. MIL freaks out and thinks post is aimed at her and my own mother commented on her experience what she went through when she was in therphy and what things helped her. Again MIL freaks out. Thinks that the post and comments are about her and my husband and doesn't want people to ""think bad of her family and son"". She messages me a massive paragraph state to unfriend all her family from my fb because they are not my friends because she is getting questioned etc and that her son does his best for me and B and says that her asking to see B isn't manipulating or abusing me. No idea what she is on about. I reply i won't unfriend anyone because nothing is about her or my husband it was about me. MIL then gets bitchy and rude. Long story short I blocked her on everything.

Husband is upset with me because I've ""messed up"" the relationship between me and MIL and I responded that it was his own mothers fault for being rude and jumping the gun as always. Husband is now mad at me and saying I ruined everything and that she qas just explaining how she felt etc. 

I corrected him and showed the messages and he realised his mother is in the wrong and did this to herself. Me and husband had long talk and we are okay. But MIL is trying to guilt trip and manipulate husband as usual.

"I am on my phone so please forgive the formatting if it is wonky. 

I L and my partner B (both early 20s) decided to host a Halloween party this year. We planned a little over a month in advance. We invited my best friend (H) and his wife (S) (we are all friends mutualy, he is just my best friend as well lol), two other mutual friends and their people and B's friend. My younger sibling is living near us so would be there and my mother was coming as well. My older sibling said they were unsure but would keep us updated (they ended up going to their spouses work thing instead)

 The only ones that actually came were H and S and then S's friend (F) that we ok'd coming. Again my sibling and mother were already guaranteed.  We set a time and B and S kept talking about drinks, foods, decorations, and activities beforehand. The party was planned three weeks in advance and set for the 28th. 

We bought extra stuff and last minute touches. H and S came over earlier in the week to make drinks and such. B and I spent the morning cleaning and setting up with all the decorations. We had bought stuff for appetizers, treats, and then food for supper. H and S provided drink stuff.

 Everything came together pretty nicely and we were both excited to have a fun evening. I picked up the other three an hour after the party was supposed to start because they weren't ready but were tipsy which was already a red flag. We arrived and within 5 minutes S tells us that they will be leaving early as her other friend invited them to the bars a couple hours before hand. She never asked us if it was okay or anything to that effect.

After a little bit they did invite us with but we both declined. S did try to guilt us both by saying we were breaking her heart by not coming and that she really wanted us to go and would make sure B wasn't left out as she can't drink due to health reasons and therefore doesn't really enjoy bars. But she still participates to the best of her ability. We still refused as we planned on a night in. 

This was upsetting for me but more so for B as she put so much time, energy, and money into this evening. We didn't say anything as to not ruin the night. We played a game of beer pong, had a couple drinks and shots and they left within 3 hours of arriving which was by 8 p.m.

They never apologized or seem to care about the effort put into the night. They just dipped and didn't talk to us the rest of the night. The next morning H asked for a ride from F's house (20ish min away) as she had left her car at their house when they met up to ge ready. 

We talked about it today in a gc and they just kept saying we had shitty communication because we didn't voice ourselves the night of. B and I both stared we wanted to wait as we were both frustrated and sad so we didn't want to say anything out if anger. They didn't take any responsibility and said we hurt their feelings and were being mean to S because we were short in the gc. I apologized to them for hurting their feeling even though they never apologized really and my bsf said he accepted the apology then proceeded to give us examples of how we could have worded our opinion.

"Every single day that I wake up, I'm hurting. I struggle to breathe. I'm constantly in so much pain because of you. You entered my life like a tornado and wrecked everything in it. I cared about you so much. I loved you even. I know I made mistakes. I know it was my fault, but you weren't perfect either. You asked me to stay. You asked me to try and make it work. You asked me to try and be friends, and I tried so hard for your sake, but you broke me. How could you expect me to listen to you talk about your new partner? How am I supposed to cope with that?

It was unfair the way things ended, and it was my fault. I'm sorry, and you're now gone. I can't stop thinking about you. You're out of my life, and I can't cope. I'm happy you found someone that makes you happy. Your life has been so difficult, and you deserve that, but I don't deserve to feel this way. I don't even want a relationship anymore. I just want you in my life, but you've moved on. You were my best friend. You mattered so much to me. How could you just leave me like this? I've seen your posts on social media. You say that you're finally happy, that your life is finally going the way you want, and I guess that's without me. Do you ever think about me? Probably not. You hurt me. They will never feel for you the way I did. Is that unfair to say and possibly untrue? Yes.

I wait for a call. I wait for a text. I wait for a sign of life that you want me in your life, that our time together mattered, but I don't think it's coming. Even if it does come, I don't think I can let someone back into my life that's hurt me this much. I know it's easier for you to move on from me because you've got someone to love, and I don't. You never really cared about me the way I did you. I consistently dropped everything for you. The one time I asked for you, you told me to man up and deal with it. Yeah, in retrospect, it was dumb, but I would've never said that to you. I was there for you to you cry always. I supported you. You used me, and you don't even realize it. What I would give for you to use me again. I can't do that to myself, though. I deserve better.

So, I'm not going to come back crying and begging for you. I'm not going to humiliate myself further than I already have for feeling this way about someone who's wronged me so viciously. I wronged you viciously too. For that, I apologize. You'll never apologize. You're never coming back. I don't want you back. I'm going to stop checking social media. I'm going to delete your number. I'm going to let you go. I with you the best, but I hate you. I forgive you, but I despise you. When you lose them, I hope you think of me and feel the pain of what you lost because you will never get me back. I hope you feel what I've felt. I hope it works out. I still want you to be happy. Which one I feel more doesn't matter. I won't take you back into my life. This is me letting go.

"I think I just need a place to vent.

I am about to turn 31 and am having a (mild) mid life crisis. Some back story- I graduated high school in 2011, my senior year I applied to 4 colleges (nothing prestigious or anything), got accepted to all but ended up not going because I had no direction and was too lazy if I am quite honest to figure out how to pay for it. I ended up moving to CA to stay with my sister for a year and a half to have a change of scenery. During that time my dad passed away and I ended up moving back home and getting a front desk job at a massage therapy place. During that time I went to talk to a Marine Corps recruiter because I saw what a great thing joining had done for my sister so I ended up signing and left for boot camp at the end of that year. I did 9 years in the Marine Corps and got out a year ago. My time in, to my surprise, I excelled and actually exceeded my initial expectations despite a hiccup my second to last year. I ended up not trying to stay in due to aforementioned hiccup (how it was handled) and because I had a kid and having both parents be active duty just wasn’t feasible for us. 
Now…I currently have a federal job in administration and don’t hate it but am not happy with it. It’s unfulfilling and I feel unimportant to put it blandly. I have started going back to school and taking classes but can’t figure out what exactly I want to do. I just feel lost. I feel like I went from doing some exciting and important to being irrelevant. Also, I have started to think about all the mistakes I made in high school and prior to joining that I wish I could take back or redo and in my logical mind I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t stop overthinking it all. 
I think recently I’ve just realized I don’t want to regret not doing better for myself and finding something fulfilling to do.

"Hi I(27M) have been with my girlfriend(26F) for about 7 years now. Let's call my Gf C. When I first met C I was crazy over her. I even had to fight off another guy for her in the beginning. But as time went on, we started having problems. Her parents hated me from the beginning because I rode a motorcycle and because im white(actual reason). And then she moved in one year into our relationship and about 6 months after that, C had surgery, and she couldn't walk or do anything on her own until she healed up.  After she healed up, I found out that she was cheating on me with another guy online. I confronted her and ended up kicking her out in the time I got confused and didn't know if I wanted to continue. Me and C decided to take a break for a while. 

And fortunately I had my best friend. Let's call her G(26F). I told her everything that was going on and, of course, she felt for me. But maybe a week in or so she told me she has had feelings for me. I didn't know how to take it, but it was a lot because I was in love with G from 2nd grade until about my sophomore year in high school.

In the end, I chose to be with C. I didn't want to throw away my relationship because, honestly, I felt like I did something wrong. But as time went on and every time I saw G or talked to her, it wasn't the same. It felt like there was so much more tension. But recently, I found out that C cheated on me again, and  I don't know what to do anymore. I want to be with G badly, but I'm scared and nervous that badly will end up badly, and she doesn't want kids, and I do. But with C, I can't trust her and no matter how much I keep forgiving and trying to move on, she does it again, but at the end of the day my family loves her and I love her too. But i don't know how much anymore. 


I'm fully aware I'm in love with G, but no kids scare me. I don't want to resent her for my choices. I feel like the answer is obvious, but I just can't seem to get it right.

"So I am 24M and I am  still a virgin but I don’t care about that, but to be honest it just messes with me that it hasn’t happened yet. 5 years ago I moved out of the house to go study and lived with 12 other students (mixed) in a shared apartment. My brother helped me move and told me: “you’re going to have an amazing time and probably are going to get laid”. Now it hasn’t happened yet. 

Background:
As a kid I was diagnosed with Autism Asperger and went to a special school when I was around 6years old  for like two years. Eventually as a got older my social skills actually improved. I’ve talked with girls and even almost got in a relationship twice. The only issue is the following:
I know we were chilling out with each other but I never knew how to move on up from there. Like what I was supposed to do. So that’s why it never got super serious. Then another time I met a girl from Lithuania because she was working summer jobs here.  But unfortunately for me she already had a boyfriend but we still kind of flirted with each other.

I am actually pretty good looking only I lack the thing that gets most guys just going naturally. 

A good friend of mine often (when going to cafe) would say ; “ Hey let’s try to get you someone for tonight”. And I’d totally agree but it never happens. 

Then one day when we were all high on drugs he comes to me and asked: “ like if you want to go to the sex workers I’d come and accompany you?” 

This actually hurt my feelings because the fact he didn’t ask the first question anymore was —&gt; because he knows I am not getting laid anytime soon. 

For me I just don’t want to get laid. I want a relationship with someone. You know like emotionally. Because I lack that right now in my life.",I am feeling lonely and it shouldn’t have to be that way.,18m14x8,1702990195.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18m14x8/i_am_feeling_lonely_and_it_shouldnt_have_to_be/,
"So I am a 24M and have had 2 years of conservatory. Both years were 1s year attempt but I didn’t get my propedeuse. Then I have had 1 year before that and after that where I just worked in a kitchen to live off. So 4 years in total and still no degrees. That last year I started working in a kitchen and worked my way up where eventually I was the main guy (chef) who was doing everything alone in the kitchen. Ordering the food, and making sure that people get there food in time, keeping the kitchen clean etc. But I was stilling getting paid as a sort of kitchen helper. So I was doing the work of a chef without any experience but I learned from the previous chef. 

In that year I’ve done the busiest night that restaurant has ever done. They made a big profit and they gave me some cash as bonus. 

I currently live in an apartment with my sister because I can’t afford one myself. I still cost me like 650€ per month and I don’t have an income right now , just working part time because I started going to college. 

The only reason I started going to college was I didn’t want to do nothing and my brother advised me to get up and just do something ( because I don’t know my qualities besides playing piano I don’t know what to pursue now). 
So now in the 2nd semester of my studies but I actually don’t like the study and hate the people in my class. I probably won’t get my propedeuse. 

So the issue right now is the following:

The government gives me like money to go to school but they only do that for like 10 years and then you need to pay yourself. I only have something like 4/5 years left and so I don’t have the option to fail the next studies if I want to switch.

What should I study is the question. Should I ho culinary school. Like I’m more introvert than extrovert. I get so much stress having a job where I am in direct contact with people but when I am cooking in the kitchen I am very social with my coworkers but don’t have any stress even when it is super busy. 

My parents always pushed me to do something for the elite. Like I never thought of going to culinary school because here it is not a high paid job, so I was always thinking towards accounting etc even though I am terrible at that.

It runs in the family having to try harder every time (brothers and sisters).
Like my sister already finished stewardess studies, she went to Costa Rica to study Spanish, and just recently finished another study and before that worked at an advertising company and was high up in the chain earning a lot of money but quit because it didn’t feel like this was going to be it for the rest of her life.

My older brother is the only one who finished University almost like , he is doing his Masters now. 

So concluding this all. Does anyone have any suggestions because frankly I don’t know what to do and my parents aren’t very helpfull. Supportive but not helpfull at all.",I am stuck in life and don’t know where to go from here.,18m0uvi,1702989301.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18m0uvi/i_am_stuck_in_life_and_dont_know_where_to_go_from/,
"Please, I just need some advice. 


I (22F) started dating my best friends brother (20M at the time) in March of this year. He is this really sweet, patient, incredible guy. We have loads in common and the best part of it all was that I already knew him, so I knew he was an actual good guy. 

We had been talking everyday since November of last year, from sunrise to sunset. When he finally asked me to be his girlfriend in March, I reluctantly agreed. This was obviously my first mistake. You see, I was hesitant because my relationship before him was toxic and abusive. And if I’m being honest, it changed me and how I view relationships forever. I knew I wasn’t ready to be with him in that sense but I feared if I said no he wouldn’t want me by the time I was. 

So, it’s official. We’re dating. What was supposed to be a happy night turned into an awkward one upon him telling me he loves me just hours later. My response to this was “ohhh…why would you say that..” and then he left. 

With that we continue our relationship, his “love” for me heavy on my mind, as I couldn’t reciprocate so it just left me feeling guilty. I’m feeling overwhelmed, unworthy of this so called love. Also a bit lonely. I should mention here that we were long distance (1hr by train) and I have borderline personality disorder (not an excuse, just a fact). He failed to speak with me on the phone as much as I wanted to, claimed it was due to having to share a room with his brother, and our conversations were rather repetitive. 

so in June, I called for a break. The break started off normal, we’d still chat and but towards the end I guess you could say I gave up on him. I wasn’t sure if being in a relationship was what I really wanted. So for the remainder of the break, I stopped talking to him. I wouldn’t respond to anything he sent me. I didn’t know it at the time but he had been crying about me to his sister. When she reached out to me to ask why I was ignoring him, I’d just turn around and ignore her too. 

The break lasted four months. I thought maybe he would just think that we were broken up but she brought it to my attention that he thought we were still together. So after several months of ignoring him, I finally got the courage to end things in October. I told him it wasn’t that I didn’t want to be with him, but that I wasn’t ready. That him saying I love you too soon causes me to panic and so instead of accepting that it could be a possible, I used it as a way to self sabotage. 

I should mention I didn’t break up with him because I no longer liked him, but because I felt guilt for leading him on for so long. 

He took it like a champ and even continued to talk to me after all that. He’s a very understanding guy. Fast forward to last week, I realize what a mistake I made. How could I let such an amazing guy go? And all because of some irrational fear I have. Some bullshit belief I have, that I’m not worthy of love, even though he was willing to give it to me. 

So I tried to get him back, subtly. I suggest hanging out. Somehow we end up with him telling me he doesn’t like me anymore.. I told him we didn’t need to continue our friendship if that was the case. He once again accepted the terms. now I’m left wondering fighting for him back is the best option? Or leaving him alone for good. 


TLDR: My ex told me he loved me the first day we got together, it freaked me out and led to a downhill spiral of self sabotage, selfish thinking, and unnecessary conflict. I suggested a break that lasted for 4 months, 3 of those months in which we didn’t talk because of me. He was hurting so much, I never realized. Once it was brought to my attention, I dumped him out of guilt. Now he doesn’t like me and I want him back. Should I fight for another chance? Or leave him alone for good?",Messed up and regret it,18m0tp9,1702989190.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18m0tp9/messed_up_and_regret_it/,

I found a couple of flash drives with pictures of my dad intimate moments with random young boys.I found a couple of videos my dad had sex with them.I found in one video that my dad is recording against his partner will.Even the porn my dad was watching was all gay material.

I don't have anything against gay people. but When I see my dad goes around extra young boys it's disgusting to me. He is 60, even if he chooses someone around 20 ...

My dad was always behaving bad with me and my mom. Always abused us verbally and when I was younger physically. He is sick clearly with a bad OCD and gambling addiciton.

I always have been suspicious why my dad doesn't have sex with my mom. Turns out this is the reason.

He is also looking at girls when we are outside. So I don't know exactly what's going onbut I know if he wanted he could bring some girl escorts to have sex with. He had the money.

I cannot say he had sex with minors speicifically because from the photos and the videos it wasn't clear but this just add to my hatred toward him.

I'm pretty sure my mom doesn't know. She is such an angel. Kind, lover. Never cheated on my dad. Always forgave him for his mistake. Always supported him financially even after bad losses from gambling.

I really want to do something about it but my mom recently had a heart attack. If it was me, I really liked to turn him in because he is an ungrateful father for what he has right now.

"To put it simply, I feel like it's a curse LMAO. Like I had a crush on my classmate who is a guy that sat beside me, and like for a while I know that he KNEW cause he's so awkward around me after a week or so. And if I'm being honest I'm not the type of girl that feels embarassed when my crush knows I like him. I would still make it obvious lol, I already know that he doesn't like me back since he keeps teasing this other girl in my class. it hurts. But I hate fighting over a boy. Anyways not only after 3 weeks on our 1st semester he made me cry in public because he chose me in our election of being auditor. I really wasn't in the mood AT ALL. After that we didn't even talk EVEN THOUGH WE SAT BESIDES EACH OTHER. (Dw I did say sorry to him and he apologized to me as well, were actually good now 👍). Anyways after that I liked this other dude (again, a classmate), we actually became friends but then he started ignoring me. I'm pretty sure it's because I don't talk to him that much or I ignored him that one time but I let him be. Like low-key he probably got embarassed afterwards cause when I approached him he became flustered and turned SUUUPERR nice which wasn't like him at all. Which obviously made me sad since we actually felt close before now we just became strangers. and now lastly (we'll recently) I didn't really think I'd have a crush on this guy, because he's just attractive to me, there's nothing really there, but he does keep sitting beside me, I'm not delusional since guys would do it often cause they usually need help on homework. That's basically it. But then we actually started talking but not about homework but about personal stuff about our classrooms  and what we felt about our new classmates etc. he is the type of person that doesn't let you finish talking unless he's done but other than that he was a pretty good guy with good morals. We started chatting on messenger and I'm a TOTALLY different person when it comes online, like in rl, I'm the most silent bitch and you will feel nothing but the weight of silence on your shoulders when your beside me. But online, I'm basically on drugs, like a high aunty who doesn't support teenage pregnancy, you get what I mean? just over all  (not to sound prideful or anything) a funny person. But guess what? he ignored me. IGNORED ME- LIKE WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO NOW??? Atleast my past crush ACTUALLY felt guilty, him??? DIDNT EVEN SEEN MY FUCKING LONG ASS APOLOGY MESSAGE. I didn't even know why he ignored me!, like we were normal, he texted me first that time (which was unusual since I'm always the one texting first) and thennn, I reacted the message (which I'm gonna say it again. NORMAL. HE WAS NORMAL ABOUT IT BEFORE TOO.). HE. STARTED. DELETING. SOME. OF. HIS. FUCKING. MESSAGES. Which are mostly him opening up about how he feels (loneliness of some kind idk, something like that.) and at school. Did NOT talk to me. I was flabberfuckinggasted cause what the actual fuck? (After he unsent some of his messages btw i replied something like ""you good? LOL"" and then ""Are you sure your okay?"" and then baam, ignored. Ignored at messenger, school, eye contact, AT EVERYTHING BASICALLY. AND WERE CLASSMATES .SON OF A B-. So I apologized. (And lowkey something happened that day too so him ignoring me was another salt to my wound) and baam! ignored! that fucker😀. HE MIGHTV KNOWN I LIKED HIM. I DONT CARE! THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN JUST IGNORE SOMEONES APOLOGY LIKE THAT!! UGH. IMMATURITY AT ITS FINEST!

"hello, i just made this reddit account because i really want to get some of my thoughts out there.

  
i have been suffering from really bad anxiety and depression for around the last 5 years. i was always a anxious and shy kid but i started having panic attacks and not leaving the house. I had a few friends in school but i didn't finish due to attendance and some other issues, i realised i had issues and got help and started taking medication.  
  
the medication helped me a lot and i ended up getting my school certificate at a community collage kind of place. I had some hopes for the future (i was thinking about doing a course and becoming a chef) but after this my anxiety started getting worse and i began spending a lot of time in my room watching random stuff and playing video games. It got to the point where even catching the bus to buy some food was really difficult as i would have a panic attack from the sounds of the engine and people around me. I increased the dosage of my medication which helped me but as time went on it got worse again.  
  
this was around 2 years ago and i have only gotten worse since. I live with my parents and I rarely ever leave the house, if i do its a big mental battle for me and i feel so tired when i get back home. I have many health issues including poor eyesight, allergies, asthma, gluten and dairy intolerance, IBS, varicose veins and more which adds to my anxiety and makes me more depressed. I stay in bed for most of the day, and the rest of that is spent on my computer watching meaningless shit. I don't play video games anymore because i don't find them fun. I don't have anyone that contacts me and asks if I'm alright, i don't talk to anyone other than my family. I have never had a job and I have always struggled a lot socially, i have never had a relationship and i don't have any friends. I had some ""friends"" i talked to in school but they never try to contact me or anything. i know maybe i should try to reach out but i just cant bring myself to send them a message, i feel like they don't care about me because they never contacted me in the first place when i stopped coming. i feel embarrassed honestly and i think that's part of why i feel so depressed.  
  
My 21st birthday was a few days ago. I had a family dinner where they gave me a few presents, i tried to act happy and have fun but I burst out in tears in front of everyone and it honestly just made me feel terrible because i don't feel like i even deserve their love. i honestly cant believe that I'm 21, i feel like I'm still a teenager and it makes me feel like absolute shit because i realise i have done nothing in life since i was 17-18. I have suicidal thoughts almost every day, although i don't feel like i could actually go through with them, i have planned out methods. my family cares about me even though i have put them through a lot of mental pain. They are honestly the only thing keeping me alive because i don't want to cause them pain. I don't think i really want to die but i just don't feel welcome at all in this world, I just want to leave to another place and suicide sometimes seems like the only option. I feel like i just wasn't made to live, even ever since i was a kid on my first day of school i cried and screamed because i was so scared to be alone in a new environment, and because of that the other kids thought i was weird and thus began my social issues  
  
In the past I have tried really hard to become better but i just cant seem to live a normal life. I have no motivation to even try to improve now i don't know what to do anymore. I know this whole thing probably sounds really self loathing, and i know that its pretty pointless to complain and complain but i honestly just don't know what to do. i feel so tired everyday, mentally and physically tired of everything","Just turned 21, feeling lost and alone",18lzuq7,1702985774.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lzuq7/just_turned_21_feeling_lost_and_alone/,
"Update: Thank you all for the validating comments. I've been feeling nothing but sick about this and feel a small weight lifted to have how I'm feeling affirmed. Much love. Though it seems clear the allegations were false, I have certainly now learned my lesson to never defend an alleged abuser. The claim wouldn't be made if they were a good partner.

Just as the title states. My boyfriend, M, and I were in a long distance relationship for about 8 months earlier this year. We were both going through rough times, with him having lost all of his friends due to false rape allegations. I wasn't sure at first, but after hearing his story, I decided to trust his innocence. He was depressed, suicidal, and overall just in an awful state. I was the only person who would talk to him. His friends said they didnt believe he had done it, but cut ties to save face. I fell in love with M, and he started to feel better. Once he started feeling less depressed, he began to pull away from me. It felt like he had been using me and didnt need me anymore. I expressed this and it pushed him away further and caused conflict between us.

A month before our breakup, I was at a friend's house, and a friend of the girl who accused M of rape was there. She told me that I had horrible taste in men, and that M was a rapist because the accuser, G, had claimed for years that she was raped by M. (The alleged incident occurred years before, but had just recently been publicized on social media). I defended my boyfriend, as he had recently met up with G to try and clear the air, and she admitted to his face that she knew he didnt rape her. G's friend screamed at me in front of all of my friends, calling me a rape apologist. As a result of the incident. I lost all of my friends. I spent the rest of the time that I lived there without a support system, aside from M, who continued to pull farther away. Flash forward a month later, August, and M told me that G had reached out to him online. I said that I was uncomfortable with them communicating and felt disrespected because she had not publicly retracted her lies and I lost everything because of it. I said it was either me, or G. Unexpectedly, M dumped me and went no contact. I have struggled since to feel anything for anyone else, and really miss my ex.

Flash forward to yesterday, and M posts his new girlfriend with the caption ""I love my girlfriend"". It is G! The same girl who claimed for years and told the whole city that M was a rapist. Now, they are in a long distance relationship, which was the exact thing M told me that he didnt want, and why he said he dumped me.

I am disgusted and shocked and feel used and betrayed and heartbroken.

"We’ve been together ten years come April. We have a one year old son who loves his dad so so much. I’m lost. 

He had been ill with vomiting and diarrhea for two weeks. He saw his regular doctor on day one and day ten and he said it was probably a virus. Day ten was Friday, and I was hoping they would do bloodwork to make sure there’s nothing weird going on since ten days is a long sickness. But they just sent him on his way. Monday I brought him to the ER because he had been up all night vomiting and couldn’t take it anymore. The simple blood test showed pretty quickly that something was very wrong, his white cell count is through the roof. They told him it could be a really bad infection or it could be cancer. They transferred him to the main associated hospital and he’s now on the oncology floor, meeting with the hematologist/oncologist this morning. 

I’m so lost and scared. We’ve had our ups and downs but for the last 3-4 years it’s the best our relationship has ever been. I need him to be okay.

"I (F) am a 2nd year university student, and I was always given the idea that people should sleep around as no one wants anything serious while they’re continuing their education. I didn’t feel comfortable doing intimate stuff with other people until after I turned 18 years old, and I felt like I was behind in experiences. I am on the curvier side, but proportionate to my height, but in my state, most men prefer petite women to date. So I, being desperate to not feel like I’m behind and wanted to release the built up sexual frustration, decided that hookups would be enough since the chances of me getting into a relationship and having intimacy with them were low because of my size. 
I slept with 4 people this year, I lost my v card in February, and the other three were scattered throughout the year. I thought that was what I had to settle for as I didn’t want to continue feeling behind. But after this last person, I have come to the conclusion that I’m now willing to wait until I get into a relationship to have intimacy again. I always had the idea that intimacy was a two way interaction. You help each other have a good time individually (foreplay) then you have an even better time afterwards together. This idea has been shattered constantly as I have been sweet talked into a session that left me feeling extremely used and more sexually frustrated than ever. 
The last two sessions weren’t meant to be just a hookup, but I was led on to think that it’d be something more when in reality I was just played. I felt so disgusted with myself afterwards because I let myself be vulnerable like that for someone that didn’t actually appreciate it or acknowledge it, but simply used me for their own benefit and I was too naive to see it. 
I want someone who cares about my needs/feelings too, and I want to have an emotional connection to them as well. I don’t want to be played or just seen as a hole. Given my body being a knowingly issue for that, I’ve been working on bettering myself. I never catfished anyone as I post pictures of my body and don’t hide anything as I think people should know how I fully look. Yet, I could see the disappointment when I actually had the same body as my pictures. Though it is my own fault for engaging in this culture, (even unintentionally) I realized it’s not what I want to actively participate in anymore so I am making a vow to myself to wait until I feel ready to be vulnerable like that again with someone im in a relationship with. I also want to have a deep conversation about it with my partner before engaging anything as I feel that both parties make known their needs/wants.

"Hi all, I, (27M), single, am frequently comforted by the thought of suicide, or death.

It started almost 10 years ago towards the end of high school and has since amplified in frequency over the years but became very noticeable in the last 6 months or so. They are not random and are always triggered by when I screw up (no matter how big or small). It seems to me that my subconscious finds death an appropriate punishment for the number of mistakes I've made in this lifetime.

Now, I know it's not healthy, but this isn't something that I am consciously triggering. If I voluntarily think of suicide, it doesn't have the same effect as when the involuntary ideations and thoughts occur. The thought of a (peaceful) suicide does not offend me, in fact it feels like what can be described as liberation from oneself and at times... comforting.

I have a history of emotional trauma. My family is filled with incredible high achievers. I, in my own right, consider myself one as well. Failure was not punished, but not well-tolerated. Mistakes, however, were both not well-tolerated as well as punished. It's a strange dynamic-- ""Don't cry over spilled milk"" but ""Cry over almost spilling the milk, because you're an f------ idiot"" type of scenario. I believe this has contributed to my subconscious not tolerating mistakes, along with cumulative experiences of emotional abuse from those with power over me (cruel partners, lecturers).

To the outside world, my life is damned near perfect. I work a job most people would kill for, I live in a neighborhood considered reserved for the top 0.01%, lived all over the world, seen and experienced things most can only dream of. I am fit, conventionally handsome, have no difficulty attracting women in and out of my league, am well-liked by my peers and colleagues. I have no reason to complain. I am fortunate, incredibly lucky, even. This, I acknowledge and recognize, and I am grateful for every last bit. But the pain inside, seemingly separate from the material world, is immeasurable. Forgetting to take a note during a work meeting, then being asked on the exact topic can trigger the ideation. Hitting a kerb on the road while driving can trigger the ideation. Saying something mildly embarrassing my crush can trigger the ideation. It's quite literally a ""I would rather die than...."" multiplied by 10.

Not long ago, I lost an immense amount of money to a bad investment. It wasn't damaging enough to send me into bankruptcy, but it was enough to absolutely shatter all my confidence in my ability to fill the gigantic shoes of my family. I felt like a cheat, an undeserving, incapable, fraudulent member of society. This was the breaking point for me. The suicide ideation amplified tremendously, but in that surreal 5 minute, tunnel-visioned moment, I somehow managed to pull myself away from the window of a 30 story building. I feel a lot better now than I did when I realized I had just lost more money than some people make in 10 years, but the haunting scene of climbing onto, leaning out of the window and watching the window go further and further until everything goes dark... keeps coming back. And it is... comforting, and depending on how bad I am feeling in the moment, the thought is almost appealing. Luckily, I always find myself mentally recoiling away from the darkness of my subconscious. 

This all seems to have a very strong correlation with humiliation and embarrassment. Do I want to commit suicide now? No, not exactly. But I am definitely quite comfortable with the idea of taking my own life. I am not asking for help, or suicide prevention assistance. Just to be clear, I know there's something wrong with me. Yes, I need to see a shrink. But no, I am not trying to off myself. I don't want off myself either, I have things to live for. I am just comforted by the thought of my own death.

"This happened when I was about 15, I'm 18 now, so it's been about 3 years.

To fully understand the situation, I need to explain a past happening. As succinctly as possible, from 11-13 I was in a toxic relationship with another girl. She'd constantly make suicide threats on me, threats to throw herself in front of trains (she lived next to a railroad), once sent me pictures of her cutting herself,  all when I wouldn't do what she wanted. She even faked her own death once and then came back to school like nothing happened. For years, I was so guilty over the ways I'd failed her. I thought I never did enough and her unhappiness was because of me. I became so meek and apologetic, constantly afraid that any little thing I did would kill someone. Combine that with my already more intense than the average person's reactions, and you get disaster.

Needless to say, my life at that age was not happy. I was separated from all my friends. I became so broken and fragile that nobody wanted to be around me anymore. I was truly, utterly alone.

And then the pandemic hit.

I never got along with my parents that well. They weren't abusive or anything, but we were just never compatible people. I've always been the very sensitive type, they're the type who tells me to just get a grip and get over it. I couldn't tell them about any of this. I couldn't tell anyone. All I could do was let it fester.

So, that's where the story begins.

I had lots of time to think about this girl. I briefly got into witchcraft and tried to cast spells against her to make her suffer and hurt like she hurt me. That didn't do anything, so I came up with another plan. I made an account on a livestream platform to enact revenge.

This wasn't a spur of the moment plan either. I streamed for months. Walking in the woods, (badly) playing piano, making bracelets and ornaments, day to day life. I slowly built up a following. The app I used wasn't exactly known for quality, but if you were a woman you were pretty much guaranteed to have a platform and 99% of my audience was thirsty old dudes. I always wore a rabbit mask to hide my face.

The mask was because I wanted mystery around me. I wanted people to try and figure out who I was, I wanted mystery, I wanted to create a big buzz. I wanted to be a big deal. The random streams I'd done for months, the rabbit mask, I even spoke in a different voice, all of it was to build this persona so I could be a bigger deal and make people care about me disappearing. I planned to kill myself on stream from day one.

In mid October, I enacted my plan. I tried to drown myself on live. I survived, obviously, and one of my viewers told me I'm lucky my wifi cut out from being too far from the house (I didn't have data at this time) so nothing was actually seen. I'd wanted her to suffer the same pain I felt, I'd wanted her to know she killed me and it was her fault, I wanted a sensation around me so she could never forget it. I've never felt that spiteful towards anyone else, but I feel like I'm an awful person for ever doing that. I'm worried that I'm just horrible and spiteful and toxic.

"I want to hate my dad for what he's put me through the past few years. He's currently divorced with my mom (Who is no better) and he's still in contact with my her. Two years ago when I lived with my dad, I was roughly like 15 and I remember he used to force me be in contact with my mom who smoked and smelled like an ash tray. He would always tell me that I should talk to my mom because she's my mother and she has the right to talk to me. Now she doesn't because neither of my parents have any right to talk to me unless I talk to them first. The reason why I want to hate my dad is because last year he didn't even come to my 16th birthday because he had work (I know that's a lie because he never has to work until 8 pm) and the day before Christmas he asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I just said a mirror because I needed one.

On Christmas day he just gave me money for my birthday and for Christmas- And this year I had tried to invite him to my school's production of Pitch Perfect and he at least did come but he barely even spoke any sentences to me and last week when I saw him for my grandpa's birthday he didn't even acknowledge me. And it makes me want to hate him so much but I can't hate him, I want to hate him because he's broken my trust so many times and he's just a bad father.

Their house it very cluttered and messy and it drives me crazy.  I told my husband I don’t want to live here anymore and that I feel we need our own space but he doesn’t listen.  To be honest, I feel like he never really listens to what I say or try and talk about.  I’m getting really frustrated with that as well.  I tried talking to friends and family but they seem tired with the same old issues, so I stopped talking about it with any one.  I know I am suffering from depression, I cry about things at least once a day. My husband tells me to just “ be patient “ and things will get better.  I have not really been able to find work we’re we are ( I have one “ maybe” job), but the lady keeps ghosting me and them telling me she wants to hire me…. Kind of like a bad date.  I have told my husband that I don’t feel like this job is worth it, with her obvious red flag behavior, but his is pushing because it’s the only interest I have found in someone wanting to hire me.  

I honestly just feel really stuck.  I don’t want to be here anymore, but I also don’t want to hurt my young children who seem happy.  I don’t want to move them around too much , like my mom did with us when I was growing up.  ( we moved like every 6 months to 2 years…. If not more).

I want them to have happy fulfilling friendships and be comfortable and connected. But I’m prefer to not do that where I feel like i have to give up myself.  I don’t mind being selfless for my family’s sake, but I feel like there should be a place we can all get what we need and I feel like my husband is ignoring my need for that.  No matter how many times I have talked to him…. He thinks he can fix it with buying this or that.

"

(Involves mention of suicide!) 

This is going to be very long, TLDR at the end.

First of all I would just like to say that Ive been in a relationship for over a year with my long distance bf (19m).

I (18f) have been friends with Jay (fake name) (18m) since we were 14. We’ve grown very close throughout the years and have been there for each other through many hard times, including the death of his mother when we were 16. I’ve tried to be there for him as much as I can but he’s changed a lot, not in the sense that he pushed himself away from me, he didn’t grieve the loss of his mother at all and became desensitised in my opinion, we remained close but it’s like he stopped caring about how his actions affected our friendship because of how desensitized he became.


He made new friends last year and ever since he’s become progressively rude to me, in the sense that he’ll make “jokes” which I was fine with because our friendship has always been humorous, but recently it’s made me feel disrespected. Last year his uncle sat him down and told him that he didn’t like the way he treats me, and I agreed partially, but also back then it wasn’t to the scale of rudeness as it is now. My last straw was when I went to his house and he just belittled me, it started off with small things, funny things, like him making fun of me for being ginger. But then he grabbed my hair and started rubbing it together saying loudly “wow it’s so dry”. He’s never done this before and I think the presence of his older brother made him feel like he had to show off by making fun of me. He then went on to start commenting about secrets I had told him in confidence, again loudly enough for his brother to hear, and he did this without it having any context at all. 

He said other things as “jokes” but I can’t remember exactly what. It really rubbed me the wrong way and after a while I told him I was feeling tired and took a nap, i then realised that I no longer wanted to be there so I said I felt ill and went home. Another thing that made me feel uncomfortable is how he’d talk about him having intimacy with his gf, he would constantly say “she was so wet” and emphasise how he’d make her finish. I saw him again later that week and again the rude comments were being said to me, as “jokes”

That Sunday him and his family were invited to lunch at my house and I was honestly dreading it because I knew he’d start, I told myself that if he was rude to me then I’d just ignore him. He came and him and my mom were teasing me (it was fine when my MOM does it but I don’t understand why he would think it’s ok for him to do it) so then he could see I was ignoring him And was annoyed so he kept following me around saying “why are you being pissy” “why are you so prissy”. He knew this would annoy me further. I felt so uncomfortable that I hid in the kitchen and tried to wash the dishes as slowly as possibly so I wouldn’t have to go interact with him. He came to the kitchen anyways and started talking to me. 

He was saying that he went out and started commenting on this girl and was sexualising her. I felt so bad for his gf, especially because right now she’s going through a tough time and long story short we genuinely didn’t know if she was even alive or not (thoughts and unsuccessful attempts of her trying to un-alive herself) and I told him that it was so horrible of him to sexualise another girl whilst his gf was suffering. He didn’t care and said “she wouldn’t mind anyways” which is so untrue. He did not like how I cut him off and shat on him for that and there was definitely tension. 

His uncle brought his new gf and she is very sweet but he kept making rude comments about her and even went as far as to call her the r slur, which was so rude. You could tell that she wasn’t fully there and I thought maybe autism but we found out later that she had MS (multiple sclerosis). Again, this made me so uncomfortable because of all his rude comments towards her and she was such a sweet lady.

I moved chairs to sit with my mom because I wasn’t having it. I felt bad later on and sat with him again and we had cake on the table so I leaned over to cut him a slice and he goes “ugh why do you smell like that” I stopped and asked him what he said and he didn’t repeat (again his older brother happened to be there and he def heard) I got up and left to stay in my sisters room. He came and I made it clear that I didn’t want to talk to him 
He went as far as to steal my phone and wouldn’t give  it back until I talked to him. So I did and I shat on him for how uncomfortable he’s made me feel AND disrespected. 

He kept using the excuse “but we’ve always been like this” but we haven’t. And even if we have, he could still see I was annoyed and didn’t like the way he was talking to me but he still continued - showing disregard for my feelings. Again all he had to say was “but we’ve always been like this” and I feel like this showed that he didn’t care about how his actions and words affected me, he just wanted to make himself look better by saying I’m the one switching up all of a sudden. This wasn’t the first time I had to talk to him about how he treats me, I had a similar conversation around 8-9 months ago and one last year, but I probably should have brought it up again sooner, instead of shitting on him all at once. But I wanted to see if he’d actually see how rude he was and if he would tone it down before I talked to him.

He did end up saying that he forgets that I’m a girl and that I have different levels of criticism/joking that I can take, and that he knows that we’ll always be there for each other so this won’t affect much.

They were going home so I just said “you’re right, but all I ask is to be treated with human decency and not to be disrespected, ESPECIALLY not in my own home”. He was supposed to come the next day but I didn’t want to see him so I made up a lie. Two days after he again asked but I made up another lie.

We made plans to go out this last Saturday, and on the Friday at around 7pm he asked to come over, i told him he could but that I wasn’t going to hang out with him bc I had made plans a few days prior to play Minecraft with some online friends and I’m not going to cancel that for an impromptu visit. He came and I still played for a while then got off. I was worried about something else so I wasn’t paying attention to our conversation from before so we didn’t talk about it, he asked if we were good and I said “yeah, I just have more important things to worry about”. 
The next day we went out and as we were driving there he gets all serious and says “my gran and I both think you like me because of how you acted at lunch” 

I can’t lie I laughed in his face, it was out of nowhere and I was zooted. I told him I did not like him AT ALL and he kept saying “yeah but I don’t know”, mind you, whilst this conversation was happening I was hiding my legs under my sweatshirt because I didn’t want him looking at my bare legs in the short skirt i was wearing. It took me later on to feel angered by this, all I asked for was BASIC RESPECT and he thinks that I have a crush on him. That whole week he asked three times to hang out and I avoided every attempt until I couldn’t anymore. I’ve never shown him any interest at all. I talked to my mom and she said that her and my dad have always thought he liked me and then I realised why it made me so uncomfortable when he talked about his intimacy with his gf, the way he’d talk about it was like he was trying to ADVERTISE it to me. To say “I’m so good at it,why don’t you come try it out”. 

I feel so uncomfortable, and really icky. I don’t even know how he’s gotten it so wrong, I don’t like him - it’s the opposite, I feel UNCOMFORTABLE around him. 

I’ve chosen to stay well clear, I cannot be friends with someone who thinks I like them, when all I ask is to be treated with human decency. And out of respect for my boyfriend, if the tables were turned I would want him to create distance so that’s what I’m gonna do. My mom has said that he’s still vulnerable because of his mothers death, and I feel for him. But i still can’t help but feel so uncomfortable around him.


TL;DR :


 My best friend thinks I like him because I asked him to treat me with respect after he continuously insults me. In his mind he thinks me not wanting to feel disrespected is actually me having a crush on him - he couldn’t be more wrong, I feel UNCOMFORTABLE around him. Not to mention I have a boyfriend who he knows I love very much.

"So my love language is words and he knows this, we've done the entire quiz and course etc but he's also someone who just doesn't remember details that concern other people. 

Our relationship is otherwise good. 5 years in, living together 3. Still do date night, still cook with each other and have a lot of fun. Values are aligned and we enjoy the company of our friends. We encourage and support each other and sex life is good.

Here's the thing. He suddenly revealed he didn't want to get married and I wasn't ready for that. I'd always said I was dating to marry and I said it when I moved in and he didn't correct me.

It's been a few months since he said it and since then I've pulled right back. Cancelling Christmas lunch and generally non committal to plans. I can't stop thinking about how my future is now not happening.

He's been doing what he can to make me feel wanted and needed and said we're forever but I can't shake the feeling of being unsafe now. He hasn't been reassuring me with I love yous like I requested since his words hurt, I need words to heal 

Like we can't move overseas together without being married (most countries require it for couples visa when work is sponsoring), we can't buy a house without lots of paperwork and lawyers and wills and power of attorney.

I'm devastated and can't stop thinking about it. I know it's unlikely to change his mind but we have counselling now to move through it.

But daily I've been reading as much as I can to healy heart for a breakup because that's already what it feels like so that's what I'm preparing for.

I'm looking at houses to buy alone as I don't trust my future now. I love him, he loves me but I hurt so badly.

"I lost my virginity to a girl I had known since grade school. We had liked each other for years throughout school but she was always dating someone else. She was a very “easy girl” to put it very lightly. She got around but I still liked her. Eventually we slept together in my senior year of high school and I thought she’d be different and change and want to be with me cuz of our history. But she was dating someone when she slept with me and continued doing so with other people despite me wanting us to be exclusive.
She broke me. I never trusted any girl I liked, met or spoke to afterwards. This made me very insecure with myself and gave me zero confidence even if I would manage to hook up with other girls. 
Jump ahead and I meet my spouse whom I’ve been with for 10 years. We’re married snd have a child. But since the start of our relationship I’ve cheated and developed a sex addiction. I would seek sex from others but never interested in the affection part of other people. I masturbate sometimes several times a day and still will have sex. A friend introduced me to an escort site years ago and ever since seeing that I’ve been addicted to sleeping with escorts to feed my sex addiction. 
Im disgusted with myself. I hate everything about me. I’ve wanted to tell her so many times but all of our friends and family would never see me the same, but I don’t blame them. I’ve thought about ending my life cuz I’m so ashamed but I don’t want to leave my child fatherless. I want to stop but sex is always on my mind. I’ll go a couple months then see something on social media with an attractive girl then be triggered sexually. Sex is everywhere I go in some shape or form. I’ve thought about speaking to a therapist or going to sex anonymous but I’m embarrassed don’t want my SO to know.  

I never thought my life would be like this and I despise the person I’ve become. Growing up you think when you get married and have kids you’re life is figured out and perfect but I feel like a disgrace and a failure as a human being. Who would want to call me their spouse or father. I don’t know what to do. I look at my family and think everyday I don’t deserve them. I deserve everything bad that comes my way. I’m not expecting sympathy. I just don’t know what to do

"I am a 30 year old woman who has yet to have kids. I have started dating someone this year and while we would both like kids, it’s a bit early. 

Long story short - a cousin of mine who is younger than me has two kids. There was a family gathering on the weekend and everyone saw the kids which is exciting as they’re the only kids in the family. My mum verbally commented to her sisters how lovely the kids are. Her sister allegedly told her not to get excited and that I will never have children. Therefore she will never experience being a grandparent. 

My mum told me this randomly in passing. I got quite upset. I did think I’d have kids by now but I guess I don’t think about it too much. I’m successful at work, I’ve travelled, etc - but regardless of all this - it does not matter. I don’t think my not having children should be a talking point and I’m really annoyed this is what they choose to talk about. 

I told my mum I don’t want to engage further with her sister who made these comments. I’m a grown woman and I’m choosing not to be around her. She got upset and apologised for telling me. I don’t think she understands why it has upset me.

"I (18) think my (26) cousin might like me or be perving on me and I don’t know what to do.

 Backstory: we live in different states and while we hung out as children there were many years where we weren’t in contact. Last summer we reconnected on a family trip and things seemed fine. My family is mormon so i told him that I’m not/ opened up a bit to him and i let him follow my spam instagram that some of my other cousins already followed.

 After the trip he started messaging me all the time and it makes me pretty uncomfortable. He often starts his messages by just saying hey and asking how my day went but does this at least once a week. I’ve been giving bland responses and then one day i saw a message that he immediately unsent without knowing i had already read it. It went along the lines of “hey, just let me know if i am annoying you by texting you or if i should stop embarrassing myself”. I found this really weird as it sounds like something someone would send to a crush or like in a romantic way and it really put me off. 

He hasn’t done or said anything explicitly weird but the small things just make me super uncomfortable and i don’t really want to go to my parents about it. I also might just be paranoid because i was molested by one of my other cousins as a super young child and since haven’t ever really gotten down the whole cousin relationship. Like is it normal to text your cousin this much?? Our age gap would definitely make it weird if we weren’t related, and because of my past i have a hard time trusting his intentions. Its gotten to the point that every time i see a message i physically get sick to my stomach and its been bringing back a lot of bad memories from my childhood.

"Last month, I was planning to go on a solo trip, but because I decided I didn't want to go alone, I downloaded an app that connects travelers interested in visiting the same destination. 

I sent a message to a girl who was planning to go to the same destination as me, unfortunately on a different date. However, since I sent the first message, we started chatting a lot, to the point that our messages became very long, and we realized we had too many things in common. We decided to exchange our WhatsApp numbers.

She did her solo trip right the day after I arrived home. During her trip, she used to send me videos of herself, selfies, basically vlogging what she was doing. To show my interest in her, I even did a nice favor for her by asking the restaurant to place her at the best table so she could enjoy the view of the city. I called the restaurant as she was very shy to ask.At one point during the trip, she got drunk, and I told her to stay on the phone to ensure she arrived safely at home. Everything went well until Friday when her ex asked to meet, and I told her that's a bad idea. She promised me she wouldn't go back to him, especially after telling me about how she was treated. She even got cheated on and lived with that woman he cheated with for two months. She continued to live with that guy for nine months, treating her miserably since he was always on drugs. Right after the face-to-face meeting, she called me and broke into tears, saying she doesn't know what to do. I comforted her and told her that he's not worth it, and she should move on. We spoke for two hours on the phone, and everything was ok, she promised me and assured she wouldn’t go back to him.

The following morning was weird; she usually sent me good morning messages, but she didn't. I texted her first, and she told me that she really wanted to go back to him, but the only thing holding her back was me. However, if she decides to go back to him, we should stop talking, she said. I tried to convince her to choose me, and she told me that “I was making everything harder”. She mentioned it was her first love, they lived together and had plans for a family, the problem between me and her was the distance and that for her would be an obstacle. In the end, she said she doesn't deserve me (probably using it as an excuse to go back to him) , and that I should find a girl who doesn't have to make decisions between two males. That really broke my heart because we had plans to travel in Asia together. We spent every day chatting and calling each other for a month, and she knew there were some feelings involved. I tried till the end, but she made up her mind.

I feel that was truly my mistake. I think I gave her too much attention just because she told me in her previous relationship she was unhappy and didn't get any attention. I decided to give her many compliments and always respond to her on time and everything and she was doing the same. But I think I was just a rebound, someone that helped her to boost her confidence and ego and validate her with attentions, so I am feeling like a fool. I wouldn’t be surprised if she wasn’t interested at all and she used me just to feel better. but she used to text me every minute and answer every my messages sending pictures of her, what she was eating and where she was.

At the end, my friend suggested she remove her phone number from the contacts as a test just to see if she will write me back, but because my WhatsApp privacy settings make photos, status, etc., visible only to contacts, she thought I blocked her. The day after, she blocked me, she also removed the like from our Spotify playlist, and I think she moved on.

I haven't eaten for two days since this thing happened; I don't really have an appetite and sleep. I started going to the gym after months and decided to work on myself, transforming this negative energy into positive energy. I know I never met this girl in person, but when you talk for a month every day, it just hits you. I am still keeping our conversation on WhatsApp.

Do you think she will ever come to me if things won't work with her ex? Or at least realize she made a mistake to lose me? I noticed she hasn't blocked me on iMessages. Should I text her in the next months, or should I cut her off forever?

"i'm 20, american, in college. i have had a very low estimation of myself for most of my life. i have had episodic depression and suicidal thoughts for the last 8 years. one of my friends killed himself almost two years ago. it broke my heart. one of the most sobering things i took away from that event was the fact that everyone moves on very quickly. they don't mention you or even think about you, except in passing, after six months. we really do not matter to other people nearly as much as we think we do. that realization, combined with some recent events, has made suicide seem a lot more practical for me.
recently, i've developed a concerning health problem. i still don't completely know what's happening or what my prognosis looks like, but i feel constant physical discomfort, and there's a chance i could end up permanently disabled or require expensive surgeries i can't afford. i'm also really struggling in college. because of this health problem, i haven't been able to take my (immensely helpful) ADHD meds. i've never been a particularly excellent student anyways, but i really dropped the ball. i failed two classes this semester and barely passed the rest. my career aspirations have evaporated, and i don't care about anything i used to like anymore. all i do is cook, eat, play video games, watch TV, and sleep. i feel like i'm just surviving, and i feel like i've been doing that for a long time. this is the worst depression i've ever experienced. 
for these reasons, i've decided to start arranging for the end of my life. two days ago, i bought a shotgun, and if my medical prognosis turns out bad, i'll set a date to walk out to a quiet park and find a secluded place to shoot myself. i don't want to live an expensive life of constant suffering and fear, and i don't want to die in agony in a hospital bed. much better to check out on my own terms. i know it won't matter to anyone i know a year after the fact.

"

How do I find the love of life again? Or the love of people? I used to love life. I used to go out and socialize and would bring myself out of my comfort zone to make things happen for myself and to talk to people.

Then I really started to come to grips with the grief of life when my cat, my best friend of 18 years, passed away after a tumultuous year where she had 4 strokes, eventually went blind, and then got so depressed she stopped really eating.

That was almost 3 years ago now. I grieved and things got dark for a solid year.

Butterscotch used to be my comfort when I got home, and I was sad that I would move away and only see her occasionally. Now she's dead, and I've lost all motivation to do anything. 

Sure it doesn't help that a couple months after she passed, I had double inguinal hernia surgery and couldn't really walk (and couldn't work) for 6 weeks.

Nowadays I'm nothing but the hollow, vapid, angry shell of an old man not even in his thirties. I'm bitter and I'm spiteful and I'm jealous and I'm insecure and I'm impatient and I feel so small but I want to feel large. Or at least large-er. I want to take up space. I want to matter. To myself, but more importantly to other people. 

And to be honest, I don't feel like I matter to anyone. I'm far too distrusting to have any sort of deep relationship with anyone anymore, i'm far too embarrassed of my own past mistakes to even take social risks.

I don't flirt, I simply exist. But also I don't think anyone that interacts with me is interested. I can't see any reason why they would be. I'm not an ugly guy, but I feel ugly, and I think that's worse.

And when people ask me about myself, I'm no longer enthusiastic to talk about it. I consistently have the want for this life to be over, that I've run my course and failed and all of the friends I have are just being nice to me because they've known me for so long. 

I used to go to school, but I'm 28 and I've spent the last 6 years drinking with what I thought was a friend group, but really is just a collection of people in a downtown area that all play politics and games with each other. 

Okay, that isn't true. Many of them are good people, and I'm just projecting. I do that a lot.

As a person, I've become such a shallow being. I feel so deeply but I can never find the words to adequately express myself, I crave attention but when I get it I feel so underprepared and overwhelmed.

I don't want to be this resentful and angry husk, but it is what I am for the time being. I know it will change at some point. I hope.

"Context: Five years ago I went through a nasty divorce. Found out my ex was hitting our kids while I was at work and more that I just don't feel like getting into.

During the custody battle, i almost lost despite all of my proof and only their speculation. I'll never forget the feeling as the judge told me that I'll never be a good parent to kids who were so young and that I should give up and give them to my ex. My heart stopped, my stomach in nots as I hold back the vomit, my world is about to end and I'm about to loose my kids forever.

My fiance decided to introduce me to a movie about a father wrongly accused. He looses his daughter because of it. The movie has a very sad ending.

Watching it made all of that suppressed fear and emotion come to the surface. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't stop the tears. The quiet crying turned to sniffling, which became sobbing. The only thing I could think to do to stop was to hold my children close and tell them how greatful I am to still have them.

After calming down my child mentioned that they have never seen me cry before. Now I'm worried about how this will make them feel and how my fiance will feel seeing me at my worst.

I’ve had so many friendships fail. Currently I only have two friends and I find that all I do is frustrate and annoy them and start arguments. I feel like I’m a petty, mean person but I don’t try to be. I’m constantly monitoring myself about this behavior but I feel like I slip up constantly

I feel that all I do is hurt people. I feel all I do is cause problems. Anyone I tell a little about this insts that it’s not true but they’re lying. What else would they say? “Yeah you’re a mean, hateful person.” No ones going to say that

Everyone in my life are such nice and sweet people and all I do is drag them down. I wish I could cut my friends off without doing it in a mean way, as they don’t need another mean action coming from my direction. But if I could cut them off I’d be doing them a favor

"I work at an animal hospital as what the industry calls CSRs. But we’re more like dispatchers. We take the emergency phone calls, and some of them are incredibly hard. 

I was just hired and I’ve experienced more things than CSRs with twice my experience. I can’t talk to anyone about it because my family and friends think it’s a normal desk job, or they don’t want me to talk about the gross things. 

A few weeks ago I answered an emergency call. The man was very calm, said something was wrong with his dogs butt. I started to get his contact info (which we usually do first and then ask what’s wrong, unless they tell us). I got his name, his number. And then he told me. He had been doing sexual things with his dog. I don’t think I actually processed what he said, I thanked him for being honest and told him he could start heading to us now. But I asked his address, and this has been haunting me since then. The call dropped and he never showed up. We tried calling back and it said the number was no longer available. We contacted the police and they hung around in case he showed up. 

But I just can’t stop thinking it’s my fault maybe if I didn’t ask for his address. Or maybe if when he asked the price I would tell him not to worry about that. People are trying to comfort me, telling me it might’ve been a prank call. I know people are messed up like that. But I know deep down it was real. And somewhere out there, a dog is hurt. I just can’t forgive myself. 

The cops couldn’t find him and wouldn’t update us any further. This is not the first time something like this has happened but it all the crazy things always happen when I’m working. The older CSRs have said they’ve never experienced something like this.

"We were young. I’m talking first or second boyfriend in college, we’d been dating less than 6 months. We were tripping and he says “I’m addicted to porn and it’s so bad I think I need help”

This was never something I even considered being a problem. I’d never thought about it in my life, let alone my first serious relationship. I found porn as a teenager and got off to it occasionally. I knew most people watched it, no biggie. I’d never felt so comfortable in my sexuality at that point in my life, not living with my parents and sleeping around a little at first in college. 

And suddenly during one of the most intense experiences I’ve ever had thus far(tripping on drugs I mean), this guy is telling me he’s addicted to porn and needs help. We moved way too fast. We lived together within months, vowed to be together forever. 

He’d watch it on my computer, on my iPad, on our living room tv, while I was asleep, while he was at work, at school, at home, in the bathroom during my family holidays, pay hundreds of dollars “tipping” camgirls, writing in his journal about wanting to cheat on me. He’d look up the same girls over and over again- people we went to school with, strangers, I don’t know how he found these people he’d seem so obsessed with, looking them up multiple times a day on Facebook for weeks or months at a time. At times when I didn’t find anything obviously porn, he was tearing up google images, Instagram hashtags, stuff on YouTube. One night he searched for nudes of jan fucking levinson after we went to bed after watching the office.

I became so hyper vigilant of everything and it ruined my self esteem. I had no idea before he told me. I tried to be supportive. I tried to not make it about me. He came to me for help. He told me about it because he felt bad about it. He asked for support. And I guess when I learned how bad it was, how frequent it was, how he was doing it so constantly, and that he wouldn’t stop for years after telling me about it and telling me he would (and wanted to!), it was hard to remove myself from the situation. To not feel like I wasn’t enough. We agreed on check ins and him going to counseling (he quit after two times because he thought it wasn’t helping), and that he’d tell me if he relapsed. 

But he never did, not once. I became completely non trusting. I can’t believe the snooping I did, or that he was so bad at hiding it. I’d ask him weekly how things were going and he’d say good. But things weren’t good. I’d never trust him, go through every crevice of everything I knew to snoop through and always found something. He’d promise it was the last time. Cycle repeat. This went on for three years. I’d say things only got worse. I spent more than half of my college career obsessing over and trying to control someone’s porn addiction. By the fourth year I completely checked out, stopped caring at some point, and finally dumped him after way too long (I took our pact to be together forever seriously this whole time, ha!)

I was single for a long time. I’ve been in therapy on and off. I’ve healed a lot of wounds and rebuilt a lot of self esteem and self-worth, but I feel so fucked up by it all sometimes still. 

I’ve been dating a man for a year now who is an amazing partner. We have frequent, loving, fun sex. Yet I find it difficult and painful when occasionally porn will make its way into our conversation. And yes, I enjoy porn sometimes finally again. I couldn’t for years. 

I can’t seem to help this worrying, even though we’ve talked about my past with my ex. I worry he’s in the bathroom watching porn. I check all his browser tabs when he shows me something or when he starts to type to search. I fret over who he follows and posts he likes. Even though I’ve never seen anything bad. He’s much more private- we’re much less enmeshed. I think this is a good thing. It’s just hard sometimes. 

I wish my ex had never told me about it. I feel like it planted this crazy seed inside of me and I’ll never have a normal healthy relationship again. I’m doing alright, I’m in a pretty good place in reality, I know my current partner loves me and that I’m enough even though he does watch porn and I don’t think he’s addicted to it. I still have this fantasy where we’d agree to not watch it. I’d give it up for him. I have better orgasms when I think about him fucking me than I do when I watch porn and feel kind of dirty afterwards. I tell myself it’s because I’m a woman that that sounds appealing to me, trauma maybe. And like I said, I can be realistic here and remove myself from this 98% of the time.

"This is long. It may be all over the place. But bear with me because I often dont enjoy using reddit for venting. But sometimes you just need to yell into a void to get things out of your system. 

I am 25 years old. I live in the shitty side of Upstate NY, I have a 6 month old and a dying relationship. 

4 years ago… it feels like in those 4 years things have gone completely downhill and spiraled. And as history has repeated, the 20s have always been shit. 

4 years ago, I was a young fresh 21 year old. My mother was stuck up my ass, both physically and verbally abusive. My father has never been in the picture, he left my mother with $3 for diapers and spent the rest of his income on groceries for his mother. 

My mother, she fell. Ended up going to rehab for a while, leaving me home alone and with so much freedom she sheltered me away from for so many years. 

At 21 years old. I decided that would be my step into the dating scene. **Actual** dates, not the shitty little long distance relationships that did absolutely nothing. I seem to have a type (thanks mom) because they consistently were abusive. The last one before I met the one I am with now, raped me and asked me if I regretted it later. 

He ended up cheating on me, I stupidly didnt leave him when he took advantage of me. He ended up taking care of himself with moving on with whoever he cheated on me with. 

I healed, I worked through those problems. 

And then at 22. I met the man I am still with and struggling with. 

A month in. My mother had asked me if I was going to end up marrying him. Because I was so drawn in. And I confidently responded that we would. 

He felt like my soulmate, my twin flame. We got along great. He’s still someone I consider my best friend. Even though I shouldn’t. 

In the 3 years we have been together. We constantly bickered about small things. But not enough to cause large amounts of discourse though out our relationship. But as time went on, the bickering became more irrational and intense. But we would still be able to come back together a few hours later and just talk about how we felt. Although that is what I had thought in 3 years. 

There was always something more. But never spoken. 

As time went on, I had a severe mental health crisis. I had a stress induced psychotic break and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a few days. It was incredibly hard for me. Because I wanted to be home. But I had also stayed, and was willing to stay longer because I wanted to better myself. 

And so they medicated me. Heavily. 

But they weren’t the medications I needed. 

As time went on. I continued to spiral. Even though for the most part I had my mental health together. Or so I thought. 

We continued to bicker. To the point couples counseling was brought up more than once. But I didn’t agree to it. I didn’t see the point if both parties didn’t get individual therapy before they went into couples counseling. You cant solve problems if you dont work on your own first. 

And then I discovered his porn addiction. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Even told him I would stay with him while he got help. And so I did. 

But he never got better. In fact. He just got better at hiding it. 

And then, I became pregnant. We both had a mutual agreement on abortion. But by the time I had discovered the pregnancy. And the time frame of being able to set the appointment up for one, I would have been 16 weeks by that time. And they wouldn’t be able to perform it. 

So I was stuck with her. And gave him the opportunity and option to leave. 

He told me he wanted to be a father. And I believed him. 

We ended up losing our home. And I had to move back in with my abusive mother so we had a roof over our heads. 

He had found an apartment. But we wouldn’t have been able to afford it. So my mothers was the best option for the time being. 

I thought she was a safe space as she had told me she got therapy. 

But it was a bold faced lie. 

It became too toxic. To the point police were called because it was considered a DV situation. 

So we moved in with his aunt. 

And she was **worse** than my mother. 

An old crotchety woman who hated anyone who was in a happy relationship. I put up with it because my fiance finally had a job he enjoyed. But I couldn’t put up with it anymore. 

I put up with that woman for months telling me we should never get married. Telling me Im lazy and do nothing because i was 7 months pregnant. She thought I was lying about the severe joint pain. But I wasnt. 

And year 3. 

We just started year 3. 

Our anniversary was august 2nd. 

Our child is now 6 months old. 

And he is depressed as fuck. 

He claims he isnt happy. He claimed that the 3 years he was with me he had never been happy. And I guess he now claims he had never said it. 

He has severe mental health issues. He needs help. 

He doesnt know what he wants out of this. 

And im at a loss. 

I finally discover I have unmedicated, severe unmedicated ADHD. 

I apologize for anything that I may have done to hurt him. 

Im working on getting help. 

And he…..just wants to give up. 

We have a 6 month old. 

And he wants to give up. 

I have never. Ever. Wanted to actually end my own life more than I do now. 

My entire world is crumbling. 

And I don’t know how to fix it.

"I’m okay with my mom wanting to show affection physically through a hug, but sometimes she’ll hug me from the side and touch my stomach. This makes me uncomfortable because I’m ticklish, so I start yelping and making noises that signal that I’m uncomfortable and try to move away from her. When I do this, she gives me a disappointed sigh and calls me dramatic. She’ll say something like “I just hug her and she’s already acting like that”. This is a regular occurrence. 

It’s not just hugs. Sometimes she will squeeze my thighs because they’re “chunky”. Her actions make me yelp loudly, and she calls me dramatic and weird, like there’s something wrong with me for reacting this way. 

Maybe it’s my fault for not directly telling her “hey, it makes me uncomfortable when you touch me this way” but I already know she’s just going to get mad at me for telling her to stop, and that she’s my mother so she can do whatever she wants. It weirds me the fuck out. 

If I were to touch someone in a way that was supposed to show affection, and they shriek in response, isn’t the normal response to back away and apologize? I could never imagine shaming someone because the way I touched them made them uncomfortable. 

I remember when I was a kid and my mom and aunts were trying to give me “the talk” (even though at that point I already knew more than they were willing to tell me), they asked me if anyone touched my boobs, or if I touched my own boobs. I played innocent and said “yeah of course I touch them, like when I’m in the shower. How else am I so supposed to wash them?” And then they said something like not like that. I forget what the rest of the conversation was, but I just remember my aunt saying, “The only one who’s allowed to touch you like that is your mom, okay?” and my mom agreed. I don’t remember how young I was, but I clearly remember thinking, no the fuck she’s not?? Only I should be the one who decides who gets to touch me where, and what they said was fucking weird.

I didn’t want to act on the feelings as I was worried about ruining our friend group and making class awkward. Sadly the start of this semester she told me she has a crush on him and my stomach dropped. I couldn’t say anything as it just felt rude to try and take that from her.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My dad has a worker(like a secretary) who has been working with him for like 5 years. 

Last year, she added me on Snapchat ""accidentally"" through quick add contacts. I did not realise it was her, so after a day she added me I sent her a sticker to get to know her and find out who was she. After a few messages I realised it was her and it was the most awkward 10 minutes. I was talking to her casually then I switched to a bit more professional talking. I knew she existed before and saw her at my dad's office, but never interacted with her. 

That day we texted till 1am. It was not anything special so I thought we would chat from time to time. However, she started actively texting me everyday. At some point, we got really close within a month and from just texting she started calling me couple times a day. I was receiving a lot of snaps of her during the day. I was helping her to choose outfits and instagram pics to post. We even met at the coffee shop a few times. It seemed like we were dating already. 

After a month, we had a fight and I just stopped talking to her. Few months after, I thought it was really disrespectful to her and I added her back. I apologised because I was really mean that time and we started talking again. But it was not the same. We were still close but I was not receiving the same amount of snaps and etc. I was still saving her snaps in the chat like before. We were pausing texting sometimes because of her work stress. 

Today, we are still talking and really close. We text each other everyday with all the gms and gns. But she is not sending her snaps as often as the first month of our texting. I low-key want her to do it again. She always was extremely nice and caring to me.

I burst into tears reading it. When i was 16, i wrote 

“today was a bad day. mom keeps arguing with me. she told me i was a waste of life. who doesn’t love hearing that? also, when i was doing my laundry i removed hers out of the drier. she got so mad at me that she said “see? this is why i like your sister better than you. she doesn’t do bad things.” Then today she told me ‘you don’t belong. you don’t look like any of us.’ even my own mother thinks i’m a loser. isn’t she the one that’s supposed to support me? i guess she really only likes ____(redacted-my sister). she basically worships her anyway.”

can you imagine having kids and treating them this way? i didn’t even realize this was abuse because it was so normalized. now when i bring it up, she says “why do you remember these things” and then she cries and tells me “your sister and brother never do this to me.” i’m 26 now. i deserve better than this. it was one thing just going off of memory but it was a whole other to read about it from my 16 year old self. she deserved better.",i don’t want children because my mom abused me,18lv3k2,1702966532.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lv3k2/i_dont_want_children_because_my_mom_abused_me/,

"Since 2020, I’ve had a wild ride with my mental health. From suicidal episodes to developing tourettes, I’ve had to make a lot of changes and adapt to how I have to live my life

Over the last nearly four years I was put on multiple medications at different times, but none seemed to work. Some gave me memory gaps and one antidepressant even had the opposite effect. My depression and extreme anxiety persisted no matter what I did, and at times I nearly tried to kill myself.

It was only very recently that I was put on a different antidepressant and in the short time I’ve been on it I’ve felt better than I have since before the Covid lockdown. My intrusive thoughts have gone away entirely and I actually have the drive to get out of bed in the morning and do things. I feel more at peace with myself than I have in years. In a way it has changed my outlook on living; I actually look forward to things instead of seeing each day as a chore

"This will be a long story, sorry... 

I'm (15F) starting to feel more depressed than I ever was. I'm already taking depression meds and doing counseling but it's not helping too much, especially with my new situation which is moving. 

For context, my mom married her husband (step-dad) in 2020 and I have 4 siblings in total, 2 sisters (1 and 5 years old) and 2 brothers (8 and 14 years old) , but only one of them which is my youngest sister is my mom's husband's child, and he adores her but hates me and the rest of my siblings. He hates them so much that he'll constantly scare them to the point where they are lying/ having potty accidents almost all the time, and I hate seeing my siblings go through that. Luckily though, my mom did send my younger siblings (not my youngest sister) to live with their bio dad/other family members to keep them safe from them. Now it's only me, my youngest sister, my mom and her husband. 

I really miss my siblings, and I found out the only reason my mom's husband hasn't treated me as bad as the rest of my siblings is because 1. I have absence seizures, 2. I don't fight/talak back unlike my other siblings. 3. I help baby sit my baby sister for free pretty much every time he has my mom do something for him. And 4. Because after my siblings left, my mom begged him not to send me away because I'm her first born and losing all her children will hurt her the most.

The thing I'm most upset about is the fact that my mom married this guy because originally was because she was in a depressed state and he promised to help her with getting a home, and always supporting her because he knew how to work a good job and make lots of money. Obviously he lied because he made my mom lose all of her stuff and he always talks her down. My mom is considering leaving him, like she's 99% certain (only 99% because there's always that 1% that always gets ya) she's going to leave him before the end of the 2023 year. But, I don't know how to feel about that because of all the stuff I would have to leave behind, and I don't really want to leave it all behind because they all mean so much to me. I already lost more than half of my stuff due to my mom losing her storage units (my mom's husband promised to pay them off but he never did) and so losing more stuff will not just hurt me but my mom too. She had way more stuff than me. I'm slowly giving my stuff to my boyfriend who lives in another town, though (I originally lived in that town before moving) 

The thing is when my mom leaves, she wants to move states but I don't want to because of my boyfriend and friends, plus I really hate big changes. So that leaves me with the option to: go into foster care, live with my horrible family members or try to move in with my boyfriend. All these options are better than having to deal with my mom's narcissistic husband. But all of those options would lead to me losing my mom... And I don't want to go through that too... I wish I could be older faster or be a better daughter for my mom so I could support her and convince her to stay with me but I know I can't do that. 

I just feel so lost, and I don't know what to do anymore.. I hope I can get it figured out. And before y'all ask, my bio dad isn't in the picture, because we have no idea where he is plus he's a horrible man. And I have tried reporting my mom's husband to CPS but we didn't have enough evidence so, it didn't work and it just ended up causing more problems, but if my mom's husband goes to jail, he'll end up being deported to Mexico where he is wanted, so we'd pretty much be giving him a death sentence by reporting him again and I don't want to live with that guilt. And my mom's husband does have a good paying job now but he might get fired because he keeps skipping work on purpose, this is his 5th time losing a job since he's been married to my mom

Right now I'm just sitting in my bed at 12 am, writing this with tears. I got school tomorrow but I just needed some where to vent to. I feel a bit better writing this but it does change the fact that tomorrow will be another day of constant arguing between my mom and her husband, and it doesn't change the fact that I still have to decide where I want to go, and chose what I want to leave behind.

"It was a really bizarre moment. I honestly felt like I was hallucinating but no it was there on the screen. 

I love vinesauce and I often go back and watch vinnys old streams. I don't remember which stream it was, but I know it was from years ago. Vinny was playing on his PS3, and random fans would message him and you'd see their username and message in a popup in the corner.

I was watching the stream, and then I saw it, in the corner. A username i recognized and thought I'd never see again. I'll just call him N. (N for nonce)

Its something I had seen so many times in that bad period of my life when I saw N as a friend, because I spent a lot of my tween yrs on the ps3. Like one minute I'm watching a dumb stream, next minute I'm hit with all of this crap I don't think I've really processed yet.

What he did wasn't super heinous, he was 16 (or at least that's what he told me) so he was still immature. But I was 11-12. Even if he was young, his actions still affected me. And like. When I reached the age of 16, I started to realise how wrong it all was for guys much older than I was to lust over me so much. I realised how fuckin gross it was that people my age would say anything sexual to someone so young. I looked at 10-12 yr olds and saw them as just. Kids. Annoying bratty kids.

I don't really have clear memory of those years but I do remember confiding in N for a lot of things. and one of them was telling him about a guy that groomed me on one of those virtual world games when I was 10. I told N about how this guy was really nice to me and would buy me memberships for the game, but one day he asked me to go to his private room in the game, where he started sexting me, telling me to undress my virtual character and stuff, telling me what he wanted to do to me in detail. He was 19 and I was still in primary school. When it happened I was in so much disbelief I just kinda laughed? I was just really confused. 

But yeah i told N about that situation and he was acting all sympathetic, saying damn that guy was a huge creep etc. 
Dude did the same kind of shit to me. He probably didn't realise it. But he did. 
I was way too young to be talking about sexual things, but he would talk about sexual things ALL the time, and ""joke"" about watching porn and masturbating. It became normal for me to hear about sexual things so often.

Eventually the weird sexual conversations were directed at me.

I'll admit, I returned the sexual conversations too, because I liked him. But I never really felt anything sexual for him. I just went along with it because I was desperate for his attention and affection. (Things weren't great with my family either and I was a lonely kid.)
But yeah. I wasnt even 13 yet.

After a while I started to feel a bit unsure about him (thanks to my irl friend telling me they think he's creepy), so one day i looked up the pictures he sent me that were supposedly him, and found them on Google. I felt absolutely sick. My first catfish experience lol. I blocked him after that. Was kinda hoping that would be the last time I heard of him, but then I saw him show up in a frickin stream. 

What's crazy is I never knew he was a fan of vinesauce. I got into that when I was 18 (I'm now 23). I had never even heard of it before that. Its just so bizarre that this even happened. Not a single person who watched the stream will see that name pop up and have the reaction I did. Its just really really weird. 

Now I think of it, dude is probably still active in the community for said streamer. That kinda makes me nervous, to be honest, because I'm in the community too. He could just be there and I'd have no idea. 

I know this went off a bit but idc. If you read this far, thank you. It's a weird situation, but I'd like to hear if anyone else has a similar story.",Guy that groomed me as a kid showed up on a stream I was watching,18luxm3,1702965926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18luxm3/guy_that_groomed_me_as_a_kid_showed_up_on_a/,

"Hello, I (20F) got traumatized on my birthday by a disturbing video game, my birthday was a few months ago and I was excited for it but it got ruined by a video game my friend was talking about. I won't say the name so no one goes through what I experienced.

It's a video game from around the 90's on the pc, it looked like someone made it on microsoft paint, the game had strange noises but each time you progress it gets worse. On the final level the game starts showing photos of real corpses, not the ridiculous ones you see in movies, they were real corpses, scary bloody bodies of people who got tortured, decapitated, hanged.

After seeing all of this I felt strange and went out with my sister to celebrate my birthday but it was ruined, I didn't feel any kind of joy, I felt empty and scared, I hated it. When I went to sleep I couldn't get the images out of my head and I could hear my own heart beat, I slept with the lights on because I was terrified.

After my birthday I kept sleeping with the lights on, I felt depressed all day and scared all night, I was randomly crying and wanted to die. Yes I wanted to die because it was too much for me. I'm a person who loves sleep so much but these days...I hated sleep and didn't want nighttime to come.

Thankfully I started getting better after two weeks and went back to sleeping in the dark, I can say this impacted me a lot, because now I get easily scared and paranoid about anything happening to me, I would randomly wake up and turn on the lights then go back to sleep.

A piece of advice, no matter how brave you think you are, don't look up terrifying things your friends talk about or recommend. If you know the name of the game, please please please DON'T say it, I don't want anyone to experience what I felt.

Trigger warnings:

There will be no TLDR on this post. It will be long. I am sorry.

Today marks my last Monday of traditional, 5-days-a-week 8 hour high school. I currently attend a relatively normal class with a 4A population size. I’ll be moving to an early grad program in January and (ideally) diploma in hand by May. For reference, I am in grade 11 (Junior). 

My reasoning for leaving is extremely complex and spans multiple years. My Freshman year I got diagnosed with PTSD related to fairly common childhood struggles, so I don’t feel the need to include the details of that. In fact it seems pretty trivial in hindsight compared to what happened shortly thereafter during freshman year. My current school only recently opened, my freshman year I went to a different one. While I was there I experienced a number of extreme peer related problems, mostly focused around my sport. I developed a severe mental illness around this time, and in the first semester I had two suicide attempts. The second, one. I was bullied for these. While they never came out and directly said it, I have a feeling it’s because i’m LGBT in the bible belt. At one point the suicide note I had written was leaked and I got hateful texts and such like that. I was also constantly changing medications, and had bad reactions to them, causing even more emotional distress and instability. Events like these were fairly commonplace that year too. I was accused of sexual assault and rape falsely, despite the fact that that I only went once or so a week, i have homebound school. I never really understood the context of that one, the schools and law were never involved because it was just a smear campaign ran or adjacent to a bitter ex. That same ex girlfriend had, for lack of a better word, an innapropriate relationship with our coach. While there was no explicit innapropriate conduct, the way he act(s) around his female athletes was (is, i still see them at big events if i don’t avoid them) questionable. Touching their faces, picking them up, that sort of thing. Nothing wrong, legally speaking, just odd. At one point i insulted her, she texted him and he said “he’ll pay for it monday” (I saw these later on, but we ran as a team for nearly 50 minutes straight that day). 

I could go on and on, if I wanted to, but it would take so much time and energy to just remember the events and I don’t feel like reliving all that. Plus, complex ptsd causes the brain’s memory to fade. So it’s hard to removed too. but to save the time, it was just so so traumatic, the whole year was horrific and filled to the brim with different events of varying severity, some worse than above and some not so bad. But I cannot lie and say i didn’t make mistakes. At one point, and this is probably the only and worst thing i did, a friend of the ex mentioned above did something minor to irritated me, and I told a mutual I wanted to slit her throat and play around in the blood(yes, i had just seen american psycho and 15 year old me thought it was unironically funny to say). I was being serious, too. I know it was wrong and believe me, i’d do anything to take it back.

I ended up at a new school the next year, in part because my parents bought a house OUTSIDE of the first school’s boundaries on purpose. 

Sophomore year was slightly better. Over that summer I gained a lot of weight, quit my sport, and didn’t leave my room out of depression. School started and I mostly kept my head down and stayed quiet, I almost tried to be invisible for the first half of the year to be honest. I guess what I’m getting at is that there wasn’t any trauma occurring, just withdrawn from my surroundings. The lights and stuff were on but there was just nobody home.

"For context I have been taking professional help, so this is actually a good thing, it's just hard and I am writing for myself and anyone that may feel this way or just needs to feel understood, I know how conforting knowing that people kind of actually know what you are going through can be.

Long story short she was my first everything and cheated twice in our 6 year relationship, I caught her the second time and learned about the first one through one of her now ex-friends. She also told me during the break up and the conversation  that I was plain, unsuccesful, that she didn't love me and just needed me in that moment and generally a lot of words that now I know weren't true about me. But in the moment they hurt like they squeezed my heart with a cold grasp, the love of my life who I wanted to form a family one day with, the one who supposedly knew everything about me, hit me in my most deep insecurities. 

But even knowing so, it's hard not to remember the good times and the trust we shared at least for a moment, after all, 6 years together is a lot of time. And as hard as it was, those little moments were actually perfect in my eyes. Even if she cheated and all the bad things aside from that. I can't say I hate her, but I can't say I like or want to see her, I probably wouldn't withstand being in the same space as her and bringing all the bad emotions back in my heart whenever I remember her, see the one who she cheated with and all of what accompanies her. I honestly hope to her actual good things, but I know friendship just isn't on the plate anymore, not at least in many many years to come. I hope to never see you, but wish you well. Even if my good faith won't ever reach you through my mouth, I hope it reaches somehow as I close this chapter.

I just can't keep you in, not in the form of hatred,  not in the form of love, not in the weird feeling I've had till this point when I think about it. I need to make space for all the other beautiful people in my life, I hope you grow and learn to be better with a new partner, because you sure fucked it with me hahaha.

For better or worse I don't think I'll forget you, but I will and have to let go of the past that keeps making me feel bad about myself, learn from it and make better relationships with others and myself in the future.

"Grandma is coming home for the holidays tonight. In less than three hours, actually.

We like to at least pretend that we're keeping afloat when grandma comes home. So, I wanted to go to the store to get her favorite cake mix, as well as some things for Christmas dinner and some general groceries to make it look like we aren't consistently starving out of a desire to avoid each other in the kitchen. I'll be paying for and cooking everything, as I always do. I'll definitely be cleaning after, too. If anyone helps, they'll act like they're being *so* generous, and they'll feel offended at the notion that it's the bare minimum.

I reminded my mother about the need to go to the store several days in a row. I'm unlicensed due to disability, and we have one functioning car. Grandma is sleeping in my mother's room with her, so my mother kept mentioning her need to clean it over the past few days (she's a hoarder). Well, my mother waited until the very last minute to clean her room after work tonight. She told me when she got off work today we'd go to the store after putting it off for a week. I reminded her in text about this earlier today, and she replied with a thumbs up. Now, it's just a few hours until grandma gets here, and my mother is tidying at a leisurely pace. If my mother had just told me when I texted her that she still wasn't done cleaning, I could've had time to order the groceries. It would've costed more, but it would've been here. Grandma will come home to an empty fridge.

My uncle put the tree up tonight, threw a garland around it, then told me to put the ornaments and the rest of the decorations up on my own before rushing off. Don't real families do things like that together? We're not a real family, not even close. We're just playing house because we happened to be born together.

The family left a pile of dishes dirty in the kitchen after I just cleaned it for grandma's arrival, so I cleaned it again. They leave their deodorant, medication, lotion, and toothpaste in the kitchen, but my uncle gets mad when I leave my scones in there. He says I should keep them in my room because they're ""in the way"" of the wall.

And before any genius says it, of course we have all tried to move out. We've all tried to break away from this family house to no avail, at the cost of one another. Economy just doesn't permit it. Not a single one of us in the entire extended family are above the poverty line.

I hate this. I hate them. I'm surrounded by people and all alone. Any little tiny bit of holiday joy I feel exists outside of them. I'm in school trying my hardest to get a degree and escape with no debt so I can never look back at them, but the meantime sucks so bad.

These people are useless. They're leeches. I've bailed us out of so many late mortgage and utility payments into the thousands, and yet I'm sure they'll be mad when they don't get Christmas gifts. Here's a fucking roof over your head. How's that for a loving gift from the newest adult in the household? I'm literally still a teenager. Is it so hard for them to be better?

None of my friends understand. Their families aren't perfect of course, but they're at least close to each other. They're responsible. Not like these emotionally immature idiots.

I want to be on my own so bad. Better yet, I want a found family. A real one.

But right now, what I really want is some motherfucking groceries before grandma comes home. My mother doesn't even have to get out of the car, she just sits there while I haul everything.

"Two years ago my stepmother, who was married to my father for appx. 30 years, passed. A couple of months after her death, he remarried to a woman he had just met. Since then, things have been downhill. I know grief can make us do impulsive things. I know he isn't happy with this new woman and wants out. She lied to our family about knowing my stepmother, what her job was, and her criminal past. He pays for everything and they have blown through his savings.

So I met this person on my birthday at a karaoke bar. Me (20s) and him (50s) He seen me walk in and followed me asked to sit with me. I wasn’t looking remotely for a man that night just looking to sing. I was polite but told him I wasn’t interested. He assured me he was happy to just be friends. He asked for my number and since I’m new to the area and don’t know many people I gave it to him. So he convinced me to go out to dinner with him and I really liked the way he was treating me then and I decided to give him an opening despite my original disinterest in dating in general and himself due to his advanced age. He has been treating me lovely and lots of time love and affection. He has quickly inserted himself into my life friend group home and family. He invited himself to my friend group Christmas party and family Christmas party yet has not invited me to his or told anyone in his family about me. He says due to his ex wife which is fine but I think he pushed me to quickly to share that side of my life as he claims “he wants to come cos he can’t stand being without me” I was really worried and embarrassed to tell people and show people him but I did out of respect and cos I felt it was going to be a happy serious relationship. He has since started to criticise me and state that he will help fix up my life and house etc. I am a self sufficient woman and I am happy with my life and house. I’ve seen his apartment which he brags for being so clean and looking so good and it reminds me of my grandmothers style and clutter. I don’t say anything as I’m not someone who inserts myself into what makes people happy. There are ways he has helped make my life better like buy me groceries but he buys an excessive amount of junk food chocolate ice cream and fizzy drink instead of food that I can actually eat and I have been losing weight and I have a fit life and routine so I do not want or need for these items. I think he may be trying to fatten me up so he can feel more secure as I am young and attractive can easily get a man at any second. I wouldn’t even need to break a sweat. My friend said she thinks he has died and went to heaven to have found me and that it seems like he is way more into me then I am him and I agreed that he does like me more and he was the one who pursued mebut told her I really do appreciate his qualities and most of all the way he treats me. But things have been building up and escalating quickly. I have been letting them slide and just focus on the good. But today he bought up how he met me on my birthday and that it marks the date of when I received the greatest gift I have ever or will ever receive… him. I went silent on complete shock and disbelief that he though/said this. So he said on my birthday we shall celebrate him as my gift. I have gotten a total ick as I said the main attraction to him was the way he WAS treating me. I have never been attracted to or sought out to date a man 30 years my senior. I struggle with feeling embarrassed by how much older he is and I hide this from him. I give him lots of compliments so he feels good about himself. I feel he is trying to put me down and make it seem like I can’t live without him which I have been doing just fine at. I have lot of achievements in my life and I struggle to understand how or why he would think it’s ok to say this and attempt to make my birthday all about himself. I’m to embarrassed to ask my family and friends for advice I feel kind of trapped right now I won’t accept this but idk if he would listen to me and change?

Hi! Basic Context: I'm 14 and have had reconstructive surgeries and a lot of other procedures regarding my reproductive system in these past 3-4 months. 

My first surgery was looking okay but I got a bad kidney infection through my foley catheter and couldn't really sit for a month. I was suicidal my first week post op and depressed. I didn't really go for therapy since things were okay and I spoke to a social worker about my suicide ideation. I go back to school after two months of medical leave. Then, I go in for a post-op exam some time later and they find that they will need to do same surgery again, and will need to harvest skin grafts from my groin and will do a laparoscopy. I wasn't upset during this time, but I guess I had some trauma from my first surgery. After my second surgery I notice I have two IVs instead of the one I saw them place when I was conscious. I just brushed it off and thought I woke up from the anesthesia mid surgery... Whenever I have anesthesia, I cry coming off of it and this time I told my nurse at the time I was suicidal my last surgery. I also had a foley catheter placed again and seeing/feeling it made me upset. After, I'm in my hospital room and out of PACU, a resident tells me my expected 2 hour surgery had extended to 6 hours, and they found a fistula. This meant I had to have foley catheter in for two weeks instead of one. Which also explains why I had two IVs. When the resident leaves the room, immediately I begin to cry and ask why my parents lied to me. My mom tells me that they wouldn't tell me this when I was just saying I wanted to die in PACU. I have a panic attack and speak to a psychologist. This post-op week was genuine hell and very painful. 8 days later they take all my tubing out and I was so happy that it was cut short from 2 weeks!! But four days later I'm displaying symptoms of another malformation so I go in for another exam.

Upon this exam, I did not pass requirements to prove that malformation was just post foley catheter symptoms, so we have to put foley catheter back in, this time for the full two weeks. My suicide ideation peaks again and I'm wondering what the hell did I do in my past life to get to this point. My school is also urging me to repeat a grade and I just can't. I have this violent outburst where I'm screaming and crying after my school calls me. When they were telling me to repeat, I genuinely thought I was going to end my life by overdosing on my pain medication. Today, we did an x-ray to see if foley catheter would stay or not. I was so excited and I actually thought I could have my life back today. I even said I was gonna chug a can of soda since I can't drink that with a catheter. But I wake up from my exam and I have to have the foley in for another two weeks. A christmas gone. I can't do this anymore I don't know how to cope. I have a psychologist but I just don't know how I can do two more two weeks. My next appointment with my doctor is literally fucking new years. I can't do this anymore I'm so tired. I want to do normal human things like urinate normally and poop without having to worry about other things!! I want to be able to walk and sit normally!! I want to slam a can of soda and eat what I want to eat. I'm so tired and I don't want to know what to do to make these two weeks go by faster.","I can't deal with the fact I have to have a catheter in for two more weeks, and I'm exhausted from surgery and life",18lti5u,1702961149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lti5u/i_cant_deal_with_the_fact_i_have_to_have_a/,
"My friend has been struggling with his health for a while. He's 20, still lives with his parents but he is too afraid to even tell them he has blood in his stool. I doesn't want to ask his grandparents either because he feels like they've done too much already for him like them paying for repairs to his car that the GRANDPA had made. 
He's told my other best friend and I that be thinks that he close to dying, that he'll go to sleep and never wake up. 

His mental health isn't great either. He's constantly stressed about his parents getting on his back 24/7 and no matter what he does or do, they will be an ass to him. He's even told me that they would charge RENT to him if he moves out. He's in credit card debt, his parents won't let him sell his car and he works grave yard shifts every day of the week. 

I'm very tempted to go tell his grandparents about what's all happening because his parents don't give 2 shi ts about him and or he's too afraid to talk to them.

If I told to his grandparents, that will most likely disrupt his whole family tree. If I do nothing, he could potentially die. Too me, he doesn't seem capable to take care of himself but will do anything for someone else. 

What should I do? Should I shake the tree or should I trust my friend that he will get help?

"Recently, i reconnected with an old friend of mine that i've known for the better part of 17 years. I was head over heels for this guy.. as a teen, i'd get home from school as fast as i could just to talk to him on msn for hours upon hours, talking to him was so easy (to this day i struggle with conversations, but even now talking to him again it's easy, like we never disconnected in the first place) We talked about everything; what we wanted out of life, where we hoped our futures would lead to, what we could do when we were finally able to drive to and see each other in person, hell he's the only person i've ever sexted. He brought out this side of me that i thought i lost when we went our own ways.

When we stopped talking, it absolutely broke my heart. We didn't live close to each other, we ended up on different life paths with our own lives, and really who was i to complain about it? but i was hurt and I cried about it for almost a year. I love him and i never told him.. and it turns out he never told me either. We were both too chicken shit to just admit our feelings for each other. We're each other's first love, and we both know it's too late now.  We're both married, and we don't want to hurt anybody. My 18 year old self healed a bit now that i know i wasn't just making it up in my head that what we had was young love. While i feel like i got this piece of me back, those feelings never fully went away and it's not fair. i don't want to cry about it anymore. it's not fair for any one. time is a thieving bastard and it's not fucking fair.

"I don’t really know how to format one of these posts, so I guess I’ll start by talking about my family. It’s myself, my husband, our twelve year old daughter, and my eldest who was sixteen when he passed. For the first fifteen and a half years of his life, we knew him as our daughter/sister, but last year he was brave enough to tell us who he really was. The new name that he asked us to use was Jasper. 

It took a bit of adjusting, of course, but my daughter and I tried our hardest for Jasper’s sake. My husband didn’t. My husband, rather than accept Jasper and move on with the rest of the family, he tried to convince Jasper that he wasn’t actually transgender and was in fact just ‘confused’. 

My husband refused to use Jasper’s new name and pronouns, it was actually a little silly once Jasper started dressing more masculine and talking in a deeper voice. My side of the family followed mine and my daughter’s lead and changed how they referred to Jasper. My husband’s side of the family followed my husband’s lead, and this devastated Jasper because he’d previously been very close with his relatives on that side. 

He tried to get me to agree to send Jasper to a therapist from a friend’s church who claimed to be able to ‘cure’ gay and transgender children of their ‘delusion’. I refused, and my husband was furious with me, but I stood my ground because I’ve heard horror stories about what happens to kids whose parents try to ‘cure’ them. 

He showed me articles from crackpot websites that claimed that being transgender was some sort of social disease, that Jasper was only the way he was because of his friends and his teachers. At that point, six months after Jasper came out, I was ready to divorce my husband. Then, Jasper went out one night and didn’t come home. 

We got a call from the police around five in the morning, who had found Jasper’s body on the interstate. We found out later that he’d jumped off an overpass and passed on impact. I found a suicide note on his desk, which said, directed at my husband, “I hope you’re happier now that I’m gone and you don’t have to deal with me anymore.” I packed my bags and went to stay with my parents that very moment.

I didn’t speak to my husband at all for a month, until a family friend told me about a funeral that my husband was planning, only the announcement at the funeral home was using Jasper’s old name an old photo from when he looked like a girl. I asked my parents to let people know that the real funeral would be held at a different funeral home at a different time as I was in the process of planning. I didn’t have the energy to deal with my husband at that point. 

Now I’m legally separated from my husband and I’m not looking back, that evil man killed my child and I never want to see or speak to him again. My daughter is bouncing between my apartment and our old family home, I can tell she misses Jasper and resents her father as well. My fury against my husband has calmed to a simmering hatred, but now I can’t help but feel guilty for how far my husband’s crusade against Jasper’s identity went without me stopping it. To anyone here with a trans kiddo, learn from my mistakes and protect your little one from all harm, especially when that harm is coming from someone they love. Words cut deeper than one would expect, and they can’t block out every criticism that comes their way, doubly so it’s coming from a person who they trust.

"29f

Neglectful, extremely abusive childhood. Absent father. Bullied in school. Very little friends (now, none) Still living in a dorm at nearly 30. No love life No money Antidepressants Etc etc

I was able to work at a job I liked enough until I crashed and burned. I haven't been able to work since. It's the last thing I want to do. No motivation, no energy. When I did work I think I was at my full potential, which wasn't that great because aside from being employed every else was the same.

When I was a kid I told myself over and over that things would get better. I was always very hopeful. It's what kept me going for a long time.

The last two years that hope has dimished...now it's scary. I'm afraid of my outcome. I'm irritated, bitter, alone. I don't care not to either, because back when I wasn't so irritable and bitter, life still constantly fucked me.

I genuinely don't think I can do it anymore.

Not too long ago, I thought I found someone to spend my life with. All I have ever wanted from childhood was my own family and to be a mother. Way better than my own. That's literally all I wanted. People say focus on yourself and what you want. It's not a career or some random hobby. I wanted a family in this life. But it's like some cruel twist of fate that it can't happen for me. The last decade I've watched friends I grew up with get married and have children. I feel sick with envy which is turning into full blown, hateful jealousy. Even my own family. My brother and I had the same upbringing for the most part, yet anything and everything falls into his lap. He drinks constantly and has his own issues, but he has a wonderful family, home, career etc. Anything he can ask for, but drinks into a stupor any chance he gets.

So it's not fucking hard work. It's luck. And I am unlucky, so why play the game ? When I used to gripe aloud about lack of relationships, people would say ""you have to love yourself first"" which is BS. I know people who struggle and I know people who are straight up assholes and they have their person. So it's not about that either. It's luck.

The guy I was with told me things and I believed. We were even looking at houses together. Then I found out he had a double life. Two! homes. The place I knew and been to then a whole other home. With a fiance. And a baby.

I can't imagine what his endgame was. Finding out I was manipulated that way was humiliating and embarrassing. I don't know how another human could do that to someone.

It's sort of the last straw for me. Yeah it really, really sucked in of itself. But it's been the cherry on top of 30 years of BS.

I guess I'm too weak to manage this life. I'm not suited to it. I'm unwanted and never fit in. It's been made clear to me.

I've lost the hope and the drive of young me. The way I had to navigate my childhood has left me exhausted in adulthood.

Any sliver of a chance of turning this shit around would take years and LUCK. I don't have the patience, energy or motivation. I hardly even care anymore.

"I (24 f) had a twin brother. He commit suicide when we were 15 because of our dad's abuse. For context, my dad used to beat my mom. They divorced and she seeked help. Unfortunately, she was stuck in that situation for years. As a result of not being able to leave, he would beat us too. I had 3 siblings, my twin brother, younger brother (now 18 M, at the time he was 10) and youngest brother (now 13 M, at the time he was 5). He would abuse all of us, but I got it the least bad (I think this is because I am a girl). My dad is bipolar and has BPD. He would beat my twin brother the worst out of all of us. My mom did not know that we got beatings, she thought it was only her. We have called CPS multiple times. They did nothing. (Fortunately all 3 of us are out of that situation now, and 4 including my mom) One week, after my twin brother called CPS, he got the worst beating he had ever received. He got verbally insulted and my dad drove him to his breaking point. He skipped school because he was ""feeling sick"" after receiving his beating. My 10 y/o brother and I got home and walked into my bedroom (my twin and I shared one) and we found him hanging. He left a suicide note behind about how he was being bullied at school and couldn't take it anymore. For another year, I had to sleep in the same bedroom my twin died in.

My brother and I were traumatized, but after 2 months of healing, we brought ourselves to clean out his drawers and cabinets in our room. We took out all of his stuff and found his diary. He journaled his self harm and wrote about how the abuse was driving him to his breaking point.

I felt sick to my stomach after reading it. I skipped a year in school, so at 16, I got to move out to a college dorm. My parents divorced around the same time that I moved out. My brothers were split between houses, leaving my younger brother with our dad and my youngest with our mom. (They shared custody, but they primarily lived with that parent)

Our youngest brother turned out fine, but my younger brother attempted suicide and got addicted to weed all by the time he turned 16. Thankfully, he is recovering, stopped doing weed, got a boyfriend, and started therapy. He moved out at 18 (he turned 18 in September) and is currently living with our mom and our other brother. Both of my brothers seem to be moving on with their lives, but I am so stuck. I would've celebrated my 24th birthday with my twin a few weeks ago. I can barely celebrate my birthday anymore knowing we would've shared one. I can't take it for much longer.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much going on in my life, including my fiancé being diagnosed with cancer (we've been together since 16) and it's only making me think of my brother more. Now that I'm alone at home most of the time because my fiancé is in and out of the hospital, I've been thinking about my brother more than usual.

I just wonder where he would've been today and how he would've been doing. I just know he would've been so proud of our younger brothers and he would be recovering and having a great life right now. My brother being gone still doesn't feel real to me. I miss him so much. I just wish he could've held out for longer. I wish I could've saved him. I wish he would've gotten help. The thought of him has been eating me alive for years, but more than ever right now. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I'm a therapist so I haven't been going to therapy myself, as I have no time. I don't know what else to do, but I just want to get better and get over this.

So recently my friend confronted me about some things that I have done. It all started when we all went out to a bar. My friend was telling me about wanting to do some sexual things with people and I just basically said some really mean things to her. Basically slut shaming her even though I am super sex positive and I dont think of her as a slut at all. I dont know why I even said it but it all happened so fast and we went home and didn’t speak until tonight. She made me aware of some of the horrible things I have been doing, and it honestly really scared me because i never even realized how hurtful some of the things i have said/done before were. I feel like i have been a controlling, judgmental, jealous person. Basically i am now just introspecting and realizing how this whole time maybe I wasn’t just being bitchy, but i am just a bad person. I want to be better but i feel terrible and i dont know how to.

In my previous post I stated my girlfriend (Sammy) was helping me through my tonsillectomy, and that I was planning on proposing to her the second I got the chance.
I decided to go all out for the proposal- I booked us a reservation at her favorite restaurant and I bought her a new dress in her favorite color, and got a shirt for myself to match. We went out to a local “park” (I don’t know if you could really call it a park, it just has benches and sidewalks, nothing else lol) to watch the stars, and I proposed. She said yes!

"I just finished grad school in the city I grew up in. After a tough recruitment period during my last year of school, I’ve secured my dream job—starting pay is low, but the training opportunities it provides for my field are invaluable, and I get a guaranteed raise each year. It’s essentially an apprenticeship. Once my training is done (after about five years give or take) I can go in to business for myself, which is quite lucrative.

During school I worked part time, and with the help of a modest student loan, could afford a really neat one bedroom apartment in a desirable part of the city. The four years I’ve lived here have been awesome. Unfortunately, as with everything right now, it’s getting too expensive to justify. The wages for the first year or two of my job make it so that staying in my current accommodation would be irresponsible at best and stupid at worst.

My parents know this city better than I, because growing up we moved away for a few years, and they moved back when I was away for uni. Last week I went to my mother and asked if she knew of any local brokerages that may be able to help me find a place within a tighter budget. She of course was very helpful and I began the search for a new apartment and roommates. 

Tonight I went to my parents’ house for dinner, and they offered to let me move in with them so that I might save up some money. We did the math, and I’d be able to triple the amount I put in savings each month. I’ll pay the utilities and help with groceries, plus a nominal rent, which will cover some of their expenses, so they can save money too. The details haven’t been hashed out yet, but I’m going to plan on staying a year and assessing things from there.

This should probably be embarrassing, because what kind of young professional moves home with their parents? But I feel like the luckiest person alive right now. This has made my life so much simpler going forward.",Moving back in with my parents as an adult and couldn’t be more excited about it,18lsfx9,1702957861.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lsfx9/moving_back_in_with_my_parents_as_an_adult_and/,

"I (29f) used to be very active in my childhood, my parents always engaged me in a lot of sports and activities (summer camp every year, basketball, volleyball, horseback riding, etc.)

By in no means was I a *fat* child, I hit puberty very young (period and C cups all in the 4th grade which is HELL BTW). But kids are terrible so bullying ensued through my entire life, and even my own parents were a bit *mean* about my weight— cue disordered eating, just cycles of binging, purging and starving myself. 

Now I will say, as a result of mental health, birth control and physical ailments I gained a lot of weight. I peaked at 280 lbs 3 years into my current relationship, and while my partner never once put me down or said anything about it— I felt insecure and unhealthy. 

I am now 170 lbs. 

I know what you’re thinking… “yes queen 110 lbs down get it ✨💅🏾”

But… I feel like I got here because of disordered eating that I didn’t acknowledge until now. My regular consumption is Monster, maybe a meal here and there and snacks. I don’t “exercise”, I just walk a lot because I live in a big city. 

People ask me how I lost the weight and I feel like an imposter telling them I did it the “healthy way”. I had an old friend DM me saying that they wish they had my body and I sobbed because I feel like I’m a liar. 

When I tell people straight-up that I lost weight due to my disordered eating it’s never “oh… that’s not good” it’s “oh, well you look FANTASTIC.”

"I don't know where to begin because I guess my life has been a bit of a rollercoaster. My son was born a couple months after me and my ex lost everything in a natural disaster, including my small but successful home business. This disaster put a major strain on the relationship. We ultimately tried to start over in a different state. Within a few months after moving, I suddenly lost eyesight in one eye and needed urgent surgery. From this time forward, I was unable to drive. 

Soon after, I woke up and realized my ex had left me. No explanation, no note. At first it was devastating. We had been together for about 10 years. There was no public transportation, and my house was 15 miles from town - and I couldn't drive. I had no friends or family within 600 miles. Everything became 100x harder to coordinate. But I loved my son more than life and promised myself I would do anything I could to make sure I was there for him. 

For the next four years, I did my best to coparent with my sons' mother and I was able to retain 50/50 custody via our verbal agreement. But she began to use my son as an instrument to hurt me and make my life harder. Throughout those four years I never missed a single scheduled day. My ex made it clear that I wasn't allowed to request a schedule change, she would heavily gaslight me, and if I wasn't available during my scheduled time, then I would lose my parenting time. The eye surgery I required needed 6 weeks for post op recovery, a majority of this time being immobile - which obviously wouldn't work with a one-year-old. 

I chose to do what any father would do, and I decided to be thankful for all of the time I had with my son, knowing damn well I was lucky. I know most single fathers are lucky to get every other weekend - and they have to fight for it. Risking permanent legal blindness in one eye in exchange for the joy I would gain being in my sons' life - I was there to witness all of his firsts. I helped him learn how to walk and he took his first step for me. I taught him his first words; how to talk and heard his first words. Morals and manners. 

Since I was unemployed, I was able to spend all 24 hours a day with him. I'm pretty sure we scouted out every inch of our 15-acre property before I had to sell our home. But, when my half of the week was over, the mental struggle would begin. I spent 4 years esentially in isolation, while my eyesight was getting worse and worse. I couldn't find a job because I either had my son or I didn't have transportation. I ended up using up all of my savings after 4 years and had to sell our home.

When it was time to sell our home, my ex had told me she planned on moving out of state within the next 6 months, but she wasn't sure where or exactly when. She had a new boyfriend, and she was talking about getting married.  I figured that this would be a good time to begin my surgeries and attempt to salvage any vision possible. I needed eyesight to be able to drive and find employment again. I was thinking about the long run; my son was getting older, and I needed to be at my best for my son's sake. The surgeons had said it was going to take a few surgeries and months of post-op recovery time. My mom had said I could move (out of state) and stay with her while I completeled the surgeries. I felt this was a good plan considering my ex would be moving in the nearish future.

I talked it over with my ex and I expressed that I would want to retain 50/50 custody, but we would have to change our scheduled time and possibly. We came to an agreement, and I sold my house and moved.  Four days after I moved, I'd come to learn my ex lied. She wasn't going to let my son visit me out of state, and since I moved, I chose to abandon my son - and it's my fault if i don't like it. 

Me and my son were inseparable. He was my entire world, and I would do anything for him. I shouldn't had been so naive; I feel like it is my fault for believing my ex. She wouldn't let me miss a single day when I lived near my son. Why would I think she would agree to this?

I ask to facetime with my son every day. Sometimes a month goes by without a reply. Sometimes I get to talk to him three times a week. One day, my son told me my ex's husband told him that I abandoned him. It felt like I was stabbed in the heart. I can visually see his anxiety. I can visually see the waves of questions going through his mind sometimes, especially when his mom is in the same room when we're talking. When she isn't in the room, he lights up and turns into his old self again &lt; / 3 I wish I could be there for him like I used to be. I always gave him extra time and love because I feel that his mother is a narcissist. She just seems to treat our son as an object, she speaks at him, not to him, she criticizes him constantly. He's not even five yet. I just can't imagine a parent saying anything that would hurt their child, or letting anyone say things to their child that hurts them. 

Now that my surgeries are almost complete, I've regained a good amount of eyesight. I've filed a custody summons. There's still a long road ahead. I haven't been able to work in so long, so I am starting from scratch and have no savings. But my goal is to legally regain 50/50 custody again. 

There are many days I ask myself, ""Was the surgery worth it?"" I feel like it's my fault that I hurt my son. Even though I know this wasn't my intentions, i am the reason he has to deal with the emotional abuse he hears constantly, 100% of the time, instead of being able to come to my place half of the week. :(

"So my..friends… decided to do a cabin trip for a week. Because of work I was only able to go for the weekend.

Can’t remember exact words because drunk but that was the gist of it. An hour later we’re all plastered at this point and we’re in the hottub. The hottub is up at front to the side of the house and about thirty feet away from the front porch to the side. I said I was going to be right back, friend asks for a drink, I said sure and left. About fifteen seconds later I get on the porch, out of view from tub and my drunk self notices that they were talking about me because they were loud af about it. They were all ramming through about some annoying shit I do and even heard one of them about how i always use my autism as an excuse for said stupid shit. I literally break down, went to my room and cried. One of them knocked on my door and just said it made her nervous that I’m alone with my door locked. Whatever I unlocked it. Told her it’s unlocked and said she wasn’t coming in. I repeated exactly what they said earlier and said I’m not going back. Other friend (who said I was his best friend) tried to made me talk about said stupid shit and wanted to talk about it (mind you we’re both drunk and I JUST overheard four people coming at me as soon as I left) and pleaded I didn’t want to because I’m overwhelmed.

"There, I've said it. I fucking HATE Christmas.

It's a shitty time of year in the first place as my adored father died just before Christmas 8 years ago. It's the middle of summer here so temperatures are in the high 30s (Celsius) and 5000% humidity - it's like walking into an oven every time you go outside.

I'm absolutely haemorrhaging money buying Christmas presents. Every single fucking year I tell myself I'm going to start my Christmas shopping early, but just like every other year, here we are 6 days away from Christmas and I'm freaking out about what to buy people, so I inevitably end up spending more money than I need to just to be able to have something I can give them. I'm having to buy presents not only from myself but also for my very elderly mother to give to people as she can't get out to the shops. She's paying for her presents.

My nephew and his partner are 'hosting' Christmas on Boxing Day at their house (they've got a new pool, so that's probably a really good thing). Except, they are providing for 10 people for an entire day .... nibbles. That's it. So I've had to buy a ham, turkey, salads and Christmas crackers. Fortunately my sister is bringing some salads, bread rolls and desserts. I swear to God if I ever just took Christmas off and went to the beach with the dog, the entire family would starve to death. I'd probably get sunburned as well, so fuck that.

"I’m a newly proclaimed only child due to a long-standing unhealthy relationship between me and my sister. I was hoping our relationship would improve over time but now I’m content ignoring her for the rest of my life. 

We used to be insanely close and supported each other through everything between ex-boyfriends being jerks and a mother with addiction issues. Truly, we were thick as thieves. 

Our mother eventually became so consumed by her addiction that she became physically and emotionally unstable. She would unfortunately pass away only after she had realized the damage she did to herself and everyone else around her. Me and my sister had lost our mom at 16 and 17. 

My sister and newly widowed father took to each other for comfort during the intense grieving process. 

This is where everything started to go downhill.

Even though my father was a strong and compassionate man, he took his anger out on us. More importantly, my sister. He saw our mom in her because of her battle with mental health and became increasingly short with her. I remember him screaming at her once when she tried to do something drastic to herself.

I talked to him about it and urged him to get help. He began to see a therapist (The same office that me and my sister went to)

We had to leave the home we grew up in due to the horrible memories and moved in with family. 

Things started looking up. 

We both were being treated for depression and anxiety, my dad was talking to an old flame, I was in a long committed relationship with my childhood sweetheart, and my sister was graduating high school.

Then my sister went to college and met someone I’ll call P.

He seemed okay albeit…a bit extreme when it came to politics 

But he treated my sister amazingly. Someone had finally seen her for how wonderful she was. I was thrilled!

He later revealed how manipulative, egotistical, and self-righteous he was once he moved into an apartment my sister, fiancé, and I had rented with the help of our father (who moved in with his new love! Yay!)

Here are some of the things P did while we lived together:

• He felt entitled to the master room that me and my soon to be fiancée rented because he wanted to start a family
• He accused my dad of committing tax fraud
•He invited his mother without notice (who would make inappropriate comments about my fiancé )
•He left common areas filthy and called me controlling when I asked for them to clean up after themselves 
•He accused me of abusing my fiancé and tried to get him to leave me….twice
•They both smoked “Herbs” inside without a medical card
•They BOUGHT A DOG without informing the apartment or us
•They then left said dog in a crate most of the time or let her chew and defecate on the new couch my fiancé bought so we could sit somewhere other than the floor
•They became upset when we stopped letting the dog on the couch because of the reasons above
•He called a family meeting because I was a “Neat Freak” (I just don’t like pet excrement left on the floor, dishes pilled up high, and trash everywhere.)
•THEY ATTEMPTED TO BREAK DOWN OUR BEDROOM DOOR ON OUR 2ND ANNIVERSARY 

That’s just a small portion of what he did while we were under the same roof….and she was okay with it all…even his previous arrest.

You see, P was arrested for distributing disgusting content and pictures.

(This was before meeting my sister and he was let go even after admitting he didn’t think what he had done was illegal. He only spent a small amount of time in jail)

This was only uncovered after a family member confronted me in private at a birthday party for my younger cousin. 

I wish I read the affidavit sooner instead of believing he was falsely accused as he insisted… but it took me a few months to muster up the courage. 

The images were found on his social media in his DMs. The affidavit I read made me want to vomit. I was beyond mortified thinking I lived with someone like that.

Everyone cut them off. My dad blocked them and told us about the hell hole they were living in ( dirty diapers, bugs, trash pilled high with old cans in reach of a baby)

I only saw them once more when my dad passed away this year from a stroke. 

I had to beg my sister to visit my dad before he went off life support.

She didn’t show up to his memorial.

She demanded sentimental belongings she wasn’t entitled to.

I don’t think I’ll ever forgive her, though I still wish her happiness.

Not P though. 

I now live in an amazing home with my husband and daughter. I got my GED and am enrolled in college where I’ll be studying to get my bachelor’s in early childhood education. I’ll hold my childhood memories close to my heart and will surround myself with items of great sentimental value….But I will always say that I’m an only child if anyone asks.",I’m a self proclaimed only child and couldn’t be happier,18lrzuj,1702956487.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lrzuj/im_a_self_proclaimed_only_child_and_couldnt_be/,
"Forgive my bad structuring, I just want to be able to finally tell someone who might care more than the people around me  
I can't pinpoint the exact date, but it was a couple months before I got a Nintendo Wii U for Christmas before it all started. I was five at the time, born in 2007, I found that at home; my brother was the only one to keep me company. My mother would always be watching something boring on the tv or be doing her make up and my sister . However, my brother always seemed to be free and made time for me. At one point, I found that things were getting odd. He would show me things like porn whether it be pictures of his or his friend's penises, hentai, or literally just porn hub. Obviously, I wouldn't know at the time how bad that actually is and just went along with it not paying much mind to it. Until one day, my life wouldn't be the same. He called me into his room, it was late at night and my parents were home but they were in their bedroom. The moment he remove his lower clothing, I knew something was wrong from all the times I got told not to show that part to anyone, however, he was my brother, and being a gullible and too trusting kid I was, I did whatever he told me to. It originally started out with just hands until it escalated to oral and all the way up to anal penetration which have all permanently etched themselves in my memory.  
Being the kid I was, I just went on with it cause I had no fucking idea what was going on and thought it was normal! As much as I don't want to write this, I did the same to others. I remember touching others inappropriately in I think second to third grade. I had many encounters with others whether it'd be in the stalls, on a bus, in a classroom, or even at their home to mostly boys who were in my grade. I inflicted the same pain my brother gave me unknowingly unto others and I abominate myself for it.   
Eventually, he stopped by the time I was around seven, meaning he raped me almost every month for around two whole years.   
And after that... well.. I never really thought about it again until I was \~12 when it struck me. I was getting ready to go to a boy scout summer camp trip to Virginia and thought it about there. I came back home after a week there and took a couple months before finally telling them. They were only slightly shocked. They talked about the situation in front of me, telling me that they'd do something and get it settled, but nothing ever happened. It was revealed to me later that the same thing happened to my older sister since they were around the same age and got curious, I suppose. From the way I heard it, it sounded like my brother was the one who instigated it and was the one who ultimately ended up rubbing himself on her. I vividly remember them telling me they'll at least talk to them, but not a word was ever said until recently. A couple weeks ago, my family and I were getting ready to go take pictures for Christmas in like a studio or something. I recall all the times I took pictures and how my brother was there. I always tried to suppress my anger when I thought of him simply for my parents cause they ""love"" me, right? It'd just do it for them, for their photos or memories and such then just look away from him. And I was sick of it. I told them I'm not going if he's going and I went to my room. Shortly after, my brother came over and, I don't exactly remember what he said, but it was something along the lines of ""I'm not going, so you can go."" which I didn't hear at the time cause I'm afraid of him. Every time I go near him, just pure fucking adrenaline releases and my anger wells up inside of me. The only words I could respectfully utter in that moment was ""Get out of my room."" before he came in and flipped my desk with my computer, monitor, and all that shit on it. I know it may sound unbelievable but he then came in and started saying he'll kill me in which he charged out of the room and my parents followed. In that moment, my anger reached an all time paramount and I finally decided to confront him about what he did just for him to shout ""What are you talking about"" as if it never even happened. Things settled down and I talked to my parents in their bedroom, confronting them once again about what happened after getting the other stuff out of the way.  
They said they wouldn't do anything because they have no idea what to do and because he brings a lot of money into the family. And that they won't do anything because they're his son and he'll always be their son no matter what.  
In that moment, my entire world just fucking fell apart; I knew I could never trust anyone in my family again. I realized that my parents never truly ever had my back. And for insight on the money part, he's a drug dealer so you can imagine how much he makes.  
Before this, I actively started consuming child porn at the age of 13 and i also well, to put it lightly, committed bestiality frequently with my dogs. as fucked up as it is, i even tried with a couple month old pup. I don't recall exactly why, but it made me feel as if I were getting back at others for what they did to me. And fuck I don't want to say this but occasionally go back, It's been a week or two since I last did it and for transparency, it's not saved locally. I still hate myself, won't forgive myself for what I watched, did, and experienced. However, I feel that getting this out there will help me on a journey of recovery. There's not a single day I don't think about what happened and what I did to others and genuinely contemplate suicide everyday. I feel like a worthless, hideous speck on this earth that just deserves to disappear. I have no friends, no one I can trust, or rely on.  
I never wanted to end up like this.   
I'm sorry if you despise me for this and I'm sorry if you'll never forgive me for actions I did on my part. I'm sorry. I became the thing I hated most in my life. I just want to move on and forget.   
I'm only writing this now cause my sister turned on me as well. I had all my motivation stripped since the realization at 12 and found that my only respite in this world was online, spending time on videos, visual novels, single-player games. What happened ruined me socially. I find that I can't even talk in multiplayer games and even just being in one makes me feel like I have a fever; thinking I'll be somehow judged or looked down upon for what happened even though that isn't really feasible. Back to what happened, I got told to do a single chore today, which I did but there was a misunderstanding. I left the chore supplies exactly how I found it which caused her and my mom to believe I didn't do it. I was in my room when I heard my sister say ""He can't even do one task, he sits in his room all day doing nothing and he can't even feed the dogs."" and my mother follows up with ""I know."" This isn't the first instance of them bad nothing me behind my back, but it really just seems like I'm not welcome in this family and I genuinely just want to go. I can't believe how my mom demands apologies after small remarks when I get carried away cause I'm always silent in class, bottling up everything I want to say cause no one would want to hear a pitiful human like me talk. I don't understand how ignorant someone can be.. does she not know what I'm going through?  
On top of all this, my parents told me they were almost ""molested"" as children as if to belittle me. They had and have full power over this situation as he still lives in the house. They MUST know how it feels, but they do nothing.   
My brother still lives in this house, he's currently in his early thirties. Which means he was 19 when he started raping me, a five year old.  
I don't know what else to add. I only lightly touched on the topic and I don't know if my last comment i make should be thank you for reading or please forgive me for my deplorable acts.

"My (18m) sister (23f) has been dating her boyfriend (28m) for around a year and a half, and recently, she has been telling me that he hates being with him and that he’s a piece of shit. We were planning to go to a festival in Las Vegas that costs $1300 dollars in total and she paid for it. Now, boyfriend has the tickets in his account and is telling her that if she breaks up with him, he will not give her the tickets. He buys her a ton of stuff that its straight up ridiculous, from plushies to her medicine. I call her everyday at night to see where she is and when she’s coming home because I hate being home alone. I trust her a lot and she trusts me a lot too. During this call I ask why she is still hanging out with him if she talks bad about him everyday. She just brushes it off and a few minutes later, she calls me again and asks “what did you say in the call just now?” in a shaky voice and the boyfriend just starts yelling at her super bad and I get scared, then the phone hangs up. I try to call her back but no answer. She calls me back again a few seconds later and tells me that she was staying in the relationship with the boyfriend for me because she cares about me and wants me to go to the festival with her. She goes on that she stayed with him to go to a previous concert we went to last month. I tell her that I don’t care about the tickets if her safety is an issue. She tells me that she was safe and she knows that she is indecisive and makes dumb mistakes. She says that it is about being able to go to the festival and not having her money go to waste.

"Before I start, I would like to make something very clear: I was not abused or harmed in any way, and I do not have any evidence of anyone being abused or harmed in any way. 

All persons and institutions are Roman Catholic unless otherwise stated. 

This summer my parents started the process to enroll my sister in Confirmation Preparation at the church we attended. My sister (who I will refer to as ""Amy"") would have been the 3rd kid from our house to do so. However, they wanted to know the following:

1. The names of any and all teachers who would be teaching. 

Very demanding, I know. 

The church refused. The director of religious education (DRE) lied about things, not only in dealing with my sister but when my brother was in it too. She lied about things she said, things which we're going on, and basically tried to pit my parents against each other. Idk about you, but that's fucked up. 

Anyway, the climax was when my parents had a phone call with the DRE and asked her a lot of questions, basically wanting to know names, what type of heads up they would get about sexual topics (which in the past were none existent) and other issues. I think we can all agree that the church should be as transparent as humanly possible when it comes to sex, because of the rape which was covered up. 

Eventually, my parents were fed up and enrolled my sister without knowing the teachers names. They were pissed. I wouldn't have signed her up but that was their circus. The night before her first class, the DRE finally revealed the names. The reason she couldn't reveal the names changed at least a couple times. 

My parents then sent an email in which they stated each and every of their concerns and complaints in a straightforward manner. No one was attacked, just pure, simple facts. 

The pastor then sent a reply in which he said ""you guys are abusive, you have been since I met you, you are complaining about things which no one else ever has, and you have to apologize in person or else your daughter is banned from our program""

We don't go there anymore, something I wanted to do for about 6 months. 

This is when it gets fun. My parents were extremely dismayed by this, and sent an email to the Vicar general. For those not familiar with the power structure of the Catholic Church, the Bishop is at the top of the hierarchy, and the Vicar general is number 2. He ignored it. Not even a response. Literally ""go fuck yourself"" would have been better. 

My concern lies with the lying and the apathy with the diocese when presented with hard evidence of the lying. That says to me that there is something seriously wrong. My uncle, a cop for 25 years now, agrees, because ""that's his experience dealing with unsavory types""

This whole thing has made me untrusting of any institutional power. 

Therefore, it is my belief that the diocese I live in, the diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana, is corrupt. I may have seen an early warning sign to a black swan which will devistate many. I will not share which church specifically was involved for privacy. 

Thanks for reading, and fuck dishonesty.",It is my fear that the diocese in which I live in will soon be exposed for covering up abuse,18lrsej,1702955845.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lrsej/it_is_my_fear_that_the_diocese_in_which_i_live_in/,
"I do not care for SIL (23F) whatsoever, due to past comments about my husband (30M) and I’s (28F) ability/ willingness to have children. She’s only been involved in the family for two years and her and my BIL (28M) are on their second child together. BIL has an additional child from a previous relationship as well, so 2.5 kids atm.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years. Met in college and have worked our asses off to get our degrees and get to the point in our careers where we were comfortable before having children.

SIL has made comments in the past about how my husband doesn’t want to have children with me and that’s why we still don’t have any. She’s immature and so rude. I avoid her like the plague now whenever DH and I visit the in laws. On top of her general attitude, she’s verbally and emotionally abusive to my nephew (from previous relationship). 

I was just waiting for her to say something this year, and she finally did. She asked in a sarcastic tone how many more years it would be until we give her kids cousins. I just said “I don’t know” and I thought that would be the end of it. Nope. She went on about how we’re taking so long and how they’re going to be enjoying their retirement sooner than we will. So I just told her a little about my life. How I enjoy being able to travel whenever we want (just got back from Thailand), how I want for nothing, and how I can afford to do pretty much anything I want because we don’t have kids yet. We went to school and worked hard to be able to get the jobs that have allowed us to become so well off. Do I feel bad? Only a little… 

She changed her tune as soon as I finished my monologue. She started explaining that she’s never wanted to travel and she’s scared of planes anyway, blah, blah, blah. And in the same breath she says that she wants more kids. I just bit my tongue but I wanted so badly to explain to her that the more kids she has, the longer from retirement they are.

It just seems like she’s constantly trying to compete with us but we’re in different spots in life so it’s not really a comparable situation. If she wants to compete though, she’s not going to be very happy with what I have to say…",SIL made snarky comment about when my husband and I will be having kids so I finally clapped back.,18lrs3f,1702955819.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lrs3f/sil_made_snarky_comment_about_when_my_husband_and/,

"Hi, I'm 22 female and I feel like I'll never have friends again. My childhood was shit, I was sexually and physically abused by my brother for 6 years, was bullied in school and then became a bully (Ive now apologized to people I've bullied). I was always the type to just have one friend in school instead of groups and I did, but those friends are gone now, one of them simply stopped talking to me, the other offered to meet but never showed up and then we never spoke again. 

Duo to my trauma, I developed bipolar disorder, but before I was diagnosed I was going crazy. At this time I was still being abused and the only way I saw out was suicide so I attempted. I survived, but they've misdiagnosed me and I got worse and attempted again. I survived again and was diagnosed with bipolar. These suicide attempts made me lose another friend who got mad at me for not telling her that I was suicidal even tho I didn't tell anyone coz I wanted it to work, but I did tell her I was struggling. I tried to rekindle our friendship coz we considered each other best friends but she remained angry. 

Anyways, when I was in the mental hospital I made some friends, good friends, I could talk to them about anything but we simply don't talk unless I message. It always has to be me and that hurts. 

Fast forward to last year I finally became a part of a friend group. Iam studying in a different country and a girl that I knew back from my home country had invited me to live with her and some other people in a shared house. I was thrilled, I agreed ofc and everything was going amazing. They even put a birthday party for me (Shrek themed lmao) and we had parties often and I finally felt like I have people to care about and they cared about me but I feel like I was wrong. 

One guy from that group I was quite good friends with and keep contact with him but I have to initiate conversations too. Another person is the girl that invited me to live with her, I feel like she has something against me and won't tell me. I found out that she cheated on her bf with the guy I mentioned before but I didn't tell anyone but distanced myself from her. As far as I know, she doesn't know that I know. Anyways, not long ago I was so desperate to have friends that I contacted her asking what happened and she said nothing and that we simply drifted apart but we can get closer again. So we kept making dates to meet up and it kept failing, either from my side or her. Now she deactivated most of her social media out of nowhere so I messaged her where she hadn't asking what happened with her socials and she just left me on seen which I found really hurtful..  like, why can't you just say couple words and I'll fuck off... 

Besides these two people, the rest people in the house I just never became close with no matter what, ig I'm just not likeable enough. Apart from that, I became good friends with one guy, we kept messaging, he even called himself my new brother but then he just stopped talking to me out of nowhere and when I asked what happened he just said nothing and last time that I saw him it seemed like I'm suddenly just an acquaintance. Then I became friends with another guy, he was going through a break up so he would rant to me and I'd rant to him about my toxic experiences from the past and we became pretty good friends but again, just stopped talking. 

Anyways, I'm not all alone, I have an amazing boyfriend, he has some male friends and they send each other memes, chat everyday, play games online and I just find myself feeling so sad and kinda jealous.. 

I feel like it's impossible for me to keep people at all and I don't understand why. I'm not introverted, when I go out I talk to people, I easily get their socials and try to keep contact, either by message or sending a meme or smth but it never turns into friendship, I don't get invited to meet up or anything, ever. They always say shit like ""yeah yeah sure"" just for ir to never happen. And I'm so tired of making a friend who open up to me and everything and it seems like they're truly enjoying talking to me just for them to suddenly go quiet and then later say that nothing happened?? 

I think maybe I'm the problem. Not funny enough, not charismatic enough, don't have enough crazy stories, too weirdl??? But then... I know people who are like that and yet everyone loves them.. they get invited to hang out, and get messages all the time from them. 

And yet I'm just this human trash. This doormat whom if doesn't engage, then not worth engaging in... it makes me so depressed sometimes, especially when I think about getting married, birthdays, even my funeral..I feel like I won't have anyone to show up, no matter what. 

I'm just so fucking tired, how do I make/keep friends?? I just want people to hang out with, share stories with, support them, feel needed, be a shoulder to cry on.","I feel like it's impossible to keep people and I don't understand why..

I (31F) have been together with my husband (32M) for 10 years, married for one year. Things are going pretty bad in our lives at the moment and it has affected how I feel about my husband and my perspective of him as a person. 


For context, my husband quit his job to pursue other things which I was supportive of. However, two weeks after quitting his job, he fractured both his legs pretty bad which put us in a tight spot financially to the point we had to borrow funds from friends and family members. We managed to get him the surgery he needs and get him home. While all this is happening, I am having troubles of my own with my job delaying my pay for almost two weeks each pay (i get paid bi-weekly). This all went to a head about two months after my husband’s surgery when my boss told us that the company is going under all while still owing us money. So essentially, my husband and I are effectively unemployed with debts and bills coming up, all of which I’m paying for with my savings. This situation has caused a huge rift on our relationship to the point that my husband’s lowkey blaming me for the whole thing. 


He’s been saying downright rude and hurtful things to me like he wishes this wasn’t his life, how he regrets everything that led him to this point, how our relationship have ruined him, etc etc. He’s saying all these hurtful things to me while I slave away caring for him, preparing his meals, cleaning up after him, paying for everything (food, bills, rent, debt repayment) with my own savings that I’ve had way before we got married. I tried to be understanding since he’s recovering and I know that he’s mostly just bored since he can’t function normally but I am at my last rope. What’s throwing me off is when he’s in a good mood, he shows me the man I married. He makes me laugh, cuddles with me, talks about our future in a positive light, tells me all about how the best is yet to come and shit. But when he’s in his bad moods, he lashes out like what I wrote above. I can’t take these mood swings anymore but at the same time I am so so scared of leaving. I know I have to leave but I have severe attachment issues that’s impeding my judgement. I love the security and stability being in a long-term relationship affords me but I can’t take being blamed and being treated like shit. It’s come to the point that I have feelings of resentment towards him. I know that I am going to be carrying this experience and the way he made me feel with me my whole life.


I really don’t know what to do at this point but venting about it in this way is sort of therapeutic. (Also, english is not my first language and I don’t live in the US so sorry for any errors.

She sends me like one snap a day, when I text her about plans sometimes she takes a whole day to respond. I do still see her maybe 2 times a month tho. What really has me upset is when it comes to occasions she doesn’t try much to make plans with me but instead her and her bf will join her older brothers friends. I texted her asking if she’d want to spend new years together and it took her 2 days to tell me that her and her bf r going to her brothers gfs party. Which is the same thing she told me last year.

"Excuse the low karma, new acc because people I know IRL found my old one.
You read the tag -and if you didn’t, go back and read it- you can probably tell what this is about. 
I (FtM 14) struggled with bad mental health since as long as I can remember, it’s never been easy, especially considering how I was bullied at every single school I’ve gone to, but it was always manageable, at least when I was younger.
Once puberty started to hit it was like there was a switch that flipped in my brain, I knew I was different already (never really liked my body, hated dresses and makeup and Barbies, you get the gist) but the second that I started “developing” I was inconsolable. I tried a bunch of stuff to reverse it, not eating, working out, buzzing my hair, buying shady pills off wish… nothing worked, duh, that’s just how puberty works. 
I started genuinely struggling with suicidal ideation once I hit 11/12. Most people (aka everyone I knew at the time) just put it down to hormonal changes and normal teen anxt. 
That was until I tried to kill myself a couple months before I turned 13. Then at least the message got through to my mom (my dad still hasn’t excepted it, he’s religious and stuff.. whatever) 
Anyway! To cut to the chase, I was put on a one year waiting list for children’s mental health services. To be honest I needed immediate help but even the thought of getting help and being able to maybe even get medication to help was just enough to keep my head above water. It wasn’t just raidio silence, there were a couple interviews to make sure I was still a “priority” so at least there was that.
After the year I was allowed to meet up with this mental health counsellor, I have weekly meetings bar holidays or times I’ve been sick. The thing is is that despite me telling her basically all about my life, she only wants to focus on my school life (arguably the bleakest subject matter in the world, I go to an all girl’s catholic school where I’m just treated as the school’s token lgbt kid, not the best but idc). 
I decided to ask her at my last session weather or not our meetings have been enough for me to possibly be considered for a dysphoria diagnosis, to which she replied verbatim ‘Oh, I don’t do that stuff’, I asked her to elaborate on “stuff” and as it turns out; she isn’t licensed to give any mental health diagnostics nor is she willing to connect me to anyone who could possibly offer those services as she feeling uncomfortable with someone my age talking to someone like that; she’s just here so I can have a “friend to talk to about family and school” and that ‘doors to that form of care would start to open once I turned eighteen.’
WHAT?! 
I don’t know if I’m just overreacting or just being and easily triggered snowflake or whatever but the realisation that I have been fed false hope for the past I don’t even know how long is far more than enough to genuinely trow me into another episode.
I’m so screwed, I can barely deal with my body how it is, and I hate to think about it in four years or however long it’ll take (the average waiting time in my country for adults seeking this kinda stuff is 10-12 years, so minim 28 when I get this stuff.)
I don’t even know what to do, I really don’t wanna relapse but my life feels meaningless at the best of times, and this is certainly not the best of times. 
I don’t even know if I’ll be able to get better if I have to wait that long. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

"There’s this woman I met at a club months ago. I’ve seen her at this club about four or five times since then. The last three or four times I saw her I would greet her and we would dance together. However the last time I saw her she didn’t want to dance with me. She didn’t seem that interested in talking either. I never really talked to her that much or got her number but she always seemed excited to dance with me. 

I also see her at this bar that I go to and now I just feel so frustrated. I kinda don’t want to go to that bar anymore because I don’t want to see her there or at that club. She was walking past me and she wasn’t even going to say hi or wave at me. I just said hi as she was almost done walking by and she waved, but I don’t think she was going to. 

Maybe she kinda liked me at first but she doesn’t seem to like me anymore and I just want to get over her. What can I do to stop thinking about her so much? 

When I saw her I hugged her and she smiled. I tried to get behind her and hold her waist that night on the dance floor and she just walked away from me. I just don’t want to think about her anymore.

"When I (F20) was born, I had an underdeveloped brain, which led to complications that nearly killed me. I lived, obviously. But I've had a realization about what would have happened if I had not lived.

I'll start with the fact that my parents were never married, and they separated when I was around 2 years old with split custody, which is an important detail. My mother has told me many times that I saved her life. And I was the reason my father and stepmother met in person for the first time. My father needed to buy cold medicine for me, but wouldn't have the money leftover for cigarettes. My stepmother offered to give him some of her cigarettes so he could focus on getting medicine for me.

Had I not survived my complications when I was born, my mother may not be here anymore. My father may have never met my stepmother in person and later married her. My mother may have never found another man to marry (though, that turned down a rather complicated route that I won't explain here). And as a result of all of those factors, my siblings would not have been here.

It's weird. I went through a few years where I believed that my existence in the world was insignificant. I was just one person in a vast universe. What did I matter? But then I started thinking about all of this and I realized that, while I may not have impacted the whole world, I impacted my mother and father's lives greatly. I impacted the chances of my siblings being here today. I impacted so many things in my small area of life, and it made me realize that I'm not as insignificant as I used to believe.

I encourage everyone to think about this. Think about how you might have impacted the lives around you. Think about the little stuff, like when you helped that random person on that random day, or complimented that random person's hair, or smiled at a random person passing by. You might have just made their whole day ten times better. Think about how you leave an impact not on the whole world, but rather on your small area of life. And I hope you'll find that you're not insignificant, either.",I've had a Realization About Myself and I Can't Stop Thinking About It,18lqa9u,1702951398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lqa9u/ive_had_a_realization_about_myself_and_i_cant/,
"There’s so much backstory as to why he’s blocked but my ex was a narcissist so that should paint a basic picture.

Today I learned that Apple will still let people you’ve blocked call you and be able to leave voicemails. My ex did this a few weeks ago but I didn’t notice until today. I don’t normally get voicemails from the spam calls I reject, but today I did and that’s how I found out. You don’t get notifications about it whatsoever, they just appear apparently.

My ex didn’t leave anything other than a second of dead air and I know *exactly* why he did it too. Mind games were his favorite and knowing that I would see the voicemail probably made him happy.

I don’t have his number saved but he’s the only person I know with the area code, so of course it was him. I even double checked he was still in my blocked list, which he is, and the numbers are the same.

So today’s been high anxiety but also, I’m livid. He’s not been in my life for over 2 years. I don’t know why he would be trying to get to me other than he lost all of the other girls he was screwing, so he thinks he can hit me up?? Anybody got logic for it??

"As the title says, I'm in love with my best friend. It's weird because we met when we were both dating other people and bonded over being in love. But both of our love lives went to complete another shit and we got even closer. We hang out all the time, we eat together, talk about everything together, and he's the person that at the end of the day I think about.

But what really sucks in the scenario is I know he will never love me back. At least in the way that I love him. He has said I love you but platonically or I love you like my little sister. And I know that's the truth so I know I will never have a chance with him which really hurts, because I thought I loved him like a brother until two days ago.

I realized he's the person I think of when I wake up and when I go to bed. I realized I want to see him every day. I realized I would give anything to make him smile. I realized I want to hug him and hold him anytime I see him and bring him as much joy as he has brought me. I want him to realize his hopes and his dreams in life. I realized he is my safe space in this world and is the person that probably knows the most true and honest form of me. I have been the most of myself I have ever been with anyone in this entire world has been when I've been around him. And I know I can never tell him that. 

I love him in a way that I have never loved another person because I know he does not love me in that way. I know it will break him if he finds out. I know I'm going to have to keep the secret either to my grave or to his, which is probably sooner than I think. For contacts I also found out I might be dying soon. 

I found out I have a genetic condition and as long as I have meds I'll probably be okay. But sometime in my life I will start showing signs of organ failure of which I can't get a transplant because of a different genetic disorder. So I know I for sure have a shortened lifespan compared to other people. I've also cried more over the fact that I realized that I can't tell him that I'm in love with him than the fact that I will be dying young and probably very painfully.

And none of you should worry. I've made peace with the fact that I was going to die young. I have a bucket list, I have hopes and dreams in life and I think it can complete it with the time I have left.

"I, 29 male, am married to my wife, 27 female. She is the love of my life and we have been together since 8th grade. We never had any problems until recently. My wife has always been big on wanting to wait to have sex until marriage. I have always had a pretty high sex drive but I complied to her wishes nonetheless. We were fine until after our honeymoon when we tried it for the first time. We were at our house watching a movie when things started to get heated. I tried to put it in but she started crying. I was really worried so I immediately stopped and asked what was wrong. She said that it was hurting her, and she pointed at my dick which was barely even in. You could still see the tip. I was in disbelief and asked if she was serious. This made her cry even more. I admit I was very annoyed and told her that I waited over 10 years to have sex with her and she couldn't even give me that. I said that if she couldn't provide me with some sort of pleasure for me then we need a divorce. I gave her the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. When I woke up the next morning, she wasn't laying beside me. I called her name but there was no response. I checked my phone and saw that she had sent me a message saying she was going to stay with her sister for a while. I felt very bad, but I feel like our relationship has been a waste of time because I've waited to spread my seed into her but now I can't even do that.

"I (M26) can't believe I am related to a monster like my father, and I need to write this down somewhere. Recently, I learned that my father (M60) has been cheating on my mother (f59) for the entire length of their marriage with many different women. For the last year, he has been lying about his cheating and claimed that he was only ever with a single woman. This week, we learned this was a lie. I need to start with this first affair as if it helps to show a pattern. Also, the title is not a typo, as there were numerous affairs.  


  
About a year ago, my mother was cleaning out our house for a move when she discovered lies about where my father had been and with whom. In particular, she saw a lot of references to one certain woman. My mother confronted him about this and eventually forced him to admit that he had been having a two-year affair with this woman. The affair was both physical and emotional at the same time. My father had promised this woman that he loved her; he proposed marriage to this woman while still married and wanted to be a father to her kids. Instead of divorcing my mother, he planned to get everything in his name, including the house (not sure how he planned this), and then divorce my mother before telling us both to leave home for good. He and this woman had planned things out and might have succeeded if my mother had not caught him.

When we learned about this, we were shocked since we all thought the marriage was strong until then. I defended my father countless times by saying, ""Oh, he's a good person at heart,"" I am still horrified to admit that. When he was caught, he continued to lie but would only admit to things over voice when my mother caught him in lies. Eventually, we both forced him to put everything into writing, and the story continued. First, this woman was the love of his life, and then he would call her all sorts of names since he thought my mother wanted to hear that. Then he told this ridiculous lie about how my brother had met this woman, and my brother had declared her to ""look like a queen."" Then, he swore that they were soulmates and admitted to talking about how awful my mother and I were as people. Father claimed that he had broken all ties with her and would never contact her again. He managed to convince his therapist that he was cured, and eventually, my mother let him back into our lives because she wanted to keep our family together, and we tried to move on.

Getting to last week, that same nagging doubt began to creep back into both my and my mother's heads. Something was wrong, and we had to look into this. So, my mother asked him again about a few things, and the gates opened. Not only had he lied and continued talking to his work affair woman, but he had started another affair with his high school girlfriend. This woman was another love of his life, and he had set up a meeting through Facebook to ""get together"" in a different state. My mother was furious, and my brain told me there was more. So, my mother continued to dig and discovered so much more.

From what we have gathered, my father has been cheating either with one woman or multiple women for the entire length of their marriage. The guess is that there have been around 20-30 separate affairs over the last forty years. There has never been a period where he was faithful to my mother, and this includes when I was born. I just learned this today, but my father was forced to admit that on the day I was born, he was not in the delivery room but off having sex with my aunt. That is correct. While I was being born, my father knew that my mother was in labor and chose to have sex with his wife's sister while his wife gave birth to their first child. The affair with my mother's sister (she is no aunt to me) went on for nearly twelve years and had both pregnancy scares and my father proposing to her. They would sneak off during family gatherings to be together.

That news broke me in ways I did not know I could feel. Some small part of me had hoped that this man loved me even a bit, but he couldn't even take the time to be there to be present for my birth. He had chosen his affair with his sister-in-law over his child. Now, I don't have a father or extended family since my grandmother (dead) had known about the affair and kept quiet.

I think I am writing this more to describe what I've seen. My father is an uncaring monster of a human being, and I don't think I can ever trust people again. I trusted him, and now he's hurt my mother and me again.

"I'll try to start at the beginning and keep some structure but it's kind of hard because it all feels surreal and it's very fresh. I am only posting here because I can not talk to anyone in my real life about this.

&amp;#x200B;

People involved:

Me (34m),   
Ana - fake name (f26).

About 7 years ago I was introduced to Ana by a common aquaintance because she had expressed interest in being dominated and the acquaintance knew that was my kind of thing.

Ana at the time was actively feminist and as such very torn between her desire to fight for equality while at the same time giving up power to a man and so we agreed to take it slow and we took it slower than than most regular couples. As in it took us 6 month before we had full blown sex for the first time. 

At this point neither of us considered it  a romantic relationship. We were building trust and I guided her to explore that side of hers. Even when she eventually agreed to a ""total power exchange"" type of deal, we kept it strictly about her learning to be obedient and exploring some of her more physical kinks. She would sometimes ghost me to figure things out on her own for a few days if she felt uncomfortable with boundary we touched or pushed but ultimately she always wanted to move forward.

So we did and we got to a point where she had a thrice daily mantra about her purpose being to serve me and her giving up most boundaries and being happier and more content than she had ever been. At this point our relationship was still about trust and obedience, not romantic love.

This went on for a while, she moved in with me and to the outside we started presenting as a normal romantic relationship and eventually we did develop romantic feelings which added another layer to our relationship and one neither of us had wanted, expected or thought ourselves to be capable of but we enjoyed it for the past 4 years. She asked me not to go easy on her and keep up her rewards and punishments and to keep pushing her boundaries which we did.

During all this time I made sure that she had enough room to keep a social life and contact with friends and family because I was wary of isolating her.

Today I figured out that one of the days when she was supposedly at a hangout at the home of one of her friends, that friend was actually at a party and when I confronted her with it, she told me she had been falling out of love with me for the last 6 months and gone to parties/clubs a few times when I thought she was having a girls night at her friends place.

We did what we always do and talked and somehow we ended the romantic part of our relationship but we are sticking with the obedience, power exchange and living together and if her feelings come back that's good but not necessary for her to stay.

So now I am grieving a relationship that is unchanged on the face of it and to everyone outside of the relationship but feels broken to me? I don't know how to deal with it because I do feel responsible for her because I am the one who broke her normal relationship compass and if she gets into a new relationship with someone who abuses her, it would feel like my fault?

Plus I am not sure, I can find new love anyway because she was only the second woman in my life I felt these feelings towards so maybe I just stick with it?

"Hey, everyone! Long-time lurker here, but this is my first post, so apologies in advance if the formatting is off.  
  
I have arthrogryposis, also known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). It's a physical disability that severely restricts movement in joints, causing deformities. I have deformed feet and hands. AMC has no known causes or cure, and if you're born with it, there's a slim 0.03% chance.  
  
I'm 19M, finishing my last year of high school. I live in a shitty Eastern European country in a family burdened by debt from my numerous operations. Due to our abysmal healthcare system, all my corrective surgeries had to be done in other countries and paid out of pocket. I've undergone 14 operations in total, and after years of physical therapy, I gained the ability to walk a significant accomplishment for someone with AMC.  
  
I finished primary school with excellent marks, thanks to accommodating teachers who understood my situation. I had extra time for exams and consistently received straight A's. I got accepted into a prestigious high school, similar to preparatory schools in the US. Unfortunately, this school lacks an understanding of my disability, resulting in mediocre grades at best. While I know the material, I struggle with written tests. Living in a country with no laws protecting disabled people, they have no obligation to accommodate my needs.  
  
Recently, I faced some hard truths. It's time to explore college options, but with my mediocre grades, I have little hope of securing a scholarship (as my country only offers merit scholarships). I can't afford full tuition. I'm stuck. Also recently I tried to take the driving test because I can drive now, but I couldn't pass the theoretical part of the driving test. Despite learning everything from A to Z, I couldn't write it down in a timely manner. This killed me. I have such a passion for cars be it driving them or simply working on them. This may sound dumb but one of my biggest dreams was buying a project car and restoring it and now I guess that dream also died.  
  
This has been a tough realization for me. I've tried so hard to achieve what able-bodied people take for granted, and now it feels like I've hit a dead end. I've been extremely depressed lately; everything seems to have hit me all at once. I don't know what to do now.

"Six years ago I had stage breast cancer. It was not an aggressive one, but for 3 weeks, between the day my doctor told me I had cancer and the day I met the oncologist, I didn’t know the stage I was and if the odds were in my favor. 

For 3 weeks, I would sometimes just burst in tears looking at my kids, who were 6 at the time. I kept thinking how young they were and how I wanted to be there for them for as long as I could. I was heartbroken at the idea I might be leaving them so soon!

I was very lucky: early stage, non agressive.

There was this boy in my kids grade, not a friend of my twins who are girls and couldn’t care less about him. His mom also had have cancer. We chatted once at a birthday party in the spring, we ended up talking about the disease because I complimented her edgy hair cut, but it was her hair growing back from chemo. She was a lovely woman. 

Her cancer came back in the summer and killed her within a month.

I took me a year but I reached out to their dad, asked him if I could hang out with his boys sometimes. 

It’s been 5 years now that they’re in my life and I’m in theirs. I go make dinner for them when their dad is working late. I sometimes take them to the movies, the theater, to eat out etc.

I love them so, so much. They are amazing young men, so resilient, responsible, and adorable. They get along with my kids too so we sometimes do stuff all together. They wouldn’t be in my life if I had not had cancer, and so I’m grateful for this happening to me.

Every time I kiss my fiancé when she’s within eyesight range, whether it’s the cheek, the forehead, the lips, or anywhere else, she’ll do a little shout and say something like, “No! Stop! Step away!”. I thought it was cute and silly at first, but the more time she spent around us, the more it seemed like it really bothered her.

It came to the point where when we riding in the car with her, while my fiancé was driving, and I’d sit in the front seat with him, she wouldn’t let me hold his hand. When I’m in the car with my fiancé literally any time, I like to put my hand on his lap, and if he doesn’t need to use his right hand to drive in that moment, he’ll hold my hand. His aunt definitely wouldn’t let me to that either. It pisses me off that she can’t see him as an adult in that regard.

Other than her acting this way around us, me and her get along just fine. We take shots together at family parties, and I love when she cooks with my mother-in-law, and I try my best to let her know that I love and appreciate her food. I keep reading stories about toxic mother-in-laws, and she’s not to that level, as far as I know. I guess I just want to know if this is something I should worry about, or even bring up.

"I am the eldest in our family ( teen ), I have two younger siblings one of them being the youngest (6). I seriously can't take it anymore. 

She has always been rude, disrespectful, whiny, bratty, always gets something from the store. It pisses me off. Because she always complains about things. For example she throws tantrums when my parents say no. 
Sometimes my brother makes a joke ( not involving her ), and she takes it personally? She begins to scream and yell. 
She talks in a baby way etc. 
She has said: "" If you don't do this for me I will scratch myself. ""
This concerns me a lot. Idk where that came from and when I tell my parents they tell her "" Don't say that. You're crazy. ""
I've tried telling my parents about it but they say: "" She looks up to you, she is the youngest, try to understand. ""
And it makes me feel invalidated. It's not fair. I seriously can't take her tantrums anymore. I've had angry outbursts because she won't stop bothering me or crying. I don't know what else to do, I've tried talking to her nicely but she doesn't listen.

"I (18F) have been going through a really tough time lately and I have gone back to self-harming, and it's taken a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend (18M). He's always known about it and used to be supportive, but things took a turn recently. He asked me to promise him to never hurt myself again, and when I said that I didn’t know if I could promise anything - he made me promise anyway. I understand that  I hurt him so bad when I hurt myself, and trust me, I am not proud of it.

A few days ago I had a breakdown and confided in him about how I felt worthless and disgusting, that I didn’t feel like I was enough for him because I keep hurting him and being mean. He got frustrated and dismissed my feelings as lies and accused me of not caring about him. This escalated into a fight where he became aggressive, leading me to feel even more worthless.

The next day things spiraled further as we continued to fight through text. I hate fighting through text so I messaged him that I wasn’t going to respond anymore and he could call if he wanted to talk. He replied “If you’re saying goodbye now, you might as well say goodbye forever”. It seemed to me as he was trying to break up. I got super upset so I resorted to self-harm again. I truly didn’t know what to do at that point because I was already having thoughts of hurting myself before he sent that message. I called him multiple times with no answer. But when he finally picked up, he asked if I had hurt myself. I couldn’t lie and he got mad. He said that if I could break that promise so easily, what other promises could I break. As if I would cheat on him. He came to my home that night and I apologized over and over again. But he just said that I was being rude to him, that I didn’t care about him. I was still panicking and crying, I wanted to hug him, but he wouldn’t let me. He just stood there with a blank expression on his face and stared at me. There was no love there. I felt like nothing.

Now, I'm torn between feeling like a bad person for not being able to stop for him and feeling unlovable because of his reaction. It's been days, and he continues to claim that I don't care about him.

"As I write this I am unable to fall asleep and I have to wake up and go to work in about 5 hours.

I am that weirdo, the one that tries to be funny but barely manages because I crack jokes that nobody gets and when I talk I make connections that make sense to no one but myself.

I feel unattractive and unfulfilled. The people who like me probably only do so because I have no ill intentions and they may find my goofiness somewhat endearing, but that’s about it. Worst possible reason to be liked by others. No practical things to provide, no real value, just the ability to not be an asshole I guess, and even then I fail at that sometimes too, because my cortisol is so high from all this rage that depending on the who and the when I might just snap randomly and be mean.

I need to stop, and therapy was working fine but for the last two weeks I just find myself repeating all these patterns and I feel myself slipping away from sanity.

"Hey, im 23 year old guy with massive insecurities. This text might sound like a rant, and it is because im typing it to just take thoughts off of doing something bad to myself. I dislike victimizing myself, because i feel like thats bad for growth, but i think typing this mess is better stress relief.

Lets start off by saying i had a happy childhood, and was generally outgoing up to age of 7, after that i was bullied physically, and verbally relentlessly until age of 16, sure there were some pauses, but mainly it was just that. At the age of 8 my father left me, and i have barely seen him since. One of the funniest things was that even when i tried to tell a teacher about the bullying, i (9yr at the time) was the one blamed for ”making such a fuss about it” by a teacher, so i just gave up, and took it.

When upper secondary school started (its kind of like high school in Finland)i was mentally scarred to a point where i couldnt make any friends, and spent any time i could hidden in wc stalls whenever class wasnt going. During my second year of high school i got severely depressed, and lost most of my ability to function, due to this my graduation got delayed by 2 years, and i still despise myself for that.

My current situation i guess is ok, i got into cognitive behavioral therapy a month ago which i guess kinda helps. Im still alive thanks to my supportive mother, and i got into university to study computer science which im somewhat interested into, and im thankful for all of this. Also i spent my whole life with undiagnosed adhd, and finally getting help to that brings peace of mind. Got off antidepressants too like 2 months ago.

However i still have massive issues in terms of me:

-I randomly break out into uncontrollable crying outbursts at night which lasts at worst for hours.

-My massive insecurities in terms of my looks, intelligence, way i do anything, and being scared of failing prevents me from making friends, and is a difficulty academic wise too (cant learn new things without mistakes right?)

-I constantly think about ending myself, but my rational brain says no hard enough so it feels like i live in endless conflict with myself.

-Due to uni i feel like i have 0 freetime (idk if good or bad)

-I imagine everything as personal attack, and take jokes too seriously.

-I feel so dumb sometimes for no reason at all.

-The biggest one is how do i make friends??? Im so lonely that im going to start creating imaginary friends soon, few people have tried to come to talk to me, but i go into defensive mode so hard i push people away (not literally)

But all in all ofc theres more, but these are the key parts of my life, if you got through this word puke,  thank you for reading it. 

I blame myself for everything that has happened to me, and take all responsibility.

 I finally scrounged up $100 and made it out to Zumiez with my 1 month old, which was also a very daunting task. She has reflux and no matter what I do she spits up and it’s just awful being covered in hot vomit ughh but there I was in Zumiez with her in the body carrier hoping I didn’t getting puked on, or worse, it somehow ended up on the merchandise!

"Generally I come here to help people, respond to their post and try to provide them with help and support. Now I felt the need to speak about myself a bit.

I met this girl, we are the same age (22) and she was in a relationship for 11 months however when I started talking to her, she didnt tell me about it. 

I learned about it after 3 days of intense flirting with her, she mentioned that her boyfriend was ignoring her and not giving her love. Now where it gets interesting is that after she told me about her relationship, she went ahead (4 days after) and broke up with him. 

We started getting out and talking more, however something did feel wrong? It seemed that she was enjoying the time with me, however it didn't felt that I was special for her. 

Fast forward a month and we are still talking, she said that she doesn't wanna be in a relationship yet, but she wants us to be exclusive ( we dont do stuff with other people).

What made it 100 times more confusing is that for almost 2 weeks now, she responds to me slower (could take even 6 hours to respond) while in the start she used to respond to me instantly or max after 2 hours. She gets out with people and doesnt text me at all and lastly she doesnt call me as she used to. However I did ask her about it and she said she is too busy to talk and that she doesnt have the time.

"At this point I am just so over it, and I truly don't understand how so much time has passed and I just see an instagram story of his and it's like all my feelings come back.

We met when we were both 17 (we're 32 now for reference).  I was always attracted to him the moment we met, but we also just got along so well, and could talk for hours about anything and everything.  He was like a magnet to me, I always wanted to be near him, but I could never read his feelings, and I was okay with that because just being near him was enough for me.  He was (and still is) the only person I felt like I could talk freely with, and we fed off each other's thoughts and ideas, talking for hours into the nights.  We lived 40 minutes away from each other which affected things, but we still became close friends.

After my father died from suicide he became more protective of me and I certainly looked to him for comfort, especially after a car wreck that left me disabled for months.  I started spending the night at his house often, but we just lied in bed together and talked.  We both were dating other people, even though now its so funny to look back on how attracted I was to him and sleeping in his bed without doing anything.  One night after drinking he did try to kiss me, but at that point we had been friends for 5 years, and I didn't want to ruin anything by having drunken sex.  I was moving 5 hours away after all, and he was headed to Spain.  I didn't seem worth it at the time, but 12 years later I still kinda wish I would have let him kiss me instead of rejecting him.  

After he left for Spain, we would see each other from time to time when he would visit our state, and I eventually told him how much I loved him back then, however, his response was simply, ""I have always been attracted to you"".  Nothing more than that.

We have kept in touch, and he is now in Australia and I'm still in our home state.  I've gone through boyfriends and am currently with the one I think I'll marry.  However, even after all these years, 15 YEARS since I first met him and was so drawn to him, I still am drawn to him now.  I still dream of him.  Once I was on shrooms and thought I heard him call my name.  Like, it's really bad.  We follow each other on instagram and interact on there, and I saw one of his stories where he just looked so attractive that I can't stop thinking about him again.  He was a magnet to me then and still a magnet to me now.  It's driving me crazy, because I don't want to be this way.  I feel like a legit crazy person at this point.  I know we'll never be together, and there is no way he thinks this way about me.  

I don't know what to do.  I don't want to unfollow him because we are still on good terms and I would love to see him if he ever comes back to the states.  But this is truly ridiculous.  I'm very aware this is all in my head and has no meaning outside of it, but I can't stop thinking about him.  I feel so bad for my boyfriend too; in one of my dreams I hooked up with him while dating my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out (in my dream).  I'll go months without thinking about him at all and suddenly something reminds me of him and it takes weeks to get back to where I'm not thinking about him.

15 years.  It's been 15 years of unrequited love and I'm still being crazy for him.  At this point I don't even know if it's him, or the idea of him.  The idea of the person who made me feel like what I had to say was meaningful and precious.  A person I felt completely and utterly safe with and could sleep peacefully with.  I have never met anyone who made me feel the way he did, even with 15 years of meeting and dating other men.

He told me once I was one of his favorites, out of the people he's met.  That was almost a decade ago, but he's still one of my favorites, even now.  But I don't want to even think about him anymore, I'm exhausted and angry with myself.  I hate still feeling this way.  I hate how I've never been able to replace him or find someone else even remotely like him.  We will never be together but my mind just won't quit, even when it very aware of that fact.  Did I mention this is stupid?  This is so stupid.

"I just can't fucking deal with it anymore. We became friends senior year of HS (we're both almost 25 now) bc our boyfriends were friends, and we got really close during our freshman year of college bc we broke up around the same time. I moved on and grew up, but I don't think she ever did. She's obsessed with high school and never stopped talking about her high school bf (we'll call him C) because she has this weird fantasy of living in a picket fence house with her high school sweetheart (her words exactly). No shade to anyone who does that, I just think it's a weird thing to aspire to and speaks to her immaturity. During our sophomore year, and this is not a joke, she dated her ex's former best friend who had the same name as him (let's call him G). They dated for most of sophomore year and junior year, which was when things started to fall apart. I could write a book about what happened but basically we lived with one of our other friends, the two of them couldn't get along, the fallout completely ruined our junior year, and my best friend ended up becoming a huge stressor for me. It got to the point where seeing her name on my phone would fill me with dread, and then COVID hit in March so my mental health was at an all time low. The whole situation and the way she handled everything really changed the way I look at her, and things haven't been the same ever since. While she was dating G, she ended up cheating on him with a guy at work, and then basically cheated on him with C because they were talking and he was coming over well before they broke up. I don't think she ever told either of them about that, she didn't even tell me until months later. So she starts dating C again and almost immediately starts complaining about all the same shit she complained about in high school. She didn't feel like he appreciated her, he fell asleep too early, never wanted to have sex, never made her feel pretty etc. etc. Instead of breaking up with him when she realized she was unhappy and it wasn't going to change, she dated him for almost three years, moved in with him, and then cheated on him. He first ended up finding a conversation between her and another guy at work back in May of this year. He flipped out, and she insisted that all they did was text bc this guy was giving her attention that C wasn't but she never reciprocated. She also deleted their whole conversation and blocked him before C had a chance to read their conversation, so I knew she was lying. They tried to move on, and he found out that she was texting him again a couple months later. The more he asked the more he found out she was lying, and he ended up calling the dude from work himself and finding out that they slept together. I don't think she could've handled it worse if she tried, she just lied and lied and lied and then was shocked when C didn't want to be with her anymore. She still won't take accountability, I think she genuinely thinks that she was justified, I asked her if she thought about going to therapy to figure out why she keeps doing this and she said ""I already know why I did it. I figured it out."" Within two weeks she was talking to ANOTHER guy from work who is four years younger than us. I haven't talked to her in like a month because I don't know what to even say to her right now.

"English is not my native language so bear with me please.

My wife is 3 months pregnant. Let's call her Ella.

So this evening, Ella called me on her way home from work to ask if i could prepare something because she was starving. She wanted me to make A LOT of pasta for some reason. 

I like cooking, so I quickly prepared some food for us. Nothing fancy, some pasta with sauce and a salad with cucumber, tomato and mayo. 

When she got home, everything was ready. She just needed to change into her comfy clothes and sit down to eat. But I noticed I had made slightly less pasta than I wanted. It was more than enough for the both of us, mind you, but I wanted to make a little extra, like she asked. I said ""Huh, I thought I made more than this"" out loud. 

So up until this moment, she was in a cheerful mood and so was I. But as soon as she heard that, she started blaming me, saying I didn't listen when she said she wanted A LOT of pasta. She got mad but in her calm, usual way. I tried to explain that there was still enough for the both of us to eat. I was also planning on filling her plate more generously than mine (without making it obvious so she wouldn't feel bad).

I also said I could make more while she eats, to which she lost her calm, saying she wasn't planning on eating alone. 

Ella kept nagging, complaining and being a child about the portions. I ended up losing my cool and shouted at her that she was being a pain in my ass and a litteral drama queen. She stopped talking and went to the living room, leaving me in the kitchen. Five minutes later, I had calmed down. I prepared two plates, with hers being well filled to the point I knew she'd never be able to finish eating it all. She took the opportunity to come back and tell me again how I should've listened because I never make enough food (which is a blatant lie, she almost never finishes her plate, I'm the one who eats her leftovers) and she knew I would make the same mistake. I told her calmly that I was not willing to start the same conversation that lead me to lose my cool. I just wanted us to eat.

In the end, I finished making the salad and added a little mayo, after asking if she was fine with it in the salad. She said yes. Now after tasting it, she said the salad was ruined. She doesn't like the taste of mayo after all.

I lost it. Told her to go eat whatever she wants and to leave me alone, that she was the biggest pain in my ass ever. I told her to take some time away from me and that I didn't want to hear her speak a word to me for the rest of the evening.

Now I'm sitting alone while she's in the bedroom and I feel.... I don't know, I have mixed feelings.

Ella usually enjoys my cooking. Yesterday I made steaks with oven baked potatoes so it's not like we eat poorly everyday. I know we're going through a lot right now, I'm not disclosing everything related to our situation but we both have a lot on our minds and the pregnancy, while being a beautiful event and mutual cause for happiness, does add to our mental preoccupations.

I know I have to be supportive, and I try to be. But I still get mad at her sometimes. 

Sometimes I even forget she's pregnant. I get mad at her and raise my voice at her even for just a moment.

Am I allowed to get mad at her ? How are other future fathers dealing with being mad at their partner ? I'm feeling guilty but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't because it's normal to get mad. I don't want to go to her for now. That makes me feel bad too but I can't help it.

"First of all, this is my fourth attempt to post this in the last five minutes. I have tried 3 different subreddits related to relationships and it has been instantly removed every time because apparently I can't ask the question in the single exact fucking specific way that questions are allowed to be asked. No yes or no questions! No open ended questions! What the fuck else kind of questions even are there? I certainly don't know, but this is my last try and then I'm done. Okay, here we go:

My girlfriend and I have been dating three years, living together for two, and up until now I thought we wanted the same trajectory from our relationship: commitment, cohabitation, and eventually marriage. My girlfriend has always been more of the u-haul type (which I admire in a lot of ways) while I prefer to take things slow and definitely fall on the more traditional side of things (my brother jokingly calls me ""the straightest gay"" and I can see where he is coming from.) We have discussed marriage, with the idea of an engagement within the next six months or so.

Well, she comes to me last week and says she has learned a lot about polyamory and feels that it is ""wonderful"" and is something that she feels compelled to explore, and would love to take that journey with me. My very first thought in that moment was...""No. Absolute non-starter."" and my feelings have not budged one bit.

I love my girlfriend and in general I want to be adventurous and go outside my comfort zone for the sake of new experiences with her, but opening up the relationship is just an absolute no. I want to give my whole heart to one full-time partner, not settle for several part-time ones. I don't want a calendar to keep track of who she's fucking each week. I don't want her to fall in love with someone else, and I don't want to go through the painful motions of trying to fall in love with another person at the same time.

They’ve all just had children and lived off of that….

"Title pretty much says it all, but here goes.

My wife and I have been having difficulty conceiving for around three years. We had been told it was an issue with her body, but a few months ago our doc thought it was worthwhile checking me out as well. Things seemed fairly normal until I was asked to have an MRI scan on my brain, but given no explanation as to why.

MRI scan took place a few weeks ago, and last week I received an email out of the blue whilst away on businesses telling me that I have a brain tumour. Now from my own research it hopefully shouldn’t be life threatening, but when the words “neurosurgery”, “tumour” etc are mentioned and there’s nothing in massive letters saying “DON’T PANIC” guess what… you kind of panic a bit.

Anyway, got home the following day and tried to make some calls. Other than that I have a visual check this week I am still totally clueless as to what is going on.

Also CW: SA

So I (17m) is right now in a very happy and healthy relationship. But often when we have sex i freak out.
You see, two years ago (2021) i was together with my ex boyfriend. I thought he was sweet at first. Bit the moment we got together ge started to get... bad.
I wasnt allowed to show my friends the slightest amount of love (platonic ofc), and when i did he would accuse me of cheating. 
But he also did other things. When we hung out, he almost always wanted to fool around with me. And no matter how many times i told him ""no"" he wouldnt stop trying to start something. So this one time i let him. I crief through it all. 
After that it happened more and more times and he always convinced me that i 'wanted it'. 
One time I was over there and i refused to have sex with him. 
He forced me to sleep, sitting up, against the wall, in the middle of September, with no pillows or blankets. Not to mention this was in the middle of sweden and his heating didnt work in his bedroom. 
He did many other horrible things to me, but i cant bring it all up. 
But i wouldve dropped it all, if it werent for the fact that now, when i have sex with my current boyfriend, i can sometimes see his (my ex's) face instead of my boyfriend's. I have multiple times kicked and punched my boyfriend off of me because i thought i was being SA'ed again. Not to mention get massive panic attacks and cry until i almost vomit. 
I have only briefly told my boyfriend that i used to be in a sexually abused relationship.
One time i kicked him in the face so hard his whole mouth tasted like blood. Hes told me multiple times that its fine and that i cant control it, but i still feel so horribly guilty. 
Ive tried to get a therapist but the wait line in sweden is horrible (ive been on a waiting line since i got into the relationship with the ex). I just needed to get this out somehow.
If youve read this far; thank you for taking your time. 
I hope someone out there gets a little comfort knowing theyre not alone

I want a clean break from him, I don't want to live with his abuse I only want what's best for our children, he tries to control all of my life, he went as far as going through one of our kids phones to get my partners number to try and contact them. In the last month I have spoken to police, childrens services and one of our children disclosed to a domestic abuse worker who went on to report what was said. They have done nothing whatsoever.

The only reason I haven't ended everything is because I have children, children who are high care needs and while he and his wife dote on one of our kids the other one has been attacked multiple times this year by his wife.

"I (17F) have never felt so lost or confused with myself or where I stand in life, especially in a situation like this. Me and a guy (18M) have grown up knowing each other ever since our mums became friends when his little sister was born. Things were OK they were friendly and whatnot till I got older (around 15). I started getting more sexual urges but would never act upon them. Me and this guy would spend increasingly more  time around each other, I would open up about my sexual urges to him and he would reciprocate but I would hold myself from enacting them because I was and still am nervous. I don't know what he took from that moment onwards but when he felt horny he would ask for me to give him oral and I eventually gave in because all I thought that I had to please him. So far I've performed oral sex on him three times and all times I felt that it was my job to please him and even if I felt uncomfortable in the slightest,  I would be a nuisance. The last time I gave him oral sex he said he was in a relationship and I tried to keep my distance away from him but my mind went blank and the only thing I thought to do was to please him. I didn't enjoy performing oral sex on him at any one time ,right now I feel lost and used. I feel like I'm the  person he'll call to satisfy his urges. We hardly ever have a meaningful conversations.

Recently, my girlfriend of 1½ year got diagnosed with fibromyalgia and to say it's hard to deal with isn't even representative.  After the diagnosis, I had to take off work for ±1 week to plan the next medical meetings and just overall try to plan our life around that diagnosis since it's literally life changing.  With all those meetings at different medical buildings, I ended up getting really sick for another week.  I don't know what I caught, but I couldn't even get out of bed without throwing up, so I couldn't work at all being that sick.

My boss was at first ""comprehensive"", or so I thought, and he told me there was no problems, that he understood my situation.  When I came back to work, he became super cold and distant with me.  He just let me work for 2 days before telling me there was a hard bump for the business, so he couldn't deploy as much employees (I worked as a sales representative for a small company of ±6 employees).  Therefore, I went another 2 weeks without working.... and without being paid.

So here I am today.  I resigned officially of that job, I'm actively searching for a new one, sending more than 15 CVS per day, but still no news.  I have 29$ in my bank account and I don't have any more money coming in for at least 2 weeks.  I'd say even 3.  I'm at my last straw.

I have no idea how I'll work things around.  I'm exhausted of surviving.  I'm exhausted of this and I can't see the end of this situation.  I'm tired of struggling, I never had any time off of this.  Despite having an amazing girlfriend, I feel more alone than I've ever been.  I feel like a failure, a broke, jobless, useless human being.

I tried reaching mental health professionals, but they cost a shit ton of money I don't have.  I don't even know how ill be able to eat for the next days.  I'm eating toasts with margarine for every meals so I can save up a least a little bit on my expenses.

"When I (M20) was little my mom left me with my grandparents (supposedly to give me a better future). My grandpa was fairly wealthy and even though I had kind of a strained relationship with him because of his character (he grew up in the military hence pretty strict), he still took care of me. He wanted me to go to university and have a bright future. He died in 2021 because of lung problems and from that point onward I've withnessed my family crumble in front of my eyes. My grandma embezzled my grandpa's will money, giving only a smaller part to my mother and hiding my grandpa's real written will.

Keep in mind that I am still living with my grandma. She just stopped paying for my tuition (which is very high because our economic index is calculated from 2021, when my grandpa was still alive), is not paying neither the bills nor rent, instead spending the money in alcohol and friends. By now I've gotten used to taking cold showers in december.

The only thing I did was complain about this with my mother and she snapped back at me like I said god knows what. At this point I lost it, I saw red and talked back to her, calling her psychotic because she was trying to justify all of this, saying that I got a lot of money, I am spoiled (even though clearly I am struggling), I took advantage of the situation and so on. I ended up blocking her and I informed her boyfriend of the matter.

He then also proceded to attack me, even with personal stuff like ""it's because of my behaviour that my dad left"" (my dad left and went to live in Francewhen I was 15). So I told him to go to hell and blocked him too.

My mom and her boyfriend where the last and only people I called family and I feel so betrayed and lost it honestly broke my heart. I fucking hate money and I honestly hate life. The only thing I have that even resembles a family is my girlfriend, whom has been close to me during all of this.

"I’m a teenage girl and last year on the first of November I got a girlfriend(I’m gonna call her Lucy) she was one year younger then me but really nice and sweet, or atlest in the beginning. As I said we are both teens and we where horny, but she so a lot more then me. We would meet and makeout and then do nothing else, and in the beginning it was just that. Making out. First time we ever had sex I was okey with it. I even was the one to ask her. She was okey with it and we were both happy. I made sure to ask for her consent. After that time it was the only thing she wanted to do. Now I wanna clarify that we never went “inside of each other” we more so touched each other’s clits(I hate how that sounds) and sometimes I was okey with it. Other times not so much. Mind you we both have adhd and she thought she was autistic. So Lucy would try to touch me and I’d tell her “I just wanna watch the movie” and would push her off me. She would stop for about 1min and then start again. She did that so many times I gave up. When I talked to her about it she said “yk my autism makes it hard for me to read stuff” so I told her that when I say that I just wanna watch a movie it means that I don’t want to as I have a hard time saying no because of past experiences. She said she understood. Now after this it didn’t get better. I would tell her I was r in the mood and try to make it clear to her that I don’t hate her I’m just not in the mood. If I did say that she would turn away from me and get cold and not talk or only respond in “mhm”/“yeah.” And I have a a fear of abandonment(diagnosed bpd and shit) and on top of that our parents knew each other. She would be so cold and not even try to be understanding to the point where I would have to have sex with her just so she would talk to me. She never wanted to do anything except makeout and have Sex. I felt like she was using me. Idk if my story counts as rape since she was never inside of me and also the fact she’s younger than me.

"So...
I wasn't really loved as a child, to be honest. My father left a very long time ago, and my mother isn't home most of times, so It's only me and my brother, who also isn't home most of times, and due to school the same applies to me (17M). Recently, around 3,5 months ago I found a girlfriend who really loves and appreciates me, and I thought she would make all my problems and stuff go away.. It was like that until recently. Things went downhill.. she kind of started to ignore me, and cancel plans and stuff. It's obvious how she doesn't love me anymore, however due to me oversharing she knows I have problems so she won't tell it to me face to face. So I decided.

"First of this isn’t a plea for anything. I’m not looking for charity, just need to vent.  My life has been complicated, to say the least. My kids are 17 and almost 14. My husband came out as gay at the beginning of the pandemic. He said we would stay married until our son graduates high school because we all got along fine. His boyfriend actually lives with us. He was fine at first but honestly my husband could do much better. My mother-in-law and her father also live with us. Even after he came out we still got along but his mother has hated me since I outed the fact that she lied about filing for disability a decade ago.  I’m actually on Social Security disability so I saw the holes in her story when she said she had done it.  She had to confess that she had never bothered but had been leeching off her then 81 year old father and her kids for years. She still hadn’t filed to this day, by the way. We’ve had a couple of issues over the years but she’s gotten a lot worse recently. My husband and I had originally decided to file for an uncontested divorce so I could get into a more handicapped accessible apartment but some paperwork snafus halted it. We didn’t bother telling anyone because sis either wasn’t anyone else’s business. Once she thought we were actually divorced she ramped up the abuse that culminated in her calling me a whore in front of my son. Want to know why? She was mad that I was cleaning. Yes, you read that right. Cleaning. I was actually cleaning up a dead mouse and a bunch of mouse feces from under the cabinets. She told me it was perfectly fine for rat shit to be in people’s food and that it hadn’t hurt anyone before. I tend to disagree with that. I told my husband that night I wasn’t signing anything until he could get her under control because I couldn’t allow my son to be here without protection and my husband can’t/won’t stand up to her.  If she hates me that much it’s going to rub off on the way she treats my son.  She can’t even say “well that’s half my son” because he isn’t and everyone knows that.  My husband and I met when I was 7 months along so it was never a secret.  A few days later while I’m getting ready for my cardiologist appointment to schedule my heart surgery I get a call from the attorney we had originally started with asking what was going on with the divorce.  I said we had it on hold for various reasons. One being that I was having trouble getting health insurance and I need heart and orthopedic surgeries. He said someone needed to inform my husband of this because he had signed a 5th Avenue attorney with a retainer of $2,500 all while saying we were broke. He cleaned out my and my son’s bank accounts (like he does every month and gives me an “allowance” when he feels like it). The next day when I tell him I need money for my son’s vitamins the doctor’s recommended for his fibromyalgia he tells me he doesn’t have it. It’s gotten worse from there. He refuses to return any of my money. I’m on Social Security so it’s not like I can just work more hours. He won’t answer any texts or email about our son (he’s on the birth certificate and until now I thought he considered him his child), and won’t even give me enough money to buy stocking stuffers. This whole situation has made me sick to my stomach. Thanks for reading my wall of text. If anyone has any advice I’m happy to listen.

ETA: I have officially reported him to the Social Security Administration for theft by deception and fraud and I’ll be filing a police report this week. I’m still waiting on a call back from the lawyer. Thank you all for your advice. I’ll update on this subreddit as I have information.

"I(26M) knew this person since middle school. We were like best friends back there. We stopped hanging out in high school when we starting going different classes. 

In college, we got the same university so we ended up being roommates. We lived together for 2 years. In the next 3 years, we also got engineering close in the same place, so we lived together with another dude we knew from high school, but he barely spent a night in that apartment, even though he was paying the rent. 

We had our issues here and there, like any people living together, but I thought we were on good terms. After graduating, even though I barely saw him, I congratulated him and asked him to hang out sometime and also told him that I was happy to live him and apologized for any arguments we had... he was cool.

Later on he went for an internship abroad, so I called him to check out on him too. We sometimes exchanged messages and birthday wishes. Overall we had a very good time. I recommended to him my favorite show that he ended loving so much and I re-watched it with him.

Now, it's me who moved abroad for a job. Yesterday, a friend of mine sent me in our group discussion ( another group ) a picture, saying he is at this person's wedding... I honestly felt mad.

Here I am, thinking we're on good terms and good friends and all, and dude didn't even bother to send me a message about these wonderful news. A couple of my friends also got married last year and even though I'm abroad they contacted me months before the wedding date so I scheduled flights to attend. It means a lot to me, and it's a responsibility for me to assist and share such a moment.

He should be aware that I'm living abroad ( he follows me on social media ), and I don't think the excuse of ""he thought you were abroad and can't come"" can cut it for me. 

I'm ghosting the man.

"I(19) have always been the second choice. It started in 4th grade and hasn’t stopped since. It hurts to know but i’m trying to learn how to deal with it.

I recently got into a relationship with my (21) partner a couple of months ago and it hurts that there’s already problems.

Don’t get me wrong, my partner is super sweet and attentive and funny as hell. I already met their family and friends and I like them all and they like me back (or at least i hope so).

We were joking around a couple of nights ago, and I made a joke about something that happened to my partner after a date. My partner found this funny and decided to take my joke and post it on their second account

They showed me the post after making it and I saw the name, so I stupidly and without thinking, I followed the account.

I shouldn’t have, I didn’t know it was a vent account with some personal posts but still I shouldn’t have followed it. It’s their feelings and it was wrong of me to try to look at them

The account is private so after a bit the account followed me back, though, they texted me and said “don’t judge me for my posts”, to which i reassured i wouldn’t.

I feel bad that i’m going back on my word.

the second post was a caption detailing how they still have feelings for someone else and it’s complicated because they’re with somebody else (me).

My partner deleted the post quickly though, i guess to try and make sure i didn’t see. 

I’ve been in a stump ever since, it’s like i’m back in freshman where my ex asked me out again while saying that i was a last resort for him bc my friend rejected him.

My worst fears are coming alive again and i’m scared and sad all over again.

But i don’t want to put all these past feelings onto my partner, they’re already having a hard time and i don’t think me being upset over them is gonna help.

"5 years ago I was in a turbulent relationship with a really shitty guy who would constantly pressure and coerce me into sexual acts that I didn’t want to do. I was young and stupid, and he was my first boyfriend so I felt that I had to please him. I was never really taught growing up how to stand up for myself or that my comfort was valuable, but that putting myself aside and pleasing others is of the utmost importance. Most of these instances I can see how I needed to be firmer, so I don’t put all of the blame on him. The only one I do is the time I firmly stated no, that I wasn’t interested in doing that right now, and to stop. It happened anyway. 

I have done EMDR on this instance a handful of times, and each session I feel better, but something will happen that will retrigger the memories. I can still see in my mind exactly the way he looked at me when he did it, and the shock I felt trapped in my body, in the shower, in the house in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to go. Even with therapy, I still feel broken.

I have since moved on to other relationships, but I have a hard time feeling like sex is something more than a transaction. I feel dirty, I feel used, and no matter how supportive my partner tries to be, I can’t help how I feel. I usually cry and feel disgusted with myself afterwards.

"I (23M) was the only child in my family for as long as I remember, and for the longest time, I always wanted to have a sibling. So when I heard that I was going to be an older brother at the age of 15, I was overcome with joy. I was no longer going to be the only child of my family and was very happy to be the caring older brother every sibling wants. I wanted to introduce her to all kinds of things, teach her the wonders of the world, and make her feel like she belonged to the best loving family out there. Unfortunately, fantasy is better than reality.

Let me tell you, the way she lit up my world back then and removed that only-child loneliness I felt was nothing like I felt before. I loved and cared for her from the moment she was born. All was well until the age of 1.5, when she started displaying signs of something. She would always cry and throw temper tantrums non-stop for hours at a time, not calming down for the slightest thing. Some checkups with our family doctor pointed towards her developing some sort of mental disability or different cognitive functions. At the time, I didn't think too much about it. I thought it was the 'terrible 2s' everybody mentioned and that it would eventually go away. Also considering the fact that my dad's side of the family has ADHD, my mom's side has OCD, and me having both, the possibility of her having one or the other, potentially both didn't bother me. I learned ways to deal with it over the years of therapy and learning more about how my mind works.

A year would go by and we would come to find out it was nonverbal autism. I was a bit shaken since I never thought it would be my own little sister having this mental disability. Still, I was determined to make her as comfortable and as understanding as possible, since I too have a neurodivergent mind. I thought that connection and knowledge on how to handle specific things would help a lot. At this time, I also had a few autistic friends in my life and they told me how their minds works. I thought it would be similar, if not, the same 'quirky' introvert that a lot of people describe. We as a family started doing everything in our power to understand how autism would affect my sister, and ways we could deal with it and affirm her positively. What all this information and education programs didn't teach us was how much of a demon autism really was going to be.

For the next 3 years, we tried to do our best to accommodate for her disability. However, it was evident what we were doing was becoming more and more bleak. She still can't really eat on her own, can't be potty-trained, doesn't fit in well with my younger cousins at all, throws tantrums at them if they don't do what she wants, throws away or breaks things at the first moment she gets frustrated at something- and yes, that includes food as well if we didn't make it the way she wanted it-, and screams for hours on end if she has a temper tantrum. She would never be satisfied until we did things the way she wanted to, and if we screwed up along the way, there was no correcting it for another 30 minutes or more. She would never take no as an answer and wants everything done immediately. Every time we told her not to do something, she would find it absolutely hilarious and continue doing it. Even the things that could possibly injure her, she would do it anyway despite our warnings and us trying to deter her, injure herself, and queue another temper tantrum. If we didn't come out of our rooms right away to tend to her, she would start kicking in the door with the force of a thousand bulls. She would find it funny when it came to our pain and even inflicting pain on us as well. Our extended family stopped showing up to visit us because of her.

Now, at 6 years old, you would expect an improvement by now, but nope, it's like she never even changed! Because of this behavior happening almost everyday, it started tearing our family apart. Nobody wants to see their loving parents get hurt, injured, or go through things unimaginable, so when I saw my mom go through massive bouts of stress as a result of my sister, it started affecting me too. Eventually, the stress caught up with her and it caused her to develop an auto-immune disorder, which eventually evolved to lupus overtime. It hurt to see my mom going through hell and back with her own body, when just years ago, she was supermom. Eventually, my mom started to resent my sister. My dad unfortunately fell down the same hole, except in his own way. He developed really bad anxiety and I believe it started causing PTSD symptoms in him as well. He eventually turned to alcohol as a way to cope from the stress he was enduring within this household. In fact, both my parents started turning to alcohol.

I remember when my mom started locking herself in her bedroom to avoid my sister. Even when she was throwing a tantrum, trying to kick in the door, she wouldn't open the door. We would hear the screaming of my sister and the kicking for hours on end until she got tired and just stopped altogether. My mom started having screaming fits, while my dad slowly became more and more withdrawn as a whole. Everything unfolding in real time really made me reconsider a lot of things in life.

Finally, at the age of 8, she started becoming a more controlled and civilized sister and was finally able to go to school. She still can't really feed herself, nor can she wipe her own ass or communicate. However, the damage has been done. My mom on a lot of days is bed-bound because of her condition. The times she's able to move, she immediately gets out of the house to go gamble. I guess this is her way of coping with having an autistic child, and getting out of the house meant you don't have to deal with her. This evolved to a really bad gambling addiction. She's become very bitter and aggressive to the world around her. My dad unfortunately hasn't become any better. He's become a former shell of himself and continues to drink away his problems which led to him becoming pre-diabetic, and still drinks despite knowing this. I have never seen my dad so withdrawn from life before, not going out to do anything at all because my sister required 24/7 care. He's not the loving and happy dad I grew up with anymore, and I don't think he ever will be again. In fact, typing this out made me realize my parents never did anything together from the moment my sister was born. On top of that, we never had a family vacation in almost a decade because our funds were so low all the time taking care of her.

I know some people would say we didn't do a lot, or didn't do enough to accommodate for her disability, and I do agree. Though, I think there just comes a certain point when you start breaking down and thinking negatively when you don't see any sign of improvement whatsoever for the longest time. The thought of ""where did I go wrong?"" and ""how can I make this better?"" just keeps repeating endlessly like a scratched CD in a CD player. I know my parents could've handled this better, I know I could've handled this better, but there's so much you can do given what you have I guess?

All I ever wanted in my life was to have a sibling and a happy family. The kind that would just sit at the dinner table or watch movies or shows together and shoot the shit. The kind that goes on fun trips together, laugh, explore, smile and make amazing memories. I wish I could love my sister with the same love I felt for her when she was born, but those feelings are long gone now. The only thing I see when I look at my sister is a wrecking ball that tore through my family.

I always wanted to start my own family in the future, but these days, that dream is dead. I understand I'm still considered young by a lot of people, but the possibility of passing down my neurodivergent genes and/or autism made me realize I wouldn't be able to handle it. I'm not risking it.

I will preface this by saying I know how this will seem farfetched and some of you may think this is another of the twenty million fake stories  on here. All I can really say is that’s it’s true and I know that because I lived it. I also apologize about how shitty this is probably going to be, as I am not a good writer and this brings some pretty intense emotions for me.

I (23M) lost my best friend and roommate J (21M) to suicide 7 months ago and I just need to get this off my chest. My friend deserved so much better than what he got and I need to get everything he went through out there. 

I had known J for the majority of my life and we were always alright friends. J and I were both born and raised in a relatively small and rural town in the Midwest  After we had graduated high school we both ended up in the same massive friend group. Around December 2021 we started becoming extremely close. He was in the army reserves and was looking at houses a few hours away near a Military base he had gotten a job at. He knew just how much I hated our hometown and how my plans to leave always fell through. He offered to let me move with him if I helped pay for some of the house. I happily agreed and used nearly every penny I had in my savings to help him out with the down payment. In June 2022 I dropped everything and moved into a shitty apartment with him for two weeks until we closed in the house. I left my hometown with just my Xbox and a futon and was forever grateful for J for giving me the escape I could never manage myself.

Starting sometime in the summer of 2021, J had started dating A(20F). A had come from a different state and had only been living in our area for a year or two at the point her and J started dating. A had always rubbed me the wrong way since the night I met here. My first experience with her was at a party J hosted and she came up to me out of nowhere and told me some extremely personal stories. I had never met her before, had never had a single conversation with her,and I did not know her name until months later. When I started becoming close with J in December 2021 I officially met her. I was never particularly close with her but we got along well enough. After officially meeting her, my opinion was that she was very controlling around J and often made extremely personal comments and jokes out of the blue. But I never told J my thoughts about her and we got along well enough.

Cut back to June 2022
Just a few days before we finally closed on the house, a freak storm hit the town. J and I were both at work so J asked A to check on the house for damage as she did not have a job and just layed around the apartment all day. She threw a massive fit that resulted in J breaking up with her that day. When I got home to the apartment they were in the middle of an argument. J was just silently packing up A’s stuff while she was screaming incredibly manipulative things to try and fix the relationship. I personally heard her say things such as “You never loved me” and “at least I never gave up on you”. Every time they got into a fight she always said shit like that. But anyways I got home during the argument and J asked me to help him fill A’s truck up with her stuff. We loaded up her truck and she left. I could see how J was feeling so I sat down and talked to him for a while about everything and I  then ended taking him to the bar so he could have a better night and get some of his feelings off his chest.

This story should’ve ended there but unfortunately, that’s not how things worked out. After she left the apartment, A went back to our hometown where all of our friends were and spun a tale of J being emotionally abusive and manipulative to her. The vast majority of our friend group had all known each other for almost 10-15 years. We all went to the same middle school, same high school, hell half of us were in the same t-ball team when we were little kids. In total, there were probably 30 or so people in our group. Sides did not have to be drawn, but they were. Everyone except 2-3 of us chose her and cut J off. Even some of J’s own family chose her. But I didn’t give a shit. I felt such a debt to J for helping me get out of our hometown and I had became so close with him that I was in his side 100 percent. We were in a new town, a college town with a good party scene and dozens of good bars. We could just make new friends. And we did.

I ended up living just under a year in that house with him and one of our other friends who moved in a few months later. And it was the greatest year of my life. Around this point is when I started considering J my best friend. He was the best friend I could’ve ever asked for and I was on his side 100 percent. After the breakup and our friend group choosing sides, we did keep in touch with a small number of friends from the group. About a month after the breakup we discovered that the friends we had stayed in contact with were informing A of everything we were doing. We had blocked her on social media but the friends we had kept into contact with would send her every single thing we would post. If one of our stories had us at a bar with any female sitting near us, she’d call J on a random number to just scream at him. If one of our posts showed J to be drunk at all, she’d start sending him nudes and offering to drive the several hours to our house to sleep with him, knowing he was a horny bastard and too drunk to say no. This happened several times. I was able to talk enough sense into him several times but unfortunately, I didn’t catch it when it was happening a few times and she was successful at this a few times.

J was determined to cut contact with her and be rid of her, but A was not about to let that happen. She spent the next few months making J’s life hell. I’m not gonna type every single thing she did but I will say the most notable. J was raised by a single mother and was extremely close to her. After the breakup A had started living with a friend in an apartment just down the block from J’s mother. Every single time J went back to our hometown to visit his mom, A would see his car and start shit. One night J received a call from another random number, and it was A. A was saying she was going to commit suicide and J basically said to do whatever because they were not together anymore and he did not care. She did her usual “You never loved me line and hung up” she then grabbed her shotgun, went outside, and fired it in the air so J would believe she had actually committed suicide. She then would not answer any of his calls or texts. It wasn’t until J ran over there to check until we learned the truth.

The next most notable event was in December of 2022. J was back in our hometown to visit his mother. He had heard someone knocking on the door and it was A. As he opened the door, A started slashing her wrists, saying if they could not be together she would end it all in front of him. J called the police and wrestled the knife from A. But when the police arrived, they saw J holding a knife while A was covered in blood on the ground and J got arrested. After this event, I believed J had completely cut off A. I kept speaking to J about this and he always told me he would not even entertain any conversation with her. I pressed him several times and always received that answer so I believed him. Now I know he bought a second phone to contact her. A was the first and only relationship J had ever been in, and the manipulation of the past few months had worked. J could not get over her even after getting arrested because of her. He did not let me or our other roommate know because he knew we’d make him cut A off. But at the time I did not know, and I stupidly believed him.

As I said at the start of the story, J was in the army reserves. Around the middle of May, J was going to be deployed to Morocco for about a month.he was so excited to go to Africa. I had never seen him so excited before. He had went to our hometown to spend a weekend with his mom before he went to Africa. May 5th 2023 is when everything changed. A had shown up at J’s mom’s house. His mother immediately kicked her out. J told his mother it was alright and they would go on a car ride and talk this out so she would not bother them again. During that car ride,A had gotten a rise out of him. He was threatening to kill himself if she did not finally leave him alone for good. Instead of calling his mother or myself, the two people he would’ve listened to then, A called her best friend.

 I want to make a note about A right quick. A’s best friend K had a boyfriend who had attempted suicide just a few weeks before this. A also had another friend whose boyfriend did commit suicide just a month before. Of all the people in the fucking world to call while J was having a crisis, A decided to call K, whose boyfriend had just attempted suicide. Once K showed up, she threatened to call the cops. J told them that if they did call police, he would kill himself right then and there. So they call the police and as the cop comes walking up to J’s car, J shoots himself twice. He shot himself once in the chest and when that did not work, she shot himself for the second time in the head.

As soon as I heard what had happened I immediately went to my hometown to visit his family. Some of the people I had went to high school with decided to all have a meet up and talk about what just happened and grieve together. As I show up A is laughing and cracking jokes,but as soon as she sees me she flips a switch. A starts playing the victim card and starts saying stuff such as “HE SHOT HIMSELF IN FRONT OF ME” and “ J was the love of my life”. Keep in mind she had already had another boyfriend for months at this point. Everyone had bought the story A had fed them and started comforting her. I had to immediately leave this event as I was seeing red. All of our friends had chose A during the breakup, and we’re now mourning J like they were loyal to him the entire time. A was acting and being treated like the victim,not the woman who had made his life hell following the breakup.

Following J’s death had to move back to our hometown. Being in that big empty house without J was too much for me so I had to move back in with my parents. My former friend group tried to get me to hang out with them like we used to, but I just can’t. I still hold so much loyalty towards J and so much anger towards them. I know this isn’t healthy but I am filled with so much anger. They all chose A. They supported her while she made my best friend suffer. A is now a moderately successful influencer. I see her ads on TikTok all the time, with dozens of thousands of likes and thousands of comments.just last week I saw one of her TikToks documenting her pregnancy. I am just angry. She pushed him to the point of no return and now gets to experience shit J never will. How J being gone and A being able to bring new life into the world is in any way fair, I will never be able to comprehend.

I know my anger towards A and my former friends is unhealthy, but I need to get it off my chest. J will never get his story told. J will never get justice for what A did to him, but I owe it to J to get it out there.

"Turning to Reddit because I don’t know who to go to about my situation. Me and my girlfriend are high school sweethearts. It’s been my first long term relationship and I’ve been planning to propose next year. Lately we’ve been having to have serious conversations about our relationship and what issues we’ve been having. Her issues with me is I have an attitude when I get home from work and I’m always on my phone. My issues with her is that love feels like a chore to her, theres no intimacy and I always have to initiate even the smallest of things like a kiss or a hug. We had a talk last weekend and we spoke about said issues and both agreed we would try, fast forward to this past weekend. She went drinking Friday night and stayed at a girlfriend’s house. I got home from work Saturday afternoon to another talk that she’s been having doubts for a while and thinks we should end our relationship. I was blindsided because I thought we were doing fine but told her I don’t want that to happen. She told me she’s willing to give us another chance and she wants space. Since then I’ve been hurt and unhappy, I’m not sure if I should let her go and move on or try and make it work again. We don’t want to break up and we both love each other so much but I’m afraid if we keep going the relationship will turn toxic.",My girlfriend of 5 years is giving me one last chance to fix our relationship.

I organise them. I'm the family mediator. I sort out their problems. Chores and other family stuff. 

 I've achieved a lot the most, according to my family
 (I'm not trying to be cocky. I don't think you can measure achievement like that, and I don't think it is all a person is or can be.) Despite everything 
(Bullying by almost everyone in my life because of my disability,stalking ,harassment  sa, etc)

I tried to get a job to pay for stuff for myself, but my parents said I needed to do the housework(they said they would pay me, but they never do). I haven't been able to do anything because I'm so stressed and tired.
My sister used to help  me a bit, but she's moved out and is never home.

I have been burned out for a long time, so the roles have switched, and my family is complaining all the time about me. 
I had heart problems due to the stress of my life. I called the ambulance, and my dad took my phone and hung it up. He grabbed me and said there's nothing wrong with you. I went to the hospital though, so obviously, there was a problem.
I don't know what to do. 

I can't sort out their problems, let alone my own. I'm a teenager, so I can't do a lot of things without my parents. i wish their was someone who would look after me. I still love my family, but i wish they  could help themselves because I can't even though I try .
But i can't. I'm too burnt out. 

I go to  things like therapy,group therapy, and other stuff to help myself . I'm taking a break off school despite what my family wants me to do. This is the hardest year I've ever had.

Hi guys I’m new to Reddit i just had a devastating event happen in my life and need some advice. For some back ground my girlfriend(24F)and I(24M) have been highschool sweethearts for the past 7 years. We just moved in together for the first time a little over 6 months ago. My girlfriend has always been very strict with my activities or associations to other female even to go as far as to become upset when i would have conversations with her own friends during parties or activities. The past 6 months living together has been a dream. It was going so good i was even looking at engagement rings last week. We have always been super open with communication and have never really had any issues. That was until this past weekend. My girlfriend and I were hanging out at our apartment and watching movies when all night and around 11pm she said she was going to go to the bar with somefriends. I said “no problem see you when you get home love you.” She went to the bar and I fell asleep and was woken up at around 2pm to my girlfriend(24F and her friend(25F) coming into the apartment I thought nothing of it as this is a common occurrence when they go out. Well anyways my girlfriend’s friend said they were going to the hot tub at our apartment complex. I had asked if they wanted me to go with them since they were drunk and she kept insisting they’d be fine on their own. Well they left and i decided to stay up and wait for them. Usually there hot tub sessions only went on for about 30 mins so i put on a movie. I sat there for about 3 hours waiting for my girlfriend to come home. I called her multiple times and texted her to make sure she was okay. I asked her if she wanted me to come get her and she kept insisting they were fine. At around 5am they both walked through the door and my girlfriend was plastered.(They had taken a bottle of wine with them.) I proceeded to get my girlfriend in bed and even set up a bed on the couch for her friend. I stayed up for about 20 mins making sure they were both okay before laying down with my girlfriend and sleeping. I woke up the next morning and my girlfriend looked at me like she had seen a ghost. She then proceeded to tell me her friend and her had S*x at the hot tub.

"Im 38. Ive never moved out. The longest Ive been away from home was a full month when I went to Europe. That was fun.  


Ive thought about moving out but honesty? Why? To say my stuffs 100% together? To give some landlord $1300 a month to have slightly more interior space with a whole lot less exterior space and more rules for $1000 more then I pay now? No, Ill pass. Ill also pass because Im lonely as fuck and talking to my mom either in the morning or at night is the most socialization I get in person. I have 3 friends online that I game with occasionally and talk to over voice chat. One is a guy Ive been friends with since high school and my only real friend but we haven't hung out much since 2020 as his dad needs to take immunosuppressants and forgets to take them or refill meds. The last time we hung out was before covid officially hit the states. We watched a few plague movies while drinking coronas.  I have coworkers that I talk to but its not the same if none of them only reach out after work for work related things. My birthday came and went this year as well. I got a birthday wish from two of my friends, my mom, and my grandparents. Thats it. I nearly hit a low point of 6 feet under except I still have my dog who wouldn't understand if I were gone and I dont trust anyone to care for her.   


So why move out and isolate myself further and feel even lonelier?

I have started going to meetups on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com). For the most part, Ive been welcomed and people greet me when I show up. Ive had one member member who isn't as warm as the others but its not that big of a deal. Another member wants to meet up for coffee and three of us might start going to the gym together. 

My mom likes the company and is glad Im there. Shes not in a rush to kick me out. I help her out around the house. I could do the dishes more but I cook more often then she does and I move things she cant. We have our own 1/3 of the house with the kitchen and dining room acting as shared space for the other 1/3 of the house. Our personal space is on opposite ends of the house from each other. 

  
Im dating. I get a decent amount of hits and likes on multiple apps but most conversations fizzle quickly. I used to make an effort to keep them going but Ive learned that if Im getting 4 word responses then they are not into me. Thats fine. I usually land a date every 6 months or so. I have dated women who dont care that I live at home because I have a job, a car, hobbies, and I'm emotionally mature. I was even engaged to a woman for a while who lived with me for a bit and was fine with us living there as she enjoyed the house and the company too. Though I would not want to raise a family there with my mom living there. Its a good house and good schools but raising kids at my moms is to far.  


As far as have I ever thought of moving out? Yeah, I have.   
I stayed at home while going to college and working part time. When I was able to get a job that paid well enough to move out or save up for a house, it was cheaper to own a home at the time, if you had the down payment. Since then houses have gone up. Its still cheaper to own but it takes a much bigger down payment now. I still look at prices occasionally too. Right now my minimum requirement for moving out is locked/on site parking (yes, some places have street only parking) because I bought a kia soul back in 2015, and dog friendly.  Id like AC and a pool but those are more ""extra"" then anything.

"I would just like to start this by saying I love my family very much. But I’ve never felt like they love me the same back. They’ve always made me feel like I’m less than them. They always had a reason to be upset with me. And ya know, for a long time I thought maybe there was something wrong with me. But through life I’ve found two people who love me very much and have never been afraid to call me out should I need it, and they tell me I’m a perfectly fine human. That I’ve done nothing wrong to my family and they see how different and wrong they treat me. 
My sibling and parent are just so close, it’s almost like they don’t want to make room for me. And its felt this way since we were kids growing up. I’ve had people who aren’t family tell me that my parent has said some really disrespectful and rude things about me, not thinking it would get back to me. My parent has completely spoiled my sibling and both of them have turned into monsters. Honestly, if we weren’t related I wouldn’t even acknowledge my sibling. They aren’t really a decent person. 
This last bout of them speaking down to me was enough. I told them I had enough and blocked them both. And everyone is telling me I should have done it sooner. People support my choice to go NC so I feel like I did the right thing. But with the holidays coming up and my intrusive thoughts bringing me more and more panic attacks, I just needed to vent and get some of these feelings out.

"So, this is going to be a pretty long and morbid story. I'll start by saying that I'm a male in my late twenties living in a developed western country.  
  
About five years ago while I was a university student, I experienced a sudden episode of extreme dissociative amnesia. In the most acute phase of this, I basically felt like a new-born baby, with no knowledge of my entire life history, facts about the world, or ability to orient myself in space and time in a coherent manner. As I re-integrated from this experience (I can't remember well enough to know how long it lasted) I remember periods of disorganized and poorly coordinated behavior, for example knowing how to perform a task but getting the sequence of the steps out of order somehow. Gradually my memories and personality returned, and I began to grow suspicious of what may have occurred to cause this. I should note that I have no history of drug or alcohol use. As I was living with my parents as a student, I initially directed my suspicion towards them, as their denial of having witnessed anything commensurate with my own experience seemed strange to me. Eventually our arguments came to a head, as I suspected they may have drugged me in some manner. I went with them willingly to the local hospital, where I was immediately certified by two psychiatrists under my country's mental health laws (essentially, involuntarily confined to a psych ward) with a preliminary diagnosis of psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. I distinctly remember the certifying doctor joking, in a mocking tone, about there being a conspiracy against me. In the moment I was too taken aback to stand up for myself, so I complied and spent several weeks on the psych ward being ""evaluated"" and ""treated"" with antipsychotic medication. It was obvious to everyone present that I did not truly belong there, and several nurses even made direct comments to me to the effect that they didn't understand why I was there and that I should request a legal review of my situation. The more lucid patients also commented on my apparent lack of insanity. At one point, a nurse sat down with me and made a cryptic comment about how I had been betrayed, and mocked me for having to take medication she considered toxic. Eventually I was discharged, and placed on extended leave from the hospital. Still furious with the situation but having finished my undergraduate studies, I proceeded to find a stop-gap job to wait out the pandemic. About a year after the first certification, and still living with my parents, I could not let the issue go, and argued with them continuously. Eventually I agreed to go voluntarily to another hospital, in the hopes that professionals in a different community would be able to discern what was going on. To my dismay, I was certified again and sat on another psych ward for several weeks before receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Baffled, I pointed out to the diagnosing doctor that I didn't even meet the strict criteria for this illness as laid out in the DSM. She responded that adherence to such criteria is unnecessary and can be overridden by a clinician's judgement of a patient's case. For the next two years I was forced to receive monthly injections of an antipsychotic. I briefly moved to another community at this point, and was assigned to a third doctor. This fellow seemed skeptical of my supposed insanity, but was cautious enough to not take immediate action. Instead, he slowly tapered me off the medication before finally discharging me in April of this year. At this point, now a voluntary patient, I was simply advised to take an oral medication. Naturally, I immediately stopped taking it, with the only effect being my shedding the 40 pounds I had gained as a side-effect.  
  
Over the course of this treatment I made several attempts at a legal review of my situation to have my involuntary patient status revoked, all ending in failure. The first doctor defending my status as prisoner-lunatic repeatedly cited as evidence of my mental illness my ""lack of insight"" into my having a mental illness (really?). The most recent such review resulted in another rejection, however the doctor himself (the third one mentioned above) confided to me after the fact that he had seen patients in far worse states of mind be let free, and that he found the panel's decision surprising. My assigned lawyer made similar comments to the effect that I was by far the most well-spoken and put together patient she had ever represented in such a case.  
  
To my knowledge, this entire series of events has not been known to anyone outside my immediate family. Over the past several weeks, however, I have begun to talk about the situation to some of my close friends. The first is a friend I've known since elementary school and with whom I had socialized continuously over this period; he expressed total shock and moral outrage at the situation, and advised me to take legal action (something I had of course already considered). He claimed to have not noticed any changes in my behavior or personality over this period as someone who has known me continuously for close to 20 years. I also spoke to two other friends, former coworkers I have known for roughly seven years, and who have had similarly routine interactions with me over the period of this ordeal. Their reactions were very similar, with one even stating that my story was especially absurd as he had considered me to be one of his more level-headed and intelligent associates.  
  
I have reached out to several law firms to push a medical malpractice suit, and have so far received fairly pessimistic opinions, given the laws in my country.  
  
My aim in sharing this is naturally to solicit feedback from internet strangers, especially considering what may have caused the initial event (suggestive of extreme psychological trauma). Looking at the whole situation holistically suggests some pretty heinous interpretations, but I've tried to present the brute facts in such a manner so as not to bias anyone's judgement.

"i know i’m a piece of shit for this. i know i was a bad boyfriend and i know that what i did was wrong, but i just couldn’t take it anymore.


context, i’m 15, male if it matters, she was also 15, we both live two hours apart.

the beginning of our relationship was great. except for one thing. almost every SINGLE time she visited me, she had what she referred to as a “tummyache”. she’s also lactose intolerant, and ALWAYS showed up to my house with a huge ass starbucks latte halfway gone. However, i did like taking care of her at first. for the first two months of it i held her each time, kissed her head, got her a heating pad, let her absolutely annihilate my poor innocent bathroom, and did everything i could to make her feel better. then she started coming over more often. every fucking weekend she would come over. even tho i had hockey, i wanted to hangout with friends, etc, i could never go without becca absolutely destroying my notifs bc i left her with a “tummy ache”. I couldn’t even hangout with my friends without her bombarding me, and if she did come she’s beg to leave bc of a “tummyache”. okay, i was fine with leaving most times. 

i started to get annoyed when the very first issue rose. One morning, when she was preparing to come over, i caught a stomach bug thing from my sister and was puking up my entire food history all morning. i texted becca, saying i didn’t feel well and if she wanted to turn around we could hangout when i was feeling better. she said no, “i wanna help you”. I then warned her that i acc feel horrible and i’m prolly js gonna be in my bed all day. she said “that’s fine”. then she showed up, walked into my room, and laid right on top of me. I asked her nicely to get off, bec i wasn’t feeling well and wasn’t comfortable with her laying all over me. 

  she started crying saying her “tummy hurts” and she just wanted me. i said that’s fine and offered her the spot next to me. she shook her head no and curled into me more. this upset me a bit. i feel like shit, i’ve been puking all morning, and now i have to take care of becca like every other time. but i got over it, and took care of her. held her hair back when she threw up, got her a heating pad, rubbed her back, the whole nine yards. meanwhile, while i was puking, she did nothing but cry to me her “tummy was hurting.” she didn’t even go near me. and no, she doesn’t have emetophobia, she’s always helped her sick friends, just not me. 

   i got over that situation. i loved her through that whole time, even still in a twisted way. however, she ghosted for two months, then texted me out of nowhere she wasnt doing good and asked to get back together. i agreed. 

every day she would text me her “tummy hurts” and “i’m the only thing keeping her alive” which i guess is sweet. every time she complained i’d tell her i’m sorry and i’m here if she needs anything. every fucking time. then i started getting sick. 

i started throwing up every single day, constant headache, the whole nine yards. during this, becca conveniently got worse as well. she would randomly stop texting me and text 15 minutes later, “sorry i passed out”. and every fucking time i’d comfort her. if i tried to say how horrible i felt, she would say an “i’m sorry” then brush it off and talk about her “tummyache” or how she felt “headachy” whatever the fuck that means. i stopped even telling her how horrible i felt. i quit hockey bc i felt too sick to go. most my friends ditched me. i only had miles, my bsf. (miles if you see this man i love you). 

finally it got bad enough that i had to go to the hospital. on my first night,  becca stopped answering around 10pm. okay, i figured she fell asleep. then she texts me the next morning, saying “sorry i stopped responding i had a seizure and jus had no energy after”. 

i lost it after that. i know it’s wrong and she’s sick but i texted her back “dude i’m being so fr go to the fucking hospital”. context, she is not epileptic in the SLIGHTEST and has no history of seizures. 

  she got mad at me, screaming “wtf liam i have a seizure and instead of an “i’m so sorry baby” or “i’m here for you” you yell at me!” 

so i texted her a really bitchy thing “well do you want my condolences or to actually give a fuck about her well being. she cussed me out again. 
i told her i wanted space bc i was really mad and she responded with a “well if you’re so mad then why don’t you just break up with me” and i lost it again yelling at her that it was a bitch move to say js bec i’m mad she thinks i wanna break up, and that i’m basically not allowed to be mad. 

she cried saying i was a piece of shit and i apologized. later that day i found out i needed life saving surgery the next day, and i told becca. she had forgiven me at this point btw. i texted her i needed her. and what did she do? she got drunk. and i had to take care of her. finally, i made a comment that i actually didn’t have her by my side, because all she was doing is making horny comments. she cried saying this was how she coped. for more context, she’s a very horny joke and often says stuff i’ve told her i’m uncomfy with and she continues to do, or just says “fine i’ll just finger my self.” 

  finally my surgery. after i didn’t respond to her for three days in recovery. when i finally got the courage to open my phone, i got multiple texts saying “liam i need you my tummy hurts again” “i had a seizure and you weren’t here” and other stuff. more context, she never showed     any health issue besides lactose intolerant when we hung out? like every other symptom jus disappeared. 

without thinking or texting, i blocked her. we’ve been broken up since that day, and i know i was crappy for it  and a shitty bf but i don’t regret it.

"I [F18] am having a bit of an issue with a friend [F18]. This friend and I are currently both college freshmen, a few states apart. We met our freshman year of high school and stayed close ever since. During our senior year, I did notice a bit of tension at times because she has a very defensive (and sometimes controlling) personality. She often likes things done her way and also is very hateful towards others, so she does like to gossip a lot. She is the kind of person to “shit talk” others she doesn’t like or people who do not like her. Her and I share many mutual friends and one of our big friend groups in high school was us two, and another friend [M19]. They were a bit closer because of family and towards the end of the senior year, many of our collective hang outs would end with just them two talking. Going to college, we did not talk as much but we still remained close. However, for my break I was going to her college because some of my new college friends had friends there as well, and my best friend said she could host me. However, leading up to this trip, she repeated to me various times to not come because of many reasons including she was stressed (with exams), was not in a good place with her friends, nervous I would not have fun (because I did not have a fake so I would not have been able to go clubbing), and many other reasons and I still went. I still went and instead stayed with my college friends, and she reached out once to make plans and I told her I would tell her when I had time. However, this was my fault because I ended up getting caught up in my plans and was not able to see her. This caused a huge rift, when I told a mutual about this situation and she ended up confronting me over text. I tried to explain myself and make up through an explanation and apology and all she did was “like” my message. She often has passive aggressive bouts like this which makes it hard to say stuff straight up to her. Instead of giving in and apologizing and trying to make things better, I just left it because I was tired of doing that in high school. So, a few weeks later she calls me and tells me that we should stop fighting and as we’re catching up, she makes a lot of passive aggressive comments including how I would have had more fun at her college if I actually hung out with her, how her school has more parties than mine, and a lot more. My friends and I all know she comes from an insecure place so we have tried to just ignore it, but I was tired of it so I just left it be. However, when we came home for Thanksgiving, we all hung out and she just was very different and was kind of criticizing our mutual friend [F18] and I for “not being fun” enough, not wanting to smoke, and more. So the hang out was cut short and we all went home in an awkward fashion because it was obvious she was not having fun and the dynamic was different. I could tell our friendship was a little strained after this but I still invited her to my birthday dinner for this upcoming break, and she recently asked for a gift that she gave me before college back over text, and even after asking if everything was okay between us, she just said yes and still asked for the gift back. I called our mutual friend [M18] from our high school friend group because I know she still talks to him about our issues, and he told me to send her a long message explaining how I feel and it’s up to her whether or not she actually wants to talk and fix it. I think I am most worried about losing many of our mutual friends if we decide to end our friendship because at this current state, her passive aggression and her attitude is just draining me and my energy.",I [F18] am having an issue with my best friend [F18],18lgaq9,1702925545.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lgaq9/i_f18_am_having_an_issue_with_my_best_friend_f18/,
"          Hello. I will start this by saying I’m a young mom to an 11 month old baby boy. He’s amazing. I’m sure many parents will say that about their children, but I really lucked out. He’s very easy and happy. I’m 23 and a little alternative looking. My husband works very hard and I’m lucky enough to be able to stay home with our son. 
         When he was four months old he woke up one morning with a fever. I was ready to take him to the ER, but decided it would be faster if I made an appt with his pediatrician, so I did. I got him in the same day. They tested him for RSV came out positive) , gave me a prescription, and sent us on our way. Something was not right though. I knew he was sick, but it was bad. We had to take shifts because he wouldn’t sleep without being held. He was projectile vomiting anything he drank. It was intense. The next morning he was sleeping in his crib. He was burning up. I checked his temp and it was 102 degrees. I woke up my husband and we rushed him to the ER. They checked his lungs. They said he didn’t have a lot of mucus. Gave him Tylenol, sent us home, and said babies bounce he’ll be fine.
         The next day we had a follow up appt with his pediatrician, did the same thing and sent us on our way. When we got home, he fell right asleep and we were grateful. Sick babies are so hard to care for. When he woke up he was having a seizure. To say I was panicking is an understatement. I called 911 and they took him to a childerens hospital. 
We were waiting for a room and they had started testing him for things. I told the nurses he had just tested positive for RSV three days ago. They then told me he didn’t have RSV. I was livid for three days he was severely sick and never had RSV. So what did he have?? They gave him a CT scan and said he had a brain bleed. This is when it started. I had to talk to 4 different social workers, who were asking me if we abused our child, did drugs, drank, “accidentally smashed him around” No, No, No . The nurses brushed me off and gave me dirty looks. A nurse came in and told me they were gonna be giving him an MRI and if it was a brain bleed it was abuse. He told me twice like I was stupid. They did the MRI and rushed him into surgery. He didn’t have a brain bleed. He had meningitis. He had a brain infection that had been there for two or three weeks is what the surgeon told me. After that revelation they started treating me better and I was such a good mom for bringing him in, but it still pisses me off. I was sobbing thinking my son was going to die and they were interrogating me like I was a criminal. I understand people abuse their kids, but to treat people like they are evil before they know anything was traumatizing. It scared me. Later in the month they found out he was having strokes as well. After a month long hospital stay and multiple seizures and strokes, we were discharged. I got him into physical therapy right away and changed his pediatrician as I couldn’t trust her word anymore. Now at 11 months, you can’t tell anything was wrong with him. But for me I’m traumatized. Im paranoid. If he looks at me wrong I’m ready to rush him to the ER. I
Check on him constantly at night. I have a hard time sleeping. I get so frustrated with how they treated me. What pissed me off the most was that the nurses would praise me for being such a young mom and staying every day with my son. I AM A MOTHER. No matter how old I am he is my child. Young moms love their children too. It was demeaning and embarrassing. We go to regular MRIs and I get so shakey in the hospital. I’m still scared they think I’m hurting my child when really he just had a freak illness. I don’t wish your child almost dying on anyone. It was horrifying seeing him laying in bed having seizures. Or just sleeping 24/7.

"For reasons that recently have become relevant, I’m wondering if people who view artistic nude photographs are actually just seeing the art, or if there is always an erotic element to nudity, since we are human beings after all. I go back and forth on this topic and wonder how others feel. 

Personally, although it depends on the photos, I usually can’t 100% view the subject of an artistic nude as pure art - there is always a sense of the subject as human, as having sexuality.

"Back in October, my (18f) boyfriend (19m) of two years admitted something that he had been hiding from me for a while. I’m not going to get into it because that’s his business and I shouldn’t talk about it, but it was detrimental enough that I decided we needed to break up for the time being so he could figure his own things out. This was a pattern of behavior; every time there was something going on with him that he absolutely needed to tell me and communicate in our relationship, he’d hide it from me until I found out on my own. I told him that he needed to really work on this as it turns out he was extremely insecure and thought that i’d leave him if he told me any of these things despite me never giving that idea and actively encouraging healthy, open communication.

Well, in our time apart, we were still talking and began to work on getting back together. He ended up meeting and sleeping with a girl in that time. I only found out that they slept together after getting back together- but this wasn’t where i’m saying he cheated, as we were obviously broken up in that time. I set a boundary once I found out: he needed to block her on social media and imessage so they wouldn’t be able to text eachother. I was okay with him seeing her at parties and being acquainted as they were in the same friend group and those interactions would be public, but I didn’t want there to be an opportunity for anything to happen through text (though, at the time, I trusted him as he had never done anything like this previously). He said he did so and we moved on with our lives and continued about our relationship.

Well, a week ago I found out he was still following her. I ended up getting a gut feeling that I needed to text this girl and yeah, turns out he had continued their relationship on the side while being with me (she didn’t know as he told her we were broken up and hid it from both of us for a month or so). She’s hardly affected as they weren’t really doing anything serious, but they did sleep together. She was really kind to me and kept apologizing and gave me the evidence i needed to confront him. He tried to lie about it when I initially confronted him till I sent him screenshots that she gave me- and he was trying to describe me as some crazy ex girlfriend to this girl. 

I’m absolutely devastated. It was a two year relationship and before October I would have never thought he’d do something like this to me. He’s always been such a kind and loving boyfriend, and his family loved me a lot. I figured that maybe his friends encouraged this behavior after our initial breakup, which really hurts as I thought his friends were my friends too. I’m meeting up with him in two days to talk and I really don’t know what to do. The logical thing is to never speak to eachother again, given I broke up with him the second I found out, but part of me wants to hope he’ll go back to the boy I fell in love with. I don’t recognize the person he is at all. I’m gonna be leaving for college after my senior year finishes and he’s moving to the same place as me, which means i’ll be seeing him constantly regardless. I want to try and see if maybe he’ll change, but I know that’s not a good idea and could very well likely lead to him hurting me again. I don’t know. I still love him and this was my first serious relationship so it’s hard. Giving him another chance means putting my own self respect on the line. I just don’t know what to do.

EDIT: just to add, this is completely out of left field behavior. I always had access to his phone previously (not that I looked through it, but he didn’t ever have anything to hide and would give it to me and I knew his password). He was extremely caring and loving and texted and called me almost every day. We would also go out on dates semi frequently and he got me gifts constantly.

"Before explaining the situation with my (25f) boyfriend (24m), let me add context. I have some sexual trauma from a relationship before my bf, where I was constantly expected to have sex, even being forced to at some points. I didn’t expect that it would hit this hard since that was over 2 years ago.

I love my boyfriend so much. I’ve put my best foot forward in this relationship and I honestly want to marry him. There have been some issues in the time we’ve lived together, such as the distribution of chores and whatnot. However, the biggest thing for me is the sex.

I’ve informed him about my sexual trauma and how it has basically destroyed my sex drive. We’ve had multiple conversations about it. I am often uncomfortable with initiating sex, and have also been unresponsive to his advances when he wants to have sex. The thing is, he has told me he could have sex every day, multiple times a day. Any time we’re alone together, he’ll grab me or cuddle with me and start grinding on me expecting it to lead to sex. However, it’s become so frequent that I’ve stopped having sex with him, and it’s honestly been a few months. I told him that I have a lot of PTSD from my previous relationship, but I can’t tell if it is really just that, or that I’m scared of being expected to fulfill his sexual needs so often. It’s gotten to the point where I have extreme anxiety about sleeping with him because he constantly grabs at me and grinds on me, and when I tell him no he just flips over and goes to sleep. It’s so stupid, I’m crying while I’m writing this.

Idk what to do anymore. I feel like I’m trapped and that no matter how often I tell him to stop, he won’t.

"I (32m) had my whole life crumble last year and I didn't know what to do. I knew I didn't want to stay in the state. My friend (31f) of 13 years offered me a place in a different state. I made sure to ask that I was not disrupting her life as she had a boyfriend and also she shares custody with her ex husband for 3 kids. I knew what I was getting into but I was not as prepared as I thought. Her Boyfriend was not very welcoming and I tried to respect his boundaries but at a certain point they became too much and I ignored them. Seriously one of them was offering them the dinner I cook. It got weird to say the least but I tried to stay out of the way. She ended up breaking up with him. That's when things got a little weird. Or maybe they were already weird but I just didn't notice. Some of the rituals and behaviors that we did prior to her ex became controlling. Now almost 8 months she starting to date. Which is fine. I have no qualms. Obviously a but is coming. My responsibility over the year has only increased and I've taken a more active role watching her kids and over the household in general. With that came her wanting to know what I was doing. When I got to work when I'm going home. I understood when it came to the kids and even when not she didn't want to worry about me. Then I expected the same and I was called controlling when I would ask or engaged in some of the things she would ask of me. So at a certain point I stopped asking. I only except information that's freely given. I didn't want to be seen as controlling so I'm just being passive. Then she started to ditch me while we hung out. She got a phone call and then just left the living room without a word. Though she says she said something. I didn't hear it but I waited and eventually decided to go to bed. Then the other night she went on a date and told me she'd be home to wrap presents. It was a first date and she was picked up. Nobody in our social circle knew who this person was and my anxiety was very high. I asked a friend if he was doing anything and I got invited to a party. It got my mind off for a bit but I won't lie and say I wasn't waiting for her to tell me she was on her way home. Well the party came and went and I was stuck at home waiting. At a certain point I gave up because I got fed up and felt that she had put herself in that position and it isn't my responsibility to make sure she's safe if something happened.  I was a bit upset cause she blew off our plans but I let it go. The next night I was tired cause I took NyQuil due to a cough I've had and I took it later than anticipated so I was drowsy all day. I stopped by the store helped her and her kids put up the tree. I was exhausted so I ended up taking a nap while they made dinner. Im usually in charge of it but they made something instead which I was grateful for. However, when I was woken up to eat I find myself making my own and I get a little grumpy about it because I could have stayed asleep. She made began to give reasons as to why one wasn't made for me. Like she wouldn't know what I would like on it and how I would like it cooked or if I was going to even wake up to eat. It kind of dawned on me that this happens all the time where I put in so much energy and effort and it feels like she has become dependent on that. It also feels like I'm not getting the same energy back. I cook, I watch the kids, I try to keep our place clean. I don't care what our relationship is romantically as I'm just trying to settle my own affairs. If she wants one from me I have told her I am not opposed to it. My issue is I don't know how to communicate that I feel like she is using me. That lately I feel like a placeholder. Like I feel less like a friend or roommate and more like a caretaker. I'm burning out. She has told me that she loves me and that she is so happy that I moved in. It is starting to feel hollow. Like one day I'm gonna come home and she will ask me to leave.

"My ex dumped me a few months ago on our one-year anniversary. I knew it was time, but I was so busy and stressed that I didn't want to bring it up until he did. He was pretty mean, and while I felt bad about myself after, I didn't feel bad about the breakup. I got back on bumble and rebounded hard, looking for guys who were actually interested in me. I went on lots of dates with cool guys but wasn't feeling it. I could feel myself rebounding more and more and almost deleted the app.

Then, I met this one guy. The rebound feeling immediately stopped. I knew when we met that I wanted to date him. I even wanted to kiss him on the first date, which I'd never felt before. I was so attracted to him in ways I've never been attracted to someone before. He was very attracted to me too, and the first month was great with lots of dates and long phone calls.

But, he's really struggling with his mental health. When I met him, he was beginning a downward spiral. He became more open about it, and I noticed him getting more and more distant and down. Still, I didn't know the extent of what he was going through. The last 2 weeks, I felt like a hassle for him. I couldn't tell if he was actually enjoying being around me, and I wasn't going to fight for it. I told him this one night. I can really struggle putting my thoughts into words, so I don't know exactly how I came across. We talked for a little, but he had to run and said we'd talk more the next day.

Two days later, I hadn't heard from him and was worried our talk had pushed him further down. I texted asking if he was okay, and he said he just needed more time to process it and think. By three days, I told him I needed to know or I needed to move on. This didn't get him going at all, and he said he *might* have some time to talk.

I was pissed. I'm so used to giving guys the benefit of the doubt and it's always come back to bite me in the butt. I'll assume they have good intentions and that I can trust them and they walk all over me. I couldn't let it happen again. I figured this guy was trying to ghost me and/or seeing another girl, even after long chats about how shitty it feels to be ghosted and the fact we'd become exclusive. I left him a blunt, albeit harsh, message. I said I wouldn't wait for him to get around to talking to me, how he spoke of monogamy and dating one girl at a time when he was putting me so far on the back burner. I said he needed to get his stuff sorted before we kept dating.

Well, in trying to keep myself from getting hurt, I ended up doing some hurting. Turns out, he is way deeper in the trenches than I knew. He wasn't trying to ghost me, he wasn't dating anyone else, he was just incredibly burnt out and depressed. Honestly, I don't really believe in the ""right person wrong time"" concept EXCEPT when mental health is involved. I've struggled with mine for 10 years and know where he's coming from. We talked about maybe keeping going while he gets through this, but he said he couldn't stop thinking that he can't give me right now what I deserve. So, I told him to call me when he's in a better place, but that I would also miss his company. He said we can still chat and hang out, that he'd welcome that, but I've yet to talk to him again (1 week) or see him  (2.5 weeks). 

There was so much I wanted to say to him but didn't because I couldn't formulate the sentences in the moment. I don't think I even explicitly mentioned why I was so harsh, that I thought he was ghosting/seeing someone else, and that I'd never stood up for myself before now.

I got back on bumble. I noticed he's deleted his account. But, I have no energy to go on more dates. I just miss being around him. I don't know if or when I'll contact him and vice versa. I don't know if he needs his space right now or if he's waiting for me to text him a meme or something. He mentioned having to will himself to talk to people but that he really needs the socialization. I just don't know if he wants it from me.

"So basically my best friend (f17) and I (f17), had a classic falling out. We had been best friends for almost 10 years at this point, but during a birthday trip for one of our mutual friends at an indoor waterpark resort, we had a falling out. I’ll get into that in a second. The reasoning behind it was stupid, but honestly, that friendship had been dying and was basically already in rigor mortis. It didn’t really affect me that much. We had gotten into multiple fights recently, including a physical altercation, and my heart and mind were just out of the friendship before the actual breakup. 

On this trip, her “situationship” had come and so did a couple of other boys. They only stayed for a night. But basically, the whole reason why she hates me now is because this guy, who didn’t have the same understanding as my ex-bestfriend of their relationship, fell asleep on the same bed as me and she assumed that we had sex. I know how it looks, but we only slept in the same bed because that was the only bed available after everyone had already taken everything else. It was late, like 4am, and we weren’t exactly “coherent” (if you know what I mean), but I was coherent enough to know that nothing sexual had happened between me and said boy. She woke up and saw us there and immediately accused me of having sex with him. I couldn’t even get a word in trying to defend myself. I would never stoop that low and I thought she knew that. Things started getting heated, and at that point, I decided to leave because we were both getting aggressive and at this point she wanted to get into a physical fight, which I was VEHEMENTLY against. I got into my car and drove away, all while she’s still threatening me and throwing word vomit on me. 

*I would like to add she is still friends with this boy and they still talk. Weird!


Anyway, since this, we haven’t talked. I knew that she was spreading rumors about me, especially about what happened on this trip, but I knew there wasn’t anything I could do about it. She’s bored and making things up about me because that’s how she can justify her hating me. I swear I have not said a single word about this girl. The only time I have spoken about her is when one of our mutual friends reach out to me telling me that she’s saying something about me. She recently posted a photo on her Snapchat private story of my shirt all cut up and captioned it “Someone send this to [me] and ask her if she wants her shirt back.” Immature and low. There are multiple instances of her doing something not dissimilar to this. But I didn’t do anything about it. I have a great support system, but I have lost friends by her doing. 

Most recently, she befriended my ex-girlfriend (this is a common theme of hers— befriending people who don’t like me on the base of their mutual dislike over me), and they’ve started telling people that I have an STD, specifically, chlamydia. This has started to permeate my social circle and it’s starting to really negatively affect me. Mentally and socially. 

I think it’s a build up of everything and this was the last straw. I don’t know if there’s anything I can do about this, but I really want it to stop and it feels outside of my parameter. Is there anything I can do so that she’s obliged to stop? I have a promising future and I don’t want to lose opportunities due by some disgusting lie.

"Roughly two weeks ago I broke up with my now ex. Together 6 years and lived together for 4. Dogs, a cat, the whole 9. 

Towards the end she got more vindictive. Id fall asleep, she’d grab my phone, and low and behold I find out she texted my coworkers. Called them differing names in the book. Lucky I was able to retain my job. 

That was the nail in the coffin. She thought I was cheating with them. I can confirm I had some cheating ways in my past. We broke up and were off and on a whole lot years ago before she moved in. 

A few days after breaking up with her she try’s texting me. Back in college I used to have a friend who texted her on Snapchat behind my back. Asked her to come hang out. Not a true friend. Called her on FB when she first moved up here. 

She swore to me she never hung out with this dude. Well, fast forward to a few days after the breakup she admits to me she did fuck this dude and his dick “according to her” was bigger than mine. 

I don’t give a rats ass and she damn well said that to try and piss me off. She went on to say that she and him are dating now. How do you move on that quick, or maybe she lied for whatever reason? 

She is for the streets clearly, but it’s been rough getting over it. Especially during the holidays. Dating apps suck. Not looking to date. Just venting on all this.

They werent any voices though they were specifically screaming. Like someone was being tortured typa screaming. I would hear it specifically when i would hear sounds that werent peoples voices. Like the sound of running water in the shower or the sound of my crocs squeaking. 

These voices would also be usually be accompanied by nightmares about war. It was abstract and very hard to understand or explain and yet it felt like there were so many emotions being tossed around. Specifically betrayal and that feeling you get when you fucked up and havent told the other person because you know theyd get mad even though you had good intentions. Yeah that.

"CW: Mentions of suicide, chronic illness

I don't even know where to begin with this. Today is just, absolutely crazy. I've thought about today for years. I've been excited for it, terrified of it, confused by it, angered by it. My ""Golden Birthday"", my official first day being an adult. I've been through so much - depression, car accidents, and very recently a life changing diagnosis, but through it all, I made it here today.

When I was younger, 14-16, I was extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. But despite being in therapy (for anxiety), I hid it well. No one had a clue that the only thing keeping me from committing suicide was the thought of my mother finding my body. We'd been living almost in poverty, bouncing from trailer to townhouse to apartment to condo. We were poor and so lived conservatively. My mother would tell me horror stories of the hardships of adulthood - tiny budgets and aging bodies, realism verses optimism. It didn't help that I was online almost daily, talking to adults who'd tell me their stories and experiences. The thought of becoming an adult gave me every negative emotion you could think of. 

So, I decided at some point during that time, that on my 18th birthday, to save myself from the hardships of life, I'd end it then. Live and enjoy my teenager-hood, but as soon as it was up, I'd die. It seemed genius and foolproof.

But as time went by, going from 16 to 17, things began to change. I found a community full of caring, loving individuals, good people and real friends who, some, I've had for a long time, both online and in person. I still remember meeting up with a bunch of members from the community in person, last summer, going to a sushi/pho place, going to the park after, goofing off, and getting absolutely poured on by a thunderstorm. I look back on that day fondly.

I grew as a person, from a sad little boy to who I am now. I found passion in listening to, studying, and writing classical and film music. I wrote a few stories. I explored nature. Got employed, worked hard, made money and reached goals. Befriended large local figures and networked, made connections. I have some of the greatest artists in my city in contact and a career almost being handed to me. Life was going good.

December 3rd - two weeks ago now - I had been feeling sick for the past month and couldn't figure out what was happening. Blood results came back from an Urgent Care visit. My BGL (Blood Glucose/Sugar Level) was at 440ml/dL. (For context, healthy range is 70-180ml/dL). I needed to go to the ER. That night was all very fuzzy to me - according to the doctors in ICU, when I came in, my BGL was at 579ml/dL. Above 600 was when comas began to happen. My muscles were eating themselves because the sugar in my blood wasn't getting to my cells, and the sugar had basically began to ferment in my body. As my body tried to flush out the sugar with fluids, causing extra liquid in my cranium and my brain to begin swelling. I was within a snickers bar of dying.

December 6th, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, the kind that doesn't go away. I had likely been going through diabetic shock / [DKA](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/diabetic-ketoacidosis.html#:~:text=Diabetic%20ketoacidosis%20(DKA)%20is%20a,cells%20for%20use%20as%20energy) for at least three months, likely much longer. If i was an hour later in the ER, chances are, I'd have died that night.

I sit here in my room now, typing this. I remembered one of my friends asking me yesterday, ""how're you feeling? since tomorrow's your big day."" This is what I said to them:

""*Y'know, something I never would've imagined. I remember in the past if being so scared of being an adult. When I was depressive, I considered committing on my 18th so I'd spare myself the hardships of continued life. Even after dismissing that plan I was so fucking anxious for tomorrow. But after almost dying anyways, I've had so many dumb yet insightful ironies and epiphanies on life and everything*  
*After everything, I'd never expect to feel acceptance, yet here we are. I'm gonna be an adult. After everything, I've gained too much to lose, to simply quit on living. In any case, given everything, I still made it. I can say that with pride. Through depression and anxiety and car accidents and attempted hate crimes and months of diabetic shock, I can say it:* ***I made it****. So I feel acceptance.*""

So as I finish up this post, wondering if anyone will read my shpeel, thinking about my insulin dose for lunch, looking into colleges to study my passions, I'm happy I changed my mind on killing myself today. Because now I know I'll be okay. I have everything I need to be happy and live. And it's not to say life from here on out wont be hard, It'll absolutely be more difficult. But so long as I got my community, my friends and my family, my interests and moral set, and enough insulin to keep me going, I think I'm gonna be just fine.","After everything, I finally, actually made it to my 18th birthday today",18lf761,1702922830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lf761/after_everything_i_finally_actually_made_it_to_my/,

"So our relationship has been quite bad for some time. Frequent fights and arguments, over the tiniest of issues.

 I recently planned a big family trip with our 2 preschool kids. I planned everything - dates, accommodation, flights, activities etc. I didn’t mind that - that has been our entire dynamic while dating and pre-kids. I plan all “fun activities”. I don’t mind. 

But this was the trip I was hoping will help/mend our relationship. We have been having big arguments over the smallest of things. Really inconsequential things like - I said this but he thought I said that and I got angry at his response. And it’s really seriously minor stuff. But the problem is that it’s constant - like literally every week. Some big fight/arguemnt over something really small or petty. But it really affects me. Not so much him. He thinks it’s over something inconsequential hence
It IS inconsequential. I think constant fights over something inconsequential actually means something bigger  

We did have a great time during the trip but the day we got back, we immediately got into a big fight over something really small and petty again. 

the fight upset me so much. to me it felt like the whole family trip and the memory of it was
marred by the stupid fight. to him, it meant nothing. 

I really don’t know what to do. I’m just sad now.

Just adding that I’m not asking for advice, though advice is welcome. I just need to say (or type) it out loud without fear of judgement or ridicule.

"I (m44) was a young single dad for most of my oldest daughter's life. I was 18 when she was born and her mom left when our daughter was just 6 months old. So I was always pretty close to my daughter she is my whole world. 

Fast forward 12/24/13 I'm 34  my daughter (16) got into a car accident caused by a drunk driver and passed away instantly.  It was the day before Christmas the supposed to be happiest time of the year and my whole world had just fell apart.

At that point I had been dating my now wife for almost a year and she helped me A lot during the time she had known my daughter and were getting close. It was hard on both of us but she helped me so much. We eventually got married and ended up having children of our own boy girl twins who are now 5. We keep there big sister memory alive. Even with it being almost 10 years and having other children who are young the holidays will never not be hard on me. 

My wife knows this and even though they're young my kids to an extent know this. Saturday night my sister was having this Christmas party. To be honest I was struggling hard that day with my oldest daughter not being here it's crazy for me to think she would be 26 and a young adult, not a teenager anymore if she was still around. Tbh in certain ways I was bringing down the mood but trying to keep myself distance from everyone else. My sister pulled me aside asking what is my problem, I told her how I was struggling a bit mentally with my oldest passing. She basically told me to get over it because of how long it's been. Saying I can't be sad forever and my oldest daughter would want me to be happy plus I have other children now. I can't believe she said that to be honest.",My sister told me to get over my daughter’s death,18le2w7,1702920092.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18le2w7/my_sister_told_me_to_get_over_my_daughters_death/,
"I’m still kind of in shock so apologies if this post wanders.

For the past few months I’ve known something was off. She’d been isolating herself a lot more, spending more time on her phone than with me, sometimes acting as if it was a chore to spend time together. And I saw how she acted while she was on her phone. Whenever I’d walk by she’d quickly force quit all the apps and open something more innocent like Twitter. Or when we’d be in bed she’d contort herself in a way where I couldn’t see the screen. And I knew she had hidden app folders.

I’d brought up this feeling so many times and every time I was told she was not doing those things and I was imagining it out of my insecurities. Not even that she wasn’t talking to someone else, she’d deny she had even closed out of the apps and swear she’d been sitting in the new one the whole time. I’d started to spiral back into a hole of severe anxiety and depression. I could trust my partner’s word implicitly so therefore I must actually be imagining things. It absolutely destroyed my self esteem and sense of reality. I’d get hurt and not bring it up because I told myself I just imagined it. 

Yesterday she admitted to it. Spent all day upset and talking to her friends and finally at night I got her to talk to me. I was right. She had feelings for her coworker. They had been chatting a lot more than was appropriate. She had sent him photos. Several months ago she physically cheated on me with him, and people in their friend group covered it up while all knew she was in a long term committed relationship. She finally admitted she had been cheating on me for months and gaslighting me about it. 

I told her to leave. At first she said she just had emotional feelings, but that was it. And then she admitted to the physical stuff like kissing, but that was it. And then actually they did go all the way. I was on the fence about trying to work it out at first but when she kept lying to me even when confessing I knew what I had to do. The trust had been broken permanently. I could never take her word again. If she had told me when it happened, cut contact with the other person, and went to therapy together, I would have been open to at least trying to work it out. She called the new guy and he picked her up from our shared apartment we just signed a new lease at for the next year. I so much wanted to hug and kiss her goodbye knowing this was one of the last times I’d see her but I just couldn’t. It wasn’t right. 

I don’t know what happens next. I’ve never felt this kind of betrayal from someone before. We’d known each other for so long and had planned our futures together. And she threw it all away. I guess the first thing I need to do is heal from the lies and learn to love myself again. I know the only thing that can heal this is time but man, this sucks. I don’t know if I’ll ever get a “why”. I don’t know if I’d even want to know why.",My relationship has been a lie,18ldvpy,1702919594.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ldvpy/my_relationship_has_been_a_lie/,
"I went to France for my studies, and to be honest, I really like it there. I missed my family during the first year, but I visit them once a year (they are too far to see them more than that in a year) and now it is the third one. I got used to it. I don't have that many friends but I like living alone, not worrying about others, doing whatever I want.  
The truth is that, they are religious people. One of my older sisters in particular, who sees France as a place of deviance for believers' hearts. Maybe, the fact that I want to stay there and that I became less religious would only prove her point but I can't help it.  
I never got friends with whom I really felt like I was myself where my family lives. It is so little there that the only people enjoy themselves is by talking about each other. I would have to always see the same faces. And I'm an introvert, I don't really enjoy talking to each other, but I like having that chance to construct relationships with people that didn't hear about me or the neighbour's neighbour's of my neighbour.  
At first, I thought I used the excuse of ""but I have to assist to the diploma ceremony"" which is in a year to justify not coming back sooner, and then find a job in France. It's not that easy to find a job where I came from (little place, little job opportunities and a lot of nepotism) so I also thought about using that excuse.  
But it seems like some members of my family think it's okay to return even though I would not have a job. Some of my older sisters did that (coming from France and living under my parent’s rooftop without a job) and it was okay, because at the time my father worked. Now he is too old. I don't want to be a financial burden and most importantly, I want to get my own money, not depending on someone else.  
And it breaks my heart when my younger brothers say things like ""we can do that when you'll come back"". Because I want to be with them, but not in that place. My parents seem a little bit more okay... My father is used to my older step-sisters living in the house and my mother already told me before I left, she was persuaded I would stay there, even though it hurts her.  
  
I don't know what to say without appearing as heartless or someone who abandoned her religion because that is certainly what some of them would think.

He blew up to the point our dogs were shaking and cowering, then later tried to revert to normal. I asked him to calm down and not stress myself or the dogs out. I haven’t been able to tell him but I had signs of a miscarriage (later confirmed) earlier this month. Over the past few months as we’ve tried to repair our marriage we’ve been trying for a baby. I’ve seen my primary and OB multiple times and there is nothing remarkable on my end, I am in overall healthy condition for a baby. I have been asking him to be seen or get checked but each time that ends in an argument. He told me last night that the problem I’m not pregnant is because he doesn’t want to have sex with me, he started shouting that maybe if I wasn’t 300lbs he would want to f*ck me. Here’s the thing, I am not 300lbs. I’m in decent shape and work out multiple times a week. We have sex a few times a week, but still nothing. I finally had it and told him that he is the only one who doesn’t find me attractive and I’m sorry I don’t look like his favorite porn star. I said that I do feel beautiful and while I’m not a tooth pick, that there are multiple people that would love to f*ck me. He laughed and said I’m not a great catch and I’m lazy. I work 40+ hours a week, I do all our cleaning, grocery shopping, laundry cooking and meal prepping. His breakfast, lunch, dinner and coffee are all made and packed by me. Any service appointments and maintenance I schedule and handle. He always screams that I spend too much money- which is true. But I 1. Am the only one buying anything for either for either of us and the house. 2. I pay for a lot of our bills, minus the mortgage.

It feels like all my goals, be it a career, a family, traveling, a house or else, are beyond reach.  
Life to me, especially when I was young, feelt like I would live forever. The end of my school-life feelt like an abstract thing I couldnt really grasp, the school year feelt like forever and Christmas.. gotta wait too long for Christmas. When I finished school, life slowly started to take up speed. Suddenly everything changed. Yeah shure, life lately already introduced parties, I made my driving license and so on, but the living situation, the people around me, all stayed quite similar during my time in school. Now everyones moving, getting jobs, relationships break appart, families have to let their kids go and my second stage of life began. Congrats, I stumbled into adulthood.  
For me coming out of school was a culture shock. My parents werent the most educated, or the richest people, but they always took care of us in every way. They did all the chores, all the planning, or the duties and we could live a carefree and chill childhood. Pampered is the right word I guess. I worked at 2 harsh jobs which were legal for young adults, but they were just shortterm. So overall, life pre 18 was a quite chill thing without much challenges or character growth.  
When I started university, moved out of home and crashed into my first problems: How to run a household? My roommate gotta tell me. How to cook? Youtube had to teach me. How to take care of yourself? I had to figure it out somehow, but in some parts I never really did. When I confronted my parents about why they never taught me anything like that they just said: ""We had to figure it out ourselves too!"" I never was able to wrap my mind around that. Parents should share their knowledge and take time to prepare their kids. But it seems like my grandparents fked that part up and I cant blame them cause they were the post war generation that suffered a lot. But back to my time in university. I was a lost boy in an adult world that doesnt leave much room for fooling around. Society expects you to function and if you dont, you run into problems no matter where you are. 
When I grew up they promised me the world. They said, if you get this degree, you can become whatever you want. No one told me that the degree was just the entry ticket and like 5% of everything I would have to do to succeed. I felt like a peasant in the middle ages that was given a pike, put into the first wave of combat and being that he is invincible; me charging into life like a damn fool.  
So time passed and my life stagnated. I worked in like 10 different side jobs (a club, childcare at a school, cinemas etc.), some for a few weeks, others for years, while studying at University without much success. I lost much friends along the way. I also had a 7 year long toxic relationship with a girl that had an undiagnosed mental illness and who would break me mentally and emotionally. I wouldnt say that she was the cause for my faliure, but she also wasnt helpful. I was vulnerable back then and a good victim for her. If you fail in life again and again your selfesteem is fked; not beyond repair but it takes much to fix that.  
In the meantime, time had slowly advanced to insane speeds. Time flew by, life threw tasks at me like that old guy in ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" threw wrenches at Vince. Some I could handle, others created new problems for me. But time wouldnt slow down ever again.  
The older I got, the more I realized that most of my issues are, on a personal level, self control related and on a broader level money related. - I'm overall quite mentally stable despite it all. After my Ex broke up with me 5 years ago, and after I changed my career path 2 years ago, life got better. I worked on my self in money ways on a shallow level, got into a better position in life, but its just the basics. I still lack selfcontrol, I'm still just in training and not in a fulltime job, I still visit the gym like once every 2 weeks, I still dont sleep enough. - Money is always an issue. If I had money I would have gotten an hair transplant yesterday cause it really looks extremely unattractive (I dont care about it much, but my dating life gives me the feedback). I would have gotten my own flat ( I live in shared flats since 10 years), I would have traveled way more and finally bought the camera I always wanted to get more into videography.  
I will never again listen to the people who say that money isn't important. Money, besides health, is everything. For me it decides if I have to live in a small, moldy appartment, or if I can have a flat or house without health risks, with a good view and much sunlight. Money decides if I gotta walk cause the breaks of my 10 year old bycicle and the steering of my 14 year old car are broken and expensive to repair, or if I can just buy a new, relyable car and dont have any of these problems. I dont have to delay fixing things cause of money issues. It decides wether or not I can go out with friends, how often and to which locations. Can I go on Dates? Can I travel regularly? Can I support my family? Can I build a family? Can I go after my dreams regarding hobbys and skills? There are plenty of hobbys that are expensive af.  
While others in my age have a wife, an fancy af appartment, new cars, the ability to travel often and far and can put money into investments, I cant. While they threw a big, expensive wedding, I had to buy my clothes on Amazon cause I wasnt shure if I could afford them, or had to send them back. I was able to keep it luckily.  
Here I am at 28 (nearly 29), again in a low. I ditched an very important exam today cause I couldnt concentrate on it even tho my life depends on it (can retake it in march). I depend on my parents to fix my car today. My eyesight deteriorated and my glasses dont fit, but I cant buy new ones. I'm like 500€ in debt, but that will be gone after my job pays me a recession-benefit which they lately put on the way. Still no backup money, no investments. I have a stack of papers that I have to sort since like 2 weeks. I wanted to look for a second job to fix my financial problems, but it will take time away which I need to learn for my exams. I procrastinate every day. I havent been on a date since like 2 years, althought I wish for a woman in my life to share it with. I feel lost.  
I could ramble about this topic all day, but there is no use. I have the chance to get my life together if I learn for the two exams in March and Mai. If I fail them, I'm very very fked. This is already my plan C. I also could go to the gym regularly. Its a fancy one, there is no reason not to go. I also have great flatmates which I really like. When they will move out someday, I will miss them dearly; I fear that day.

I think, all I wish for is stability. Stability through selfcontrol, through doing what I need to do (learning, sports, finances etc.), stability through finishing my training and getting a fulltime job, stability through a girlfriend, stability through an own flat. But I make these plans since \~12 years now and I never manage to build the routines and habits necessary. I had so many chances in life and I fear the day I'm too old to turn the wheel around.

"TLDR: my life story as an adult. 

I (19nb) met my now husband (19m) in feb ‘22. We dated until April ‘22 because it was long distance and we had different schedules. I moved out of my moms house in August 2022. I moved in with my grandma and grandpa because things at my moms house were getting rough. She and I would fight every day, and she had different goals for me than what my goals were, and if I didn’t pursue what she wanted me to do, she’d get pissy with me. In September ‘22 I crashed my first car in Dallas, 4 hours from my home. That night I called my husband, who I hadn’t talked to since April, and he stayed on the phone with me all night while I waited for my grandma to come with the trailer so I could take my car back home. We got back together that night and we took everything seriously from there. Before, it was on and off and kind of iffy, but from that moment, I don’t know if we matured during our time apart or if we finally had somewhat matching schedules, but it worked. It was long distance again until December 22. He flew down here and surprised me and we stayed together until January 6, 2023 when he flew back to his home. My grandparents were the first to meet him, and they absolutely adore him. He is everything I could have ever asked for, and more. I won’t go into details here because he deserves his own post. Well, fast forward to June 23. He graduates high school, and his living situation changed. He was kicked out of where he was staying previously. I told my grandma about it, and she and my papa suggested that he could stay here with us, and they would provide him with a safe place to live so that we could be closer, just as long as he helped cook, pay bills, and did adult things. June 12, 2023 he moved in with us. He met my mom and stepdad and my dad and stepmom and all of my siblings. And everyone loves him. My moms kids all call him their brother in law, and in October, he introduced me to his friends online as his wife. We aren’t legally married yet, but we have been talking about it for a long time. We both know we are too young for that, so we plan on getting married at 25, when we mature more. But he is my husband and I am his wife/spouse. He came to halloween and trick or treated with my little siblings, and he came to thanksgiving at my moms and my dads. And we decorated our own Christmas tree this year. But I didn’t get invited to decorate my moms tree this year. They did it last night and they put up my special ornaments without me. And after being sad about it, I realized that it’s a part of growing up. I’m not my moms oldest, but I’m the most mature out of them all, and I’m the one who has gone ahead and started my own family, even if it’s just my husband and I right now. I will always be invited to do holiday stuff with them, but now I’m building my own traditions with my own family. My husband was supportive of me last night. He went and warmed up the living room and turned our tree on, and he made dinner for us both and held me as I was crying. I don’t like being an adult but he makes it more bearable. We talked about what we wanted for dinner this week and what we needed grocery wise, and we talked about what kind of car we wanted because we are a few weeks away from getting our own. We’re getting a pathfinder. We’re having Chinese food tomorrow night, and a shepherds pie on Wednesday and shrimp on Thursday and Salisbury steak on Friday and then the weekends are leftover days or sandwiches or salads or whatever we can do that doesn’t take a lot of work because I work weekends. I love my husband, and even if we aren’t married legally yet, he’s my little family, and we’re going to have some cats once we move into our apartment.

"So, this is really about my brother’s friend, Drew (not real name). He’s kind of a family friend, though, because we’ve all grown up together. And Drew is part of a larger group of friends that my brother and I hang with and have known over the years. We’re all now in our early 50s. 
So, Drew lost his father about six months ago. it turns out that his father had a curable form of cancer and just decided to let it take him. This caused Drew a lot of anguish. 
Now, my brother, did the usual decent thing and send some flowers to the funeral home and I contacted the wife and expressed my condolences. My brother found out that there was to be no service, and that Drew wanted no one to really talk about it. So this may be where things got complicated.
Ever since this has happened, Drew has ghosted both me, and my brother, at an recent event, where a group of our mutual friends were, he was there, and when I said, hello, Drew wouldn’t acknowledge me and walked past me, even though I said, hello again, he completely ignored my brother, even though my brother was standing next to one of our friends playing guitar. 
We are both at a loss as to what to do about this.  I feel like he’s making us pay some weird price because we dared to acknowledge his father‘s passing. We never had any issues before and certainly my brother hasn’t. My brother is frustrated, angry, and hurt.  His larger friend group doesn’t know about what’s what’s going on, and he doesn’t wanna bring it up either. He figures in time perhaps Drew will come to his senses and start talking to my brother again (and me), although I really don’t care. I just find this the reaction after someone’s died. It’s like we’re being punished for acknowledging that somebody died and I don’t understand what to do about it.
We’ve all been invited to a Holiday  party, and have said yes, but we’ve noticed that Drew hasn’t RSVPed yet. I know that after what happened at this former event, I would just give him his space. But my brother and I are both confused as to why we’re being frozen out.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am the 3rd of 4 children my mother had. I was adopted and taken home from the hospital by my grandparents. My birth parents were never really around much. My father moved to Florida to get away from some warrants, and I would see my mother every few weekends when she dropped my older siblings off. I was always told she was selfish and only cared about herself and only came around when she wanted something. From my perspective this made sense, the only time I saw her was when she was offloading the other kids, or asking my grandma for money.

Shortly after my younger brother was born my sister moved in with us. I found out later it was because my mother's boyfriend, father to my younger brother, had been sexually assaulting my sister for years. My mother stayed with him and even chose not to testify at his hearing causing him to be acquitted. From there what little of the relationship existed deteriorated, and I never tried to reach out to my mother because she decided to prioritize my sister's abuser over the rest of the family.

Fast forward to this year. I'm in my 30's now still have a pretty good relationship with my grandmother, and occasionally talk to my mother. She has since left her old boyfriend and is constantly apologizing for how fucked our childhood was. My grandmother and sister were talking about my grandpa and my grandma mentions that they were swingers, talking about how a family friend that has been around for my entire life was one of their partners. This family friend has stayed the night with his wife and my siblings and I have caught them having sex in various rooms around the house as kids.

Last month, my mother drunk texted me and my two older siblings, apologizing for being a shitty mother, and saying that maybe one day we will all sit down and talk about what happened to her to make her the way she is. Very cryptic very vague. When pressed she just keeps hinting that something happened between her and my grandmother when she was 9, and it continued until she got pregnant with my sister at 14. When pressed more after sobering up, she kept insisting that we don't need to know until Grandma is passed so she can live the rest of her life ""happy"". When I ask my grandmother about it, she dodges the question and gets aggressive only wanting to know what my mother told us. From what we are starting to piece together between the two of them, it sounds like my grandmother allowed the ""family friend"" from earlier to SA my mother from the time she was 9 until she was 14. My grandmother still has a relationship with this man. She let me talk about my mother staying with her daughters abuser, even agreeing at how fucked it was while was doing the same fucking thing. Bringing him to family events, around the grandchildren and great grandchildren. At one point he even made a comment to my sister, ""I've already had two generations, now that you're 18 maybe I can have the 3rd.""

I feel disgusted and lost. I don't even know how to begin to process what I'm feeling.

"I (20M) am being accused of grooming my partner(18NB) and it’s really upsetting. 

For context, today is my birthday, I am turning 20 years old. My partner is a year and some months younger than me, so they are 18 turning 19 here soon. We met when we were 17 and 18, and have been together since. However, their ex best friend has been harassing us ever since we started dating to the point that I’ve had to contact police. She at one point tried to accuse me of cheating on my partner with a 14 year old, which was obviously untrue. 

Now, it seems she caught wind of me having a birthday and has done those secret instagram drama pages to say that my partner is 17 and I’m 20, which is obviously not okay. As someone who did date an 18 year old when I was 14, I know how just not okay that is. Unfortunately, her posts have actually gained traction this time and I’m being called horrible things.

"I remembered this moment the other day, and I felt like I had to share it 

So this past summer I (21 F) was living with my ex bestfriend (also 21F) in her apartment. One night she and I got invited to a house party with a bunch military people by a guy she met on bumble. And for those in the military that will understand this, the military base next to us is mostly used for training so all these guys were in tech school AND they were army. So you already know when we got to the house we were met with a lot of drunk idiots (love y’all tho, thanks for serving the country). Now I will say the night was fun. I have a lot of friends and family in the military so it’s a crowd I’m used to being around. We laughed, danced with people, played drinking games and drank as much as you expect two 21 year olds in college to drink (my lightweight ass had like 3 drinks and a shot and she was FEELING IT) 
Now at the end of the night Bumble Guy asked if he could come with us back to the apartment and we agreed since up until that point he had been chill and we figured he could just take an Uber back to base. WELL we’re all in the Uber on the way back with the dude sitting in the front seat and my friend and I in the back. As we’re going I suddenly start to feel something on my foot and I look down and this man had sneakily reached behind the seat and grabbed my ankle and was rubbing it. I was APPALLED. Not only was I not even remotely interested in this great value Fred Figglehorn look alike but my friend WAS RIGHT THERE. Now she didn’t notice and as to not make a scene i simply tugged my ankle away. Now before I lose you I had every single intention to tell my bestie, I just needed a window. When we got to the apartment we all went upstairs sitting around the livingroom. This was when more red flags started appearing. Because not once, but twice, did this man make a slight hint at a threesome. WHICH WAS SO RUDE. Sure my friend and I are bisexual and hot but damn, not all bisexuals friends like having threesomes with each other. Anyway this douche canoe finally excused himself to the bathroom and that’s when my friend and I immediately look to each other knowing we had things to talk about. I told her about what happened in the car and she apologized and we both agreed this man had to go. But the question was how. Asking him to leave???? NO. Too simple, too boring, oh and he’s a man and men are scary. So I, in my drunken state, devised a plan. I looked to my friend just as I hear the man finishing up in the bathroom and told her to just follow my lead. He came out of the bathroom and we continued the night as before then I acted like I suddenly got a phone call and walked out of the room. After waiting for like three minutes, I went back into the other room, looking a bit distressed. Now, there were so many things I could have said. So many scenarios I could’ve gone with, but the one I chose was saying that my dear friend Trevor(fake name) had died tragically. I say this and I start breaking down into tears, legitimate tears. My friend immediately goes along with the bit and takes me into the other room, where I proceeded to start wailing. I cried, and said things like “no, this can’t be happening” “I just heard from him the other day, he can’t be gone” You know all things a person struck with grief would say. Now when my bestie left the room and told the guy he should go some reason this wet sock of a man felt like he HAD to stay and help care for me. As if I needed him when I had my bitch right there. It took her like 10 minutes to convince him to call Uber and then another 15 minutes for the Uber to get to the apartment. For that entire 25 minute period I had to have more commitment to this bit more than anything I’ve ever committed to. I was a grieving woman after all. I laid on my bestfriends floor in her room and I truly wept. I was lost in the moment of my performance and my bestfriend had to check in at one point to make sure that this was still fake. He finally left and I was able to bring my brilliant performance to an end. She blocked him, we busted out the snacks and spent the rest of the night chilling and watching smosh.

"in february of 2022, i watched my mum have a stroke. 

for context, she was 46 at the time (i was 16), no prior health issues, nothing. she's the last person i'd expect it to happen to. i just had to get it off my chest because i've never really talked about it at length.

anyways. i woke up for school like normal, go downstairs for her to do my hair. she was sitting at the kitchen table, not doing anything. when i approached her, she said repeatedly ""i don't think you should go today"". i thought it was odd, but didn't think much of it at the time. she went upstairs for a shower and i stayed in the living room, waiting for her to come back.

after about 15-20 minutes, i got concerned because i couldn't hear the shower running. i went up to see if she was okay, and she was just standing there, not moving. i asked what was wrong and she kept mumbling about how she ""couldn't do it"" and ""didn't know"". i began to panic and went to wake my dad up because something wasn't right. he immediately got up, brought her into their room, sat her down and picked up the phone. 

not too sure what happened next, as i went into my room to get ready for school because i didn't know what to do. when i came out (i was in tears at this point), he was on the phone with 999 and going through the stroke questions they ask you (is their face drooping, etc). she was clearly having a stroke at this point. however, there were no ambulances in our area, which pissed my dad off, so he called my aunt, telling her what was going on. she came over and said she'd take my mum to hospital. all i remember about this part was hugging my mum whilst crying, and then going to school. it was a terrible idea to go to school in the state i was in, but i didn't know what to do. i don't really want to get too into it because it was traumatic and i don't want to relive it.

i went, and it was fucking awful. i cried the entire day. i was so worried that she wouldn't be my mum when she came back. yes, she'd still be my mum, but she wouldn't be the version that she'd been the day before. i kept having all these thoughts, and it just fucking sucked. i was a wreck.

thankfully, she got to hospital before anything really bad happened and was given a surgery that saved her life (and is one of the few who have had it, thanks to the nhs). i remember my dad picking me up from school, and me just crying in his arms when he told me that he'd be okay. she came home two days later, as they weren't sure what caused it and all her tests were okay. she didn't deserve to have that happen, and it hurts to think what she went through.

it's been nearly 2 years, but i can't forget about it. it's left me with a lot of trauma (also had stuff happen to me two months before that really fucked with me), and has really affected me. just writing about it makes me want to cry.",i (17f) watched my mum (48f) have a stroke.,18lbdho,1702913294.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18lbdho/i_17f_watched_my_mum_48f_have_a_stroke/,
"Some background info: My mom used to breed shih tzus (show dogs, pedigreed, not byb) and we ended up with an accidental litter due to a wandering jack russell. 

I think that litter may have been the best mistake of my life. They had them when I was 2 so I grew up with this little raggedy mutt, Charlie. I'm 16 now. He was my unofficial first dog and now I don't really know what to do without him. 

Since he was technically my grandparents dog he died there. But now I feel ill even thinking about going to their house because I know I won't be able to ever see him again. I'm tearing up just writing this. 

It's not that he gone that's the worst part. I knew he'd by dying soon. They didn't even tell me until afterwards. As far as I know he was alive for a full day and nobody told me until afterwards. I'm so upset. I wanted to see him alive one last time.

Here's what I was told, AFTER I'd already spent an hour sobbing because mom told me he died: My granny tried bringing him for a walk and he basically laid down and refused to get up. They brought him back inside and got him comfortable. Ruby (my ""official"" first dog, who was actually supposed to be mine) stayed with him all day, taking care of him. This may sound normal but she is a hyperactive, neurotic mutt that barely listens to me. Besides when it comes to him. I'm not even as upset at the thought of him dying as the fact that they never even bothered to call me until afterwards, probably hours after (mom told me at 8pm and my granddad called me maybe an hour afterwards). 

I feel physically ill. I don't think I'd feel this horrible if I actually got to spend that time with him. This is my first dog that I've lost that I've been close enough to care enough to cry for hours straight for days. Normally I would go up to their house on weekends for a sleepover but I feel like throwing up whenever I even consider it. I love my grandparents but I'm just so upset at them. I was the one who told them a week prior that he was about to die. I cried while talking to my granny saying about how skinny he was and how he was acting really off. He was a little fatass who would jump on my knees until I sat on the  ground for him to rub his head into my side. 

When I called him over he was extremely slow. I tried pulling him closer to me onto my lap (like I usually do) and he got off almost immediately. Ruby just lied there and watched while I pet him and cried into his neck. I've never seen her so well behaved, it was honestly scaring me. 

I'm sorry for the long ramble, he died on the 15th and its currently the 18th. I just feel really lost right now, I haven't been able to go more than a couple hours without breaking down

"Throwaway

I, Daya (37F), got engaged to my boyfriend, Andy (28M), last month and we found out this week that we are pregnant. Though I am excited about everything that is happening, I am equally scared of telling Andy the truth about my past.

The version of my past that he knows: I am an orphan and my parents abandoned me as a baby. I was a troubled teen and never finished school. As a teenager, I got addicted to drugs and had a hard time keeping a stable job throughout my twenties. I also had a series of bad boyfriends throughout my troubled life. I finally got clean at the age of 30 and finally got a stable job when my sponsor recommended me to my current job. 

The truth about my past: I was born and brought up in a good family with my 2 younger siblings. At the age of 12, a 30 year old man started grooming me. I ran away from home with him at the age of 14. He used me as a prostitute, charging his friends to spend a night with me. At 17, he sold me to a brothel where I was drugged up and used by men as they wanted. I was finally rescued by the authorities at the age of 21. When I returned home, my parents were equally relieved and disgusted. I took a job at a restaurant, hoping for a new start. But the manager there raped me and gave me an STD. When I reported to the authorities, he claimed it was consensual. This was too much for my father to bear and he died of a heart attack. His funeral was the last time I contacted my mother and siblings. I left home and I went back to prostitution to feed my drug habits. I tried to get clean multiple times but always failing. At the age of 30, I was able to stay clean. I lied to my sponsor as I couldn't handle my past and stuck to the story ever since.


I decided to remain celibate till age of 34 and when I finally decided to start seeing someone, I asked out my boss, Andy. We started as purely a physical relationship but soon developed feelings for each other. I wanted to tell him the truth but always chickened out before telling him. I was afraid of losing the only good thing to ever happen in my life. When he proposed, I wanted to tell him the truth but again I was afraid of losing my only chance at happiness. I was trying to work up the courage to tell him when I found out about my pregnancy. Seeing Andy so excited about the news, I couldn't tell him.

"TL;DR: hate my job and my Manager, standing long hours for 20-30 hours a week, double standards up the ass.


I hate my job (fast food worker. Not naming the place cause its a very niche chain of restaurants). I'm grateful and blessed that I have one while i go through college, but I'm just overworked and underpaid. I stand outside in the drive thru with my dumb tablet taking orders for customers, standing for 4-8 hours depending on how many hours they put me, with only a 30 minute break. Standing.... for 20-30 hours a week. and if I sit down, which shouldn't matter cause the time to take an order will still be the EXACT SAME AND CUSTOMERS DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK AS LONG AS THEIR FOOD IS MADE AND GIVEN TO THEM, I get yelled at. Despite me having medical papers that says I have bad knees from playing basketball in high school. We can't use our phones, but ohhhhh the managers can. If family or friends come over to the restaurant, we can't sit with them, but when my general manager's third freaking gf or whatever the fuck that bitch he dates is with her screaming little kids (not all his but one is), He just spends hours with them and makes us bring them shit (usually I love kids but they don't fucking control them and they're always yelling and running around the store messing shit up, which guess who has to retuck in the chairs and fix the tables? Me and my coworkers).

Earlier this week in fact, his girfriends daughter who's like 10-13 came up after I clocked out and asked for a fruit punch refill. To which I calmly and nicely said that since I clocked out I couldn't do it, but I was sure someone else would be able to. Then, my general manager grabbed my shoulder as I was walking out to my parent's car who were in a hurry and was like ""oh just get her a refill"" and I said ""I can't though, I clocked out and can't work."" And he said ""well it's nothing really just do it."" To which I had to do it. Now that daughter has the idea that daddy will make any one of us do what she wants. Great parenting right? I hope that if my friends come one day, he keeps that same fucking energy. Cause I feel like I would just lose it.

I dont even curse and im usually a chill guy, but this is how much I get pissed off. As soon as I get another job, I'm quitting. Fuck their 2 weeks (it's not in their policy), and fuck him too. The only people I'll miss are my coworkers, who all work their asses off like me and are chill as hell.

"I have a good wife and family, so I can't really go other places to talk about this.   It's really bothering me, though.

Background: Wife (41F) and I (44M) have been together for ten years and known each other twenty-five.   I'll call her Amber.   Amber has had major medical issues all her life.   I knew this when we dated as teenagers and accepted this when we seriously reconnected as adults.   I knew that her medical issues would be a constant factor in the household.   I do my best to take care of Amber and maintain the house.   She has a lot of bad days and I understand that she can't help it.   On her bad days I make food, take care of the dog, and everything else in the house.   I will check on her ensure that she has all that she needs to be comfortable.

I was raised in a household where we helped with my grandfather as he aged and I had five siblings in the house.   We got sick a lot and had to use low-income remedies because we couldn't afford to go to the doctor unless things got serious.   You learn how to care for sick people in that environment, I guess.

Now to this past weekend: 

I don't get sick often, maybe once or twice a year.   Last Friday night, I was drinking and Amber was not.   She doesn't care for it and doesn't like that I do it.   I didn't drink as much as normal and felt odd.   Saturday, I woke sick.   This wasn't normal, but I just thought, ""I'm getting old and can't drink like I use to.""    Amber had asked me to help her with an online scheduled event at noon.   I got up, helped her though her online event, but still felt very nauseous.   Amber asked that I go to the store and then to her parents' house for a task related to the upcoming holiday.   I told her that I would need to wait until Sunday because I wasn't feeling well.   Amber gave me the attitude of: ""That's what you get for drinking,"" and I felt no compassion.   

When I went back to bed at two, she made a comment sounding like I had ruined the day for her because of my drinking.    

I laid in bed all day, getting little to no sleep.   I was in pain, and made several trips to the bathroom to be sick.   At no point did she check on me.   She came in once when I was sick in the bathroom.   I had to call her on the phone to get her to bring me some medicine because moving hurt and each time I got up, I felt sick enough to vomit.   

She didn't come to bed, saying that she didn't want to put any motion on the bed that might make me sick.   That I did appreciate, but she slept on the separate floor.   She still didn't check on me or even think that I should eat at all.   

Sunday, I was still sick, but mostly in pain and dehydrated.   I pushed myself to sip water and forced myself to eat bland food that I made for myself.   Even though I was still sick and barely moved off the sofa, Amber still wasn't helping me.   She asked me to do a pickup from the store and two more errands because ""they need to get done"".     I pushed through her two errands, but was feeling very rough by the end.   I unloaded the car and that was all that I could do.   

I stayed the rest of the day on the sofa, sipping water and trying to keep pain medication down because my entire chest and stomach hurt.   At no point did she check on me, offer to get my water, or assist me at all.   She even seemed annoyed when the dog needed out and I told her that I couldn't do it.

It's Monday morning.   I'm a little better, but still hurt.   

I just keep thinking of how much I help her and with her medical issues.   She's been around healthcare most of her life.   I can't remember anytime that she's been very helpful when I have been sick.   I thought those were natural skills.  I know that she loves me.   I'm just now realizing that she has no caregiver skills.   This is not a deal breaker or something to divorce over.   I just am now thinking that if I ever need major care that I need to start thinking of alternatives.   

Thanks for listening.   I just needed to get this off my chest because it was bothering me.   Amber has a lot of medical issues and is a good person.

"I don't know how to comprehend my situation, Please bear with me.

Background Info: My Mom(40F) got separated from dad right after she had me, I was I guess 2.(She moved to a different town with me and left dad, not officially divorced) because dad cheated. 
Mom struggled for years, worked small odd jobs and raised me simultaneously as a single mother.
Till I turned 14, Mom decided to finally file for Divorce legally.
(Because all people, including mom's family, grandparents, people here in society were forcing her to get remarried again and settle because she wasn't able to provide for me properly and she used to have real bad emotional breakdowns and provided she was pretty young, 34 at that time, So everyone took this decision and forced on my mom) 

Reluctantly, Mom had no choice. She was just 34 and got married to a man much older, He was 56 at that time(His wife had died recently and he had a daughter) Everyone celebrated, the cost of mom's marriage was taken cared by my mom's parents and uncles. From the day 1 in his house, He totally ignored and denied to call me his stepson, although as promised by him to mom's parents, he paid for my school, for my expenses etc. 

He used to treat mom real bad, even his used to daughter abuse mom on small things, They made mom clean up the house, do all the cooking, iron the clothes everything. He used to physically slap mom if dinner got late by even 10 minutes 😭.
Within months, mom got pregnant with him. Even during pregnancy, he continued the abuse. I used to take care of mom when he wasn't there sometimes. Mom delivered twins! He got very happy, threw a big party. Soon after, again the same abuse and assault started, now mom used to feed, take care of the twin babies along with entire house. I remember when the twins were 16months old, Mom again got pregnant! And 9 months later delived a baby girl! Same cycled continued! 

I remember mom used to cry every night(I know, it might seem to be graphic but trust me I've been experiencing this for years now, right after mom puts the babies to sleep, she checked up on me and then goes to her bedroom, locks the door and soon after her crying starts along with the sex noises and stepdads abusive loud words😑. It's like he physically assault, abuse while having sex with mom everynight and mom just cries and endures it). Now the baby girl Arya also turned 1 and mom again got pregnant 😭. It's like he only married mom to have kids and abuse her. 

I've tried taking to mom's family multiple times, all they say is I should keep all this with me, it's my mom's fate and my mom and I should be thankful to that man(stepdad) that he took my mom in, Remarried her knowing she was divorced, didn't had money and had me to take care off. It's like he did a favour on my mom by doing all this. 
Mom's family, uncles and even mom's friends all turned back on her😭. I don't know how to stop all this, mom is turning 41 almost now. Her spirit seems to be shattered with years of abuse, assault and forced marital sex. She had 4 kids with him, in such a short time span, I really care for her. 

Please give me opinions, what is happening here, is this normal? What mom deserves? What to do, or atleast what my mom can do?

I see constant comments about women over 25 having “expiry” dates and it gets even worse for those over 30.

I’m single and being fed incessant rhetoric that I’m an aging grandmother with no romantic prospects.

"We were high school sweethearts. Got together at 17, lived together since we were 20 and stayed together until we were 26.

  
She came home in tears from a city trip with her friends, I initially assumed someone died or something along those lines. I was dumbfounded when she promptly and tearfully told me she slept with someone else.

  
Once I regained the capacity to form a thought I asked for details, not believing that could be the full truth. There had to be more to it. There wasn't. She just fucked some guy she met at a bar. She wasn't even drunk. The only mitigating factors she brought up, if you can call them that, were that her friends pushed her to do it and that she regretted it before the night was over.

  
I asked if it had been worth it, she said no and I told her that was a shame. I packed a bag and left while she pleaded with me to stay and talk. My brother picked up the rest of my stuff for me later that week. She made attempts to reach out to me, I was mostly content to ignore them but after she showed up at my work looking for me I sent her one message telling her to drop it or I'd get a restraining order. Fun fact: I have no idea how one gets a restraining order or if I qualified, but the threat was enough and I stopped hearing from her.

  
As much as I might have made it sound like I stoically walked away and moved on... Ha. No. I was a fucking mess for months afterwards. I still am a mess, really. My eventual attempts at trying to meet someone amounted to fuck all probably in no small part because of the voice in my head telling me ""If you couldn't trust \*her\*, what makes you think there's anyone you could?"". (I also have no game, which can't have helped.)

  
It had been a bit more than a year and half when I saw her again, last month while out shopping. If I had seen her first, I would have walked away, gone home, spiraled for a couple days, normal shit (yes Reddit, I know I need therapy) (I also know that knowing I need it doesn't make up for not getting therapy). But she saw me first and by the time I registered her coming towards me it was too late to make a break for it.

  
She asked if we could just talk. Just find a place to sit down and talk and that if I wanted to get up and leave at any point she wouldn't try to hold me back. So we talked. She told me there hasn't been a day she didn't hate herself for throwing away what we had, that she wished she could take it back, that she missed me. We also just caught up on the past 18 months. When we parted, she asked if we could see each other again. \*Just to talk\* of course. I think if I had said no, that'd have been it. But I didn't say no.

  
We've met up a handful times since then, in neutral public settings at first until this Saturday when I went over to her place for dinner and a movie. She finally explicitly asked the question that had been implicitly there since beginning: Could I forgive her, could we try again? She bundled that with a request for me to stay the night. I told her I wouldn't be staying and that I had to think about it.

  
I have, of course, already \*been\* thinking about it. For a year and a half give or take and doubly so since I saw her again. Turns out, she's still the person I fell in love with. Still funny, smart, sweet, beautiful. Still the woman I've spent a third of my life with, still the one I have so many memories with. Of course being around her again has been awkward at times but it's also been the happiest I've been in ages.

  
She is also still the one who cheated on me. I'm pretty sure I could let go of the resentment, I'm not quite as sure I could ever really trust her again. But the one thing I know is that I want to. Nothing in this world sounds half as appealing as a future with her where we've put this behind us. On a rational level I don't know that if it can materialize, but the fact I want it to gives away the game. I'm not going to take her back tomorrow but I'm mostly certain I eventually will.

"Trigger warning for mention of SA and assault. 

I’m in my early 20s and I’ve recently reconnected with a friend I had a falling out with a few years ago. We’re both in the same graduating class and were super close back when we used to be friends. 

Our falling out had to do with a lot of stuff but near the end of our friendship she confessed she had been working with her therapist and that she felt she should come clean about the fact she lied about her body count and lied about getting assaulted. She said she did it in order to convince her parents to put her in therapy. 

Well she reached out recently and as much as I don’t trust or even forgive her for what she did. I wanted to give her a chance because she really seemed like she was trying to work on herself, and it felt like it would be in bad faith not to give her a little grace. It seems like she’s going through a tough time right now as well which complicates things. 

Regardless this morning she just told me it was almost the 5 year anniversary of her getting SA, the same thing she told me she lied about years ago. I’m super lost rn on what to do and haven’t said anything yet but at this point I’m even questioning my own memory of the whole situation. 

What’s the best way to broach this without making her feel invalidated or attacked?

"I (F24) am a team leader at the pub I work at. I’ve been at this specific pub for 5 years, but I’ve been in the company overall for almost 7 years. 

Things went South at the beginning of this year when our old pub manager went on maternity leave, and the new pub manager came in. She seemed really nice at first, and portrayed herself as a ‘people manager’, but that clearly isn’t the case anymore. 

She’s very condescending and very unpredictable. Some days she is okay to say hello to, but other days she’s in an awful mood, and if you do something ‘wrong’ in her eyes, she will make sure you and everyone else is aware of it. 

My own issues with the pub weren’t to do with her at first. I was being put on the rota to work 6-8 days in a row without a rest day in between, guilt tripped into coming in early/starting to late, not always getting entire break, and being put on the rota to work when i’d booked the day off months in advance (this has happened 7 times throughout the year, including on my birthday and my aunt’s funeral). 

The issues mentioned above are more down to a male manager who writes the rotas. 

Now onto my current issue. 

Every year, we are asked to work a minimum of 2 days throughout Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, NYE and NYD. We can choose which 2 we want to work, and can have the others off. As always, I said that I am happy to work all of them, only asking for NYE off. 

A few days after that rota was published, I was told (not asked) by a manager that i would be working NYE. I could see no point in arguing, as they had already decided and executed this, so in response i asked for new year’s day off (this rota has only been published today but i was already down to work that day as well). this specific manager said he would look into it, but the pub manager denies him speaking to her about it (i know he did), and he personally has struggled to find time to sort it. 

I did also message the manager who is in charge of the rota and asked if he could please look into it. i expressed that i felt it was unfair that everyone else could have at least one day off but i was having to work all for of them and would have liked to have one of them off if possible. i was trying to get the new year’s day shift sorted before it was published to make it easier for them. 

the rota was due to be published today so i sent him another message just clarifying if it would be okay for me to have off (myself and this manager are friends btw, he’s literally coming to my wedding next year). 5 minutes later i get a message from the pub manager saying “i’ve removed the new year’s day shift that you agreed to take, so please stop messaging other managers and moaning about it. if you didn’t want to work it you should have said no”. 

1. new year’s day wasn’t the day i picked up so she doesn’t even seem to know what’s going on. 

2. i couldn’t say no when i was told, not asked, and they’d already made it official on their end. 

3. it’s my day off and i’m crying and feeling like shit because of her. 

the rota has just been published and i am indeed off on new year’s day now. but, i am only working 14 hours that week, whilst i am contracted to 35, and i feel like she has done this to spite me but i’m too scared to bring it up now. 

what do i do?? 

this place pays really well and i have been looking elsewhere but no where else pays the same and i am already struggling a bit financially as it is. my fiancée has said i can pay less rent and he will cover all of the financial costs but i don’t think this is fair on him so i don’t want him to do it 

myself and my fiancée are moving city in may next year and i was initially going to stick it out until then so i can get a transfer but idk if that’s the best idea anymore it’s been mentally affecting me for months but i just feel like i can’t do it anymore.

"**TW: SA, misogyny, victim blaming**

I (21F) have known my best friend (let's call him Nick) (21M) for over 5 years. I know everything about Nick and he knows everything about me. He knows my history of having experienced SA since childhood. (first my mother's bf m0lested me, a few years later my own brother SA-d me. I've also experienced a lot of SA in public by strangers).

Nick has always been understanding, supportive, compassionate and respectful towards me and my traumatic past. He's also told me sad parts of his life and I've always showed him nothing but support. Recently something happened to him. Ever since he watched The Barbie movie, our conversations entirely changed. We've always had the same opinions on things and he's generally a great person to talk to, but recently he's become strange. He constantly talks to me how the movie was disrespectful towards men and how exaggerated it was.

Most importantly, he found the part where the guys catcall and harass Barbie to be unrealistic and exaggerated. He told me that things like that don't really happen often in real life and that the movie is purposely portraying men as brainless monsters. I assured him that stuff like that do happen in real life on the daily and he went on about how ""it's women's fault for dressing inappropriately which results in SA"". That really caught me off guard. It upset me, given the fact that he knows my history of SA. I told him that I dress modestly but that never really changed anything for me, I still got assaulted. He responded with ""Are you sure that really happened to you tho?"". I was crying at that point and he was acting like he said nothing wrong. I ended the call with him that night. Later mutual friend of ours let me know that Nick went to him to rant about our talk afterwards: ""They dress like sluts, then cry when they get assaulted and then they hate all men for it."". Nick also told our friend that women always want to be victims and that the most oppressed group of people are the straight white men. Mind you, Nick has never said such things before, neither to me or our friend.

I confronted Nick about everything afterwards. He kept telling me that The Barbie movie is brainwashing young girls into hating men and the patriarchy, as he believes the patriarchy is a good thing. He also voiced his disgust about the way the movie tries to discourage young girls from having children in the future and encouraging them to become old sad single cat ladies, as if that's a bad thing. I was baffled and straight up told him that I do not wish to talk to him unless he becomes a better person.

About the SA part, he still believed that it doesn't happen that often, and if it does, women should just ""get over it"". His main argument was: ""It has happened to my mother and to my grandmother, but they have never cried over it because they had more important things in life to worry about. You should just move on."". The last nail in the coffin was when he told me that my shared experiences of SA have always upset and burdened him. Even though for all those years he has never expressed that before. I'd completely understand if he had told me earlier, I'd never want to upset him. He kept denying SA and dismissing victims.

In the end, he told me that I need to go outside more and that I'm detached from reality. He believes that I have radicalized myself for simply liking the movie and having opinions on issues such as SA and domestic violence.  
The funniest part is that I have never said anything bad about men, yet he believes I'm a radicalized misandrist. Even when talking about my SA experiences, I have never demonized or bashed ALL men. It's like he is defending himself against an entity that he's convinced is after him. Meanwhile, no one is blaming HIM for anything, no one is implying anything about HIM. Yet he acts as if The Barbie movie was criticizing him personally in some way, his projection getting in the way of his critical thinking I presume. And to that I say **""If the shoe fits...""**

Needless to say, I cut Nick off of my life shortly after. Cold turkey. It hurts, because he has been my best friend for so many years, but I also feel good. Keeping him in my life would have resulted in resentment and pain. He sometimes tries to reach out and I always respond with dry/short texts or I don't respond at all. I'll always be baffled how a movie about a doll prompted him to become so strange. How a pink themed girly movie unleashed such anger in him. It leads me to believe that he has always been this way and thanks to the Barbie movie, I managed to see his true colors for real. For all that, I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive him. I only hope he one day grows as a person.

     And I know someone’s going to say “talk to him, how will he know if you don’t tell him?” I have, sure he’ll take the criticism and fix the attitude for about a week, but then within the next week he’ll go back to his old behaviors. And I’m just so tired of it. Tired of not trying to snap at him. Tired of constantly apologizing for being to harsh with the truth which hurts his feelings. Tired for not being appreciated. Tired of being used. Tired of explaining why I’m still with him.

"I had shared a class with a girl that I thought was very beautiful and interesting. I genuinely had not felt that attracted to another woman since my ex and I dated. She was pretty, dressed nice, had a lovely voice, I had the impression that she was really smart as she talked during our discussion groups. Just overall interesting. 

I kept getting cold feet and chickening out when I wanted to talk to her. I didn’t know how to approach her by either initiating a conversation or asking her out as I honestly don’t have a history of doing either. 

I some how convinced myself that she probably was dating someone already or would be bothered by me or something similar. 

She would quite often leave the class before I could catch her or I had to catch the bus quickly. I keep thinking about how I didn’t try and it’s actually bumming me out more than it should.

"Hello everyone. I'm 29M and had some highs and lows on my life. The same as most people: distant parent pictures, no friends on school, moved from house to house a lot of times and, since I remember, I always felt like and intruder: like I every feeling that I've had is fake, like I changed personalities based on my environment and people around me. When I was with my mom I was one person, with my father another one, on school another one. But the feeling of emptiness always stuck around, ever growing, relentlessly.
When I turned 19 I found a gf and begun my downward spiral.
Before continuing I must say: it wasn't her fault anything that happened to me (at least most of it), it was my own choices. She just made it easier.
Begun using pot to run away from my feelings and, later, coke. Never actually became really addicted, even after using it for a long time. When I decided to stop, I just stopped and that was it. But I miss it because it helped me stop with my thoughts. Today I'm clean.

A couple of years ago, after my breakup, I started rediscovering myself. Started painting my nails, using lipstick, wearing skirts. I was happy with who I was, for the first time in my whole life. And started seeing a guy.
That was the start of another downfall. My neighbour saw and started harassing us. Tried to break into my house. Run his car over me. Follow me on the street. Curse me when I was going to work. Curse when I was coming back from work. And hunted me with a knife (I don't know the English word for this but here we call it a ""facão"" or ""pexeira"").
It destroyed me, my self esteem. I can't use skirts anymore, I don't feel good. I don't use makeup, somethings blocking me.
Recently started dating another girl and she's perfect. She accepted the fact that, after those things, I don't feel good having sex anymore (we still do but on a low frequency). She accepted all my problems and is helping me through it.
Now I started going to therapist. She diagnosed me with borderline. And I'm having a rough time. Because I wanna tell my gf that I don't feel fine. That I never, in my whole life, felt okay. I'm happy with her but is something bigger than her and I don't know how much can I keep going. Looks like I have a vacuum inside me and there's another me, instigating me to jump from a building, in front of a car, cut myself and honestly? I wanna do it, I feel something I never felt when I think about doing it but I DONT WANT IT. I WANNA LIVE GOD DAMN IT.
My therapist said that maybe I need to take some pills. My gf is against it because she fears that I'll become addicted. I understand her worries but I'm afraid I won't be able to deal with myself anymore. I wanna live but at the same time I wanna die soo much.

"I “broke up” with a friend almost three months ago. We were friends for almost 7 years. She saw me as her best friend, I think at some point I was thinking the same. We vere close, we travelled together more than once and we knew each other’s family. 

2 years ago she started dating my boyfriend’s very close friend. We were hanging out together, went on vacations etc. Their relationship was unfortunately very toxic. They dated for about 6 months and she was in pain all the time. She would call me and tell me everything bad about their relationship for hours almost everyday. I was far from judgemental, I tried my best to give advice, or just listen and nod most of the time. Supporting her. They broke up but it didn’t stop there. The went on and off for a long long time. And I was there, knowing every single detail of their relationship, even though I didn’t want to. I sometimes said “Look I know it’s a hard time of your life and I want to be there for you. But I don’t want to know every single bad thing.” Her ex is still my friend too. She didn’t really respect my wishes and got petty with them. She would even call me when I was out on a vacation and chilling by the sea and tell me everything over and over again. I would tell her that I was busy but she didn’t really take a hint. I was stupid and wasted my time listening to a person that just wouldn’t respect my boundaries. 

Over time, she kind of let go of her ex. But this time she was just all about herself. Her career, her money, her friends, her success etc. Her career was the most important thing this world could ever see. The amount of success she had was crazy and everyone should’ve known about it. She always expected me to listen to everything because I was “her best friend”. I was supposed to hate everyone she did. She wanted to be closer with every close friend of mine. But she didn’t want me to be too close with her friends. She enjoyed being the “most loved” and a person that has “too many friends”. She would brag about how many friends she had, how many people watch and like her Instagram stories, how many guys DM’ed her and how many follower requests she gets. She would compare herself to me either. She would say “This is the first year of my career and I’m making all these money already.” I always thought she had very hard times and now she was having a good time, so I let all these go, for a longer time than I should’ve. I stopped telling her stuff. I just didn’t want to. She didn’t realize that for a whole year. When I told her something very important to me, she always had something more important to talk about and would talk about that instead. 

It all came to and end. She had a new bf for a few months and everything was fine. One day she called me and told me she cheated on him with a married man who she was working with. She was okay with it. She didn’t care whether the man is married or that she had a boyfriend. She told me “It was actually pretty good.”. I always knew that she was self centered, but this was a new level. Then it kind of got worse. When she first told me about that night in the morning, she remembered every single detail, I know because she told me that like a victory. I became a little cold and distant for like two days. Then she called me and told me that she thinks she was a victim of sexual assault and  she doesn’t remember the night. I told her that she did and she told me 36 hours ago, but if she really thinks that she should press charges and probably inform their boss. She didn’t do any of these. Three months passed and she still works there and she is very much friends with that guy who assaulted her. I think she lied because I was getting distant. When she told me about it I also felt that it was a lie. And I hope it is a lie and she didn’t live through that nightmare. I never told her that I didn’t believe her, of course. That was the point where I decided that I was not going to be friends with this person, despite loving her still, because she was self-centered, dramatic and used our friendship against me to create an obligation for me to always listen to her and support her without getting anything back. 

There is more times when she hurt me and when I told her she didn’t care or apologize but they’re too long to write about. 

I have a few regrets. I think I should’ve talked to her about her behaviour change towards me. I just expected her to realize I was lost within the relationship we had and that was unfair. Maybe she would take actions and we would still be friends. She had a hard time taking criticism and that’s why I never had a serious talk with her. That was wrong of me. 

She was a lovely person before that and I still remember her as social, cheerfull person. She was generous with money and she loved having fun. Sometimes when I look back I wonder if I was wrong for ending it. I miss our fun times. Maybe I was too harsh but idk. 

I know it’s long. I just wanted to get this out of my chest and I want this to stay here so when I miss her, I can read this post as a reminder why I did what I did.",I ended a friendship and I have some doubts.,18l89tq,1702904862.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l89tq/i_ended_a_friendship_and_i_have_some_doubts/,
"Dated some guy a couple months back and we met over a common game. We would all have our mics on and my ex, unfazed, would take a very loud and audioable shit and piss. It was gross, but I mean most of my guy friends do the same so it didn't bother me as much. The issue I had was that he did this when we had strangers in the lobby and it would just be awkward silence in the middle of our conversation as he loudly does his business. 

I wouldn't have cared too much if we were all with close friends. And on top of that as he was doing his business, people were straight up debating if he wiped since he clearly took a dump and flushed immediately after. I was super embarrassed and didn't say anything. 

I confronted him about it when we were alone. He at first claimed that he ""quickly muted himself to wipe"" and I said, ""Okay buddy you don't need to lie. I was there when it happened and there was no muting going on."" He then said, ""okay okay yeah I didn't wipe. But I don't wipe myself because I take a shower everyday anyways."" From what I know so far, he truly does take a shower everyday. But I was still shocked and said that while taking a shower is good, wiping your ass is still just as essential, and it only takes a couple seconds. I don't understand how someone isn't able to wipe.

"First time posting, long time lurking here.


My old best friend and I stopped talking a few months ago. We had a bit of a weird friendship as for the last two years we had been crushing on each other but not yet ready to confront our feelings.


She got a girlfriend around the time we stopped talking. Her girlfriend had a few issues with past partners and infidelity, and found out that my friend and I had a history (crushes), so she wished that my friend not see me alone and only in a group of friends. My friend agreed to it.


This really rubbed me the wrong way, it felt like I barely mattered to her all of a sudden. I was very glad she had started dating someone, truly, but being told I wasn't allowed to see her as I usually did felt like a betrayal. I never would've done anything that would have crossed boundaries, but she was my best friend and we used to go see movies or get coffee and chat about Zelda games.


We spoke about it and didn't fully resolve the issue, but during that time I had a depressive episode. During depressive episodes I tend to withdraw from everything around me and spend time alone in self loathing. I told her I would see her in a two weeks but didn't elaborate any further. We had a plan to go to a party with mutual friends at this time. I forced myself to go there just to see her and everything was fine, until she didn't say goodbye to me. I thought she may have needed space. I figured I wasn't allowed to message her, it might've come across wrong to her new girlfriend, so I messaged the group chat a while later to see if people wanted to hang. She didn't respond nor read the messages. I tried a few more times but since then she's blocked me on everything.


It's been a few months and I've been mourning our friendship, going to therapy and doing EMDR. It's been hard but I'm starting to see a difference.


EXCEPT:


I found out a few days ago that she's been talking to mutual friends about me. Saying a whole bunch of really hurtful things and things that aren't true. Stuff along the lines of how no one should be my friend because I hated everyone, that I never supported her new relationship and I was toxic. None of these accusations are true, I had to show mutual friends my messages as proof(not screenshots but actually physically scrolling through). I just feel so empty. I feel worried about her as she doesn't act out like this. I feel like I've triggered her abandonment issues by not properly communicating. And I should be mad about her saying all these lies but I'm just so heartbroken and disappointed.


A mutual friend of ours told me all the things she said and said he didn't believe they were true and wanted to ask if I was ok. I'm so thankful to have friends that believe me. I'm the type of person who can never forgive themselves if they hurt others they care about, I was so worried that maybe I was a horrible person. But I know I wasn't.


I've barely been able to eat the last few days because I feel so depressed. I'm so worried about my old friend.

"“Pop Therapy culture” is such a turn off for me nowadays. I’m a guy in his late 20s and I’ve had many conversations on Bumble in the last few months but honestly, almost all of them were driven with jokes of “huh that’s a redflag haha” or a lack of general understanding of how therapy works and how a strong, real relationship should look like.

It seems like online dating is flooded with badly interpreted second hand counseling nowadays. I’ve been in therapy for three years now and it’s so easy to spot a person that actually did it too or a person that has no idea about what they’re talking about.

Usually the lack of vulnerability and genuine communication is a key giveaway in my experience.

People are gonna have red flags. We all have them. We can’t perfectly reverse all of our past and upcoming trauma, but we can try and strive to keep it in check while maintaining respect for our partner. There are also gonna be green flags. It really depends at the end of the day what your limits are and what you’re willing to accept or not. But stop making jokes or allusions that what I said might be a red flag. Why are you not vulnerable and straight up ask me if what I said might be a concerning thing for you instead of beating around the bush?

People expect you to communicate if something’s not going right and they don’t want you to ghost them, but when you actually show up and vulnerably &amp; respectfully explain your reasons for not wanting to go forward, you’re usually either left on “Read” or faced with passive aggression from them.

I’m not saying that happens in 100% of the times. I’ve also had mature interactions too where we just did not click.

But most of my conversations were with wannabe “woke” chicks of my age that just discovered the art of searching therapy quotes on goodreads and magically “incorporated” them into their lives, without putting the actual work in with a real therapist.

On the other hand, I’ve heard from my female friends that online dating is even harder for them as there are many assholes lingering on these apps. So I don’t really know.

But anyways, especially since the pandemic, it seems that we are so scared to form new genuine connections. And I don’t blame people for having so much anxiety after all of the global events that have happened recently. I have it too and it’s hard to get back to how things were (it would be pretty sad imo if this would be the “permanent” upcoming normality from now on).

I just miss us being open to connect more in real life instead of relying on dating apps and fearing that for every bad move we make, there’s gonna be a person that records it and uploads it on social media.

"Just a few days ago I saw a post about someone who planned to end their life. This person said that they prepared for everything: told their wife (who understands and is fine with it), got the necessary legal and professional assistance to make sure business keeps going and family left behind is set for life, and laid the groundwork for fake heart problems so children will instead know the cause of death as a heart attack. Regardless if this post is real or not, a lot of people in the comments were downright hostile saying that OP is selfish for what they were planning to do.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m an advocate for mental health and understand that most people who often say “Suicide is incredibly cowardly and just passing your pain to others” and “You’re so selfish, just think about what the lives of others around you will be like if you go through with that bs”just want to help and discourage suicidal people from taking their own life. However, the approach often does more harm than good because:

1. Suicidal people are already aware that what they are doing might be selfish to some degree and that it will hurt people. It’s not like they need other people to tell them that. Just imagine how much pain they’re in and how resolute they must be for them to still consider offing themselves WHILE knowing that it will hurt people around them. Suicidal people don’t need other people to tell them that, especially in a hostile manner. 
2. From my observation, people who say these lines are usually those who do not have an idea what it’s like to be mentally unwell or suicidal, making their statements lack genuineness since they don’t understand the thoughts and feelings of a suicidal person. No one who knows what it’s like to be suicidal will make other suicidal people feel selfish, knowing it does more harm than good.
3. If these people expect suicidal people to be like “Oh no, they’re right. What I’m planning is selfish and I should get help and stop this at once” is living in a pipe dream. What is more likely to happen is suicidal people feeling even worse about themselves after being called selfish and cowardly, which might make them even more determined to end things.

It’s quite a long post but I believe this needed to be said. Just because you did something with a good intention doesn’t mean it will be delivered and received in a good way. Especially with sensitive situations, and in this case, one that is literally life-and-death.

EDIT: I initially wanted to leave this post alone after submitting it, but changed my mind after some commenters missed the whole point of the post. Some even unironically proved how hostile and apathetic people can be to the feelings of others contemplating suicide. I wanted to make these points clear:

1. People going through suicidal ideation can be helped better by being sympathetic and understanding. Not by invalidating their feelings and telling them they’re being selfish and cowardly. Suicide is a touchy subject, so talking about it should be approached with utmost care, ESPECIALLY for those who do not know what it feels like.
2. This post is not an argument about whether or not taking one’s own life is selfish. By definition, it is a selfish act since it is a decision someone makes for their own benefit. BUT AGAIN, someone suicidal doesn’t need others to tell them that. That someone probably spent an ungodly amount of time pondering on whether to go through with it, and you think they haven’t realized that it’s a selfish decision?
3. It’s not as easy as “taking own life and leaving others to suffer bad, staying for the sake of others good.” It’s a lot more nuanced than that. There are a lot of other factors to consider, ESPECIALLY the feelings of the one wanting to end things. A lot of redditors sadly seem to lack the thinking prowess 
required to understand just how complex this is.

"tldr ; being overfed, cant do anything about it, ruining my body

i come from a background where its offensive not to finish your plate. my grandparents are usually the ones setting my meals and i have 0 control over how much i eat. 

i really do love the food my grandma makes but she just gives too much. i have tried sounding out to her multiple times that it would be great if she could decrease the portion and she always acknowledges it by saying yesyes and such but the portion never decreases
it honestly breaks my heart telling my own grandma shes giving me too much food as as well

i have asked my mom for advice and she said theres nothing that can be done and 'old people are like that'

ever since a baby i have been overfed by my grandma and it has led to me being rather fat and i dont know how to get rid of the fat. i do really appreciate my grandmas efforts in keeping me fed but i cant do this anymore

i also focus much on academics (parents forced), so there isnt that much time for me to go for exercise during weekdays or weekends but i can do workouts after midnight in my room? do drop some useful workouts to burn fat

"i’m a 20m and a little over 5 months ago two of my boys and i went clubbing. we get to the club grab a booth and get lit. near the end of the club’s hours a group of chicks invite us to a house party, we say fuck it and head are drunk asses out. we grab some food and reach the party, we head in and it’s kinda dead but it’s chill. at this point it’s around 3:30am  i’m tired, and feel like shit. i decide to check out the house, i head upstairs and into a bedroom and into its washroom. this is where shit is about to go south.

this blue eyed blonde sneaks up on me and starts talking to me. i had seen her staring at me a few times earlier. this chick seems chill and talk for about 15 minutes, the whole time i could tell she was trying to flirt and get close to me and out of nowhere she starts kissing me and touches me in the no no area (btw i didn’t lead her on) i told her to back off and that i’m leaving but then she drops a bomb like she was mf oppenheimer or some shit and says that if i didn’t have sex with her she would run out screaming and tell everyone that i tried to rape her. 

at that moment i completely sobered up and thought about what the best possible solution would be. i thought that if i walk out nobody would believe me except my boys and even if people believed me regardless the allegation alone could ruin my career because i had seen it happen to other dudes, so i decided to give in. it was surreal because when i wouldn’t put in effort she would say she would stop and go tell people i raped her so i had to actually give it my all and even made me finish in her. 

crazy thing about it is that she came off traditional, didn’t wear revealing clothes, no crazy amount of makeup, etc. i never felt so powerless not because of her but because of society. i could’ve easily overpowered her. after all that i found my buddies and left. i never got her name or nothing. i feel like if i report it would be just another thing to stress about and still could potentially ruin my career or at least ruin my social status. also if i even report it would be my word against hers, best case scenario would be they find evidence of her admitting to it and even then i feel like no justice would be served. 

i decided that i’m not going to report it, i keep telling myself that it’s all good and that she was pretty cute and that she was a solid 7 or 7.5 so it was alright. i honestly don’t know how to feel, on one side it feels nice that someone was interested in me but at the same time i feel a little taken advantage of.

"For many years I have had depression. Last August or so, I found something I truly love and have passion for. That's when my appetite started to really grow, I guess.

This might sound odd, but for years, after a bowel movement, I'd shower. It was a sensory thing, that even though I would keep the toilet and myself clean, I would never feel truly clean until I took a shower (even with a bidet). It got to the point where I'd get itchy if I didn't shower after, probably a mental thing, I dunno. I used to eat 1 meal every 2 days or so, maybe snacks in between, but when I started to eat more, my body seemed to keep up, and I would go to the toilet more. That meant I also started to take more showers.

I used to have almost perfect skin that didn't need much attention (I just washed with bar soap and shampoo), so I wasn't prepared for all the problems that taking 1+ showers a day would bring. I used to take a shower every other day because I knew my skin would really dry out, and I hated using lotion. Another sensory thing.

And as I expected, my skin started to get really dry. Any movement was painful. Then I guess the skin on my face got infected with something, even though for years I would never touch my face unless it was to wash it and would never let anyone else touch it. Acne started to cover my face over the next few months, and I didn't know why, despite all my best efforts to prevent it.

I was reluctant to use acne products on my face because I never needed to and thought it would go away. Before, if I ever got a pimple, it was often gone within a day. But after a year of increasingly bad acne, I caved and bought acne wash and facial lotion to try out. At first it seemed like the acne was going away after a couple weeks, but then it started to get even worse than before. Then I would get to the last drops of the products' containers and my acne was still increasingly bad.

At around a couple months before buying the acne products, the dryness of the skin on other parts of my body started to make me itchy. I caved again and also bought body lotion to try out. At first it also helped with the itching which kept me up at night. Then in its place, I was instead kept awake because the lotion would make me feel like I was hot and sweating.

Then eventually my clothes started my make me itchy. I think the lotion would stick to my clothes and collect dust, dirt, etc. on the inside. This probably made it hard for the washer to clean it properly. I started recently to wash everything inside out after realizing that, but now every single seam or fold pressed against my skin would make me itchy. I'm also not confident the dryer works properly even with the filters cleaned because I still find dust stuck to my clothes. A lint roller would probably help that, but I keep forgetting to buy one.

Over time, with various cleaning products and techniques, my skin would still get worse and worse. It's at the point where the acne has spread to my back, stomach, chest, and shoulder areas, and I'm sooo frustrated and sad. I try to be so gentle with washing the affected areas, but the slightest pressure pops multiple pimples. Nothing I try works.

My eyebrow area has swollen up from something, but when I try to stop using the acne wash and lotion for a couple weeks to see if the swelling would subside, it wouldn't. My eyes look more sunken from the swelling and the lack of sleep. I try to stop using body lotion for a day to see if that might be the problem with my body acne, but then I get itchy from dryness. I don't know what to do

Now that I've developed an appetite, I'm just ALWAYS hungry, and I hate it. I look in the mirror, and I see everything that has changed, and I really don't know who I'm seeing anymore. Honestly, at least before, I could feel confidence in my looks. It's so bad I can't even concentrate on the thing that made me happy in the first place.

"I have known this guy since we were in the army (not US) together, and that's a long time - let's just say we're old enough to remember the administration of Bush Snr.

But I am considering cutting this guy out of my life. The shit doesn't stop and I'm tired of helping.

After we left the army, he started some MLM type business involving health supplements. He invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, and set up some kind of heath bar / gym membership thing. I paid him for a $3,000 a year membership that I barely used, just to help a bit.

Then his wife found out he'd secretly used her savings to fund his business; and their family was broke. I had to lend him $5,000 just so his daughters could afford their school fees one year.

Then the business went under because one of his employees ran off with around $70,000 - all because he gave her all the access to the banks, and put her in charge of everything (because he was too busy networking and ""growing the business"" to actually run it).


So now his wife was mainly supporting him, while I tried to get him a job. He went through four jobs in one year, each time
complaining the bosses were bad, they were not ethical, etc.

Recently we found out he had a second family his wife didn't know about, in Thailand. And a lot of the money she gave him was going to them.

Cue divorce, and now he's asking me if I can invest in some bakery he's setting up (he knows nothing about baking but he has a ""friend"" who does).

"I feel bad somehow, even though I probably didn't even do anything wrong on a rational level. But I should give a bit of context first. My boyfriend has always had a lower sex drive than me. Which was ok. It just meant that if I wanted to have sex I had to initiate it. There were phases when his sex drive was higher. But when it was more stressful times, he never initiated sex.

I suppose he was too distracted by the stress to even think about sex and would never have been able to enjoy it. I really love him very much. He treats me really well. He treats me like I'm his queen. And he deserves the best in return.

But when we had sex the other day, I noticed for the first time that he didn't seem to be in the mood at all. He seemed distracted and had a look on his face that told me he wasn't enjoying it. I had initiated it this time but thought it would be ok for him because he had joined in at the beginning. I asked him if everything was ok. As if out of a trance, he reacted with surprise and said: ""Yes, of course, I'm sorry. Continue"". I was at the top at this time.

But then it happened again that he seemed absent and I asked again. He looked down with an ashamed expression and asked if maybe we could just cuddle, order something to eat and watch a movie. I stopped immediately and made it clear to him that that was totally fine with me.I then asked him why he didn't tell me at the beginning that he didn't feel like it. He said he didn't want to hurt my feelings or make me feel like he didn't think I was the most attractive woman in the world.

I asked him if it was the first time he didn't really want to and he admitted that there were a few times when he didn't really want to but didn't want to tell me.

So he’s a veteran, he was also a trucker (OTR) and at the time, I didn’t know he was very conniving, manipulative, and a narcissist.

My other mama drove me to the hospital, waited and drove me home, while my ex mother-in-law watched my other kids, and he was very cold towards me, and when it came time to lay my baby to rest, I decided that I was going to intern her at the veterans cemetery in the columbarium. He knew three weeks ahead of time for date that we were going to inter her.

"**Notice:** *I realize this post might sound very strange to some of you. Honestly, I feel I might be the only person on the planet who does this sort of thing. Still, I assure you that this ripping definitely does happen.*

I've been doing it for the past twenty years, starting when I was at a party in 3rd Grade. I favor ripping my thumbs, pointer fingers, and middle fingers. My ring fingers get a minor bit of ripping by the nails, and my pinkies remain unharmed.

I'm not sure why, but I really enjoying doing it. Usually, I'd start by pulling on something next to my nails, and then I'd try to pull some of the ripped up area to ""even it out"". Ripping the white parts that cover a recently ripped area are great since ripping those tend to be painless (and feel great), though ripping new areas has a chance of being a little bloody. If the blood is covering up a noticeable part of the fingertip, I suck on it until the bleeding stops.

What I rip off are tiny strands of skin that vary from around half to a full centimeter, but are extremely thin. I commonly leave behind these pieces of skin behind when I'm done playing with them. Sometimes, I like to poke my face with the pieces because it's ticklish when no one's looking. The pieces are indistinguishable from dust or crumbs unless someone looks really closely, so I am in very little danger of being discovered that I leave such ""droppings"" behind.

My fingers generally look okay, including the fingertips, though there are some tiny splotches of red where I was really active with my ripping. People don't tend to notice the ripping unless I actually show them my fingertips - my parents tried to give me gloves and some medicine when they figured it out in my teenage years. The only time people can really see the ripping I did is when I get my hands wet - the ripped areas, unlike the rest of my hands, look almost completely white. Interestingly, this gives me the opportunity to rip up more areas because I can see the rippable portions really well at that point.

I barely even realize when I'm ripping these days. While I do still have feeling in my fingertips, it certainly has a unique feel compared to the rest of my skin - the ripped areas can certainly feel pressure, though they seem to have trouble detecting moisture.",I Rip My Fingers,18l50q2,1702892954.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l50q2/i_rip_my_fingers/,
"The other night, a local film festival took place that I have worked so hard to make content for and I was looking forward to it for a long time. This night meant a lot to me. Mere minutes before we had to leave, my boyfriend confronted me about how I hadn't been doing the laundry/my share of chores in a timely fashion (I was too focused on the film I was trying to complete and laundry ended up taking me 12 hours. Big mistake on my part). Not only that but there was an entire load I missed and still needed to be washed. He was also upset that we hadn't been intimate in a few days and reacted with frustration and anger. I hate when he does that, it doesn't exactly make me want to do it. Not only that, but it is a bit triggering to me for personal reasons. So the anger about no intimacy kind of hit me in a soft spot. Soon enough, my hurt also turned into anger but we had to leave right at that moment so I bit my lip, dabbed my eyes, put on a neutral face and we left.  

Me and my boyfriend and I's mutual friend had to be dropped off early together because he was manning the door and I was a creator, so we walked from the drop off to the event building together alone. He could tell I was upset and something I despise about myself is if anyone asks if I am ok, it is over for me I am going to break down crying. Even if I don't think I am upset, I will become upset idk why. But I was already on the verge of tears and he asked the damned question so I started to hide my face and bawl. I was mortified, I never wanted to cry in front of this person. He expressed concern for me and I would have given him an answer, but talking about it would have only made me blubber and sob harder and become inaudible. All I wanted to do was stop crying so I firmly told him ""just don't ask about it."" He apologized and we continued to the event. I walked in, felt awkward walking around with visible signs of crying, and walked outside alone for a bit to cry it out and clean up. I felt upset not only about the contents of my boyfriend's last minute confrontation, but the fact that he did it minutes before an event he KNEW I was looking forward to. He KNEW and SAW how hard I worked for this event. He KNEW I wanted this night to go well, and he KNEW confronting me like that was going to make me upset and cry. I don't know if I want him to find out I cried in front of our friend because I don't know how he'd feel about it, even if I didn't tell him anything about our argument. I don't think my boyfriend did this deliberately or with malice, I think he was just being inconsiderate. 

I feel embarrassed but also resentful that I felt embarrassed, upset and unconsidered on a night that was important for me. Worse yet, now I have cried in front of a friend that had nothing to do with it and has no context as to why I broke down like that. He approached me today and apologized about the incident and I just felt embarrassed again that he felt the need to apologize for checking in on me. I must have made him feel bad or awkward for shutting him down like that, but I literally had to or I would have full on sobbed trying to explain myself through tears and laboured breathing. That would have been worse.

"I used to help an old sweet granny after her husband passed away and she couldn't work her casual jobs (helping other elderly people) during covid. 
Just $100 a month for groceries.
Every now and again I got her something extra, she would never ask but we got a lot closer and she seemed to be a genuine good person. 

Then for her birthday I got her a beach vacation (just a small airbnb and covered the costs) - it was around $150. And her whole family could join - and they did. 

Then she got serious pneumonia 3 days before the vacation. I called the accommodation and they agreed to move the booking to two weeks later. 

The family was furious. How I was ruining their vacation. They do not work. Every day is vacation. 

""Can't you just rebook her another one and we still go?""
""You are gonna have to tell my kid you ruined their vacation""

She survived and they went, she loved it. It was for her, not them... But oh goodness this unlocked pure hell.

Birthday? I'm broke!
End of month? No food in the house!
My daughter's bday? I need a 70 dollar cake or I'll ruin her birthday.

And the granny I've helped has since passed from cancer. She was helping an elderly man with dimentia when her body gave out and she was admitted. Until her last act she was helping. She deserved every bit of help. She deserved better family.

"Before you read please know that English is my third language.

Today I've come to a realisation that I have never spoken in depth about how me moving to a new, relatively a very bad (disliked) town, can change you a lot, positively (if you are willing to be open minded).

To begin with, I am a 22-year-old undergraduate student studying in a quite unfamiliar town for approximately about a year now. I've come to recognize that this town and overall school experience has changed me so much and made me recognize things that I have never really grasped in myself.

When at home, I've always had a true sense of belonging, though it wavers from time-to-time, because I've been struggling with low-self esteem and depression. However, when I moved here, I kind of built myself from scratch, erasing everything I had back home. A new, totally different person, of a different ethnic make-up compared to the everyone (if not most) here. This feeling definitely made me more isolated compared to everyone. 

I am a very quiet, introverted person, though I can do a good job on maintaining a conversation.. no one here really cares to ask much about you... so I'd just be a passive listener most of the time. I hate to admit it but I'm starting to resent it. SO I've been using literature, mainly reading and also writing to cope but it is only making me feel more deserted. I do take walks alone. Trying.. trying to meditate. 

I don't know if it is my ego or a kind of sense of superiority, but I feel like I skipped a chapter, and advanced emotionally than all my peers here. I just don't know if they are all oblivious (or actively choose to be oblivious) and is able to just be, without any sense of self-awareness. 

So.. the positive change I have intended to write about my experience is that, you have to learn how to ***accept.

"Things haven't gotten any better. He now lives with us as well and still drinks sometimes. 2 or 3 weeks ago he drank and got shitty. I was having a sleepover at my friends but an hour before my mum had to drop me off, he came up to me and my brothers room. He always  spouts shit when he's talking to us.

My favourite blanket is my granddads, his dad, and he started asking why I like it so much. It's hard to explain what he sounds like when drunk and how he speaks but it is so annoying and almost threatening. I almost started crying because I hate when he drinks and never leaves me alone. After, he went to my brothers room and that's when things got worse.

I don't know what he was doing in there but after a few minutes I heard my brother yelling. I can't remember what he was yelling but he said for him to leave him alone. My brother slammed the door and my dad was just outside of it the whole time. He was blowing his nose loudly and coughing loudly to piss him off.

I don't know why but I was crying, I just hate him so much. My mum was downstairs and telling him to leave him alone and that he doesn't want to talk to him. She doesn't do anything. She just says stuff.

When he used to live with us before he moved back in, he was like this. When he was drunk he hit my brother when he came home with a lighter. He slapped me once because I smiled when he handed me $20 and he then said money doesn't buy happiness.

My mum's never gonna kick him out. I gave her a letter that said how I was feeling because I don't like speaking about how I feel, so it feels easier doing it like this or in a letter. The same day I gave her the letter was the same day a few weeks ago when my dad was drinking. I wrote  many things in it and the next day she didn't mention anything to me. I'm pretty sure she didn't show my dad or else he would be acting different.

I also cut myself because of him. I started writing it down so I can give it to my mum.

Late January my family are gonna go to the beach. We're gonna have a bbq and my dad is probably gonna drink. So that means I'm probably gonna cut.

"We were shopping for Christmas decorations this weekend, and my husband, 43, and his friend, 30, and our youngest son, 6, said some really embarrassing stuff.  
While we were walking through the aisles, the kids (11 and 6) kept touching the decorations so I was already mildly annoyed, and their dad and his friend didn't seem to care that they were touching them. Then an assistant asked if she could help us and our 6 year old said: ""Dad wants to buy this giant reindeer that looks like a girl, because he likes girl characters, even if they are evil.""  
My husband's friend laughed loudly and inappropriately, ""HEHEHHEHEHEHEHHEHE""... I just went bright red and told our 6 year old to keep quiet. The assistant just laughed and said ""Really??"" and said we should ask if we needed any help.  
Just when I thought it was over, my husband's friend loudly said: ""Imagine if Santa were actually controlled by Vixen, and she really ran the North Pole and made Santa do what she wanted! That would be a cool scenario!"".  
Noone said anything, it was dead quiet, until my 11 year old said: ""Bruh. That's sus.""  
She has ASD and the 6 year old is just a 6 year old, but still, the level of humiliation I felt, because there were a lot of people in the shop and there is absolutely no doubt they all heard it, was insane.

"I'm rather awkwardly placed in my family. I have no siblings, and I have virtually no other family who is near the same age as me. My older cousins were old enough to babysit me, and my younger cousins are like 10 years younger than me. There's virtually no common ground in either direction. 

I mean, there's pretty much no one to talk to in my whole family. Everyone older than me will always view me as a kid no matter what I do, hell they've all but admitted it. And it's not exactly easy to have conversations with middle schoolers either. At least the rest of my family has, well everyone else. They all have siblings and other cousins they could relate to. I had jack shit. I had to practically beg the older members of my family to spend time with me as a kid, I had no one else.

The real kicker though? I technically lied. There is *one* person who is basically my age, my cousin on my dad's side. I don't see my dad's side of the family very often, basically never nowadays. I did used to see them during the holidays though, and I would try my best to spend time with my cousin. And he just... didn't care. I was like a ghost to him. Never wanted to talk to me or hang out with me for more than five minutes. Hell I hardly even know anything about him besides his name. Honestly, this hurts more than if I just truly had no one. The one person I *could* relate to never bothered with me at all.

She says she's alone and that she doesn't want to be. I couldn't do much but be on the phone since I was somewhere else far, she tells me how she needs me and...I tell her I'll always be there as a friend. I look back thinking what ifs, as if that was our one chance to try something but I loved H that I could never do that to her.

this started this year. i binged out on a lots of junk food and chips one night, and I decided to throw it up. i thought this is just one time, never again.

over the course of 9 months, i have done it multiple times now, more frequently recently. everytime I do it, i promise myself ""never again"" and yet it happens again. i feel terrible every time I do it, and yet I can't stop. lately I feel like I have started to see it as an easy way out, eat whatever you want, throw up so I don't gain weight.

i knew of bulimia and throwing up food because of an ED awareness campaign, and I feel terrible that I sought out this way.

"This is a success story. I feel so validated and relieved. Forgiveness is liberating. Additional TW for substance abuse.

My mother was a single mother and I was an only child. She was my whole world. She wasn’t perfect, but she always tried her damndest and I was always fed and safe. She never spanked me because she thought it was wrong to do that to a child.

Around 11, she met my stepfather. The only serious relationship she had since my father. He’s a great guy and it was good to see my mom have company and to have a male role model around, but man did they like to party.

Partying and fun soon turned into calling out and fighting. Tears and mayhem all the time. I was my mothers emotional support and emotional punching bag. By the time I was in highschool she was physically abusing me and my stepdad. He was a major contributor to the problem, but he was not physically abusive.

I was suicidal and my mother was aware of this. One day, in a drunken rage, she told me “[I] should just go fucking kill [my]self”. I’d already had my pills saved for months, and I attempted that night. This was the most traumatic event of my life— even my friends “punished” me for it. The first time I prayed to God, it was for my own death. I was 15. 

Nothing changed. At 18, my mother ended up assaulting me in front of my grandparents— the cops were called and she was arrested.

Part of her legal repercussions involved 40 days of rehab and 180 days of sobriety. She spent my 19th birthday in rehab. Since, she has put a tremendous amount of effort into herself, my stepdad too. Progress has not been linear, but still constant.

I am now 21. We ran into a substance related conflict tonight that led to the three of us having probably the healthiest conversation yet.

Previous conversations regarding my attempt were lacking accountability and laden with the assumption that it was only for attention.

Today was very, very different. My mother shared some reflections on her behavior that really helped me understand her. She validated me, listened well, and apologized. She was careful of triggering body language and encouraged me to speak on anything lingering. I got things off my chest today that I never thought I’d be able to. My stepdad is less communicative but was a gentle, affirming presence as well.

I am so grateful for the changes they have made. I am so lucky they were willing to put so much effort into themselves and take accountability. Addiction truly is a disease that brings out the worst in people. I love my parents, so much. I know that there’s always a possibility for relapse, but it doesn’t feel imminent anymore.

My lease ended and I could not afford the apartment on my own and didn’t have time to find a room mate I moved back in with my mom which brings us to today this morning I was woken up at 8:30am to take my 18 yr little brother (mom won’t let him drive because he crashed three times in one year) for his choir meet time at 9:30 for his concert , I got up took a shower and put on my usual hoodie leggings and shoes despite this being a church event because my brother said it was allowed , I drop him off and park and go to sleep to wait for my mom to get there because I did not know the concert start time and couldn’t text because since my mom refused to transfer the phone bill in my name and hasn’t paid the bill I couldn’t receive or send out text when I woke up the concert was over and no one came to get me to see it my mom accused me of turning off my phone and going somewhere else I pointed out the fact that I didn’t receive any messages or phone calls because my phone is off due to her not paying the bill and having no WiFi I couldn’t use the gps to go home much less anywhere else she called me a liar and said that I should pack my bags knowing I had no where else to go when I started crying and asked why she said that I was a shitty bum for wearing a hoodie and leggings and that me switching majors is wrong and asking my step mom for  ride to work tomorrow because she said I couldn’t drive her car anymore is wrong , after that she said if I wanted to stay I have to ride the same public transportation I was assaulted on and to “just mind my business and not talk to anyone “ and if she caught me catching a ride I would be kicked out and I have to show her my outfit every time i leave the house because leggings are apparently what bums wear after venting my frustration and hurt to my long distance partner she took my phone and read the messages and yelled at me stating that if i felt unloved she doesn’t know how to show me because she let me move back in and I haven’t missed a meal this is just a vent post to try and clear my head",I feel like my mom doesn’t love me,18l29tq,1702881289.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l29tq/i_feel_like_my_mom_doesnt_love_me/,
"Let me start by saying I'm not morally against websites like pornhub existing and I am pro sex education, I think it is an important thing to learn. That being said, the ease of accessing porn online is insane. I don't care if adults are accessing it, they can be into as much weird stuff as they want, but I firmly believe it is fucking up kids.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was about 15 I had discovered online porn and it really fucked up my view of what was acceptable and not. I also ended up getting groomed by an older woman so sending pics was viewed as normal by me at the time. A big part of the problem is that most of those websites just ask if you are 18, but of course minors are going to lie since there are no repercussions for doing so. I'm not saying I'm in favor of the Louisiana laws regarding sending ID (one data leak for those companies would be disastrous for a lot of people) but I do think the rules should be stricter than just clicking yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a minor online is also just dangerous. I remember seeing a post by a 15 year old asking how to report a predator that messaged them, and they ended up having to close the DMs because so many predators approached them because of their age. All it takes if them finding one kid who doesn't suspect them to really fuck up someone's life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think there is a benefit to minors having limited access to the internet and that they should have some exposure early on, but we do such a bad job at keeping them from places they shouldn't be and they aren't mature enough to know how to handle it. I think people should have the ability to access the internet and a right to privacy, but I don't think the current set up is working or helping anyone.

I really can’t tell this to anyone irl because I don’t trust them and also the only other person I talk to besides my daughter is my boyfriend. We just went Christmas shopping and we went to different stores shopping for each other. We went to a shoe store and he absolutely fell in love with these black new balances. He tried on these other two but these ones he fell head over heels for. I ofc bought them and a hoodie that has the gtr skylines on the back, Like all the different models if that makes sense (I apologize if I said the cars wrong) and some stickers. I hid the shoes under the clothes and now their wrapped under the tree but he keeps gushing how much he loved these shoes but they cost so much. He keeps saying he wants to buy them for his birthday since it’s coming up but It just makes me happy I picked the right ones and I just can’t wait to see his reaction on Christmas morning when he tears open the present.",I hope I make his Christmas,18l25kh,1702880828.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l25kh/i_hope_i_make_his_christmas/,
"I met this person about three years ago. I think I ruined him but I really don’t know. He met me at the worst state of my life and I terribly hurt him. We both decided that it was good if we got separated after graduation and moving out of state, but that did not happen. We kept coming back to each other but in a toxic way. Everytime I would want to leave because we are nothing alike but that never happened. Once twice thrice .. it never happened. I always knew in my heart that I could never be happy with him but at the same time I never imagined living my life with anyone else but him. We had a toxic relationship. I can’t speak from his side but from my side, he could never let go of the past. Also why I wanted to leave. We have lots of other issues but I knew from the start that I couldn’t be with him but I am all he had got so I felt like I couldn’t abandon him. 

Anyway a few days ago he called me a bitch in anger. He had called me a whore twice in the past and he said he didn’t mean that but he knew how much that hurt me. So this time around I told him he was dead to me and left. That is all I said. The night before I was crying thinking I was never going to be good enough for him. He is never going to be nice to me or not yell at me. I always thought he would respect me, maybe if I got better over the years but that never happened. It hurts, but I don’t want to show my emotions. He thinks there is another reason why I am leaving (a new bf or sth) but there isn’t. I am just so tired of wanting him to be good to me, to be accepted as who I am, to be someone who is treated well, to be respected.

"Pretty much the title. In a bit less than a month, I'm going to see a specialist for an assessment for whether or not I have an ED, what to do, this and that. I'm not someone who usually gets scared of things, but that shits scary, man. I don't want to have to do it, but at the same time, I do. For fucks sake, it was my choice to. I suggested it. Stupidly suggested it. I've been having a problem with eating (well, lack of eating) for like 3 years now, and I don't really know what my problem is, and therefore have no chance of fixing it. So now I have an appointment, and I am absolutely dreading it. I don't want to have to admit to problems I have, I don't like sharing my struggles or anything like that. I prefer to keep everything to myself and just ignore it and move on, not to tell someone about it. So to have to do that, with a professional, and possibly even get a DIAGNOSIS?? Hate it

Even worse, the possibility of meds. I've never seen how this sort of stuff works, so I don't know if people can get meds for EDs. But I do know that people with other diagnoses get prescribed medication, and I also had to have some for related situations. But I've been noticing that I've been slacking off on it. Most likely because I have to take it with food, and I don't want to eat. So if I do end up getting diagnosed and needing meds for it, then I don't know how good my chances are of doing well

I don't understand why this all even has to happen in the first place. Why can't I just eat two fucking meals a day? Not even talking about three, which is how much you're SUPPOSED to have. I'll have two meals on a good day, but why can't my normal day be three like everyone else? The thing is, I'm literally in full control of it. I don't have some legal guardian who is hiding the food, I don't live on the streets of some abandoned city. I can eat, I should eat, but I don't. Why? Why am I making myself suffer, then complaining about it, then proceeding to do that same thing anyway? It's so dumb, and now I have to talk to some specialist about it.

"My girlfriend is a performer, not a stripper or anything that could fall under sex work or any related category, but a dancer of sorts. This isn’t her full time job and more of a hobby that she is able to make money from. At first it was no big deal and I enjoyed watching her performances (they happen on average once every one or two weeks but she has had multiple in one week before) when she first started and they were just dancing, but it’s gotten kind of sexual and beyond what makes me feel secure in a relationship. The outfits are now getting smaller and smaller and more revealing, with her most recents outfit being a mostly see through dress with nothing but nipple pasties and nude underwear underneath, and an incredibly revealing 2 piece (she has been performing for about a year). The dancing has also gotten more distanced from what it started as, now involving small amounts of pole dancing, some ass shaking, and pelvis thrusting against the floor. I haven’t been to the performances lately because I’ve been busy with work, but I see them on video. We live in New York and these performances are usually at bars and small clubs, but I just don’t really like that my girlfriend is going to clubs dancing suggestively in revealing outfits for money, but it’s not something I feel I would want to end the relationship over. We have been dating for about a year, and while I feel like we have strong communication, I just don’t know if I could tell her the way she’s dancing at these performances makes me feel jealous, and a little self-conscious, because I know how much it means to her to perform and I really want to support her, but I just don’t know if I can get over the way I feel about how she’s dancing and dressing.",My gf is a performer and I don’t like it,18l1w4n,1702879809.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l1w4n/my_gf_is_a_performer_and_i_dont_like_it/,
"My bf (33)&amp; I (32 ) have been in an almost 5year relationship. Im having doubts that this is even for me anymore. He used to be a great communicater and very sweet always got me flowers and was very good and understanding and listning to my feelings and concerns. The past few years things have been what I feel rocky. 
I had a miscarriage at the very beginning of our relationship and was devastated. I feel like after that I ddnt look at him 100% the same for a while. Then had my rainbow baby a year later, which was very hard on my body and mind as well. I felt like he wasnt as helpful as I wish he wouldve been but heard that was normal for alot of men. We've argued alot since on and off. This is just abt year 5 and I feel like hes not the same person I fell in love with. I just had another miscarriage in May and I feel like he hasnt been as supportive as Ive needed. He doesnt understand. I just feel delavued at this point in our relationship. We just got into an argument over my step daughter (his 1st born) recieving a big girl chair for xmas and mine not being able to get one and no one helping me bc shes 3 and can fit the other hand me down ones. According to him she ddnt NEED one and they arnt always going to get the same thing. But my baby told me she wanted one &amp; ik her little facewould light up so big for one when she saw it. I work a bit not as much as him so I basically give him what I make for bills. I decided to take outta savings and use my tips to get her one. Bc he said he would go half on it a few fridays b4 but then never did and never explained to me that he ddnt order it until I asked abt the other chair arriving at the house being my daughters and he said no. Mind you I gave him half for it already. He said bills needed paid but the chair I picked was already low on stock so I thought it had been taken care of. It hadnt. Her chair sold out. I hand to find another one and get it myself. Everyone faught me over getting her this chair even though it states 3+. I dont understand. When I go to communicate to him that he was wrong abt not telling me he ddnt order it, he states "" you hear what you want"" &amp; puts it on me for not understandingwhat he never said clearly. Im just pissed at this point and emotional I guess bc why does every approach feel like a battle now. A one sided battle. I dont recieve flowers. I dont get date nights. Hell we dont even sleep in the same bed.He doesnt want another baby to help me cope with the loss I had 6 months ago( he makes it clear over and over and in smart remarks sometimes when ppl joke abt it)(which kind of hurts my heart)... and he hasnt proposed to me or even brought up any type of hints he wants to continue this life with me. I told him when we met 5 years was what I was really hoping for to be engaged at least ( we ddnt have to be married)The last time I even mentioned it he gave me 2 almost ultimatums as to what needed to happen b4 hand for an engagement that made no sense to me and had nothing to so with just us proving love for eachother. Communication and Understanding was one thing I thought we were really good at but its gone or lost. Hes a good guy, a great dad. But I feel like Ive lost connection and his attention. I feel he has no empathy for me or any situation I bring to him. He doesnt comfort me like he used to or make me feel wanted. I just feel cold. And emotionally pissed and confused. I may just be ranting and pissed abt our last encounter but I really just dont know what to do. I was in a very toxic relationship for 10yrs prior to this one. So I'm not sure what a normal almost 5yr healthy relationship is like... is this common?
But I felt Ive learned alot this time around and have been so much mature and  handling communication so much better but Its only one sided now. Its starting to feel really familiar. I dont want the toxic back....

One of my friends needed somebody to walk her dog for a day while she was visiting family; she lives in a house that's split into two apartments. Somebody else (I don't even know who) who works at the same college lives in the other apartment of the house. I forgot to clarify which of the two apartments she lived in when I went over to grab the dog for the first time, and I chose wrong. She'd left a key for me hidden outside, and because it was under the stairs that led to the second-story apartment, I just assumed that was hers. The key either worked in both locks or the upstairs neighbors had left their door unlocked, but either way I walked into the wrong apartment and started looking for the dog I expected to see. Instead, I rounded a corner and saw a very naked man on top of an equally naked woman in a dark bedroom. I didn't say anything and I don't think they noticed me, I just turned around and walked out. Tried the key on the downstairs apartment, and when it worked I found the dog I was expecting to find chilling in the correct living room. I have no idea who I saw or if they noticed the front door closing behind me, but now I'm paranoid they saw me and will recognize me on campus and I'll have to explain myself.

Our relationship was better than anything I could have dreamed of honestly. They used to spend so many resources just to see me for like ten minutes some days.

"I’m 16F and this really weird scary thing has been bothering me for a couple months now. I heard what sounded like a violin and piano in the distance. At first I thought my neighbor might’ve learned to play, but then I started hearing it while I was at school or anywhere else outside my home. Plus I saw my neighbor a few days afterwards and she said she doesn’t play any instruments and doesn’t even put on music. Any other neighbors I saw said the same thing. 

This was sort of creepy because my parents used to play piano and violin duets together, but they passed away years ago. The music I heard sounded like the sort of things they used to play. Let me just confirm I don’t believe in supernatural anything but that’s why it’s so strange to me. 

tried to speak with my grandma (I live with her now) about it but she just said it’s nice my parents are always on my mind. When I tried to say I heard it all the time whether I’m thinking of them or not she just seemed confused.

It’s gotten worse over the past couple weeks. The music is literally keeping me up at night. It was incredibly faint at first but over the past week or so there have been times it got loud enough that I could hear what my friend said until she repeated it a couple times. I’ve also begun to develop these bad migraines (never had them before) and weird dizzy spells that don’t last very long. 

A few days ago my grandma was able to se up an appointment with my regular doctor to ask some questions about this. He didn’t really listen to me and said I’m mostly likely just stressed from school and other stuff. He didn’t even comment on the physical symptoms I told him about. My grandma agreed with him and now is looking to re-enroll me in grief counseling. I’m not saying therapy is a bad step and I’m sure it’ll help with any emotional issues I have. This is different. 

I’ve tried to tune it out. At first I figured it was a weird coincidence that was so strange I made it warped by obsessing over it. I tried to distract my self with friends and different music thinking if I just ignored it it would eventually fade. Nothing worked. The scariest part is the new volume changes. Sometimes it gets louder so suddenly I get spooked and flinch. I’ve tried all kinds of meditation to try and control it but nothing is working.

The migraines are really painful and yesterday the sudden dizziness made my legs suddenly collapse. Of course whenever I try to explain my symptoms to anyone they just think I’m some poor orphan chick having a psychotic break. Tbh I don’t have a clue what’s going on maybe that’s it. 

The music keeps me up at night and anytime I do manage to fall asleep the migraines wake me up. Grandma said she won’t take me to see another doctor until I have a couple sessions with the grief counselor she found. He can’t see me for another two weeks and the sessions will be once a week. That’s makes at least a month until my grandma brings me to some other medical doctor. 

Other than the exhaustion and music that isn’t really playing I feel ok mentally and can think clearly. I’m not crazy and this is getting scary. I don’t know what to do. I’d be a lot calmer if it was just the music but all these sudden and painful physical symptoms that started so quickly are unnerving. Should I push through and find some other doctor or neurologist on my own?? How would I even do that without my grandma? Should I just stand by and wait like she’s telling me to? Any advice would be awesome.

UPDATE: Thank you all for the advice and support. I was able to talk to a friend’s mom who offered to drive me to the ER.

Me (15f) and my friend (15f) have been friends since  6th grade. We went to the same middle school and high school and have a lot of classes together. Last night I found out she passed away but it still doesn’t feel real to me. I knew she had problems with her mental health and I thought she was getting better because she acted happier. I can’t listen to any music because it reminds me of her and then I’ll start crying. My heart always hurts. I wish I could’ve helped her more and been a better friend. I don’t know how I’m gonna go to school tomorrow because I’m so used to seeing her everyday. I’ll have to look at an empty seat in almost all my classes for the rest of the school year.

"Last night I 17F called 911 because my 55M dad was unresponsive in our kitchen. I was downstairs in my room watching a movie on discord with my online friend when I got a call from my mom who was at work (she’s a nurse and works 12 hour shifts) I answered figuring she was getting her break or something but instead she told me “go upstairs to your dad now.” In a voice I’ve never heard her use before I was so scared, I started running upstairs and as I was approaching the second floor I could hear him stumbling during the last steps and turning into our kitchen where he was I heard him fall, I started screaming for him (all while on the phone with my mom.) He was on his stomach straining, his face was bright red and his eyes were wide and darting back and forth, he looked like he was choking. I was holding him and his head when I realized he was shaking. At some point I called 911 on his phone, I didn’t even know that I knew his password. I kept yelling “daddy can you hear me” I don’t remember when I started crying or when I stopped, what I do remember was that I grabbed his hand and he squeezed mine back and turned his head to look at me even though his eyes couldn’t focus on me. I remember thinking is this the last time he’ll ever hold my hand? At some point before the paramedics arrived he stood up stumbling and confused. They took us to the hospital and by the time we arrived he was acting like nothing happened and trying to leave without getting an EKG or a CT scan of his head. He’s fine now and the tests don’t show signs of stoke/seizure anything of the sort, but that was the scariest moment of my life. He was diagnosed with cancer in September of 2016 and had it completely removed in January 2017, I have diagnosed PTSD from that and have been in therapy for it.

"It sounds so fucking stupid. But its like ive always wanted him to be soft with me, be able to compliment me, be affectionate

. Hes in general a man of few words and when he goes through something he comes off very cold towards me. I dont know if he knows and i dont think he means to be but it feels like it. I dont know if i should even go near him ir uf he wants to talk to me. 

Ill greet him after work, ill talk to him ill give him a hug and stuff but he still seems so drained and dead. And suddenly he sees his cat and its like hes mentally recharged only when hes around his cat. 

Dont get me wrong, i know exactly how it feels because i have 2 of my own and the bond with ur cat is different. But it doesnt mean i feel and look miserable unless im around my cats and spending time with them. Being around him also helps me mentally recharge. 

When i dress up or do my makeup ill get a weak compliment where he looks awkward saying it. Hes always been like this since i met him, so i never had an issue with it. He struggles with being affectionate with his words. Atleast did until he adopted his cat and suddenly he has no issues showing his cat love. 

Hell be having dinner or on his phone and sometimes wont acknowledge me there or be doing his thing but if someone mentions his cats name suddenly hes looking back to see whats happening or give him attention then goes back to it. 

He rarely takes pictures of us or asks to take pictures together and if i ask he says stuff like “when is the last time you saw me take any pictures even of myself”, but then his gallery is full of pictures of himself and his cat posing together and shit. Like bro what the fuck 

I know he loves me, because of everything he does for me and how he shows it through his actions. He is working hard to build his career and to live a better life. He joined uni later than me so hes behind me in terms of where we are in our career stage and theres things he is yet to do. He communicates as much as he can and works on actively improving himself. But lately despite all this, when i look at him or when work is mentioned, or if we’re talking about things that need doing all i see is a man who is tired and feels obligated to provide for me or something, even though we literally have separate finances and dony even fully live together yet.

"i (f22) have struggled with friends all my life. i’ve never had very many. i was homeschooled (not the reason for the lack of friends mind you) so i shared pretty much every aspect of my social life with my brothers who are just a year younger. from co-op classes, to beta club, extra curriculars, camps, you name a social circle and we definitely shared it. even the few friends i had were associated because their brothers were (are) close friends with mine. it was exhausting.  

i graduated and went to college and it was so freeing. i was separated from my brothers and could finally have my own social life not involving my siblings. i didn’t make many college friends, but i didn’t care. they were my friends that i made all on my own and didn’t personally know my family. it was awesome. since i’ve graduated, only 2 of those friends have stuck around. i’ll call them A and Z

about a year or so ago, i made the grave mistake of inviting A and Z to my house more frequently, therefore meaning they were around my family a lot. it didn’t bother me at first because my brothers would usually leave us alone, aside from a “hello” here and there. but then one night A and Z wanted to have a game night, but it’s hard with only 3. so, they had the idea to invite my brothers to play with us. i figured why not, it was just once and they probably wouldn’t really get along. well, that was mistake number 2. they did get along, and every time after that when we hung out and wanted to play a game, my brothers would be invited, even though i would be very clearly unhappy about it. 

flash forward a year later and, not only do my brothers get invited to game nights, but now my friends are comfortable enough to hang out with my siblings without me. typically when you say you’re tired and need to go to bed because you have work in the am, that would be your friend’s signal to head out. but instead, A stays and hangs out with my brothers while i go to sleep. 

i tried talking to A, who is the main one who talks and hangs out with them a lot. i told her that it makes me a bit uncomfortable and explained why i’m not happy that she’s becoming such great friends with my brothers. that i feel like i’m losing the one part of my life that i had to myself. that i’ve shared every aspect of my life previously and don’t want to do it again. she says she understands, but continues to hang out with them anyway. we’ve had so many little conversations over the year, plus one big one that lasted 40 minutes just the other day, and yet she still doesn’t understand how much it hurts me. 

i feel like my brothers have hijacked the one piece of my life i had to myself and i regret ever introducing them to my friends to begin with. at this time i quite literally only have 2 friends. only 2 friends and i now share them with my siblings… i really fucked myself over with this one.",i’ve lost yet another piece of my personal life to my brothers and i’m sick of it,18l0eaf,1702874463.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18l0eaf/ive_lost_yet_another_piece_of_my_personal_life_to/,

"I have so much stuff that happens in my life, like I've been through genuinely so many traumatic things and I try to avoid bringing it up, but sometimes I'll ask for permission to vent to someone/get preestablished permission, and like I'll ask them if they have any triggers they want me to avoid/censor, and tell them they can tell me to stop at any point, and if they say yes I warn them once more that it IS heavy and triggering shit, and if they say no I drop it. No guilt tripping or anything, just like maybe sending a silly TikTok to change the topic and lighten the mood so they don't think I'm upset.

"I’ll be turning 21 in February. I’ve never had a single good birthday. I was so hopeful for this one, but I was wrong. So now I have to prepare for the disappointment.

Here’s the B-Day history.

When I was a kid, my parents constantly fought. So as the oldest child, for whatever reason always involved on solving issues, I had to answer what I thought they should do. Should they get a divorce? I was four being asked that. All of memories of birthdays involve screaming and yelling. So I stopped celebrating.

When I was 16 I wanted a birthday party. Nothing big. Just to go skating with my friends. Huge snow storm comes through so that obviously falls through for every brand new driver. However, my family pulls together at my favorite restaurant. That’s when my dad starts a huge fight with my mom’s younger sister. It felt like nobody cared about me. I spent half an hour in the bathroom, no one noticed. I was “a selfish b” for caring about the fight.

My 17th my parents forgot. 

Didn’t celebrate my 18th.

19th my dorm roommate screams and cusses me out because I said no to a dog we weren’t allowed to have.

My 20th I decided to spend with my boyfriend. All he was agreeing to do was to just watch a movie at home. (No it wasn’t a money thing or snow, he just didn’t want to go anywhere)

Now it’s my 21st. I live in a totally different city where I have no friends. The food here is awful and over priced so I don’t even like going out to dinner. My best option is to go out to a bar that I don’t like because it’s basically outside (like it literally has three walls and a fence) with my boyfriend’s coworkers because that’s all the people I know. Traveling isn’t an option because of my boyfriend’s job being busy. 

I just want this one fun day. But I’ll probably just spend it in bed again. If anyone has anything fun to do let me know.

"I (27M) have been on a significant journey to heal my unresolved childhood trauma. I started microdosing psychedelic mushrooms in March, and it has profoundly affected my life. I'm not here to promote these substances but merely to share my experiences.

I remember starting to go to the gym in March after I began microdosing. I began to have visualizations of confronting my fears. Having suffered from panic attacks due to C-PTSD, the gym became a place where I could visualize and tackle these fears differently. The inner child meditations, and the concept of reparenting and protecting my inner child helped me confront my fears and insecurities. I used the meditations as scaffolding to these scenarios. 

I began visualizing scenarios where I saved my inner child. Growing up, I idolized superheroes, and the hero complex concept probably influenced me from a young age. I never had a father or even a father figure in my life. Superheroes like Spiderman and Batman were the biggest ones.

One song that I still listen to in the gym to this day is ""Won't Back Down,"" particularly the Nickelodeon Barnyard version. It may seem a bit goofy, but the scene where the father, Ben, plays the song, left an impression on me since I first saw the movie. In this visualization, as the song plays, I see creatures (representing my fears) approaching over a hill. I'm on the porch of a country cabin, and my inner child, frightened, looks to me for reassurance. I reassure him and give a hug before sending him to the basement. Meanwhile, the song continues as I head to the gun closet, retrieve my assault rifle, and prepare my gear. I’m actually a Marine Corps veteran, so the whole load out is what I usually put on. After the whole dress up, I face the hill, ready to confront these creatures.

My childhood was extremely challenging with an alcoholic single mother. Her emotional neglect and constant work left me to take car of myself from around the age of 11. I even had to drive her to the hospital in the 7th grade, which left deep scars. This led to anxiety, trust issues in my romantic relationships, lasting until last year, and a lifelong pattern of people-pleasing, initially to prevent my mother from drinking. She never changed her habits.

"Got caught up in some nostalgia scrolling through my old Tumblr today. Ran into a picture of a girl I used to be friends with online, we used to talk a fair bit, and I think we both had a crush on each other (we were still teenagers at the time.) 

We never followed each other on any other social media, so I have no idea what she's been up to in the last 8 or 9 years. The last few pictures she had posted were of her and her new boyfriend. 

Out of sheer curiosity decided to try my best at doing some online ""stalking."" Ran one of her pictures through pimeyes reverse image search with no luck. Tried with another, and was able to get a hit. I wasn't 100% sure if it was her, but definitely a close match. Was then able to run that pic through Google reverse image search, and it came up with a LinkedIn profile. It turns out it was indeed her! 

From there I was able to find out that she is now married, and her husband's Instagram is public. Well it turns out, it's the same boyfriend from 10 years ago and they now have two kids together.

Finding out all of this brought up so many emotions and tears. It felt so good to get a small glimpse into the person she has become and I just want to say that I am proud of her. I know she'll never know that, so that's why I'm writing it here, as I have no one else I can tell.

He got mad at me a few minutes ago bc he ran to the store, I started fixing g the animals food, left my phone on charge. He didn't want to bother anyone by KNOCKING ( even tho people were right there sitting) so he called and texted me to let him in. 
When I walked the dogs food out to the porch he's yelling at me for not answering. I explained I left it outside bc I had no more fuckng hands..hejust left and said......im.sick of this let's break up. 
Im like ""I did NOTHING wrong, I apologized for missing his call then he yelled at me and suggested we break up. He said ""do u want to"" and i asked him im if he did.
He didn't answer. He went off on how I always want to fight. I didn't. I asked him the same question he asked me.
The he stopped answering. I said r u asleep or ignoring me even tho this was a important convo. He said askeep
Then he said I obviously am an idiot bc he said he didn't want to break up and he would screen shot it and show me.
Then he didn't, he just said he said. So i went back and check and he never said that

"I'm currently writing up a pretty long post talking about my last year and how much my life has been uprooted and I feel like I've lost but TLDR; I started dating a girl who I'd been really close friends with for years and it ended up turning somewhat emotionally abusive, and included cheating and gaslighting about said cheating. I'd love some words of advice or encouragement.  The relationship caused me to move from somewhere I loved living, lose most of my close friends, including the two men I wanted to walk me down the isle when I got married, and comepetely lose a personal identity I was just starting to find.

I eventually found the strength to break up with her recently. Since the breakup I fell into a bit of a fuckgirl phase and ended up rebounding pretty hard. After the rebound went up in flames (my fault), I did a lot of looking at myself and refuse to keep down a path of self-destructiveness.

I've been spending a lot of time on hobbies and trying to make new friends but then night comes and I just feel so alone. The loss of the relationship hurts though, I've mostly recovered the self confidence I lost from it,  but I feel so hurt about the loss of my home and the people I cared about.

My birthday is coming up in January and I can't stop thinking this is the first birthday I'll properly celerbrate that isn't a joint birthday party with my old best friend.

Anyway I don't know what else to say but I just feel alone, like I don't know who I am anymore, and connections I've made since feel like I'm trying to fill the void of what I've lost this last year.",I don't know how to cope with being alone anymore.,18kz24m,1702870050.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kz24m/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_with_being_alone_anymore/,
"I was such an asshole in my previous relationship. I cheated physically multiple times, including an emotional affair that lasted a few months. I really was like disassociating from it after awhile. Our relationship started with them stringing me and a few others along at the same time, and a big struggle for commitment on their end, but I stuck around.

After awhile, It was easy and I was, most of the time, activly looking for other relationships but not willing to leave my current one. It was like that for almost 3 years. I only started feeling guilt the last year we were together, and the guilt absolutely consumed me. And weirdly enough- it started when I smoked weed and would think. I would become distraught with how shitty of a person I’d become. 

 I tried for that year to be the best SO they’ve ever had. I dramatically changed my life and my commit to that relationship. I thought they forgave me and we were both moving forward, which now sounds so stupid on their part and mine. Anyways, we split up and it was messy. They cheated, but It was mostly their decision because I felt like I needed to make up for the time I was shit and stay in this relationship. But thank god one of us snapped out of it.  

It’s really a bummer to think about now days. That was 5 years ago. I have a spouse and kids now and I haven’t ever once thought about stepping out on this SO. I’m genuinely so happy to be with them.

I still think about it from time to time. I don’t know who I was then, and sometimes I don’t know who I am now.

My girlfriend of three years 3 months ago told me she wants to take a break because of overwhelming stress from her job and difficulty balancing work with our relationship. I hesitated to accept it at first but I wanted her to feel comfortable with me, so I told her that I would support her and be there for here regardless, and she seemed happy. After our conversation, I left her apartment and went home. Few days later, I wanted to check in on her and asked her if she is ready to get back together, to which she replied that she needed more time.  
  
Few days later, I sent her another message. She said she still needs more time, and I responded with few sweet messages to reassure her that I'm still here for her and that I still love her. Days passed with the same pattern, where I would text her, she would respond with ""i need more time"", and wait few more days to check on her again. A month later, I received a message from her at night, saying a restaurant name.. that's it. I thought she wanted us to meet there, so I drove my car there, and went inside to look for her. I found her sitting on a table with another guy and were holding hands and her leaning towards him. I almost broke down in tears in the middle of the restaurant, but I took a picture of them and went home and didn't talk to anyone for 2 months. I started to heal and communicate with family and friends back and build my relationship with them again.  
  
Just few minutes ago she texted me and said ""Sorry it's been too long. I was really struggling with work and family problems, but now am ready to be together again"". I still have their picture together. My plan was to send this picture to her family and her friends, but I couldn't. And now that she is back, I don't know what to do.

"Throwaway.

I was very poor when I was growing up. I never did that well with saving money in high school, because I helped my parents with their bills with my after-school jobs and I bought things to distract myself from my shitty home life.

As I got older, I would go between extreme saving and frugality to letting it all out and buying a ton of shit. I found out when I was in my early 20s that I had bipolar disorder but didn’t get medicated for a while.

I’m currently trying to clean and organize the household so that I start 2024 off with a decluttered house. I also have a desire to start handling my money better.

I bought bins to put spring/summer clothing away, and felt good when it was all labeled and put away. However, when I was organizing what I had for winter clothes into the closet... it doesn’t fit in the closet and spilled out. 

I have tons of clothing in the attic, the floor of my closet, and in another closet. I have over 20 handbags. When I cleaned out my bathroom and vanity, I had a scary amount of makeup that I don’t use from Sephora and Ulta, 3 hairdryers, 4 curling irons, 3 straighteners, an AirWrap, a ton of Velcro rollers, hot rollers… and I have enough tampons for at least the next 2 years. I have an amazing amount of sunblock, aloe gel, and lots of oral care items for the next year. I also have a ton of books, and it’s just now hitting me that I’ve gotten myself into a bad place.

I am in some debt, but I’d probably be in less if I stopped buying shit I don’t need. I want out of this. I’m making an appointment with a therapist to work through this ASAP.

I am writing this down so that I can reference back to it and not make these same mistakes from the last few years to next year.

"Hello, I (F21) just had my grandma over today and told me something extremely disturbing. Here’s some backstory so the story makes sense:
In 2018 my grandma gets a message on Facebook from her friends niece that she needs a place to stay. the woman/niece we will call “A” (she’s in her 30s) was in an abusive relationship and already had a son with him and she was pregnant. My grandma offered to house her and help her have this pregnancy away from her abusive boyfriend. The boyfriend later went to jail. Fast forward after she has her baby, she lives with my grandma for about a year and she starts losing her shit. I mean actually losing it. She started to steal my grandma’s medication (my grandma was attacked by two dogs in 2012 and her neck was damaged and needs pain medicine) the woman A started to also steal my grandmas jewelry. She even stole my great grandmas ring that survived WWII. A turned out to be a drug user. A started showing more disturbing behavior, she started leaving the gas stove on at night and told people she was planning to kill herself and to kill my grandma and her kids. My grandma called the police when the smoke alarm went off and A got sent to a mental institution for months and got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Fast forward a few years later my grandma still kept in contact with A because she felt bad for the kids and still supports the children because she feels guilty that A is their mother. 5-6 days ago A calls my grandma to complain about her mothers boyfriend we will call “K”. As mother got an inheritance of about 20K I believe and gave A 10k of it. A told my grandma on the phone about how she wanted to use the money to get a car and get her life more together. She was then complaining that K asked for the money to keep his house back in another town so he wouldn’t lose it to the state. A started to joke with my grandmother that she was going to put visine in his drink when he wasn’t looking. 3 days ago K died from an unsuspected heart attack, he was a healthy man with no heart issues ever.

The only contact I'd had with any of them for that time was short text conversations(never initiated by me), my graduation, and a fourth of July get together that same year. Because of the lack of contact, I basically had zero news on anything happening with the family. 

A few months ago, however, I was invited to what was basically a family get-together hosted by my aunt, with whom I'd be staying to prevent two incredibly long drives within the same day.

2.) One of the dogs that belonged to the aunt I WAS staying with died

And I hate looking at ugly people. It completely ruins my mood. It’s not that I’m judgmental towards them (e.g. you’re ugly so you must be stupid/unpleasant/friendless/some other negative adjective, you’re ugly so you deserve to be mistreated), I just dislike looking at them and being around them. I hate it when I go somewhere and notice most of the people are ugly, obese, or putting 0 effort into their looks. And I’m obviously not saying they should change themselves to please a random stranger (me), I just needed to vent somewhere.

It’s completely irrational and I don’t know why I feel like this. I also hate looking at ugly art and being in aesthetically unpleasant places, I love being in nature (at the beach, most of all. Water is very beautiful to me) and hate places like parking lots or offices, anywhere that smells like gasoline or has fluorescent lighting.  

I also tend to hate on myself a lot if I feel ugly. I think I obsess over my appearance an abnormal amount, specifically aging. I quite literally have perfect skin and have a good skincare routine but sometimes I feel like I’m developing wrinkles around my mouth (even though it’s just the way my cheeks look when I open my mouth) and it gives me anxiety that I’m getting old and will be ugly (this is irrational too, I find some people 40-50+ beautiful as well)

"As the title suggests I may have broken my foot. 2 weeks ago my friend and I found 2 jugs of expired milk (not chunky tho).

We came to the conclusion we should dump the milk on the concrete, but not before we shared a few laughs. We proceeded to open the jugs, put them between our thighs, and then hip thrust the expired milk onto the ground to make it look like we were, infact, jizzing on the concrete.

"Can't believe i'm going to be a person behind a reddit sex post. Well, here it goes. Its actually a short story, but I wanted to discuss it. At the end of the summer of when I was 18 I was experiencing psychosis again and was taken to a mental hospital. I do consider myself to be of generally sound mind and I have improved since. While at the hospital I met a women named Amber. She was much older then me and had written a few novellas. I was obsessed with the humanities, history, world knowledge and culture. She was too, and we were both delighted to meet someone with similar interests for once. In art therapy she was impressed with my music taste. We would talk nearly the whole time of our stay and we swapped phone numbers. After getting out it took a while but I reached out to her again to ask her how she was doing. We talked some more and she invited me out. We went to the bar and she ordered me drinks. I was somewhat fearing what I was getting into but also intriguided. She took me back to her place afterwards. We sat on the couch for a bit played cards but things turned sexual when she playfully tackled me over spades. She caught me staring at her when she was on top of me and asked if I wanted more. I said yes and blushed. We went on to make love without much penetration.  
Looking back I sort of regret it. It does not feel right in some way. Its a fantasy for many but a weird situation in truth. I've reached out to her again recently and we chatted for a bit.

"I'm grappling with a constant sense of guilt and self-doubt, and I need to get it off my chest.

I (M22) have a friend (M20) who seems to be going through a tough time, possibly dealing with depression. I genuinely want to be there for him, offering support whenever he needs it. We do talk, but my overthinking brain is convinced that I'm falling short, and it's tearing me apart.

We're in a delicate phase where we both like each other but are taking it slow. I want to support him through it all, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm falling short. He's dealing with other things, and I understand he may not have the energy to talk to anyone. Despite him communicating his feelings, my mind tricks me into believing he's upset with me, even though it might be him tired.

He occasionally cancels plans because he lacks the energy, and I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. I want to be there for him, but my overthinking mind makes me believe he's not interested, even though I know that's not the case.

"I am a 35 old male. My wife is my age. Ours is an arranged marriage. My parents are old (father is 75 years old and Mom is 64 years old) and they live with us like all indian parents do. Dad stopped stopped working around 8-9 years ago. Mom was a housewife since the beginning. 

I have an elder sister who is married and lives in another city. She is my first friend, mentor, guide and support system. 

Coming back to my parents - I like my Dad more than my mom. He worked hard all his life to make sure that I and my sister got education. Mom is an asthma patient for as long as I remember and her primary responsibility was to look after the house. I wouldn't say she didn't do anything for us but her health limited her responsibilities to only certain things around the house. The rest of the responsibilities where handled by my dad. 

Mom has temper issues and she throws a huge fit if things don't go the way she wants them to. It has been like that since the beginning. I don't recall a single week where there has been no arguments in our house. These arguments can happen over any trivial thing and even after so many years I am still not able to stop it from happening. The only thing I understand is that it's always my mom who picks up a topic and starts fighting with me, my Dad and my wife. The person with whom she is fighting changes but it always starts with her. We (I and my sister) and our Dad never fight or argue. Even if we do, it's the result of mom instigating him against us. My Dad has sort of learnt to live like this. They fight in the morning and act normal in the evening. 

I and my sister we have never been able to adjust to my mom's temper tantrums. We both are people who generally like peace and happiness, and cannot tolerate the daily arguments. My sister got into an arranged married very early in her life because she didn't want to stay with mom. She thought she would be happy but things are not good at her place as well. My Brother-in-law is an emotionally unavailable person and my 12 year old niece was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. My sister is in the marriage only for the sake of the child and plans to get a divorce when my niece becomes an adult. 

As for myself; since I am the son, it's my responsibility to look after my parents. I am the one with whom my mom fights the most. Our fights lasts for days and they are ugly to say the least. My arguments evolve into shouting matches and my neighbours feel that I am a bad person because it's my voice (which is much louder than my moms) that they hear. My mom has two personalities - One that she shows to us and one to the people outside. She is very warm and friendly with our neighbours. Hence everyone assumes that I am a bad person. I never wanted to get married because I was of the opinion that my wife will never be able to adjust with my mom's temper issues. I even managed to avoid getting into marriage for almost 10 years by coming up with one excuse after the other. I finally had to give up when my whole family including the relatives started forcing me. 

My wife comes from a loving and supporting family. She is finding it very difficult to adjust into our family because of my mom's temper issues. My wife like me is an introvert and does not like to get into fights or arguments. She is not happy with the regular fights and arguments that are happening in our house. My mom has made life miserable for my wife. Mom is trying to control each and every aspect of our life - What we should eat, what we should buy, how much we can spend outside everything. I and my wife are the earning members of our family and still don't have any control over how we want to live our lives. We don't have any freedom. 

I have tried my best to keep my wife happy but I think I am going to lose her. Last night after another rounds of arguments in the house my wife told me that she wouldn't have married me if she knew about my mom's nature. 

I feel like I am alone in the sea and I am drowning. I have contemplated suicide multiple times in the past. I tried twice and failed (before marriage). Lately I have been getting those feelings again. I feel like ending everything once and for all. The only thing stopping me is the thought of what would happen to my father and my wife after I am gone.

"I found a black widow spider right next to my parking spot in the apartment building I'm moving into. She was just chilling there for the last few weeks and i always checked on her when I got to and left the building. I was kinda worried but read they are shy and pacific, would only bite if threatened. As it's a new building, it's mostly empty for now, so I just let it chill, but was reading about how to capture and rehome it humanely. I was still a little worried because there will be a lot of children moving in in a few weeks and my wife is also pregnant. I thought about rehoming it but couldn't really plan on where to release it, how to go about it, was worried I could get bitten etc etc etc. She laid an egg and I thought about not being able to rehome it safely and thousands of spiderlings infesting the building. So I decided to end it and just kinda kicked the web, she was really clumsy, and I stepped on it and on the egg.
Now I'm feeling super sad about it, I could've at least tried, I don't know. There isn't a humane pest control where I live so I couldn't call them, but I feel I could've done better.

"I am in my mid thirties. I am one of five sibling, I am the middle child. When my sister, let's call her June, had her first child I was so excited to be an aunt. So when she asked me to help babysit on weekends, when they had to both work or went on dates, I agreed. When my cute nephew was almost one I had been babysitting almost every weekend at this point. For the first time since I started baby sitting, I was going to be alone with her boyfriend for about two hours until my sister came home from work.  
  
Her boyfriend, let's call him Juan, I didn't care for him much but he was always nice to me up to this point. So I didn't think anything of being alone with him. He SA'd me that Friday night. I was 17 years old, him, a 32 year old man. I was so scared to leave, because he hurt me, that I stayed until Sunday morning. I knew his daughter was coming on Saturday so I thought I would be safe.  
  
Saturday morning my sister was so over cheerful and catering to my every need, which was unusual for her because when I was over I had to help with cooking and cleaning. So I felt like she knows what he did. So for back ground my sister cheated on him with his brother. So my sister gave me to him to be even.  
  
Sunday morning I remembering coming home and begging my mom not to go to church that day but she wouldn't let me stay home. So off to church we went. I was not okay and I was not doing so well. I had a panic attack right in front of the whole church and run out of the room to a chair by the door. My mom came to me and by this point I was almost hyperventilating and crying so hard that more people came to see what was wrong. I told them that Juan had SA'd me. My whole church found out and I heard the whispers I deserved it and I was attention seeking. If you know me at all I hate attention, any attention good or bad.  
  
My mom and stepdad took me to the hospital to do an SA kit. It was so horrible undressing so they could see if any evidence would come to light. The nurses were horrible and said they didn't believe me. I talked to a detective by myself. A direct quote from the detective "" if you were 14 I could have done something for you, but since you're seventeen there is nothing I can do"". Those words haunt me to this day. He didn't believe me and no charges were filed against him.  
  
Afterwards, my sister with my nephew ghosted our family for two years. I had to hear my mom cry about not seeing her grandchild. I felt guilty for that. When my sister came back, she called my mom to came meet her, so my mom took me with her to see June. All June wanted to know is if Juan was going to jail or not. She had another kid with him, she had baby with her when we met. She was there to beg me to drop the charges. She told me I need to tell her what happened. In her mind she didn't hear my side of it, so how could she know if it was real or not. It was during my senior year, I still don't remember first 9 weeks of school. It's all black in my mind, except for the first day I went to school after it happened. Walking in the hallways made me feel dizzy and cold.  
  
She is still with him to this day, 23 years she has been with him. She has three kids with him. If I could go back in time I would say nothing to no one and never go to her house again. I would have never reported it ever. I truly wished I hadn't.




Edit: since people are questioning why I say she doesn't believe and I also say she gave me to him. I gaslighted a lot and didn't work on myself for a long time. I always thought she didn't believe me, but the truth is just a couple of years ago I started working on healing. Looking back I could see so clearly that she knew all along. I know in my heart she did give him me. So sometimes I go back and forth. Both are true! She is really good at acting like she did nothing and later she believes her own lies.



Edit: poem I wrote


Letting go


I am the one that got hurt

You're the one that fell down crying

It's my fault in your eyes, I ruined your life

Never gave a thought to mine

You want  me to forget the past

When I wish I could, more than you

My feelings don't matter to you

Your feelings were always above mine

So I hate to say it, but this is goodbye 

I am letting you go, after holding on too long

After listening to family, who didn't know my story

I can let you go, I am letting you go

You see this as an act of defiance

Give it enough time, I will be back

Not this time, somethings can't be undone

I'm done calling you family

I'm done listening to you

I have no more heart to give you

I have no more time to waste

On someone who, likes others pain

Never thought this would happen

But you made it so

Goodbye

"I fully acknowledge the negative choices I've made and attribute them to my weaknesses. Please read through, especially the Male Figures here, please HELP!  
   
I acknowledge the negative choices I've made and attribute them to my weaknesses. To sum up, I grew up without a father figure, started working at a young age (currently 23M), I have no social connections and struggled to make friends despite being outgoing. Challenges included the absence of friends, financial struggles, and a troubled family situation, leading to very lonely lifestyle. In school holidays I spend weeks without interaction.  
  
The root of my issues lies in early exposure to pornography and a history of molestation. I've silently battled these struggles, exacerbated by a lack of emotional support and financial strain. I know for sure if I have a solid connection this addiction will be gone.  
   
Despite securing a job in the tech field, which is good but may not be entirely stable but covers my bills and school tuition, remote work has made loneliness a constant companion. On my recent birthday, very overwhelmed by loneliness, I sought solace in a new unhealthy way.  
  
Despite my religious background, I spiraled into engaging with sex workers, creating a recurring pattern over the past five months. Despite efforts to break free, loneliness and weakness persist, seriously impacting my finances and health. I've faced toxic relationships and continue to attract the wrong people, leaving me deeply troubled.  


I look and act so physically matured, that I only get noticed by older females and males. Hardship has really toughened me up, made me very strong too. I cant remember dating within my age range. I date girls of late 20s and early 30s. It doesn't last because they aspire marriage and I am not ready for that.  
  
Despite attempting socializing without success and maintaining a consistent workout routine, I'm still struggling. I seek guidance on breaking free from this cycle and improving my mental well-being.

"For the sake of the story all names listed in the post are fake. TW mention of SA.

I (20 F) chased two girls down an alleyway. I know how this sounds, so I’ll provide some context. 

It was my 20th birthday and I had just finished my appointment of getting my lashes done. I was feeling so happy about how they turned out, and was really feeling like that bitch. I started to walk back to my car and on my way there I had to walk down an alleyway. Usually I tend to avoid them but today I honestly was feeling like nothing could get in my way. As I was walking down this alleyway I noticed two girls out of the corner of my eye and instantly realised who they were. Two of my ex friends, stood in this alleyway, Kirra and Shania. Now I hadn’t seen these two in a while, as I had cut all contact with them over a year ago. Shania was a judgmental person but what made me really cut it with her was when I found out she was grooming a 14 year old whose older brother had recently passed away (Shania was 19 at the time). Kirra had her issues too, she had a white saviour complex and continuously raved on about how woke she was but when push came to shove she wouldn’t do anything. I explained to Kirra about what Shania had done but Kirra said “it’s hard to cut her off because I’ve known her for so long”. Which I know it is hard to let go of someone who you once loved but this situation involved a literal crime. I started to distance myself from Kirra as she continued to come up with excuses for Shania, but what finally broke the camels back was when I saw a video of her all over my ex that had SA’d me. So I guess you could say when I saw them I wasn’t too pleased. I decided I was going to be the bigger person and just ignore their small snickers. That was until Shania decided to yell out that I was a slut. A fire lit up in me, she really tested the wrong slut. I slowly started to walk to them and said “what did you say”. To which Shania replied with “you heard me”. So in my heels and dress I decided I was gunna drop some people on their asses today. I started to get closer to them checking the alleyway for cameras (none) then checking if there were other people or cops (none). I was in the clear and ready. As I began to drop my bag on the ground, they both realised what I was heading their way for, and began to run. I dropped my bad and jogged after them, my heals clanking on the ground with each stride. They turned around and saw I was coming after them to which they sprinted further (you wouldn’t have thought that Kirra had asthma with how fast she took off). Once they turned the corner, I turned around and walked back to my bag. I picked it up and proceeded to walk back to my car and thanked the universe for the birthday present of being able to put two cankles in their place.",I chased two girls down an alleyway,18kv2st,1702857535.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kv2st/i_chased_two_girls_down_an_alleyway/,
"ok…of my chest. i am 22F, and my mom abandoned me when i was 2 and my brother was 4. she left us home alone for days, until someone called the cops. (i obviously don’t remember this) a lot more happened , but that’s where i started so i’ll leave it at that.

"I've put a trigger warning just in case but there's no self harm, no violence in my story, and I'm not gonna commit suicide. I just really hope I'm gonna die soon.

I don't really have good reasons for it. I just don't fear death and the way I'm living right now makes me curious, I wanna know what happens after we die. I think about life kind of how I think about the first level in a video game I have no information on. I'm not gonna try to speedrun it, I wanna explore the game as much as I can, but then again I've seen this level already, I'm not a huge fan and I'd love to know what the next level is like (or to see the ending).

My life's okay I guess. I don't really wanna talk about it again. When I talk about this stuff, people try to offer solutions. I get that, I do it too most of the time. The problem is I just need a hug and someone to help me actually do stuff, just by being there. Maybe to check I'm not procrastinating again. Litterally just being in the room with me while I study for my exams. But when I say that, people always think I didn't look at the whole picture, that there's other stuff I could do to feel better, that I'd be overwhelmed if I worked more, that it would be a lot of work, that I need reassuring. I just want a fucking hug and someone to be in a room with me, preferably without even talking with me so that I can stay focused. I'm quite clearly depressed, I think so at least. I've been for most of my life, if not all of it. When I'm happy, my life is great honestly. I actually take care of myself, of my flat. I love working, but I can't focus if I'm not happy, and it's a horrible cycle : when I'm not happy, I can't focus enough to work as much as I'd need, but I understand things pretty fast so on a surface level it doesn't appear that much, so people think I'm lying when I say I basically don't work at all, and no one even thinks about helping me. 

Even when I ask, when I say I feel like shit, that I really need to just see them, get a hug and not talk about it until I'm at least calmed, they just tell me stuff like ""not now"", ""I don't feel like going out but talk to me about it"" (even when going out litterally means getting out of their appartment and meeting me in front of it), and when I end up explaining (only after they ask) they don't even consider my point of vue, they don't even try to confort me, to tell me they're here for me. If they even care (which isn't always the case, I  mean a few hours ago I've had a friend just leave the call (he didn't hang up, he just left the room for like 20mins and thought I wouldn't notice) after asking me repetedly to tell him about my life when I just wanted to say hi and chat a little (we used to call each other to have background noise, occupy our phones to keep us from procrastinating and make a few puns from time to time, I thought we could do that)), my friends only try to offer solutions without even listening to the whole story. I get it, I give too much details, but then again I'm just asking for hugs and a presence, if they want to know why the situation I'm in is making me feel bad, I kinda need to explain the situation (and easy-to-fix problems aren't really my thing, I'm more of a ""I'm in love with someone that probably still loves me but we can't be together because of trauma and also I might move in a few months"" kinda person, therefore it takes a while). I'm honestly tired of people not caring about me even slightly as much as I care about them.

Anyway, I just feel like having a heart attack would be way easier. I know I'm gonna fail my exams, in which case I have no idea what I can do. I don't have money, I don't have a job and most of my weeks are occupied by classes, which makes finding one really hard  (+ I can't drive). I really want/need to go live anywhere else, I've been here for too long for me not to feel like shit here (also I have an ex here now). But if I fail my exams, or don't have good enough results to be accepted elsewhere, I'll have to stay for at least 1 to 3 years. I don't really have a choice about that, it's basically that or I go live with my parents, which is never a good idea as far as I'm concerned, I just don't have enough money to consider anything else. Mostly I feel like I'm going to disappoint everyone.

The thing is that I had never felt that much loved, the way she looked at me in the eyes and how she would randomly look at me and smile before kissing me, the way she would talk to me as no one else did before, she really made me feel special and loved. We hung out again a few days later and once again, I felt at peace while being with her, all my problems would fade away as I was next to her.

I talked to my friends about my situation and they all agreed that I should dump her, so that's what I did, I told her while on the phone as she started crying and begging me to think about it, on that moment all my friends where laughing and everything which made me think it was kind of ""cool"" even though deep down I knew it was wrong and I was feeling terrible to the point of not being able to sleep that night. Everytime I would go out, I would get a girl, but at the end of the day, I was all alone, I was missing that love she gave me. That is one of, if not the worst, mistake I've made in my life. I kind of broke her heart in a way that she would start having bad habits like she stopped eating and started smoking again. I now realize the terrible mistake that I did and I'm absolutely sorry for what I did. Since then, I tried and I keep trying to replace her multiple times with different women, but I kind of just use them to replace her, so I end up leaving them and emotionally hurting them too since I feel like I can't catch feelings anymore. They do love me as she did but l'm just unable to feel that love and I don't care anymore because no one feels like her, no one comes close to her and the love she gave me. I do think about it on a daily, sometimes even crying myself to sleep watching our old pictures together or reading our old messages. I sometimes randomly get the smell of her perfume or get flashbacks of the moments we shared, my heart even skips a beat when I hear her name. I kind of zone out everytime I walk past the spots we used to hang out at. I feel guilty about everything because I'm the one who took the decision of leaving her. It has been a long time since I had a good amount of sleep because of the overthinking and asking to myself if I would ever be able to experience that beautiful side of love again.",I’m lost,18kuku5,1702856099.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kuku5/im_lost/,
"I’m barely considered an Adult so call it an early life Crisis. 

I just sort of lost the girl I’d consider the one. Yeah I know, “Woah is me, I got broken up with, my life is over”, but idk. Just sorta felt like dogshit every day since. There’s no chance or opportunity I can see where I’m with her again. And no- there was no cheating or ugly breakup, she’s just going through a lot of personal stuff, and she can’t be in a relationship while she deals with it. Totally understand, I’d be doing us both worse if I had a problem with it. The issue is that while I lost my partner, I lost my best friend. There’s not a single person I’d talk to over her, she’s literally the perfect girl, i haven’t ever met someone I could have a better conversation with or tell more things, and now I have to live with her moving on in front of my very eyes. 

I know practically everyone’s dealt with breakups like this, I know life is filled with dozens of moments where someone thought they’ve lost “The one”, but I guess this is just my first and it’s hard to deal with. I don’t really have many friends capable of helping or that I want to bother, so a lot of this I have to deal with on my own. 

It’s not even the only thing I have to deal with, I’ve dealt with motivational depression my whole life, I can’t really bring myself to do anything meaningful anymore. The breakup isn’t really helping either, it’s hard to do anything without that light at the end of the tunnel.  I can’t say there’s a single thing I’ve done really worth noting in the past few months. I can’t do college while dealing with everything, and I can’t do what matters, I’m so upset at myself for letting it get this bad but I don’t know how to break the cycle.

My aunts boyfriend stole some intimate stuff over the summer and kept going into my room. My aunt didn’t believe me and instead got upset at me for having the things I had.  Despite catching him going into my room on camera she was still upset. 

After that I planned to move in with my dad but after looking into transferring I discovered I would have to repeat senior year. So now I’m just stuck here. They always fight and I get scared I’m going to have to jump in and protect my aunt. I have no access to a car so I have no way to get groceries, do laundry etc. My dad gives me money but I always end up spending it so quickly because of having to order everything. 

Today, I was sitting on the coach and caught my aunts boyfriend staring at me, I’m really scared of him. Sitting here sick to my stomach thinking of doing this for another 6 months. My mental health has gotten so bad that I cut off all my friends and I’m on the verge of failing my classes. I feel so trapped. Luckily I’m going to my dads for Christmas but even then I’m nervous I’m not going to get a ride. My aunt says she’ll take me but she’ll have to use her boyfriends car and he hates me. Just needed to at least tell someone.

"I don't like to be in the background. I want to be the main character.

However I have to understand that sometimes the main character is a humble person that lets and is comfortable with others be in the center. That accept that others are eating even though I'm hungry about a situation. In this case, hungry would be hungry for the attention of girls. 

It's like I don't always have to get the biggest piece of the meat. I want to know how to have self control and be a gentleman. Sometimes is knowing how to lose too.

I know It's a practice. I know It's growth. I can do my best and still have awkward and difficult moments from time to time. We are all humans and have necessities and learning. I guess I need self acceptance and self forgiveness. Because when I accidentally show signs that I'm mad or envious because I wanted to get ""the biggest piece of the meat"". I feel a lot of shame because others noticed my vulnerabilities and uncomfort.

I want to be able to go out with really good looking guys and still be confident in myself. I don't want to discriminate them just because they are good looking and good with girls. I want to learn to be comfortable knowing how to divide attention. How to be the humble friend on the back whenever it's time.


When I see a beautiful girl, if I'm alone the attention is all mine but if I'm with friends and especially when I'm with a better looking friend I have to divide attention and I may even receive none. A girl maybe I wanted attention from might prefer my friend. Or sometimes is not even that I wanted her for me. Sometimes it's just like you just want to feel special and that they liked you.

A good way I found to tackle this is not to expect attention everytime time but only from the girls I actually like.

I guess I have trouble with this because I'm the only child. I guess I have trouble with this because I was popular in high school and got so much attention for being good looking. 

I just think it's very selfish of me, for in general feeling comfortable with people that I feel I might receive more attention with and feeling threatened with people that I feel I might lose the golden attention.

Another thing I feel like makes me envious and uncomfortable with this situation is because maybe is because I have a lot of difficulties with communication and with being social and building relationship. So when I go out with a confident friend I feel bad I can't move freely like them.

"To be honest, this thoughts have been hunting me for a while but since last night, it seems to get more real and I'm writing this because I need to take it off my mind and talk to someone, because it feels I'm about to collapse. Yesterday, I (20F) was at home with some friends and they were helping to do a collage (we like to do those things because it helps with our anxiety) and all the four of us were having fun. We went to eat the snacks in the kitchen and when we're going back to my room, my mother (50F) stopped us to praise my friends for being thin and I'm starting became a fatty. My friends were mad at her for the comment because I was visible sad with her comment, but didn't said anything because they were afraid my mom'd make a scene if they said anything. Though, they talked to me and make it clear that they think my mom was wrong in that moment.

Later in night, my friends got home and I was starting to finish my collage alone, but then my mom came to see it and start to criticize it. I didn't said a word, though, she came back later to see how it was going and when she tried to look, I pulled it from her before she catched it. She was angry and asked me if she wasn't allowed to look anymore and say she wasn't as long she was seeing it only to criticize it. She said I was crazy, then pulled it from my hands and looked, only to give me a disapproving and leave.

Since it happened, I couldn't stop thinking about during my whole life, she's been doing things like it. Every time some one praises me for something, she founds something to criticize about me, especially about my appearance hair, skin, speech and posture, but mostly weight in the last past weeks. I know I've gained weight since I've started my new work (11 pounds in three and a half months) and I'm trying to lose it, but I don't need it to be rub on my face every time I'm eating. It came to a point in which I'm having difficult on eating and want to cry when I see the food. I've asked my friends to remind of not eating in work's break, but they don't want because they believe it's unhealthy for me not eating for the entire time period since I go to my job and leave (It's from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.) . My BMI says I'm on my healthy weight for my height but I can't avoid feeling I'm too overweight.

She's also be commenting on my hair and how it has frizz, unlike hers (my hair is curly and hers, straight). I also wanted to have my hair braided because I like it that way, but she said my hair would not ever be beautiful if I put it and some other comments which were hurtful and it was when I started to notice she seems dislikes almost everything I like.

I love my mom, I really do love her and I don't think she knows how bad and hurtful her comments are to me, but reflecting everything since last night made me realize she might loves me as her daughter but dislikes what I like, the way I am and behave (I'm very shy and she's very sociable) and even my appearance.

"Goodness gracious me I'm so wound up about this I feel like if I just vent it here I will feel cleansed or something.

I'm in the UK and am very lucky to live out in the countryside surrounded by small beautiful stone villages. Every year there is a fantastic Christmas event for young farmers which comprises of approximately 150 festively decorated tractors touring the area. It's a brilliant display and raises a lot of money and awareness for struggling British farmers and mental health. I'm talking Santa's grotto tractor style, it's epic. Unfortunately this evening during the event, I was working.

This is directed at all the people who booed me and shouted out at me for unfortunately becoming stuck in the beautiful line of tractors, specifically to the opinionated loudmouth in Sabden who called me a daft git...

While you enjoyed your Sunday roast dinner and got to stand outside your homes half drunk and merrily enjoying the tractor run, I was out driving from home to home visiting vulnerable elderly people in their homes. I cook meals for people who can't, I administer crucial medication to people who aren't able to safely administer their own, I look after peoples personal hygiene and make sure they tucked up cosily in bed at night then I wish them sweet dreams and make sure they're locked in safe for the night. This is my job that I love and I was working. I'll be working Christmas day too. I love the people I support to stay in their own homes, does that make me a daft git? I might well be looking after your elderly relatives one day?

Vent over. It's a stressful job at the best of times but when you're having to drive at 10mph between visits when you have a short enough time as it is, being made to feel like something on the bottom of someone's shoe was quite hard to deal with.

"Sometimes I go clubbing, and there is so many attractive young girls but I end up getting so focused on the mature ladies. 

It looks off when I'm with an older woman. It attracts a lot of attention. 

It makes me feel weird too. I feel like I kind of start loosing that respect I have for the elders because I start looking at the ladies in a different way. So it has been hard in making good terms with this. 

As an example It's weird when I meet my mom friends and I feel sexually attracted towards them and I don't have that genuine respect and boundaries. It's weird when I meet older woman with my friends, or they talk about their moms and all of a sudden get anxiety and feel guilty because I know I have a strong attraction for older woman. I get anxiety I might feel attracted to my friend's moms and not give them the pure respect. This guilt feels more strong when I decide to actively start seeking and that I like older women.

What should I do about this ?

I used to live in a big city where I didn't know a lot of people. So it was much easier to be with older woman.

However now I live in my hometown which is small and most people know one another or at the least have common friends. It's very hard to go to a club or a night out and there is no one there that you dont know. So it's been making it hard to follow up with my desires because I don't have that privacy.

I had decided to stop chasing older woman because it was making me guilty and uncomfortable around my family, in a certain way it was making me feel impure. However lately I have been feeling more established. I have been working in relationships in general and I'm feeling a strong desire to give it a try again. 

I'm 32 years old now. I like women in their 40s 50s and sometimes even 60s. I found an opportunity to be with a woman in her 60s once. It made me feel very uncomfortable and guilty the thought of it even in front of my grandmother. I kept thinking I'm not that pure young boy they used to know anymore. 

I don't know, what I feel about older woman is that they are more safe I guess. Young girls are more judgemental, and unstable, it's like I'm afraid to be my total real self with a younger girl. But I feel like an older woman would be more accepting of me. I feel like they can be more caring. Physically also I'm very attracted to mature woman. I like the soft body. I like how their body is more developed. I don't mind that their boobs falls down or whatever. Phisically I'm super attracted to it.

I wouldn't even mind moving in with a mature women. And I have never lived with any of my past girlfriends because I didn't want to commit and lose my freedom. 

Anyways I don't want to stay too long with an older woman because I want to build my own family to and have a couple of kids. So it would probably just be a temporary thing. I also don't want to be with older woman and then only when I'm in my 40s and 50s I noticed that I haven't had any experience with younger girls. 

Last time, I was sitting at a restaurant drinking a coffee, this mature lady sat down eating lunch she kept making eye contact with me so much. I was thinking in going for it and make a small interaction but I kept thinking maybe she could be my mother's friend. Maybe she could be somebody I know mothers. I don't want my friends to see me as a threat that I could make a move in their mom and stuff. I was thinking if others see me they going to judge me etc. so I left without saying anything.

The other day I was at the club and I saw an older woman I tried making a move in her, and I felt so many people staring. She didn't want to really respond to me maybe because she feels uncomfortable about it too.

Another thing is where I live the women have kids so young. So sometimes you meet a girl before even reaching 40 she already have a grown up kid. Sometimes some women I'm looking at could have kids that are same age or even older than me. So it makes it even more awkward. They certainly don't want to see their mother with a younger guy.

Anyways sometimes I even think I should move out so I can be more incognito and free. But I do love my hometown. 

Is there a way I should feel more comfortable with this and remove guilt from this or should I put boundaries on this and respect ages? 

Anyways I do noticed a lot of older woman sometimes even who are married being acttractred to me.x

"So my wife and I were married for 6 years and together for 9 when she left me. We were high school sweethearts, and I thought we had an amazing relationship. We were one of those couples that everyone was jealous of. I was head over heels for her, and I thought she was for me too. We had always talked about having a family, and for the first 3 years of our marriage, we were actively trying. However, we found out that I was infertile, and we were devastated. It sent my wife into a depression, and for a while, I thought our marriage was going to fail. It was a really rough time for us. However, we eventually came to the decision that we would try to save up for in vitro fertilization, and that if that didn't work, we would look into other options. So we spent the next 2 years saving up every penny we could. It was hard, but we both really wanted children. I thought we were doing really well, and I thought that our marriage was stronger than ever. We finally had enough money to undergo the procedure, and we were just about to make an appointment when my wife told me that she was having second thoughts. She said that she was worried that she would not be able to love a non-biological child as much as a biological one. I told her that I understood her concerns, but that I thought we should try anyways. She said she needed time to think about it. A few weeks later, she told me that she had made up her mind, and that she did not want to go through with IVF. I was very disappointed, but I told her that I loved her and that I would support her in whatever she wanted to do. I told her that we could look into other options. However, she said that she had actually made up her mind about something else. She said that she had been seeing someone else for a few months and that she was in love with him. She said that she was moving in with him. I was completely blindsided. There had been no signs of this at all. I was completely devastated. I begged her to reconsider, but she said that her mind was made up. She left, and that was the last time I ever saw her. I was a complete wreck for a long time. I had no idea that anything was wrong in our marriage, and I had no idea that she was seeing someone else. I was in a very dark place for a long time, and I thought about ending things. However, I eventually sought therapy, and with the help of a therapist, I was able to work through my feelings and get to a better place. I was able to move on, and I eventually started dating again. However, I still thought about my ex-wife from time to time, and I always wondered what had happened to her. I had no way of contacting her, as she had changed her phone number and all of her social media accounts. So I was completely shocked when, 3 years after she left me, she showed up at my door. At first, I thought she was there to apologize for what she had done to me, but then I saw that she was holding a baby. She said that she needed to talk to me. She had a baby from him and he dumped her after she gave birth. She is begging me to take her back and I don't know what to do

"My wife Lucy, and I are struggling with some behavior from her parents and younger sister, Molly. There’s a lot surrounding the events and I have ADHD but I will tell this story as clearly as possible. 

Backstory—Molly was (is still possibly) an addict, in rehab 10ish years ago. Before rehab, Lucy was the only one that pushed the family for Molly to get help. Parents are enablers and  ignored Lucy telling them Molly was on drugs. (Lucy found a bag of white powder in Molly’s room, showed parents. “Oh that’s probably just flour.”) After rehab, Molly was ok for a bit. Would drink heavily sometimes but was somewhat stable. 3 years ago, Molly got divorced and moved back in with parents, sharing custody of two kids. These kids have seen a lot with two parents as drugs addicts and have trauma and some behavioral issues. 

Lucy and I have been together 4.5 years. As I said, Molly was ok the first couple years. Lucy has constantly been pushing for both Molly and mom to get in therapy. (Mom had a traumatic childhood that she buried resulting in physical manifestations a couple years ago so she desperately needed it as well.) After a couple of hospitalizations, mom and Molly agreed that they each would go to therapy if the other did. Never happened. 

After the divorce, there was a lot of drama between Molly and her ex that kept increasing Molly’s anger and aggression and her mental health kept declining. She started smoking weed because of the stress which was a slight concern to the rest of the family, but not much was said. They’ve been in a custody battle started by the ex for the last 6ish months that finally culminated a couple of weeks ago in her ex relinquishing and giving full custody to Molly. 

Their parents bought a new house about a year ago. They stated the condition of Molly and the kids moving with them was that Molly had to go to therapy and start working on herself. Again, never happened. Their parents will not enforce boundaries with Molly, simplistically because she’s the baby and “fragile”  because of the drug addiction. Although somehow Lucy isn’t “fragile” even though she had horrible mental health and multiple attempts on her life during high school. This is where pretty much all of the problems lie—that parents will not enforce boundaries with Molly. Molly’s behavior, as well as her son’s (that he has learned from her), is now affecting the entire family. Lucy’s two other siblings have become concerned, think she’s on stuff harder than weed, and are hesitant to let their young children go to the house to spend time with grandparents because of Molly and her son, Mark. 

Mark’s (11 yo) issues pretty much all stem from both his parent’s behavior and how he has been taught to handle situations. (Lucy and I genuinely believe he would be an amazing kid if not for how they treat him.) Screaming, cussing and uncontrolled emotions are how situations are supposed to be handled so he reacts to situations exactly as his parent’s would. They’ve both put hands on him multiple times and he is screamed at constantly. He was suspended from school 10+ times over the last year for fights or other aggressive behavior. He got expelled a couple of months ago and was placed in alternative school by the school system and has been suspended/sent home at least 3 times from there.  

We watch him and his sister to help out, but also sometimes he just wants to come over and hang out with his aunts. We have lots of dogs which he loves. He loves helping, cooking. He get so excited when it’s time to feed the dogs. He’s been helping with construction on our house. He is a good kid at heart, but needs some hardcore therapy and lifestyle changes. 

He came over last month after a fight at alternative school. He didn’t want to but Lucy dad told him he had to because all the adults in their house were working. (Lucy is a stay at home wife and I only work 3-4 days a week.) We were working on house projects with my dad and Mark spent a good bit of time with him and he opened up to my dad a little. Told him about the fight at school and told him about a fight with his mom. The original story was that Molly wanted to talk to him about something and he didn’t want to so he hit her on the side of the head. Mark tells my dad that Molly picked him up by his collar and thought she was going to punch him the stomach. We talked to Lucy’s parents after my dad told us this and her dad pretty much just said Mark was lying to my dad and he doesn’t want to talk about it or deal with it. Lucy tried to discuss Molly’s behavior with her mom but was again brushed off. Mom basically said Molly is a lost cause and she just wants to help Mark because “he can still be saved.” 
We both kept pushing and trying to explain that he cannot get better if Molly is not putting in the same effort. 
They said, “He’s 11 and he should know that his behavior is unacceptable.” 
Lucy responded, “How can you expect him to behave better than his mother? How can you get mad at him for behavior that you let his mom get away with constantly? He see’s his mom disrespecting you constantly in your house with no consequences so obviously he can too.” 
“Well he’s been living with us for over a year, so he should be better now.” 
“One year of consistency cannot undo 10+ years of trauma!” 
We asked them about therapy, which the school helped set up. Lucy’s mom said he’d gone a few times but wouldn’t talk to the therapist anymore. I told her, maybe a little too forcefully, that it did not matter if he wasn’t talking he should still be going and he will talk eventually. She was quiet to that.

It all came to a head this week. Lucy had said that she wouldn’t make Mark come over again if he didn’t want to, which he didn’t, but Lucy’s parents were going out of town for the weekend. Molly had to work all weekend, 10-12 hour days, so we hesitantly agreed to watch the kids for Friday night. Lucy said it was more to help out her dad and not to help Molly. She picks the kids up from school but there was apparently no communication from dad to Molly so the kids had nothing with them. No clothes and Mark had just started a new ADHD med that he couldn’t miss a dose. So when I get home from a 12 hour shift, we drive over 40 minutes to get what they need thinking Molly couldn’t bring their things because of work. Instead we find Molly and her flavor of the month high as fuck in their parents house that now reeks of like weed. (Mom smokes cigarettes but absolutely will not smoke in their brand new house.) This pissed Lucy off, so she went outside for a few minutes to play with the dogs and cool off. She comes back in and we start trying to get the kids together. It’s after 10pm and they are very sleepy. Mark and climbed into his grandparents bed and dozed off. Lucy gets him up with a bunch of protests of he just wants to stay there. It was explained that he cannot stay by himself because of his granddad doesn’t trust him after his behavior the last year. She finally gets him up and he goes upstairs. She then calls Molly over the hall and asks what is sitting on their parents bed that her son had just been laying in. It’s a strap on. Molly simply walked in and shoved it under the blanket. 

Lucy moves on and goes to get Mark from upstairs. I can hear her talking to him, acknowledging his feelings but standing firm on why he can’t stay by himself. He then stomps down the stairs extremely hard and throws himself on to the cough, yelling about how he just wants to stay with his dog. We calmly explain again why he cannot while trying to still acknowledge his feelings. Lucy is tugging on him a little trying to urge him up, without success. She says, “Mark, we are going either way. You’re too big. I’m not going to carry you.” “Oh, I will!” I snapped. I scooped him under his arm and drug him into the kitchen where he very aggressively slings his phone off the counter, putting a whole in the wall. I grab him and pull both arms behind his back briefly. “We’re not doing this,” I tell him. He was relaxed enough and I spun him around and had a bit of a heart to heart about how I know how he’s feelings  but actions have consequences and that is what he’s facing right now—his behavior led granddad not to trust him so he is not allowed to stay by himself anymore. Meanwhile Molly never moves, just stands in the kitchen cooking like nothing his happening. He’s still crying about the dog so we tell him he can go say bye but we start the whole process again—physically drag him off the bed, stomps down the stairs but at least runs outside this time. We go out and Lucy and thought he’d taken off. He’s sitting by the car on the passenger side and Lucy has to pull him off the ground and starts forcing him in the car. She’s strong, he’s 11 and she tells him he’s never going to win. He’s pushing against the door frame as Lucy is physically moving his limbs into the backseat. During this, there were multiple times where I thought he was going to hit her. She finally gets him in. I shut the door and put the child lock on and walk to the other side. As I do, he yells at his sister, who’s sitting in back driver side, to move. He draws back but doesn’t hit her. He launches himself out of the open door as I come around. I throw my arm out to stop him. He’s flailing his arms, not necessarily trying to hit, but being aggressive and threatening enough that I was concerned. I pull his arms behind him again and he’s fighting so hard, I turn us around and press him against the car. This pissed him off but got his attention as I had intended. We finally get him back in the car, screaming and crying about how he just wants his dog while Lucy is holding and saying “I know you hate me right now and that’s ok. I love you. I promise I love you.” He falls asleep in the car and once we get home her and I both hug him and apologize for the situation getting to where it did but that his behavior was unacceptable and aggressive and we had no choice. He hugged back, and we kept telling him we loved him. 

We have decided one final conversation with her parents about Molly and their enabling. We’ve had multiple convos and they don’t care, but Lucy needs to get some things off her chest and create closure for herself to know she’s done everything she can. She wants to help her parents in regards to Molly, but you can’t help people who don’t want help. We are done helping Molly until we see actual change or effort and we are done with parent’s enabling of her. We are setting hard boundaries. The kids are allowed to come over if they ASK, but we absolutely are not watching them if it’s just because Molly needs it. We will help her parents with normal life stuff if they need, but nothing to do with Molly until they can set and keep boundaries with her.

"He broke up with me 6 months ago due to family pressure, however since he always told me he loves me up untill that breakup point, I had hopes till this day. Emotionally I am at the same place he left me 6 months ago - shattered, but after what I've read today on his Reddit account, I feel like a lightning struck me. While he wants to meet his new GF's parents and is searching for an expensive box of chocolates, I am wondering why did he stalk me from his alt accounts on all platforms, why did he send me ""Happy Birthday"" on my brithday over his status which was a month ago. And before you ask how I know, I know because the situations were very specific. I just cannot accept yet that he moved on so fast, and whats even worse, while he was checking up on my profiles, he was in a new relationship.

"  


I have so many thoughts in my head that i can't express. I try to talk, write, sing, paint, but i can't.  
I try to be myself everyday, but it feels like my expression of self has a sent that attracts people who want to have what i have. I'm not strong enough to keep them away and have them not step into my boundaries.   
I'm confident in who i am, but my sense of self is fragile. If someone tells me I'm mean, I'll believe them. I hate being interpreted as mean. But the consequence is that i let people who hate who i am, define me. I don't like people interpreting me, giving them something as a ""bribe"". I want to give you that because i love making people happy. I don't expect anything from you, nor do i give you something because i want you to like me. Its just who i am.   
There is too much to be sad about in this world. If i can make someone happy, then that makes me happy. I don't like people always taking every action i do as something suspicious. I have a suspicion that i might be autistic, I'm getting it checked out and am waiting for my turn to be evaluated.   
The thing is that I've lived a very very sheltered life. I was not allowed to go outside to hang out with friends. Everything i said was second guessed when i was a kid. I was only believed when i was lying. Somehow i never learned to just.... lie. I hate lying.  


  
When i started Uni, i went in with the mindset that ""i can pretend to be who i want, no one knows me"". I was very good at faking confidence. But i always attracted people who wanted to be me. I hated me. It didn't matter, they wanted to be me/have what i had.   
So i always built connections and routine for myself and then someone who came along or was in my group decides that, no they want that so they decide to turn everyone against me. It always works. Why? No one even bothers to ask me. So now I'm 30 and i have 1-2 friends. They live far away and honestly i don't even know if they are my friends. I try to ask if they want to hang but it trickles to nothing. Well, that may be adulthood i guess.  
I honestly have no idea what to do. I want to show people my true side. But if i do i get used and trampled on. If i don't show my true side, i get people who are interested but it's clear that they are only interested because they think I'm mysterious and they think I'm... cool? I don't know. I don't feel cool. But they act like i know everything and know what to do in any situation. I'm tired and i don't want to think. But when i do that and let myself just not think. People who want to use me come into my life.  


  
I've only had one person truly see me in my life. At the time i didn't know what that meant to me or how that relationship impacted me till later in my life. But i messed it up and now I'm 100% sure that my friends partner has made me out as a manipulative and intentional homewrecker. I hate that. I hate that more than anything. I hate how i treated my friend, but it hurts thinking that my friend think that way of me.   
That friend of mine has been my only ever thing I've regretted so much that I'd want to fix it. I have regretted things in my past, but I've always accepted my fault and brought the event with me to learn and to be able to grow. But this event is killing me slowly. I get that i can't make it right, only to make sure it doesn't happen again.   
But I'm scared that i won't be able to find someone like them again. It's been almost a decade since, and i have been out trying to make friends, but i haven't found anyone like them again. I'm longing for true connection. And it might show and make it hard to form connection. I can add that i do look pretty ok, so i don't have a hard time meeting people. But it's the true connection i miss. It's a hard thing to build and the older i get the more reserved people are.  


  
Now I'm alone. I'm hurt. I'm heartbroken. From friendships and relationships. I'm trying to build again, for the 100:th time. But I'm slower and tired. I know i will build again. But I'm scared that the same people will find me again and the shit-show will start again. I don't have energy for that anymore. So I'm building now. I'm being careful. But i have a feeling that some may find their way in. I don't have the energy to fight it. So, what's the point of building again? I don't want to do this again. However hard i try to meet different people, the same ones find me. I really do try to fight them off (not literally).   
I'm weak. Everyone says I'm strong. I'm not strong. I'm only strong if i have people around me that i have true connections with. But sadly no. I feel empty. I feel like I'm walking around outside of society, looking at people living their lives. Living happily while pushing their feelings aside to be able to live in society. I don't know how to do that. I need to feel my feelings in order to be stable and to be able to understand what goes on around me.   
I can act like everyone else and just do whatever and move on with my life. But it feels like i put myself into a sleep. And usually when i wake up i fall into a depression trying to sort through all the information i was not able to process while sleeping.  


  
I don't belong to this world. However i don't want to leave. I believe that human connections are the most beautiful thing. I love seeing people happy, i love to be able to contribute to that happiness. It makes me feel like I've done good in this world. I love helping people, usually helping people means they've been helped on a deeper level and it's always a profound experience for them. I love that i was the one who gave them that.   
But then they've been helped and need to move on. It's beautiful! But i miss being woundable with friends who love me for who i am. Who won't see me differently when i am different versions of me. Sad, happy, neutral, exhilarated, angry, illogical. I miss that with my former friend.

"I’m scared of people and men in general. I have no problem interacting online, but offline I’m so shy and scared that I can barely say anything. I’m also quite aggressive when it comes to my freedom and I really need time alone.

I want someone who’d be by my side, who’d support me, to whom I can talk to and who will leave me alone for some time when I need it. Sometimes I think I need a friend more than a lover, but I need them to be two in one package. I want my lover to be my friend first. 

Sometimes I think I want a daddy. Yeah….well… I’m cringing just by writing it, but I can’t help but like the idea. Recently a man suggested something like this to me (sugar daddy) and I said no to save my face and pride. But I keep thinking and fantasising about it. What if I said yes?

Sometimes I think I’ll be better with a girlfriend. But I won’t be able to date publicly and I have to find a bi girl or a lesbian first and then talk to them… and then have them agree to date secretly and then keep it a secret.

"I don't know if this really belongs here but I really need to get this out.

My mom has struggled with mental health my whole life. Work is stressful and her meds don't always help. We've been trying to get her meds changed but doctors are slow. Last month she had a plan to kill herself and stayed in a hospital for a couple days.

Every time that I think she might be getting a little better everything just gets worse. I'm not ready to lose my mom but I don't know how to get through to her that we love her. My dad is trying his best, my siblings and I are trying our best. I can't lose my mom and I'm so scared that I'm going to wake up and shes not going to be alive anymore. Or that I'm going to come home from school and shes not going to be alive anymore. I've had nightmares since she got home from the hospital of a million ways I could wake up she be gone and I can barely get though the day without crying anymore. I can barely go to school or get up because I'm scared that I might do something wrong and that be what pushes her over the edge.

I love my mom so much, shes the best mom I could ever ask for. I just don't know if my family is enough to keep her alive. I don't think it is. I wish I knew why we aren't enough. I've tried accepting that she will never get better but I just can't. This is to big for me but I want to just make it all better. My mom will never get better but all I want is to know that I can go to sleep and know that she will be there when I wake up. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't think this is something I can fix. I'm at the point where I'm just trying to brace myself just in case. I don't want to lose my mom, I want her to see my siblings and I graduate, I want her to see us get married, I want to see my mom retire and get old but I don't think that ever going to happen.

"I'm a teenager who's still living at home (obv) and 2 months ago, I was feeling kind of depressed and a little bit suicidal (Im too much of a coward to actually act on those thoughts tho) and I just felt the need to write something down to get these feeling off my mind.

I was muttering to myself that I did not want to get in the car because I was terrified. When my mom showed him the note, he got mad just like I said. It was kind of understandable, but he took it a bit too far. He said I didn't even understand what pain was and that I was selfish for thinking my family wasn't good enough for me to tell them anything because I said I didn't know why I was feeling these things (which was the truth) he then told me I couldn't use my phone after-school (I can use it on weekends and breaks) and some other stuff. I told my brothers about it a day after (They're both 18m) and one of them was understandably mad at him for saying that. But now, everyone is acting like nothing happened.

"I volunteer at a cat adoption site on weekends. It’s lovely work, I clean their condos, play with them, and screen potential adopters and walk them through the paperwork. It’s the best feeling to watch a cat that was surrendered at 8 years old get adopted by a perfect family not even a week later—it gives me hope that good people are everywhere and willing to do the next right thing, and of course it means that one more cat gets a shot at the good life full of love they deserve. 


I have my own cats (rescued a pregnant stray and kept her and two of her kittens), and I am very fine with loving the cats at the shelter but letting them go when their adoption day arrives. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing very sweet and playful cats and seeing them off. However, last week, I ended up covering extra shifts and got to know one cat particularly well. She is playful, extremely affectionate and clingy, and overall a one-in-a-million kind of kitty! I have only experienced this kind of love for my own cats at home. 


Naturally, an application finally went through for her and she will likely go home during the week. When I go in for my next shift, she’ll be gone. 


I am happy she doesn’t have to spend too much time in the shelter. She was surrendered recently and is barely older than a year and six months—her best years will be long and happy and full of love. But I can’t help but feel terribly upset and sad that I didn’t get more time with her, or adopt her myself. I keep telling myself that it wouldn’t have been a good fit because my cats are all related and have never met feline strangers, and they would have been upset to have their routines uprooted. I also tell myself that every cat adopted out to a good family makes room for the next cat in need, especially since we’re a no-kill shelter. It still hurts in spite of it all. I loved that little cat very much. I’m kicking myself for being so soft-hearted about a known risk of volunteering with animals, especially since I’ve been fine with it so far.

"I keep overthinking all my interactions with my mom as I secretly plan to move out and its definitely an experience. 

Earlier, she asked me if I wanted to cook something or order something for dinner. There was no 'WE', it was me supplying the food either way - just a matter of if I was being her butler or her wallet. I said I was ambivalent as she started musing about what restaurant she wanted to order from, before I stepped out and said that I was going to cook for myself specifically and then left. 

A few hours later, she says she got a 'gift' from one of her 'friends' in the form of a grubhub gift card and that she ordered McDonalds. So, because I refused to pay for her dinner, rather than cooking anything in the fridge herself, she immediately reached out to her 'male friend' and got him to foot the bill. Nice.

She got me (23F) a Happy Meal. The conversation that revealed this felt like I was talking to a brick wall or an oblivion NPC:

Me: ""Oh Mcdonalds? (Sarcasm) Did you get me a happy meal? I was just reading a story about how someone was throwing down in Nova Scotia over Pokemon Cards that come in happy meals.""

Mom: (Serious) ""Yes, we got you a happy meal."" 

Me: ""Wait actually?"" 

Mom: ""You'll have to look up what the toy in it is.""

Me: ""Well I know the toy, I was just saying that people were freaking out over pokemon cards.""

Mom: (walking away) ""Yeah I don't know, look it up."" 

Me: ""I wasn't asking what it was though.""

Mom: ""It'll be here in 15 minutes.""

I've had more cohesive conversations with ChatGPT, so often when we talk it feels as if she's responding only to what she wants to hear rather than to a single thing I'm actually saying.

And ordinarily, the happy meal thing would be a funny joke, don't get me wrong. But in this context it felt almost offensive, especially because she made the side comment that she got me a water bottle with it as she knows I don't always drink soda. Just, the fact that at no point did she even try to speak to me? To mention that she was ordering food, ask me if I wanted any, what I wanted to drink, none of that?

"So I have been with my husband for over 15 years now and I have always been aware of his anger issues but it never really seemed to get this out of hand so I just tried to see it as a bad lifetime. However, my daughter, who is currently 14, was very afraid of him since she was very young and I always had to confront him whenever he started yelling because she would run to her room and would not stop screaming and crying. Whenever I suggested that he take anger management classes he would get angry at me and at my daughter, saying he was the man of the house and if he wanted to raise his voice he would do it. Well, two days ago he made me realize he would never change and I was being an idiot for keeping my daughter in this environment. My daughter has suffered from panic attacks for the past three years now and me and her therapist have been working very closely with her to get them to stop. Thankfully, for the past two months she hasn't had a single panic attack, at least until two days ago. My husband and my daughter were playing a game when my husband got a call from his mother, so he went to the other room to receive the call as it was very loud. While he was doing this my daughter started shaking and I could see she was having a panic attack. I immediately got up and sat with her. I told her to look at me and try to breathe in slowly, which thankfully she started doing. I started stroking her hair while she was calming down and after a while she was completely okay and that's when she told me she was feeling very scared when my husband received the call. According to her she did not feel good about him leaving her alone. I told her I would talk to her father and make sure this doesn't happen again. I then asked her if she wanted to lie down in her room for a while and she said yes. As I helped her stand up my husband walked in and asked what was going on. All I told him was that our daughter had a panic attack and was going to take a small nap. And so I have my daughter to a room. She was still very shaken up from the attack. I had only been with her for a few minutes when I heard my husband screaming in the living room. I immediately jumped out of bed and ran to see what was going on and that's when I saw my daughter crying and my husband screaming at her for being a coward and crying over nothing. I tried to pull him away but he yelled at me that I was babying her and making her weak which only made her cry harder. He then turned his attention back to her and asked her why at 14 she was still crying like a baby. I pulled her away and took her to our room and locked the door. I sat with her and told her that the way her father was treating her was wrong and she had no reason to be afraid. It was normal for her to be scared when she was receiving therapy for her panic attacks. But she just looked at me and kept crying saying she didn't want to be weak. I hugged her and told her she wasn't weak at all and she was very brave.

i have a pretty active social media presence, my profile is public and i regularly post on my account. and i still don’t feel like posting my s/o. i rarely post any friends either. i can’t remember the last time i did.

"I (21F) started thinking about what actually happened to me when i was 13-14 yo and I'm not sure what should I call it.

In school I used to have a female friend and we had this really strange codependent homoerotic friendship thing going on if you know what I mean. She was a year older than me and was more experienced in a relatioships and one day I strated noticing that she was flirting with me like really openly but I was a) a bit stupid kid so I didn't really understand If i liked it or not and what should I do about it and b) too codependent to even say something against it. Now it feels like I didn't have any personality at all back then, I was like her shadow or something. Listened to everything she said, went everywhere she went and all that.

And one day we went in a girls bathroom together after classes when the school was almost empty. I don't remember how we got here, what we talked about or did we even talk, and I don't remember how we even got to that but I remember that somehow we where into the toilet cubicle. She was closer to the door, I was facing her. She closed the door and came closer, making me sit down on the toilet lid. Then, without saying a word, she sat on my lap and pressed her cheek to mine. We where like that for a few seconds maybe but when I recall it now it feels like it was forever. Then, again without saying a word, she moved her face a bit so she was now touching my lips with hers, and started kissing me. I don't remember how long it lasted but I remember her pushing her tongue into my mouth, her body still pressing me down. I remember that my head felt so empty at the moment, I really didn't know what is happening and what should I do. I just froze.

I'm not sure what happened after that, all I remember was us going down to the locker room to go home after maybe a half an hour of whatever happened there. We where silent but she looked happy I think. I couldn't get a word out of myself. I didn't know how can I look her in the eyes after that and I wasn't sure if what just happened was okay, is that what people do when they like each other or what. The rest of the day I was mostly silent, it felt like my head was empty and my body was made of glass. We never talked about it after that (and before lol). 

For a long time after that I used to think it was just funny because after all it was my first kiss. I thought it was funny that you dream of some perfect cliche first kiss on the beach with the sunset and stuff but instead you get a kiss in a toilet cubicle in a girls school bathroom. I made fun of it. But after all this situation had some kind of impact on me that I started to understand just a few years ago. I'm still not sure if it was that terrible.

"I joined the Dofe program when I was 14. I thought it would be a fun experience and a way to make friends.It is not, Ive done my Bronze hike, and my Silver hike. Both of them were really hard on me more mentally than physically. My team excludes me. 

During my Bronze hike I was constantly getting told that Im doing something wrong (Things that Ive done multiple times before) got told Im weird for doing normal things (ex. Smiling). The girls in my team treated my like I was a child who needed to be watched, even tho I was the second oldest and tallest. I remember there was a look out tower and while the other girls were taking a nap I was crying up there and contemplating jumping off it so I could get hurt and be sent home. When I finished my bronze hike the coordinator hugged me and told me ""Congratulations, I didnt think you would make it""

During my Silver hike the girls still kept excluding me. They picked on me for the way I pulled cards while we were playing a game. They kept joking about the fact I dont really have full eyebrows (I dont have them bcs of a surgery I had when I was young). When I accidently knocked a girls bag of a bench she said ""Only [name] could do that"". When I asked that we stop for a bit when we were nearly at our camp they told me that everyone's tired and were nearly there (I was physically about to collapse on the spot) And it wasnt like I was complaining all of the hike. I didnt complain even once before that or after that.

My Gold hike is in 2025 and I know thats still far away, but I dont think I will mentally be able to spend 4 days in a foreign country with my team. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. :)

It's not hard for me to make acquaintances but close connection idk



- i can talk to many people but they don't fulfill my heart, the ones who do, i do try to get closer to them, tho usually most people are slow, so for me, i can immediately be very verbal that I like something about someone, but recently, i only felt worse and hurt by it as they don't mind my presence but i didn't felt they love it too


I'm aware i shouldn't create my future based on my past, but i don't think i can make friends as after I don't like someone (usually it's cause they did something against my morals and values) and people around me still keep them, I feel, i don't want this kind of friendship. As by that, I'll feel more alone by being with people who are fine with people who mistreat me or goes against moral.



- in relationship, I'm very inexperienced and i haven't explored much even though I'm 25+, I'm not easy at all, not low maintenance, i want to be independent and learn to live, so it's like i want other person's money, but I do only like to be treated in soft spoken way, holding in a way that I feel free. I don't even think I'm someone who can think of marriage and settling down so idk if someone will change my mind or I'll have different desire in future, I don't want kids too. I love to feel taken care of in ways, like being handled with love, respect and affection, I'm not goofy much, my humour is mostly witty so I don't enjoy silly bizzare things, so thinking about this and more, idk, i just don't know, even after I work on myself and be independent, will I'll meet someone who will make me go heads over heels for them, as to me, i only see point of relationship if it's very fun and loving.


So after this, i guess, maybe I'll grow up alone, and I do want to build a connection with myself, learn self love, heal from so many things and be ok, be better.



Tho I see people who aren't like me, who will be ok, with others, they aren't so difficult as me, they struggle with this too, i guess world is really teaching us to love ourselves first before thinking of anything else

"We've known each other since October of last year. We've been attracted to each other since almost day 1, and we've had intimacy in that time. It's been clear since I met her that she's had anxiety issues. At first, it was reasonable things (uni exams, bar exam, etc.) but as we kept growing closer, she showed anxiety opening up to someone new romantically. She started seeing a clinically psychologist back in August, which helped her overcome issues and allowed us to finally start dating properly on October of this year.This sounds all fine and dandy but it's starting to dawn on me that she still has a long way to go. She can't handle her anxiety at what she perceives the slightest threat or danger. She can't relax when we walk on street at night. We have to take a detour if she sees a homeless person walking towards us on the sidewalk, doesn't matter if they look sketchy or not. When we're talking on the car at night: she *freaks* out if a car passes us by. Crowded places? Forget about it. The slightest cough? Full hypochondriac mode. The other day an ant bit her. She started hyperventilating and had me rush her to the nearest medical clinic. The medics explained that allergic reactions were immediate and clearly it wasn't a poisonous insect. She insisted they give her *something*. Last night though, we reached a new level of absurdity.

We were having non-penetrative sex. She got a copper-silver IUD two weeks ago and is still dealing with some bleeding. It's all good. We were laying naked, me on my side, her laying down with her legs over mine. I was stimulating her with my fingers, she was very close to orgasm thus very lubricated. My penis started rubbing her underneath her thigh/buttocks, and I was of course leaking precum. At this point, she *completely lost it.* She started freaking out that my penis ""might have made contact with her vagina and ejaculated"". She was too lost in the moment to know ""what liquid belonged to who"". I tried to calmly explain the situation but she wasn't having it. She started going off how she couldn't have my penis anywhere near her vagina without a condom, *while having a copper-silver IUD.* It absolutely *ruined* the night, but what frustrated me the most was that no amount of reasoning would calm her. I may be reaching a boiling point because I choked up seeing her like that.

It's the day after and she's been sending me all this information about IUD effectiveness, precum sperm levels, etc. She won't relax until she gets period. It's all too much. I feel powerless because no matter the situation, there's nothing I can say or do to break through her anxiety. It pains me a lot because other than this, we've building a very healthy relationship. She's the sweetest, most wonderful girl I've met so far and it's my wish to stand by her and help work out her issues.",My girlfriend is completely dominated by anxiety and it's starting to bear on me,18kr9zp,1702847184.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kr9zp/my_girlfriend_is_completely_dominated_by_anxiety/,
"Everyone seems so passionate about a lot of things. Hobbies, their jobs, projects, politics, the environment, a million different causes. But i'm just tired. There's nothing I'm passionate about anymore. I used to love reading, I used to love writing, I used to love gardening and swimming and ice skating and exploring out in nature and playing video games. Now a lot of those things I don't do anymore because I'm too tired, and others I only do because they're familiar, or because I feel like I *should* do them. 

I start a new book and put it down, or I read it and feel meh about it. I play a video game and get bored or get extremely invested in it for a couple weeks until the excitement fizzles out. Going outside feels pointless because it's cold and gloomy outside and there's nothing to do that doesn't cost money. Sports are too much effort. Writing I dread, and I'd always much rather ""have written"" than ""be writing""

And yes, before anyone says it, that's depression. I'm aware. I've been diagnosed. Therapy and medication are the obvious answer, but first of all who's gonna pay for that? Second of all it feels like a band aid instead of a solution. Therapy won't fix the state of the world, and I can't imagine a bearable life in the world we have right now that doesn't involve owning millions of dollars/euros/pounds to guarantee financial independence and thus standing above the metaphorical meat grinder.

"I am an adult, but I still have to live with my toxic mother because my job doesn't allow me to move out; I simply don't earn enough to do that. We have better and worse days, but she absolutely ruined my last birthday with her anger outbursts and she refuses to even acknowledge she did anything wrong. If anything, she was upset at me when I called her out on her behavior, saying that, since I got an expensive gift from her (which is true), I shouldn't be saying that she ruined my birthday. Expensive gift aside, I don't think any sort of gifts give her permission to yell at me and call me hurtful things during her meltdowns; besides that, I'm really hurt that she tried to turn tables on me and make herself look like the victim of the situation, when it was me who spent most of my previous birthday crying because she treated me like crap.

This year I lied to her, saying I will no longer be celebrating birthdays because I'm 'too old for birthdays'. Instead, I organized a big party with all my closest friends (a couple days before my actual birthday) and we all had a great time. I simply told my mother I'm going out with friends. I knew she would be asking questions as to why am I only celebrating with friends and not with her and, not wanting another birthday to end with arguing and crying, I decided lying was the best course of action.

I know I will never be able to tell her what really happened, but I needed to get it off my chest. I have the greatest friends, I received amazing gifts and that party made me happier than any birthday ever had.

"English is not my first language.

I am going to keep this as simply as I can, this incident happened just few a month ago, so I guess it's still fresh in a way and I was able to help my friend with dad's advice hence why he will be mentioned.

My friend Leila (not real name) had a boyfriend Alex they've been in a relationship for like 3 years or so, I am new to the group of friends hence why I don't know much about their relationship, Leila and I share the same classes in college and she got me into the friend group. The group is made from 4 girls and 3 guys, beside Leila I also share classes with 2 of the guys (this is important), the two guys are dating 2 of the four girls. So with me we make 5 girls in that group.

Now the problem starts this one girl in the group Isa, I noticed that Isa and Alex were weird around each other, I don't know how to describe it but basically it's like how two people have a secret and nobody knows about it but you can just tell that there is something between them and it makes you uncomfortable for some reason. I asked Leila about it and she said that it's fine they were always like this cause they are childhood friends.

I decided to drop it because I was new to this friend group and I didn't want to mess up anything between Leila and me, but I couldn't keep it to rest, a month later I saw Isa and Alex together in a restaurant, I was with my dad at the time and he asked me what was going on cause I made a face when I saw them together and I told him my concern, he turned around to look (which was super embarrassing btw), I took a picture just in case I was right to tell Leila later on.

My dad was the one who suggested for me to keep quiet for a bit and get more solid evidence in case Leila brushes off the whole restaurant thing (my mom cheated on my dad but he didn't have evidence about it during the divorce but thankfully he had enough evidence to show the court that he was the one who takes care of me and not my mom so I could live with him that's why he told me to get better evidence).

My dad was right about one thing and it was the fact that once a cheater gets enough confidence their guard goes down and slowly they don't try to hide much anymore, I found them again but this time kissing in the girl's bathroom, it was at a party and I don't drink because of health reasons, both of them were in too deep and drunk so they didn’t notice me, I also walked out of there to make sure they don't catch me and took a picture cause this was the solid evidence I needed and the next day once Leila was sober enough I showed her the pictures.

At first to make it easy on her I started with the restaurant thing then the picture at the party and she started crying, I did my best to comfort her and told her I would have said something about the restaurant thing but I needed more evidence incase she brushes that off and says that it's nothing but a moment between friends.

Now about the lied part and I am not proud of this one, and I am so sorry about it but from one side it did end good.

I messaged the other two girls lets call them Amy and Emily who are dating the two guys I share classes with, telling them that Isa tried to seduce their men by touching them during the party, they rejected her and took it as if she was joking with them before they picked them to go to their home because they were drunk but she was able to get Alex. Which was half the truth Isa did indeed exchange some talk with the two guys but it wasn't flirting and they did indeed take Amy and Emily back to their home.

And I swear to this day I am suprised it even worked, the girls spoke with their boyfriends who swore up and down they had no idea that Isa was even trying to get them to sleep with her, none of them broke up if anything it just made them all confused. They then called Leila to confirm if Alex was indeed cheating on her and she started to cry all over again.

The next day they publicly shamed Isa and everyone at the college got wind of what she did, Isa swore she didn't approach their boyfriends, Amy called BS and showered her a picture of her and Alex kissing and Emily started to shout at her on how could she do that to Leila who was there for her when Isa had a very bad family incident that I will not put here.

A week later Isa got out of the college, Alex stayed trying to get back with Leila who refused to talk to him, the guys desided to completely stay out of the conflict, I don't know if they do keep contact with Alex but I don't think they do.

This is all, we are all in our 22/23. Leila and Alex are one year appart. Leila and I are 22 if anyone is curious.

I just wanted to get this off my chest and I didn't want to tell my dad that I lied even if it did end good, Amy and Emily are still with their BFs they kind of decided to turn this into a bit of a joke by reporting to the girls whenever another girl talk to them, it was funny at first but now its a bit annoying in a good way.","I got revenge for my friend but I also lied, it did end well but I don't know if it was good.",18kqq8c,1702845746.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kqq8c/i_got_revenge_for_my_friend_but_i_also_lied_it/,

So here is the story : my wife has been wanting a dog for years. My daughter too. I've always been the one who was unsure and wanted to wait to be fully ready, because I know it's a lot of responsibilities and takes a lot of time every day. After a few years, I felt ready to give him a big chunk of my free time.
Anyway, we started looking for a dog in shelters, read a lot about it and also took advice from our local doc educator and finally decided against it because we didn't want to get a dog with an unknown background or traumas. 
I finally found a breeder and we ended up buying our dog as a puppy. 
We wanted a large dog and I chose a shepherd dog thinking it was the best choice for a large dog as I imagined it would be nice with other animals if they ever have to be in contact (neighbor has sheep, others have cows, I let you picture the kind of place). Also I've had only good experiences with this particular breed of dogs. 
Since the day we got the dog, I put big effort into his education, train and walk him every day, go to a dog training ""class"" every week, go on a run every day with him, etc. He kind of became my best friend. Our daughter loves him, plays with a lot, cuddles him... On the other hand I feel I'm the only adult of the house to fully try to fulfill his needs. Also my wife works a lot, so she has less time at home, but I don't feel that on her free time she really takes care of him.

Now here comes the trouble: this dog has always been what looked to me to be playful with the cats (maybe a little bit too much) and they were afraid and always hid when he was around. We were told to not force the cats and that they will eventually come out when they'll be ready.
Three months ago something horrible happened. I let him out in the garden to pee and he came across one of our cats and killed her. I won't go into detail but I'm still super shocked by what happened and what I saw that night, the cat died in my arms. I still cannot forgive myself for this happening, I love my cats, we all do, they always have had a special place in our life. My wife broke down emotionally, our daughter was so sad and tried her best to comfort us. 
Since then, we talked a lot with my wife, got to a psychologist to help us get over this and help take a decision with the dog. It was a super hard moment and we decided to keep him and to ask for help from the educator. Since then, we've been following a special training with the educator, I also train the dog every day with exercises to teach him to control himself. Also we keep the other cat inside because we're too afraid of what could happen, but we've had good hope because we've been told and read from several sources that any dog could be trained. 

Fast forward to yesterday : our dog literally destroyed the fence leading to the hens yard and killed every chicken we had. It was horrible, we tried to save one that was still alive, took her to the vet, but she didn't make it through the night. I know that will sound strange to some, but our hens are pets too and are not destined to be eaten, so that emotionally took a whole other dimension than having random chickens killed. 
Having to dig a new hole to bury our animals really made me super sad, plus I now have accumulated a bunch of horrible images that I wish I would've never seen.
My daughter is heartbroken by what happened (every hen had a name, she loved to go and cuddle them, etc) and my wife turned from sad to super angry.
Super angry against the dog, and also creates a big tension between us.
Today, she took the decision to find a new home for the dog. 
I feel really devastated. I feel I am in a deadlock. I never abandoned an animal in my life, I really built something strong with this dog as I explained earlier. I cannot accept the idea of giving him away. On the other hand, I feel that he has a too high prey drive to even cohabitate with any other animal and I know that if he stays with us, someday another accident might happen and our cat might get killed, so I understand her decision but still can't get over it. our daughter is super sad too and we talked to her explaining that it was the best decision we could take for everybody. Deep inside me, I know it is.
I would like to go back in time and erase all this, all I can do now is cuddle him and cry. I hate this situation and see no easy way out.

When he used to throw a tantrum essentially and give me the silent treatment when I told him no so I’d just give in to get him to acknowledge my presence. That when I told him to stop “messing around” when he used to “play fight” me and constantly hit my ear every time to the point that now 3 years later it still randomly pops and rings because of him. That when he broke that mirror because he got angry and punched it, it wasn’t my fault that I can’t control his emotions. That no matter however many arguments, it was always my fault and I had to make it up to him. Then he’d do all this then switch it up as soon as I mentioned having enough so everything was all cupcakes and rainbows and he’s use his “mental health” to get me to stay, saying that he’d do horrible things to himself if I left. He used to try his hardest to separate me from my friends and would purposely get so angry and upset if I did anything “wrong” then gaslight me to believe everything he did afterwards was my fault. He also stalked me when we did finally break up and sat outside my house with his friends and pretended to be on a phone call to take photos of me while I was working with children. He then got all of his friends to harass me and my best friend over text, calls, or any form of social media, even after blocking the contact, he’s still find ways to contact me. While we where together, he also made any of my achievements about him, I finally got my GCSE results and he just so happened to be having a mental health crisis on that day and was saying he was going to off himself if I didn’t help him that instant.

"My partner and I (35F) were at the Ghirardelli store purchasing chocolates for holiday gifts. The main store in our city is located downtown where there is an extremely large homeless population. In the last year or so, I’ve avoided going downtown because I have had a few frightening experiences and unless I’m accompanied, I prefer not to go because the unpredictable circumstances make my anxiety worse. 

I decided to pick up some solo chocolates in my favorite flavors and was walking around the display when I got distracted by my phone and stopped suddenly. When I refocused onto the chocolate I noticed a hand trying to politely slip around me to grab two milk chocolate squares. I immediately turned and apologized and encountered a homeless man that apologized to me for reaching around me. 

As we were checking out, we ended up a few places in line behind that same man and when it was his turn, he went up and paid for his chocolates with a few crumpled bills and the humanity of the moment struck me. The thing is, being able to buy Ghirardelli chocolates for yourself and your loved ones without much thought is a luxury, one that we were fortunate to be able to afford. But seeing that man allow himself that small luxury made me feel so humbled by how much we took our circumstances for granted.

I asked my partner to wait and ran off and grabbed a big package of the milk chocolate squares and added it to our purchases and kept an eye on the man I had encountered. By the time we checked out he was trying to secure a seat at one of the high top counters. 

I ran over with the package of milk chocolate squares, tapped him on the shoulder, and handed him the bag saying “I noticed you liked the milk chocolate squares and I wanted you to have this.” He looked so startled and thanked me so profusely that I felt ashamed and simply said “I love the milk chocolate ones too, I hope these brighten your day a little” and left before the situation wore on. 

That encounter was a bright spot in my week. Because of how stressful our jobs are, I find myself losing sight of our abundance. Being able to add a bit of light and consciously see how that man brightened up by simply being SEEN has really provided a humbling context for me going into the holidays and it’s a feeling I really want to hold onto and can hopefully have the opportunity to provide other people that I encounter.",I was humbled by just treating someone like a human being,18kq9oy,1702844533.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kq9oy/i_was_humbled_by_just_treating_someone_like_a/,

"When I was a kid I always had many friends, I was kind of a nerd back then, I was skinny, was terrible at sports and liked geeky things like pokemon but it didn't matter because even the ""non-nerds"" kids liked me and I was friends with them, throughout the years I met even more people and got even more friends, I was really fortunate because I never left my cluster of schools so I always had this circle of more or less 20 friends, this friendship expansion continued till high school, I ended up in a class with only previous ""non-nerds"" kids who are now popular and a bunch of new faces, I was completely ok with that because I liked meeting new people, however these ""non-nerds"" kids who some of them I considered of my closest friends started making me the punch-bag friend, in other words mocking me 24/7 and always being the punch of a joke, at first I just thought it was a popular type of joke and they were trying to make me popular so stupidly I even encouraged this type of behaviour and made many deprecating jokes which only increased the mocking, at some certain point I realised it was no friendly jokes and, admitting this with shame, they bullied me, not in a physical type of way but in this too much offensive jokes and pranks which went too far way, I never confronted them with it because I thought if I let them go they would eventually stop and only if I reacted they were gonna continue, I was wrong, it got worse everyday, I felt humiliated, I was the laughing stock in my class, I felt so ashame that I let this supposed friends do this to me, my other friends who werent in my class during this year we were losing contact, we still met and talked in the halls but rarely hung out outside of school mainly because I was depressed and didn't wanna leave the house, plus I was kinda ashamed of myself because I was being bullied and felt weak, the year ended and I held back a year to ""improve my grades"" which was a facade I just wanted to leave that class without seeming to obvious, during the summer I was in my family´s summer house for most of the summer so barely saw any friends during this summer, then the new year started, I just wanted a fresh start, however, I know it is weak-minded and pathetic, I couldn't start a conversation on my own with anyone, I was too scared, and I wasn't approached many times by my new classmates, I don't know if it was because I was older, because of my not so good looks or any other reason but what matters is during the first half of the year I was kind of a loner, I wasn't too much friends with my classmates and avoid the guys who bullied me at all costs and the other previous friends were all changing, they were starting to smoke and drink and have different interests, I didn't have any more in common with any of them, I was lonely, but luckily in the second half of the year I don't recall how but I started to get along with my classmates but only in a superficial manner, what I mean is we were only school friends, didn't talk outside of it, which is at least a improve from last year, the year ended and didn't talk to basically any of my previous friends during the summer, however during the summer it clicked me, the  desire to do teenager things, drink, smoke, make out with girls and stuff, kinda late but better late than never i guess, however how will I do this activities? I barely have friends, so at the start of the current year I tried hard to make plans nearly every weekend so go drinking and go to cinema and go have dinner and those stuff, sometimes these plans happened sometimes it didn't but when it did I could feel that I was a ""secondary"" friend, I was never as included as any of the other new friends, plus I believe they made plans without me based from all the inside jokes and stories they had together I never knew about, the year goes and goes like that however, some days ago I am invited by a previous ""non-nerd"" friends to his birthday party, he was one of my best friends till high school so even if I shouldn't go I went to his birthday, I was expecting to be mocked the full night but what happened was totally different, they greeted me and after some minutes it was like I was a ghost, they completely ignored me, I felt happiness and confusion, these guys I gained a ""trauma"" just completely got over me and I am still thinking about those shameful memories get to me, it was a shock, however in this mix of emotions I wanted to know how much they changed I tried to talk to them on multiple moments however they or gave me a one word answer or just ignored me, after a hour trying to socialize I was confused as to why nobody was engaging in my attempts to have a conversation, then another hour passed and I kinda stopped trying to comunicate with them as they just ignored me, and then hour after hour passed with me just a ghost in that party just looking at my phone while listenning to their conversations without being able to engage in them, then after the party was gone and I left during the walk home I was completely stun by the party, I had and still have ""scares"" about that year where I was ridiculed by them and this past 2 years have been really ""damaged"" because of the fears and insecurities they put on me and they just move on and grew up, me on the other hand kept so stuck on those moments and wasted my teenage years, I still feel like a kid entering the teenage years but in 2 months Ill be 18, a loser 18 year old with only superficial friends who don't even like him, I know theres people who suffer way more than me in the world and I seem pathetic complaining about not having friends but I just can't shake these feelings, I don't know what Ill do next, I feel like I can't attain happiness now and is undeserving of lov for pushing people away, I wanna kill myself.",Im 17 and have no friends,18kpzom,1702843831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18kpzom/im_17_and_have_no_friends/,
"So my birthday is January 1st, and the more I grow up, the more I hate it. I will turn 25, and I know for sure, like all the previous years, I will be alone despite having ""friends"". Bc for everyone around me, going to a New Year's Eve party and shouting ""Happy Birthday"" at midnight, equals to celebrate my birthday. But no, not for me. I don't like big parties, I don't like loud music, I don't like when there is a lot of strangers people, I'm just not comfortable in those gatherings. But my friends don't understand that, and so for a long time, I forced myselft to go. I know most of them from the uni (6/7 years now) and I thought that if I said that I don't like parties, they will think that I'm uncool. So ofc, today, when I say that I don't like those parties, they say that I'm a ""killjoy"". But it's not the ""worst"", so here's my birthday background, it's pretty funny you'll see lol :

\- NYE 2018 : nothing. I was ""yeah we don't know each other since long time, it's normal"". But they thrown a party for all the other members of the group in the next months haha

\- NYE 2019 : they organized a big party with a lot of strangers. Maybe that's why, after midnight, we were hiding, just us, in the bathroom while they're giving me my birthday presents. The funny part is that my sister wanted to help them for the gifts, but at the end she did all by herself, so my friends discovered the gifts at the same time as me

\- NYE 2020 : I wanted to organize something for my birthday, since no one did for me. I was ""Okay stop waiting after the others, if you want something do it"". So, one MONTH before, I started to talk about it to my friends. Everyone said ""no problem I'll be there"". I reminded them regularly, and I told them that if they wanted to go to a big party, it's okay but I won't go with them, because I don't like that ; I could understand that some people prefer big parties to intimate one. I was reeeeally exicted. But 2 days before, I had to cancel, despite having everything ready. Why ? Because one of my friends wanted to go to a big party and she motivated some others to go with her. ""You'll come with us, you won't be alone for your bithday"". Guess what ? I was. Crying my eyes out bc I expected that day so much. 20/25 days later, we went to a restaurant and they offered me a plaid and some random comics as a gift

\- NYE 2021 : they celebrated my birthday 20 days after the 1st. Well to be precise, my ex organized the party bc he was part of the group, but ""after the exams bc I don't have time for that"". I told him about how it hurt me to feel that no one cares, so at least he tried to make the things better. They offered me some random displates, I think they didn't have inspiration again

\- NYE 2022 : the first and only one party I had just for me and the January 1st, it was cool ! It was my first year on the other side of the country, and I was afraid they were more distant than before but no, and I appreciated it

\- NYE 2023 : last year. The first plan was to be just us, intimate, and playing some video games. But the same friend that 2020 was invited again to a party. So, at midnight, they sang ""happy birthday"", they gave me some money bc ""we didn't have ideas for you, go buy what you want"" and we went to the other big party. I hated it

\- NYE 2024 : I'm more distant than ever with my friends since I'm far away of them. I'm saying to people that I won't go to a NYE party, but that maybe I'll try to do something the 1st since it's my actual birthday. But I'm afraid to be disappointed again. A closed friend from highschool told me that she won't be there, bc she has other cool plans, despite I traveled for her birthday 6 months ago to surprise her (and I'll do it again bc she was so happy bc she hates her birthday). So, it hurts

I know that I can say to my friends that it hurts me, that I have the feeling that I'm not important bc they're organizing surprised parties for everyone else, except for me, and they're offering me some general gifts bc they don't have a fking idea of what I like. But I won't. Bc I don't want them to have pity for me and...I'm still hoping it will come from them without asking for that (it's silly I know)

Sorry, it was pretty long and I'm just venting about silly things. Maybe I'm not grateful enough for what I have, idk tbh. And also, sorry for my English mistakes, it's is not my native language. But thank you if you read that, I think I just wanted to talk about that to someone...

The last 12 months or so I’ve seen a new side to her; one where she’s (in her own words) “moody”. All of our fights and arguments have stemmed from her behavior. Ironically I’m never the one to start the conflict. Every possible disagreement starts with her giving me the silent treatment for a day or two followed by a meltdown. 

I’m worried if it’s a compatibility issue. I’m naturally outgoing while she is more reserved. Even around my family whom she’s known for years I’ve been told by them she acts “standoffish”. 

Every couple months. (January, February, March, June, October, December) we’ve had a fight.

"I'm going to keep this short and not get into irrelevant family drama. When I was 12 I spent a summer with my uncle so my parents could focus on my grandmother after my grandfather passed away. This was in 2005.

My uncle was nice to me and never did anything inappropriate. But I discovered that he had loli porn on his computer and stupid 12 year old me thought it would be a good idea to lie to my family and say he molested me. I wasn't trying to protect anyone, I thought it would be fun to stir up drama and chaos. I was old enough to know this was wrong but I did it anyway. I don't know if other members of the family knew he was into lolis or if he was ever weird around other kids but they believed me with little questioning.

My uncle was beaten up pretty bad by several other adults in the family and ended up going no contact with all of us. No charges were ever pressed on either side and my parents wanted to move on so within a few weeks of this all happening all mention of it ceased and no one ever asked me about it again. I never brought it up either. Life continued forward.

This year I turned 30. I've done a lot of soul-searching in general and I've righted many wrongs from when I was younger. My uncle was the last one on the list. When I was a kid I thought lolicons were child molesters. As an adult I realize life is more complicated than that, good and bad people exist in every group and I can't judge my uncle just off his fantasies. Without some proof he abuses children, something he's never been accused of besides my incident, I can't assume he's a bad person.

I reached out to him this summer on the anniversary of the day my family cut contact with him. He was surprisingly open to conversation and wanted to meet up. We did, and he forgives me for what I did. My family still doesn't know I lied and he doesn't want me to tell them the truth. He is happy just having a relationship with me again and knowing there is one person in the family who accepts him without judgement.

I really don't know what to say to that. What I did was so shitty and shouldn't be forgiven. I am willing to come clean to my family but he doesn't want me to. He's satisfied with how things are now and just wants to maintain a relationship with me.

"Part 1 is posted before this. Feel free to look at my profile for it, they are right next to each other. So to pick up where I left off...

So my wife needed to find her own relief, and it was through the friendship of a few people in our lives.  It got to the point that she was leaving almost everyday to go see them while I stayed home. I saw them occasionally, but not often. It was once a week for a bit, but then deteriorated into seeing them once or twice a month. I hardly even talked to anyone through text. Partially my fault for not reaching out as much as I could, I was just destroyed and felt comatose, so I didn't. 

A couple years of this continued, but part of the way through it, my wife convinced me to finally see a therapist. I was terrified of therapy affecting my court case (complete delusion, but the fear was there).  So I started seeing a therapist, but the damage in me had been done. Therapy definitely helped, but by this point in time I felt empty and without an identity or personality. Constantly afraid that everyone will leave me. Because that's what people do.  The only thing that kept me going was my kids and i made sure they had a good life with me and knew how much I cared for them. If I did anything, it was usually with then and that also made me feel more like a person.  It doesn't matter how bad I feel, my kids deserve to see happiness, love, and joy. So I gave that to them anytime I could. No excuse not to. Because if I wasnt a good caring dad, then who the fuck am i?

Well now I've been working my ass off to help my mental state. I have medication to help my depression and adhd. Which in turn helped my anxiety a bit too. I have better tools and a better grasp on things and the work I've put into myself has shown results.  The only issue is I still don't feel like I have an identity or personality. I have to fight with my inner voice everyday to know that I have friends and that they do in fact like me. But it's a struggle still. I see them a little more often, Maybe once a week or once every 2 weeks on average. But I find out that I have no idea how I was seen. Like I don't feel like I speak much or have much to add, even though I did actively try. I don't feel fully in the loop on things they talk about or the activities they do. I don't feel much like a person or friend still and I know that has to be a lie my own mind is tricking me with. Knowing it's not true doesn't make it feel less shitty. But I'm being serious when I said I'm getting better at this slowly.

But now that I have the tools to help myself better, how do I get my personality back, or feel like I'm apart of things. I don't want to feel empty and alone, as I know that I am not.  I just don't know how to hang out with people anymore or how to be a person around people. I just want to be me again, and I want my wife and friends to have me back...or see that i never left. It's weird. I'm lucky I have the friends and wife in  life who love me enough to stick through things like they did with me. The hardest times of my life and they are still here.

"This story is longer than I anticipated, so for those who stick through it, thank you and enjoy the mess of my life and mind. I will post this as part 1 and post part 2 right after. Using an alt account, because this stuff is personal and I don't want to post this sorta thing on my main. I'd feel self conscious and embarrassed.

A few years back I was an absolute mess mentally.  I was in the midst of going through court with my abusive ex wife to make sure my kids get to to have life with me.  She would lie about me constantly to her lawyer, which in turn would put me in the position of constantly finding proof that she was lying. I was constantly on edge about if I made any mistake or did anything wrong at all then it would affect me in court, and my there is nothing more important to me in this world than my kids.  I spent 13 years in total in court to eventually end up with full custody of my oldest daughter, and 50/50 joint of my youngest (different moms, seperate cour cases). My youngest was the one I was fighting for in court a few years back  that I'm talking about for this. So from the age of 19 to the age of 32 I was in court fighting for a better life for my kids. My entire 20s was spent worrying about this.

I became horribly depressed and developed a pretty bad anxiety disorder, but that never stopped me from fighting for my kids. I have been married to my lovely current wife now for 5 years and been together 8. I have no kids with her and have a vasectomy to assure that stays that way. During all of this my depression and anxiety started to affect our relationship, as it would anyones, and she started to get out and see our friends more.  During this time I worked full time, was a parent full time, and would rarely leave to go do much with any of my friends.  I just watched as everyone else grew with each other and I felt like I was falling away from them. That may have been my depression making me feel that, but it's how it felt to me.  I began to feel like I was totally alone.

In this period of time my depression and anxiety only got worse. I didn't know I had OCD at the time, but I did and those intrusive thoughts really fucked me up.  While this was happening I could feel my personality slowly draining away.  I still got to occasionally see some friends, but everytime I did I felt more disconnected by a small amount. Eventually I didn't feel like I had a personality anymore and didn't feel like I knew how to hang out with people and talk. This feeling grew stronger everyday as I watched all my friends and wife have time to spend with each other.  My wife was badly depressed as well and had some other issues, so her getting to spend time with friends really helped her and I wanted to make sure she kept getting to feel better by seeing them more.

I tried talking about it a bit, but I am not great at explaining myself, especially when I didnt feel like a person, or someone that was even fun to be around. Who was I to rain on anyones parade with my black clouds hanging over me. Well...that's how I thought at least. I'm well aware that most of these thoughts were likely delusions from my incredibly low self confidence and fear that if I said anything to anyone about how I feel, that they would all leave me. Horrible horrible fear of abandonment in me, likely stemming from my last marriage where many bad things happened that caused me to feel this way. (Some examples are waking up to her being gone *several times throughout the relationship* without an explanation or warning and not knowing if she was coming back, constant belittling and demeaning me, gaslighting constantly, trying to force me to have a baby when I expressed I did not want to have another child...but still finding all my condoms has holes poked in them or her actively trying to force me to finish in her by wrapping around me and not letting me get off of her, or when she finally got pregnant through this awful method forcing me to and decided she didnt want to be with me anymore, but told my entire family that she was pregnant before deciding to get an abortion, tell them all she had a miscarriagell, and then leaving me for her new boyfriend that she had before we even went to court for our divorce.) Yea real fun stuff, and yea, I know I'm a fucking idiot for staying through all this shit, but by then I had become a completely empty vessel of a person...yea real sad shit, but my fault ultimately for staying.

"I have struggled my entire life with my (under)weight. I've only been at a healthy bmi (19) for 2 years and I even struggle to maintain that when i get sick. ""just eat more, lol"" Do you really think i'm not trying. I am tracking my macros, used wheight gainer shakes, used protein shakes, tried more carb heavy diets, adding olive oil to what i eat.
 Yeah there are days i can eat 3300 kcal. But on days i don't go to the gym I just forget to eat sometimes.

 I can have my meal prep of 800-1100kcal prepared but that's kind of useless when you can't eat it in one sitting and i am sick and tired of eating cold meals. And if one more person says to me just eat mc Donald's every day. I'm going to punch you in the throat. I want to gain weight in a healthy way. I want to gain via high protein meals with tasty veg. 


And yes i consume caffeine on a daily basis. I know it hurts my appetite. But i have tried to cut out caffeine numerous times and the result is only that i get way less shit done and i feel like shit. (I know i'm addicted) But even then I've been under weight for most my life and i haven't been consuming caffeine most my life.

 
I know it's weird to forget to eat. I don't know either why i forget. Today I ate a breakfast of 700 kcal and then started to work and i blinked and it was 4 o'clock. only then i realized i had to eat something. I don't know why my body is okay with waiting 8+ hours between meals. I'm tired of it.

"I know hate is a strong word but honestly I don't know what other word to use. Mostly because I feel bitter more than anything.
I'm 24F. I come from a family of immigrants, El Salvador to be exact. I never had my dad in my life, I've met him a handful of times but it was clear he only wanted to use me as an opportunity to one day be a US resident. I grew up with a mom that didn't censor herself for anything, not even the reality of my conception. I now understand the trauma and struggles my mom had to go through as a kid and coming here so young, but I know a lot of other parents that went through the same and didn't subject their kids to the life of misery she put us through. I don't know if my siblings remember because they would always be sleeping when stuff went down but I remember everything. 
All the times I had to stand up to my stepdad so he wouldn't hit my mom, all the times she humiliated me confronting him in front of me to ask if it was true that he sexually abused me(of course he never told the truth), the time I ran out the window to go to the neighbors house because he was hitting her and i was genuinely scared for the first time and then when they came to take him she started crying and screaming how was he gonna feed his daughters now in Guatemala. I could go on and on but that's not the point of this post. 
I got pregnant at 14 and my mom still blames me for everything that happened while I was underage. I'm no contact with her now, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Mom's are meant to protect and love you and mines failed miserably at it. 
My grandma tried to raise me as best as she could but she had 2 jobs, and as a sneaky teenager I knew my way around her &amp; it wasn't her fault cause she thought she was doing the right thing not knowing it was gonna hurt me down the road. 
I had my second kid by 15 and now I'm 24 with 4 kids. None of that was my mom or my grandmas fault I know that, but I do know that ""normal"" families don't have teenagers having babies. 
As I said I cut my mom off 2 years ago, I let her in for a couple of months only to realize it was a big mistake so I went no contact again.

I have a cousin I was super close to, almost like a brother. When my stepdad would assault me, I would call him at 2/3am to tell him what happened. When I got pregnant the first time he was there for me so much people thought he was the dad of my baby. I was one of the first few people who he came out to and accepted him. He cut the umbilical cords of both my first &amp; second child, but I guess even all that wasn't as meaningful to him as It was to me.
A year ago I caught his boyfriend sexually messaging with who was my husband at the time and that he even gave my husband oral. My then husband was going through a rough patch abusing drugs (meth), which I know doesn't excuse him either but my therapist is helping me to accept that my cousins boyfriend took advantage of my husband in a way. He was giving him money for drugs, gas, free food all in exchange for my husband to go sneak out while I was asleep so they could have their alone time. To this day I dont know all the details and honestly I don't wanna know anymore. 
When I found everything out I confronted my cousin and his boyfriend but he just denied denied denied even after all the proof I showed my cousins and the audio recording of my husband explaining everything he chose to believe his boyfriend so I had to cut them out of my life and that was the most painful thing Ive had to do. 
My brother, 19 at the time , and I haven't talked in 3 years all because I got tired of cleaning up after him and chose to abandon him instead of communicating. All for a man that ended up beating me just like the father of my kids did if not worse. 
I woke up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and the first thing I saw on Facebook was a picture of almost all my family together at my cousins college graduation, one of them has my cousin and his partner in it. My heart broke and I won't lie I had an anxiety attack. It's not fair. Life is not fair. It's like I'm paying for everyones wrong doings not just my own and I'm being left out. 
My kids won't grow up with a ""mom's side of the family"" cause I have no one. Everytime I'm slapped with the reality of the situation it hurts so much and I don't know how to let go of this hurt &amp; bitterness because I feel like I hate them. NONE OF THEM have ever showed up for me for ANYTHING not even when I got my GED.
I know I'm not a good person myself either  but I'm not a bad person either I'm trying to fix myself but seeing shit like this makes me want to go yell at everyone.

"Hey guys,

Recently I’ve slept with my friends ex and I want to know your opinion on this… Here is a background:

My friend’s ex has been hitting on me after a while when He broke up with her. I ignored it at first and told to my friend, when we were drunk (not blackout drunk) that she is hitting on me and asked him if He would mind if I’ve slept with her, cuz I find her quite hot. To which he responded that he doesn’t mind and he was with her only for a sex as they didn’t have much in a common.

Few months have passed after this conversation and I invited her home and we slept together. The sex was kinda weird because it felt sinful to do this even though my friend gave me consent. I wrote to her the next day about feelings that were evoked inside of me and she was more than understanding. She also said that it’s upon me if I want to meet up the next time or not.

I don’t think I’ll want to hook up again with her as it doesn’t seem right to me and there weren’t any feelings from my side - I just wrote her to find out if she’d come or not and was just playing at first…

My question is should I tell that friend that I did it or just not talk about it unless he asks directly? We talked about her 2 times after they broke up in 4 months (only when I asked) so I don’t think another conversation will ever occur about her.

There is also a 3rd party involved, which is our friend group (my man friends and their gfs) and we talk about this kind of stuff openly in a group so I think if I would tell this to him, all the group would know it and their opinion might be different than my friends and it might do more damage than good…

PS: they haven’t been in a contact after they broke up.

What would you do this in my situation? Thanks for honest answers…",I’ve slept with my closest friend’s ex,18knull,1702838133.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18knull/ive_slept_with_my_closest_friends_ex/,
"When I was 20 I got pregnant with my oldest daughter, a year later with the second. 
I was so much in love with my ex, but he was a terrible partner and not a very good father either.
I always tried to keep the girls quiet, because he’d get irritated if they cried. I told them to shhh and nothing was wrong, don’t cry.

They are in their 20’s now and both of them have problems regulating their emotions.
I know that’s my fault. I tell them if they need to, they can always talk to me and I won’t feel attacked or judged, that I will always think what they’re saying through and be as honest as I can be.
I apologized for how I treated them when they were young. For usually not taking their pain seriously, and only being worried about their father getting angry.

So I know I’m doing right by them now.

"This is a long story so I try to keep it simple.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have a beautiful 3 year old daughter. This year in the summer, she had to be hospitalized for two weeks and as a result we were all tested for full DNA-panels each.
We got the devastating news that both of us had a gene that had activated in her and she has a very rare (1:40 000) disease, which will eventually take her piece by piece. I was and still am devastated, and so was my bf. 
While all this was going on, my boyfriend didnt handle everything well and started to go out alot. Mind you that our daughter got a feeding tube awaiting for a surgery for a PEG-button into her stomach. She has to indefinitely be fed 5x/day and given meds 4x/day, and it all got left on my shoulders, because my bf was panicking. 
He started seeing his co-worker behind my back.
First time, he vanished in the middle of the night and I couldn't get ahold of him for hours. While we were having a sleep study in the hospital, my bf was with this woman at her house and I found it out because he wasnt home when we got there the next morning and he was supposed to be there. He eventually slipped it to me thay he had been sleeping with her and I was devastated. I had just weeks prior learned that my child will die and waste away mind and body before she turns 18. And now this.
My family is broken. We have been trying to fix it, since all that was obviously a huge reaction to shock. But the fact that he kept insisting that the woman and him could stay friends infuriated me. 
The thing to know about us is that I lean on the polyamorous side and told him that if he ever got the urge, he just needs to tell me first and it can all be done in mutual agreement. Well, he didnt do that. 
I also have confronted this woman once face to face. I cried and told her about my daughters diagnosis and to stay back atleast while we get our shit together. She promised, but later it turned out to be a lie. 
I contacted her on social medias to yet again tell her to leave us alone. She always insisted that I was the reason everything was falling apart because ""I was such a horrible person who tries to take our daughter away from my bf"". I was shocked. Never ever have I even thought of that and here I was accused of this. Everything obviously came from my bf. 
She finally peaced out of the picture a few weeks ago after trying to break us up for months with her admitting it, calling my bf spineless and to go back to his ""shitty life"". 
I havent been talking to my loved ones, since I know my life is such a huge mess, that its alot on everyone. I am talking to a psychiatrist and we also have a family psych that all of us visit. 
I know my bf sounds like a mess also, but who wouldnt be in our shoes? We just learned the worst news any parent could hear. I have had therapy in the past so I have some means of coping, but even thats not enough anymore and I am at my breaking point, since my bf has been seesawing for months now on what he wants. 
There is way waaay more to this story, but I can gladly clarify or add if anyone wants to know more.

It’s always small arguments that we have. I really don’t feel like going into the details, I don’t want this post to be super long. Just trust my word on it, it is small stupid arguments that escalates into something further because my husband doesn’t like talking about his feelings when he’s upset so he gives me the silent treatment until he starts to miss me and this can go on for a good week or two.

Today he did what he always does whenever he’s really mad in an argument, he said he’s going to divorce me because I’m unappreciative. I didn’t say thank you to him because I was tired and exhausted and really annoyed. I am sick of his threats of leaving me, I told him he should.

It just sometimes when I show her something I like or wanna get she would occasionally give the most outrageous reaction to those things. 

Like going “ eww that’s so disgusting” or “ this is so ugly” or just plain “ eww”. 

Like I get it sometimes I like weird and none standard things but it still hurts hearing and seeing her react like that. 

Like today I showed her a purse that I been wanting to get for 2 years now. 

It’s a bag that I find very cute but I couldn’t buy either because I didn’t have money or because the store didn’t have the color anymore. 

When I showed her I said “ I been wanting this bag so much” and she immediately went “ eww this is disgusting”. 

I just was so hurt that all I said was “ oh okay”. 

She noticed it and just said “ why don’t you buy it”. 

I responded “I literally don’t have any extra money now since I bought gifts for everyone”. 

She said basically she can buy it for me but I didn’t want it anymore from her reaction. 

This is just something that keeps repeating even after explaining that there are literally in world so many things that are truly disgusting yet she gives this type of reaction to things that I like. 

Literally I once showed her a little duck plushies that I thought was so adorable and kinda looked like me. 

I wanted to buy it and I personally don’t buy plushies but this one I thought was so cute and looked like me. 

Her reaction was again “ ewww this is so disgusting”. 

I got angry for the first time and I just blow up saying that I don’t understand why she has to react like that. 

Like she can just say it’s not cute or it’s not for me or that she doesn’t like it but the fuck she has to make that reaction. 

I even explained that I am okay with her not liking and saying her opinion why it’s not for me but for the love of God don’t react to it like it’s the most disgusting thing. 

This might seem so pointless and just nothing to get upset about but it’s the fact that I saw myself in that plushie and that’s how she reacted to it. 

I just wish that she would not react like that, like she sees how it upsets me and it just seems so mean. 

I have very thick skin and most times I literally don’t care about anything or anything regarding what I like.

As the title suggests, my fiends suck. There are times I don't even think they think of me as their friend.

I get left out of events and then they don't understand when I get upset about it. It's something I've brought up with them numerous times, yet they still do it.
They also have a group chat that doesn't have me in and don't understand why I get upset at the fact they never text me even when I try to text them.

They've also crossed multiple boundaries of mine that I have re told them over and over. 
They also think it's funny to make fun of me despite me expressing my dislike for it. They think it's funny when I get mad or shout at them (I have anger issues and take anger management classes [they don't know I take the classes] and everytime they do it it sets me back steps or to the beginning).

I'm moving away in a few months and they want to stay in contact, even though we never text now so we are barely in contact as it is. I don't want to, but they don't know this but I don't think I'm going to tell them, I want to see what happens.

"I've needed to get this off my chest for a while.

My family and I (16M) moved to a new house and location in 2021. We are in a small courtyard with 6 other houses and coincidentally us and our neighbour (let's call her L) both moved in a few weeks apart. We are in Terrace housing so we grew very close as we were both ""the new kids on the block"" and the other neighbours didn't really talk to us often. In the COVID Lockdown we also got to know each other well. L lives alone with her 2 dogs but knows a few people in the Local area. 

My family and L made a good relationship by chatting over the Fence and in the courtyard every so often and sometimes having some small garden parties if the British weather was nice. Our good relationship grew as we occasionally went out on walks with her dogs (as I don't have pets) and I did dogsitting for her while she went out places (as her dogs are only puppies).

Me and L grew even closer as I often help her with tech and other handyman things around the house. I specifically remember one day when I was helping L with her new printer she bought, I was going through all the settings and helping her understand everything and we were both having a bit of a laugh, she rested her hand on my thigh and caressed it slightly (which I can't lie, made me aroused). After I finished helping her, I did what an average low life 15 yr old would do and went back home, went to my room, locked the door and found the most identical person on pornhub to bust a nut to. I couldn't tell if that made me feel better or more depressed than I was, coming to think about it. 

Fast forward to the present, I did dog sitting for her today as she was heading out to town for a drink with friends. When I went over she greeted me at her front door wearing some casual clothes which showed quite a bit of cleverage, which of course caught my eye. I walked inside and she usually just gives me some lemonade and has a quick chat before her taxi arrives to take her into town but today was different. She stopped and turned around, giving me a tight hug, her large jugs pressed against my chest as she kissed me on the cheek, which made my face turn bright red and gave me an erection. I didn't know what to do so I awkwardly wrapped my arms around her lower torso, just above her behind. Thoughts raced through my head about the possibilities of us hooking up but they immediately departed as she pulled away and slightly grinned at me, leading me into the kitchen where she gave me the usual glass of lemonade and thanked me for agreeing to dogsit. We casually chatted as my face went back to its usual colour and my erection died down. Her taxi arrived a few moments later and took her away as I sat down on her couch with her dogs and stared into space for what seemed like hours. I went on my phone and edited some pictures I'd taken as peace and tranquility of her home surrounded me, the casual crackle of the fire and her dogs play fighting was all I listened to for a few hours before turning on the TV and watching some '1% club'. I did the usual attempt at figuring out the questions, failing dramatically and getting pissed off after finding out the answer just needed common sense. Around an hour later she came back, slightly drunk. I greeted her as her dogs jumped up and down around her playfully. We both love the 1% club so when she realised it was on, L got a glass of wine and sat down next to me, wrapping her arm around my waist and pulling me close (which as you may have guessed, made me extremely aroused). I sat there for a few moments, silent as all I could hear was the TV and L playing along with the game, I thought this was it. 

After the episode ended we talked a bit about life and what I wanted to do when I grew up etc. A few minutes later I thought I better go back to my home as it was about 11pm and I didn't want to stay too late. She casually got up with me and hugged me tight again, same thing happend, her huge jugs pressed against my chest, my face turned red, I got hard, she kissed me, I got even more hard and then I broke away and went out saying bye. I felt alive for one of the first times in my life, that I was actually loved by someone other than my family. I mean L is beautiful, hot, sexy, busty, whatever you want to say, but I didn't want to ruin our great relationship nor take advantage of her seeing as she seemed pretty drunk. 

I'm lying in bed writing this thinking what happened if I did make a move or do something and what would have been the consequences? Would I have lost my v card? Would she have shouted at me and told my parents? Would she have been to drunk to remember the next day? Who knows.

The only issue is, I'm 16 and she's 62.","I love my neighbour, but I don't want to ruin our good relationship",18ox5zw,1703304218.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ox5zw/i_love_my_neighbour_but_i_dont_want_to_ruin_our/,
"I had a dream about my ex, Amy,  earlier in the week.  The dream was essentially me going to a local art event with a friend and her showing up shortly thereafter, also with a friend…but without her girlfriend.  She was in a blue dress that complimented her curves perfectly.  How could I not notice the beautiful blonde with curled hair and bright red-stained lips?  I confidently walked up to her, wrapped my arms around her and kissed her.  She kissed me back like nothing had ever happened.  I grabbed her hand and we tightly intertwined our fingers and went on about our evening.  I sadly then awoke from the dream….

I haven’t been able to shake this all week.  I know I shouldn’t feel this way, we are both in committed relationships, but sometimes we just have those “what if moments.”

We haven’t been together for nearly 15 years.  I haven’t been able to get this dream off my mind. 

 Subconsciously, I feel like I know she will be back in town for the holidays, and at times like these, I seem to constantly have her in my thoughts.  
We were together in our early 20s and I was very, very stupid.  Sometimes I still beat myself up about how I broke her heart.  She was moving to California to follow her dreams and at that time there was no way I would have ever thought about leaving the Midwest.  I was playing on a local women’s tackle football team and it was chock full of other lesbians, bisexual women, and everything in between.  I “ditched” Amy for a teammate like a giant piece of shit.  That situation eventually flopped and wasn’t even fulfilling in any way.  It may seem like a ridiculous burden to carry for so long, but knowing I hurt someone I truly care about so badly hurts.

She married a woman at one point but has since divorced this manipulating person.  To my knowledge, it was a pretty bad split but within the last few years, she has found what appears to be a wonderful partner.  I, myself have been in a 10-year relationship with another woman and the timing was just never “right” to lay everything out there again where we were both single and could discuss the past.  

We text sometimes to wish each other a “Happy (insert holiday)” or trivial small talk, but it’s nothing substantial.  She wanted to meet up a couple of years ago at Christmas because her aunt’s house is near my folk’s house, but I thought if we were going to be with our current partners I felt a little uneasy about it.  But I did want to see her.  

These feelings drive me crazy.  I have been carrying this all week and I can’t tell my partner or friends, so to Reddit it goes.  I would never really post anything like this, so it feels good to get this out there.","Dream about my ex, I just can’t shake it.",18ox2qz,1703303931.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ox2qz/dream_about_my_ex_i_just_cant_shake_it/,
"Life context: I feel like I had a very ‘sexual’ youth. The earliest experience with this that I recall was when I was around 5 and would take baths with my (F) cousin and we would touch each other. I was introduced to porn at a very young age (7), sex and sex related acts were a frequent topic at my elementary school, and I was told I was stupid or treated as an outcast for not understanding sexual references or terminology. Me and my friends started playing a game where we’d sneak away and put each other’s penises in our mouths. This was consensual but started at a very young age. My other (F) cousin and I would start showing us each others privates as a sort of competitive game as who would chicken out first. In middle school I had my first sexual partner. I was frequently bullied and ostracized. When I got to high school it was a completely different time for me, I hit a growth spurt and girls were more interested in me. I talked to any and every girl I possibly could. I ended up talking to 4-5 girls at a time. 

***Serious*** trigger warning ahead**

This leads to the part where I have seriously traumatized myself and potentially my mentally disabled cousin. She is only partially verbal. When I was 14, I was masturbating and my mentally handicapped cousin came in the room. She was 9. Instead of telling her to leave I asked her to touch my penis. She said “ew” and I said it was okay. She touched it and stroked it, I ejaculated. This was the only time any interaction of this nature happened between us. 

When I was in high school (15), there was a period of a few months where I would finger and regularly engage in anal sex with my dog. 

I cannot begin to explain how physically ill this makes me to live with. I have tried to tell myself that this didn’t actually happen. I’ve written these down and burned them to try to move on. I have tried to tell myself I was young and ignorant, and while this is true, I was old enough to know what I was doing was wrong. These thoughts come up at random times and send me spiraling. I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack just typing it out. I have never in my life talked to anyone about this and have told myself I would take this to my grave. I feel like holding on to this information is tearing me apart. It makes me feel like a soulless monster and that I am worthless. I have been going to therapy for the last 4-5 months but I feel like I cannot talk to my therapist about either of these topics out of fear. The hyper-sexualization of my entire reality has made ripples throughout my life. I fear that I have inflicted trauma on my cousin and my abuse will effect her in ways she wont realize and I have no clue how to address this. I hate myself for taking what was wrong with my youth and putting that on her. Knowing that I took advantage of both her and my dog in those moments makes me physically, emotionally, and mentally ill. These are truly my biggest regrets. I have no idea how to handle this self inflicted trauma.",Self Inflicted Trauma and Societal Hyper-sexualization,18ox1sg,1703303830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ox1sg/self_inflicted_trauma_and_societal/,
"Specifically my uncle's church choir. I've always had bad experience in it because I didn't really have a choice. I've been forced to play the piano for church services since elementary and don't get me wrong, there are a tonne of benefits I've gained from doing it, but the one thing that really frustrates me is how my uncle (the maestro) teaches. He's not direct enough with the musicians, no one knows when to come in, and he keeps wanting to modernise the songs. In my opinion, I really love the charm of traditional hymns rather than modern pop worships songs, it's just not fitting. Sure, there are a few new worship songs that sound nice in church, but when my uncle wants to replicate a song he found on youtube as if mass is going to be a concert, I feel embarassed to be the one behind the music. Not ti mention he expects me to know how to work my keyboard inside out. Like no, I can't play the bass, chords, melody, drums, and strings all at the same time. I'm in my first year of college now and till this day I still don't get along well with my uncle during practices. He gets frustrated when we're running late om scheduled times. MAYBEEEE we wouldn't be running so late if you would actually tell the singers when to come in, then we wouldn't have to keep repeating the same verse countless times.

"My ex broke up with me almost a year ago, and I ended up getting severely depressed. I was extremely suicidal at the time, and I had written my letters and had my plans all set up. I'm not sure if it was just my mind trying to find an excuse not to end my life, but something happened that felt like too much of a coincidence, so I decided to keep on going with life.

Several months after that I finally got out of my depression. It felt like this giant haze and weight on my mind and body had disappeared. It was honestly one of the most relieving feelings I have ever felt. However, I now just felt empty. My goals and future has disappeared after the breakup, and I didn't know what to do anymore. So I decided to do things that I enjoy and rediscover myself. After all, there's nothing better than a blank slate when starting new right?

I met new people, discovered new hobbies, and I had a lot of fun. I even went on a date and it was surprisingly nice. But as I kept doing all this, it felt like I was just running away and distracting myself. Like I was doing all this just to get away from these suicidal thoughts. These thoughts have been coming up more often these past couple months, and honestly I'm just getting tired of living. I just don't really want to deal with life anymore. I'm tired of running away.

"So a bit of context; my bipolar mum was an abusive shit who barely let me see my dad and honestly should be in a mental institution. She didnt look after me or my brother properly, was a raging alcoholic, had the police come to the house or hotels or vans we stayed in more times than I can remember. 

Earlier this year I(13F) was in my room listening to music with headphones on, during which my mum was calling for me which I obviously didn’t hear.

So I moved her legs from tucked underneath her and pushed her legs off the bed so that she didn’t have anything supporting her.

i never really had a friend group. im super outgoing so most people at school know me and were kind of in between acquaintances and friends if that makes sense, but i dont get called or texted outside of school. 

the closest thing to friends i have right now are the kids i sit with. i really like them a lot. sometimes they like me but sometimes i talk and they just ignore me, or side eye each other. it’s a gamble every time i talk to them.

i always ask everyone about their day, or just casually conversation with everybody because i know how it feels like to be left out and i want to be known as the girl who never makes anyone feel excluded. i’d listen to everybody’s stories and once it was my turn to share, they just cut me off and start talking to each other.

"First ever Reddit post, so please bear with me. I had a pretty shitty upbringing. I lost my dad 3 days after my first birthday, 3 years later we moved in with my mom and her now fiancé and his son. Growing up they always had a toxic relationship he abused my mother physically, mentally, emotionally, and physically. Step brother got an out because as soon as they’d start fighting, he’d call his mom up and she’d go get him. I was always stuck hearing the arguments and picking up my mother’s broken pieces at the early ages of 4-5. 

A few years later into their relationship, I had to be around 1st or 2nd grade, my “step-dad” had begun to moleste me while I was asleep. After a few of his advances I had finally told my mother. See.. the thing about my mom is that she is always so unpredictable. She’d tell me to always confide in her and be honest with her, but whenever I was she would either lash out at me or blame me for whatever honesty I had given. So when I told her about what had been happening to me, she exploded. Then and there she forced me to confront him and hash out everything that had happened in front of him and my mom. I felt embarrassed, scared, and dirty… Of course he denied everything and chucked it up to “fixing me because I sleep crazy”. My mother then started to question me so I caved and just said that yes… he was just “fixing me”. After all this went down it was never spoken of again. Life had continued on as if nothing ever happened. Their relationship had continued, still as toxic as ever up until I left for college. There were small comments along the years that he would say to me that made me uncomfortable, things like “wow you smell good” or telling me just how beautiful I was, but in a creepy way. You may ask why I never said anything and well… it’s because no one believed me the first time so what’s the use? 

These memories have arose recently. I had blocked it out for so long because I hated to remember what happened to me. I never had told anyone for so long, that is until my now fiancé and I got pregnant with our first son. One of our conversations had led to how we wanted to raise our son, and one thing led to another and it all just spilled out. My fiancé met me with compassion, empathy, and anger for me. He was disgusted with how my mom could choose to stay with someone who abused not only her, but her only child. However, I came to her defense and defended her and her actions. A couple years go by and my mother’s toxic relationship is still going strong, but my “step-dad” is wanting me out of my mom’s life. He started controlling when and how I would speak with my mom, and it angered me even more because she was allowing it. 

Eventually I had told my aunt who I also see as like a second mom. It came out because he was also trying to control when and how my mom would speak with my aunt. She opened my eyes and told me that whatever happened wasn’t okay, and my mom was at fault for some of it too. It was hard to realize, but eventually my senses became clear. Fast forward to this year and from what I thought, I thought my mom was growing a backbone finally. After all these years I thought she had finally grew tired of this toxic relationship and was wanting to leave. I began to help her in anyway I could, whether it was car shopping or apartment hunting. I saw her foot out the door and I was relieved for her, and me. Because all these years I had to go along with their facade of this picture perfect couple and family. One day though she came to me and had mentioned she wanted to work things out with my “step-dad” again. But then she asked me why am I so done with him… and I let it spill all over again. She began to ask me questions and for me to rehash every detail. I did… she then said that well now it’s certain she wouldn’t stay with him… so I thought. Recently we lost my maternal grandmother, and here comes my “step-dad” to swoop in and be my mother’s hero. Now she’s back to the lovey dovey shit and everything is “perfect” once again. 

I am so angry, I feel like I’m crazy, and I’m growing so much resentment for my mother. I used to think the world of her, that she was the strongest person ever. But in reality she’s the weakest person I’ve ever met. With the recent loss of my grandmother I’m trying to be considerate of the time of grief my mom is in, but I just can’t help but want to lash out at her and blame her for all the trauma in my life… I would love to hear some outsiders opinions. I feel lost right now and in such a dark headspace.

"Today in class I had to give a presentation on a Silvia Plath poem which would’ve been perfectly fine had it been anyone but Plath. 
Plath writes near exclusively about suicide and self harm
All poems available to present on were about suicide and self harm which is personally extremely triggering
I spent a year outpatient, four months inpatient and overall have been in a lot of treatment for my mental health so presenting a poem about those same experiences I had had been beyond painful to even think about. Specifically one time I attempted to overdose and wound up in the hospital for four or so days before I wound up inpatient. Mostly I find myself moved on sure every day is a battle but I no longer take a handful of pills every two weeks with the thought process of “well either I die Or get a good sleep”
And I oh so foolishly assumed I could actually present a poem and slideshow I had spend hours making 
I walked to the front of the class already shaking 
And I held the shitty little Chromebook and I started by reading the poem. 
I typically read poems very expressively so had begun reading that way, and about halfway through reading tulips I was sobbing. My eyes were red and my tears itched at my skin, burning softly. 
I attempted to present but couldn’t, after blabbing on about the meaning behind the white nurses caps I stormed out
I took some time alone and felt a bit better a few hours later, it took an embarrassingly long time to calm but nowhere near as embarrassing as sobbing through fucking tulips while being recorded. In front of my 13 classmates (IB class if you know what that is so it’s a small close knit group. I don’t know if them actually knowing me made it more or less humiliating.)
After my slightly unnecessary meltdown I picked up my phone and noticed my friend had sent me something. She told me she envied the way I could read poetry so emotionally. She said it was inspirational. She had seen me sobbing and humiliated in front of the same kids I’ve known for years and her take away was “wow she read that so well”
Another classmate texted me something similar. That everyone apparently was talking about it after I left. I don’t know if they were trying to make me feel better but if they were they did a terrible job of doing such. 
But really I just wonder how you look at someone, sputtering and sobbing and all you can find yourself saying is “wow you’re so impressive!”
I don’t want to be fucking impressive I want to actually be able to read a stupid presentation about a stupid poem written by some Nazi obsessed dead woman without having a three hour mental health crisis.

"(ALL NAMES ARE FAKE)

In 2020, my best friend, Rachel, and I (both female sophomores in hs at the time) were dating a pair of best friends, Sophia and Ashley. Rachel and Ashley had met in a class that the three of us had together and then Ashley introduced me to Sophia. I regret it, but we would all ignore Covid guidelines to sneak out in the middle of the night and hang out the four of us nearly everyday during distanced learning. We were just four teenage girls trying to create our own cringe queer coming-of-age story.

At this point, Ashley and I were the only ones that had had any experiences with marijuana. The other two wanted to try, so I got them some edibles and then designated drove them to partake in them safely. After that day, the four of us got high together a few more times here and there with no issues. 

One day, the three of them hung out without me and then shortly after, Rachel and Ashley broke up. When it all went down, I was out of the loop because I was gone for a volleyball tournament and did not see it as any of my business. I was, however, aware that things ended badly between them and it was clear that the foursome would not be reuniting anytime in the future. Eventually, Sophia and I also broke up on not so good terms.

Flash forward to our junior year, Ashley and Sophia have not spoken to Rachel or I in months, but I end up not only having a class with Ashley, but sitting NEXT TO HER. Then, as if things couldn’t get worse, Sophia transfers into that class. Ashley and I had no bad blood, so we were able to be respectful and do desk partner stuff after the initial awkward few days. During finals, I end up rekindling my friendship with Sophia and when the topic of Ashley and Rachel comes up, Sophia gets all weird and tells me that if I have questions then I should ask Ashley directly. This caught me all the way off guard because WHAT ARE YOU HINTING AT??? 

After that hangout with Sophia, I text Ashley to tell her that I talked to Sophia and she told me that something happened. Ashley then tells me  that while I was at my tournament, the three of them decided to get high together and go to the mall. Rachel accidentally got too high and while they were out, she was being very touchy with Ashley. While Ashley would usually be fine with pda, these advances were very unwanted at that moment. Sophomore brain Ashley did not have the emotional maturity to straight up tell Rachel to stop, and Rachel’s high self could not read the uncomfortable body cues that Rachel was showing. After that day, Ashley realized what had happened, but Rachel did not remember the bulk of the day. Ashley eventually just broke up with Rachel without telling her what had happened. 

Knowing that Rachel would not be able to live with herself if she knew what she had done, Ashley asked me not to tell her. Ashley understood that Rachel was not a monster and had already forgiven her by that point, so we all left that conversation where it was. I kept my word, but I could not look at Rachel for the longest time. Having to act like there was nothing wrong just destroyed me mentally. Through many long therapy sessions, talks with Sophia, and the passage of time, I was able to allow myself to forgive Rachel and things eventually went back to (somewhat) normal. 

We are all in college now. Rachel and I are tighter than ever, I ended high school on great terms with Sophia, we all live completely different lives, and Rachel has no idea about any of this. I absolutely hate keeping this secret from my best friend, but this is something that we all decided cannot be shared with Rachel under any circumstances. I have never told anyone about this and honestly, the moral/mental battle of it all is something that I wish upon nobody. 

If you get anything from my story, I hope you gain the understanding that we are not always our biggest mistakes and sometimes we just need that second chance. I hope that you all have a wonderful holidays and a great rest of your lives because I feel like I have already lived three lives even though I’m still a teenager.

"I (21F) was at my boyfriend’s (23M) place folding the laundry when I found a clear pouch with a stack of Polaroids in the pile of his unfolded hoodies. I generally trust him and have never snooped his phone / belongings before. I wasn’t going to look through it but given the pouch was transparent, I caught a glimpse of the top Polaroid which showed his hand grasping the breast of a girl. I had a bad feeling about this and so I looked through the rest which reveals a series of intimate photos between him and his ex. I was shocked and returned everything to its original place (back in the messy hoodie pile). 

Later that day, I casually mentioned that I’ve been doing some laundry and his first reaction was to run to the pile of hoodie to “look for something”. He seemed relieved when everything appeared to be in its original place and I just left it at that. 

I understand it is normal for people to watch porn and stuff, but is keeping your intimate photos with your ex acceptable? Moreover, I feel uneasy about his reaction when I mentioned the laundry… His ex did call him two weeks ago asking to get back together - and he told me he rejected her but did not tell her about us (we’ve been together 4 months now) because he claims “she’s going through a lot” and simply “cannot break it to her”.

"Honestly some days my emotions are so overwhelming that I feel like we aren't going to make it but most days I'm planning my future with him and I can't imagine my life without him and he tells me how much he loves me but some days it doesn't feel like that. Bit of backstory, he's tried to cheat on me from the first 2/3 month of us dating (February/march 2022) until god knows when and I found out in November 2022 when we broke up for a week and I had messaged the girl because I already my suspicions (she didn't want him but he tried). Then from January 2023 he was cheating on me and slept over at another girls house on the 26th which I found out on the 27th when she told me (the 27th was our 1 year) then from late February 2023 to I don't know when he cheated on me and had sex with another girl from college which I found out in April 2023 when her friend and eventually her messaged me (that one was a whole mess and is a long story but her friend created a fake account before I knew to harass me and my sister and called me a tramp) and then he cheated one again with someone from work in may 2023 to idk when and I found out in August 2023 and the he went to a different country for a month and I found out that he had allowed 2 different girls (that i know of) to have his number or socials and he had messaged them and neglected to tell them he has a gf and then he blocked them and attempted to cover it up until I discovered those two anf I honestly think there may have been others. Throughout our relationship I have been accused of cheating and from the bottom of my heart I have never cheated but he continues to cheat and says he loves me but he's just having a psychotic break and I don't know what to do anymore. I want to relapse and hurt myself. Actually no I want to kill myself I have my own issues to deal with and I just can't anymore. I guess what I want to know is, is there any possibility that he actually loves me? Because I feel like he loves me but also doesn't and in my fucked up mind I love him more than myself and I just want to change and get skinnier and prettier and be more his type and have the personality he wants me to have so that I can be good enough for him. I just want him to only want me. And it fucks with my head, whenever I suspect him of cheating (which is never nearly as much as he suspects me) I get called names like a psycho bitch or when I want to go on his phone it's a problem but he will take my phone out of my hand and go through my chats with a friend and I wont say anything. Why won't it stop I just want him to communicate with me instead of accusing me and screaming at me all the time. And when he does accuse me I tell him that he feels like that because if he was in my position he would be ""getting revenge"" but I'm not that type of person. Or he's just accused me to make himself feel better, and apparently me saying that is being manipulative and I'm gaslighting him

"for some history on me and my brother, we never got along well. it wasnt just the usual sibling bickering but would escalate to violence and threats from him quite often. to name a few: almost made me sleep outside when i was 13 because he wanted to throw a party, forced me to buy black spray paint to paint a bb gun black (tried to rob a guy with it), constantly threatend me with violence, and arrested 3 times before even turning 18.

the big upset that caused us to stop living together was in early 2020. during this period it was just, him, and my grandfather (mom and stepdad overseas for military). i found out he was keeping a gun in our house and knowing his history i told my mom, which didnt turn out well for me. by this point he was 18 and i was 14, and he found out that i told our mom about the gun.  when he found out he tried hitting me and made threats of unaliving me if i didnt help him pack his shit and leave before my mom called the police. after this whole incident went down i told my mom and stepdad everything, and their first question or even last wasnt asking if i was ok. they pried for information and then left when i was finished.

now onto this year, after the previously mentioned incident he fucked off to california and got arrested again for unaliving someone (found this out after the conversation with my mom and stepdad). so while im eating dinner with my mom and stepdad, they tell me that he may be having a child. wasnt too shocked and didnt really care (they presented it as asking if i wanted to hear this, i was curious so i humored them). i said thats good for him and made an off handed comment that the kid wouldnt have an uncle. they were shocked by this and insisted i should let bygones be bygones and my ""denying"" a child from having an uncle is a radical take. 

i was absolutely flabbergasted by this. they 100% knew everything i had been through because of him, and expect me to have room in my heart for his child?? then they started insisting that we're still brothers at the end of the day and shakespeare had a story about this. at this point im in shock. i mean really, citing shakespeare??? i dont care if we're still related by blood he abused me and threatened to kill me. i tried to refute them by saying family doesnt make the bond true and my mom counters with, ""well the same should apply to me right? if we dont have a bond because we're family i dont have to take care of you."" by this point i was fed up so i went to my room saying im done with the conversation.  

the next day they acted like nothing happened and at that point i couldnt care less. i just couldnt believe they could say something as calloused as they dont have to take care of me if i dont ""value the family bond"". i never said that applied universally to every family member i have, and i didnt exactly ask to be born either. 

it always seemed like i was treated differently than him and had most of the expectations put on me. i get that im the ""better child"" from a criminal stand point, but i cant do everything. why is it fair that when i get bad grades i get grounded for a week or two, but when my brothers breaks a thousand dollar mac belonging to my mother he gets his phone taken for a few hours. ive even been told im just as bad as him because of the mental struggles ive had. hearing that im just as bad as a brother who got arrested several times because ive tried to kill myself. am i really an asshole because i dont want to associate with his family??",i dont want to associate with my brothers family,18ov3pw,1703297272.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ov3pw/i_dont_want_to_associate_with_my_brothers_family/,

Last year, I was working a job that had a 2 week holiday break, no pay and we were struggling around this time of the year (I have a much better job this year.) My hubby decided that he was tired of spending a ton of money on presents, 2 parents, a step parent, 4 siblings, an in-law and a nephew all on his side by this time.

One is facing financial reasons of their own doing, legit they spend money on shit they can't afford and demand ""house hold items"" I don't agree with it but hubby took care of it. Whatever. 

What I don't like is ""oh its boring if everyone gets the same gift.

He never says anything bad to her face just to me about it. When I suggest he just tell her he doesn't want her help he acts like it's ridiculous that she doesn't know what she's doing isn't specifically helpful to him.

Today I was at my local gym getting a lift in, nothing out of the ordinary up until I notice a women taking a bunch of glances towards me, even at times staring at me, throughout the duration of my workout (1hour at least).

"I (34f) was dating this dude for 4 months. At first we really clicked, we talked for hours over serious things and silly things. We watched horror movies and anime together. It was great at first. We didn't have sex, I wasn't ready and he told me he feels pressured easily and he hasn't a huge sex drive. So, we mutually took it slowly. Then I was ready to sleep in the same bed as him. We cuddled and watched another movie together. Which was fine. In the morning tho I was sleeping and he hugged me from behind and pressed himself against me and I pushed his shoulder and told him to go to his side, I wanted to sleep. A little later the same thing! He did it a third time too, I gave up in the end and started making breakfast, but told him clearly, while I liked cuddling during the movie, I didn't like it in the morning, because he moved to much and his breathing was uneven and that kept me awake. He only answered with a sarcastic ""well, tank you"".
I broke up with him after that weekend over text. I hate how it influenced my fantasies and my memories. My first crush was painfully one-sided, but his body and smell and warmth was still a nice memory and I remember that feeling of love and deep desire. I didn't even felt a spark of that for him. I hate how it influenced my writing. Fanfiction might be a childish thing for some people, for me is something essential for my health and to process things. Now when I imagine the male and female prota together, I remember him pressing himself against me and breathing uneven and moving annoyingly. I miss him, but I also hate him for tainting my memories and fantasies, just because he couldn't accept a no for cuddling. He also always licked his lips before we kissed. Like seriously, why making it extra wet/uncomfortable? Officially I tell people his feelings had turned into romantic ones while mine turned into a platonic direction, which is kinda true, breaking up with him still felt like loosing a close friend again, but the main reason really remains my tainted memory and fantasy.

I have been told I’d say 80% of the time that im beautiful and I’d say 20% eh or that im not someone’s type but for some reason what those kids said really got to me.

"My first girlfriend was in senior year of high school. The two of us were definitely not compatible as partners, I think we were both more into the idea of a relationship rather than a relationship with each other. We were good friends and never treated each other poorly, but we definitely shouldn't have dated as long as we did.

I was a pretty awkward dude back then, shy to make moves. When the topic of sex came around, I said I wanted to do it because it would be a fun and meaningful experience to share with someone I care about. She said she wanted to do it just to say she had done it, she didn't seem super turned on by the act itself. This kinda threw me off, it felt weird to me to have sex with someone who was doing it to check a box rather than someone who wanted me for me. We occasionally brought it up over the course of our relationship, sometimes she would put a timeline on when she would be ready (""oh, my 18th birthday,"" ""no, actually when we take this trip together""), sometimes she seemed more down when I asked, but I think this was based on her wanting to be like her friends who were having sex.

We broke up before college and I remained a virgin. For a long time after that, my perception of sex was messed up. I felt a lot of resentment over my ex and how much effort I put in without getting much in return. I put a lot of expectations on myself that my first sexual partner needed to be top-tier, and that the sex needed to be amazing. I was hesitant about seeing women as normal sexual beings because my ex ducked away from my advances and efforts. The longer I remained a virgin, the more expectations I put on it, which made even more hesitant. When I eventually did have sex, it was fun but nothing mind-blowing. It made me wish I had gotten over it a lot sooner so it wasn't as serious in my head.

Honestly, I wish I had just agreed with my first girlfriend that it'd be good to have sex just to check a box. Cuz looking back, my first time was never going to be amazing and maybe that's a more realistic and stress-free way of approaching it. I wish I had agreed with her and we had had sex just to say we had done it, we would've still broken up but I wouldn't have had as many sexual hang-ups. It would've probably been uncomfortable (more for her), but if we both consented it would've been fine.

There were a lot of cool women I met who were into me and I didn't pursue them because I felt I couldn't please them sexually. Maybe if I had had mediocre sex in high school, I wouldn't have put as much pressure on myself.",I wish I had sex with my first girlfriend even though she wasn't super into it,18ouehe,1703295053.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ouehe/i_wish_i_had_sex_with_my_first_girlfriend_even/,
"I (M19) don’t know why I feel like I’m not worthy, but I just feel so nervous and worried about the prospect of finding a good person to live with.

In theory, I’ve been blessed by my life and should have no issues with anything regarding to dating and my non-dating life: I go to a pretty well-regarded school in a massive city, have plenty of social circles and friend groups that I interact with, and I’m generally doing well in my studies.

On paper, I should also have no issues finding someone, too. I’m 6’4”, not unattractive, pretty easy to talk to in general, and I’m pretty sure I know two girls who are physically and emotionally attracted to me. I should have no reason to complain, and yet I just feel nervous and unworthy of the attention of others.

I don’t know whether to call it impostor syndrome or what, but every time I speak to those two girls (and some other women who I consider friends), I just get a feeling of dread in my stomach. I don’t have any social issues - I’ve been called the life of the party by a lot of people - but I always have a gut feeling that something is wrong when I talk to them. I honestly don’t know why I feel like this, maybe because I’ve never been in a formal relationship, but I just feel a sense of unease; at the same time, I really don’t want to “fumble the bag” so to speak and lose both.

I really can’t wrap my head around why I feel so internally nervous (I don’t think I come off as nervous in real life, although that might not be true) and scared, but I just feel like I’m not deserving of love, or sex, or anything like that. Maybe that’ll change with time, I hope it does.

I hope I’m not the only person that experiences this, but I do feel better after having putting my thoughts down.

About 5 years ago he began asking me about past lovers and what they did to me/I did to them. It turned him in so I went with it. I answered his questions and even used my past experiences in dirty talk while we had sex. It worked for him and I was indifferent to it.

I go on business trips often and lately he has been telling me he wants me to cheat on him in these trips. He even asked me to talk about how it would happen while we have sex. He has been putting so much pressure on me to actually cheat it has my mind wondering. It is exhilarating to think about having sex with someone else, especially in a more anonymous situation.

"Tomorrow is the birthday of one of my friends from high school. She invited me to go to a bar to celebrate with her, and I know she's going to invite a bunch of people from our high school. However, I don't want to have to face them.  
  
2023 has been the worst year of my life. I(24F) graduated from university this year and have yet to find a job. I also realized that I don't really want to work in the field of my degree. I've spent this whole year deeply depressed with a lot of suicidal ideation. I don't leave my house very often, and my grandpa died last month. I'm trying to get out of this hole I've dug for myself, but it has not been easy.  
  
Deep down, I wish I could just go and hang out for a bit, but I feel so embarrassed! I don't want to tell her how I have been feeling. I don't want to engage in small talk with the people I went to high school with, like, ""How are you? How is life going?"" It's awful. I feel the worst and think about killing myself constantly, even though I know I can't because I cannot break my family's heart like that. I feel like everybody's life is going great but mine's stuck in the mud.

To make it worse, I live very far away from the bar. Two years ago, I left my hometown and moved to a different city, which is almost 60km away from my hometown. Now, I don't have a car, so I would have to take the bus, which would take about 2 to 3 hours.

"I (25m) really need some help. I am home for Christmas and my girlfriend is going to come visit, but I think I might have to break up before. I've been dating my girlfriend for 7 months now. Initially I really didn't want to date her because I never planned on being in a relationship at this stage in my life, but I got sucked into it because we had so many trips planned together and it juat kinda happened because we were spending so much time together and I felt bad cancelling on her. But I decided to give it a try. And for a few months it was really great, but then I started to have my doubts. 

She's beautiful, we get along so well and I really do love her, but I kept thinking about other women and my desire to become single again. I also noticed my girlfriend began to gain a bit of weight. I went through about two months of debating about breaking up with her and finally decided to do it. And then I found out her mom might have cancer. I decided to put this on hold, but knew in the back of my mind breaking up was the best decision for me. 

To give a bit of context for the remainder of the post, I have a history of anxiety and have been on Prozac for it since I was 9. 

We are set to go on a NYE trip with another couple next week and she'll be coming to my family home first. A week ago before she left for home for the holidays, I really wanted to break up. I stopped myself from doing it out of consideration for her mother, but I literally had a full on panic attack just picturing how difficult it is going to be for me to put up a front for the next few weeks including on a 6 day vacation with her. Then I calmed down and the next morning I drove her to the airport. I debated breaking up with her over FaceTime, but then she found out her mothers cancer prognosis isn't looking good, and I felt like she deserved better than to be broken up with over the phone. I feel like I should have just done it before she left and put myself first, but I didn't do that. I came to the conclusion that I would suck it up and wait until after new years. 

Fast forward to now, I just had another panic attack and I am terrified about the thought of putting up appearances for this trip. I feel like I've been losing my mind waivering over this decision. I was so sure about breaking up with her last week and now I feel like if we do another trip together we are going to get closer and I'm not gonna wanna break up with her anymore. I don't think I can fully break up with her before she comes, but I feel like I might need to have a conversation with her to let her know how I feel because my mental health the past week has been absolute shit. At the same time, I know that if I initiate that conversation and tell her I have been feeling uncertain about our relationship, we're likely to break up. That might be what is best, but I feel terrible about doing it over the phone. 

I really don't know what to do and I'm driving myself insane and giving myself tons of anxiety overthinking this. now I'm not even sure if I want to break up with her anymore. I really do love her but I feel like my gut has maybe been telling me breaking up is the right thing to do. What should I do, tell her how I have been feeling or suck it up and put up a front for another week and a half and tell her how I'm feeling afterwards?

"Edit: fixing typo

Apologies for the vague description of my job as I don't want to be recognized.

I (30sF) have been working in retail for the same company for 6 years. 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. My wage is sort of in the middle. More than minimum wage but not living wage. I have savings and I don't have debt, but I haven't been able to contribute to my savings for the past 5 years. With cost of living going up, I can't help but start to wonder if it's time for another job. However, after meeting with a career counsellor, this job is actually a good fit for me. I can work within a team and also friends with my coworkers, my schedule is the same as my boyfriend's (who also works in the same company but in a different department), and the job itself is related to what I went to school for and what I'm interested in. I do like my job for the most part. This is the first time I felt such anxiety and stress over it. On paper, the job ticks all the boxes except for one... the wage. And in this day and age, it's a big one. I thought of maybe switching to more of an admin job where sales numbers isn't the main focus, so I started looking around. Most receptionist/admin jobs pay around the same as me, maybe a dollar more, which is not worth the big readjustment to not just a different job but also a different rhythm to our lifestyle. Anything close to what I'm hoping for needs experience or certification that I don't have. Also, when I was meeting with the counsellor, she asked what would I enjoy doing if I were to get an office job, and apart from a bigger pay cheque, I couldn't think of anything.

So it looks like a side hustle would be the way to go. I left that meeting feeling somewhat relieved about that because side hustle was one of the things I was wondering about. However, the more I thought about it, the more stressed I get. What kind of side hustle though? It needs to pay well and I better not be sick of it if I were to work another 5-8 hours a week. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but between work and other commitments, I'm usually mentally and physically drained when my days off come around. Call me weak or entitled but the thought that I might only get 1 day off a week has been a big stressor for me. I know I'm very fortunate that I have a partner who I can split expenses with, but I don't want to become completely dependent on that. If something happens and he's not with me anymore in some way \*knock on wood\*, then I'm screwed.

All this anxiety has also made me more tired throughout the day, which leads to me being irritated a lot more easily than normal. Things that don't usually bother me/I can brush off easily is making me just dread being at work. Some days are better than others. I admit that I'm mostly writing this on a bad day when I just want to go home and crawl into bed for 20 hours. I guess I just feel lost and stuck because this is supposed to be the job for me, so if I'm unhappy with this job, what else can I do...

"So basically i was a HUGE marshmello fan back in 2016-2019 (growing up with a mild form of autism this was clearly a classic case of a hyperfixation) i had the biggest instagram fanpage for him in my country and i even got to see him performing live in 2018, needless to say i saw him as a musical messiah and i was obsessed. 
But things started changing as soon as highschool started, i discovered a new hyperfixation and marshmello wasn't as excisting for me as he once was, this overwhelmed me as i was unready to move on from what was basically my whole world at the time
so as soon as my 16th birthday rolled around i decided that i wanted to get a tattoo of marshmello's ""happier"" ballon on my left wrist, so the day after my birthday, i did. 
I felt so cool with the tattoo for the first couple of years of having it but my marshmello hyperfixation died off completely and i very rarely ever listen to his old stuff anymore (his newer stuff is just NPC elevator music in my opinion)

What my mom does with her money is send some to our home country (no choice it's her dad and she's the only one left that can provide) and save the rest I guess. I told my mom that if she wanted dad to reduce his hours then she should pick up more hours and maybe get an actual full-time job.

Then I try to tell her that she can't just make those kinds of decisions without having any actual plan because that would mess up the monthly income, and if she did want to try and make those decisions, she at least need to go and find a full time job. I also told her we're so dependant on dad that it's embarrassing, but she was like ""well you and your dad borrows money from me sometimes so that's not really being dependant is it"". I was fuming here so my response went along something like ""of course because all you do is send money back home and save the rest. You SHOULD have money leftover that can be borrowed by your own HUSBAND to pay for expenses"". 

The argument went on and on how I was also useless and didn't have a job and why don't I get one, and my response to this was I'm in university doing a full-time studies, but I guess I'm also in the wrong since I could get a part-time job at least to ease up the expenses (although I literally don't ask them for money since I just depend on my student loans and grants). And then I went to my room and I overheard her saying to my dad ""See your son? I dont know what's gonna happen to us when we get old especially now that he's treating us like that"". And I think what made my mom cry was what I said next:

I told her to not worry because once I graduate and once I get out of this place, I will never live with her again and she will be going to the nursing home and that I'm so fed up of her. 

My parents have nothing for retirement and my mom can't even do the bare minimum and get a full-time job that's allowing her to get 40 hours a week? If she wanted my dad to reduce his hours, then do something about it! 

I honestly dont know how to feel about this. I've been with my mom since I was born and immigrated to Canada when I was 14. I'm here with all the pressure in university and student loans with no help whatsoever (I know this is my responsibility). I feel like she's expecting me to take care of them when I can barely take care of myself with all these pressure plus the cost of living is just getting higher and higher.

This was the gist of the argument.

"It’s safe to say that I’m preparing myself for the worst at this point. I have now driven my friend to a rehabilitation facility, taken him to the emergency room and have now showed up in two separate instances where first responders had to be called because he was trying over medicate himself with alcohol and Xanax. 

The scary thing about all of this though is that my friend has already spent 3 months in a treatment facility for alcoholism — and because of the two attempts that he made on his life recently; he has now been through two separate 72 hour psychiatric holds and has even spent a whole week in a psychiatric ward. Yet, he still continues to lie and make excuses as to why he won’t go back into a treatment facility. I’m concerned that the amount of alcohol and pills that he consumed have killed so many brain cells; that his mind is too far gone for him to realize how much of harm he is to himself and others. The fact that he was also allowed to pick up a new pistol just hours after he was discharged from a psychiatric facility also raises a major red flag to me — and for those that are curious; we’re located in Michigan (a blue state) and the gun was picked up at a dealer in Southeast Michigan near Detroit. My friend has a CPL license that is apparently still in good standing — and there was nothing on his background check that would throw a red flag that would have prevented him from getting the gun. 😓

Now I’ve been told by that my friend’s new gun would be locked away in a gun safe with the hundreds of other guns that he owns and I’m willing to take their word for it. I’ve known my friends parents for many years and they are highly responsible gun owners. The fact that my friend lied to me about going to his 14 year old son’s wrestling practice after he got out of the psychiatric ward — but instead, drove another hour out of his way to go pick up his new gun, tells me that he is not interested in seeking help. This tells me that his end game is death, and I no longer see how I can be of help to him since he is unwilling to help himself.","My (36M) best friend (37M), who I have known since 7th grade, now struggles with addiction and has made two attempts on his life within the last month.

"I’m a 26(F) who has been through hell and back many times over the course of my 26 years on this earth. I am mentally disabled – mainly schizophrenic/BPD/ADHD with severe depression and anxiety. I would never use a mental illness as an excuse but please believe me when I say, my schizophrenia has made me the worst person to be around when not controlled by medication. I can be manipulative to people but in my heart, if I was perfectly well, I would never in my entire life do that. I’ve lost friends because of it, and I blame myself and I take full accountability. 

I spent a while changing myself and fighting to control what I could. But it doesn’t seem to matter now because I screwed up my life since I was 16. (I had it since I was 3 but wasn’t diagnosed until 16). People don’t like me much anymore and I do not blame them. 

It’s hard to rebuild a good reputation that you never had. I don’t need criticism anymore as I’ve been handed hell in a hand-basket.  I just want people to see that I am a good person, I just got lost inside an illness that wasn’t me.

"I apologize for the long story.

I (22F) started a new job a few months ago, and that's where i met my manager (29M). In the begging we were just talking (nothing crazy just regular conversations) but with time we got a little closer and i noticed that he started flirting a little. I had a crush on him so obviously at first i didn't see (or didn't want to see) the red flags. I didn't think much of the flirting, obviously i was happy because i liked him, but i wasn't sure if i wanted to act on it. I thought that he must do that with every new girl since it was odd for me to see a manager act like that. One day he asked me to stay longer so that we could talk, i said yes and so we did. We just talked about our lives and we got to know each other better. That night he sort of confessed he had ""feelings"" for me and he didn't understand why he felt that way towards me especially since we just met. Oh and also that's when he told me that he has a GIRLFRIEND (33F). That's what made me doubt even more everything he said and i wanted to stop what we ""started"".

After that i got a little distant, but weeks go by and we still talk at work and i cant lie i enjoyed talking to him, he's a really nice and funny person. One thing led to another and one day i accept going on a date with him. I know i shouldn't have, i felt really guilty at the time but i thought that he couldn't keep acting for that long so what he said must have been true. Since then we often go out, he calls me every day, if we're not together we're texting or on the phone almost 24/7.

I started feeling less and less guilty (which is weird because i feel horrible for not feeling that way...) so i wanted to have a serious conversation about our possible future. He said that he thought about it too and that apparently i made him change his view and that he could see a future with me (which he apparently did not with his gf). I don't want to be the other woman (i know i already am) but i don't want this to keep going and i also don't want to be a pick me girl and tell him to leave his gf for me when its not the right thing to do (and honestly i doubt that he would leave her anyway). He's already established with here, they've been together a long time, they live together, meanwhile i am still at uni and don't have much for myself. One day we were talking and he brought this topic on his own, he said that if he ever was to pursue a relationship with me he wanted to do things ""right"" and break up with her, work on himself to get better first and then get with me. Because apparently if he was to say ""i love you"" again i would be the last person he says it to.

The thing is that his gf often comes to our place of work (but i didnt know that it was her before my colleagues told me). Oh yeah bc at work everyone knows we're close, they even joke about it by calling him my work husband etc. So its very uncomfortable when she's here and i am too. Also, there's been one time where he responded to my story (nothing ambiguous) but she saw my name when i responded back and asked who i was, and since he usually isn't friendly with other coworkers, i think next time she sees me she'll know somethings up.

I just gotta get this off my chest…I apologize for the length. 

So this evening, I (18F) was going to a strip mall to shop after work. It was around 5:30pm &amp; ofc was already dark. Anyway, there was no close spots so I finally park my car and get out. I’m not even three feet away from my car when I hear this car approach from behind me, followed by a man saying, “Hey, how you doing?”. 

Well, there wasn’t a single other person in the parking lot &amp; it was dark outside. So, I didn’t even awknowledge the man. I wasn’t gonna take a chance when I’m an 18 year old girl all alone in a dark parking lot. I’ve heard too many stories of human trafficking and kidnapping. So, I just kept on walking.

Well, clearly that infuriated him because not even 5 seconds later he says, “Yeah and don’t be surprised when you come out and your 4 tires are slashed.” I was completely taken aback. The worst part was his voice was terrifyingly serious.  I stopped dead in my tracks &amp; instinctively turned to look at him for the first time. I didn’t even want to make eye contact but I was so shocked he said that unprovoked that I thought surely he had to be making a sick joke or something.

Nope.

I made eye contact with him, probably looking scared shitless because I am NOT an abrasive person. He had to be in his late thirties if I guessed, and looked sketchy as hell. As soon as I made eye contact, he said to me, “Now you’re fucking looking. Keep on fucking walking bitch.” In the cruelest, most degrading voice I’ve ever heard. Of course, I obeyed him and turned myself right back around, now speed walking. He continued to drive slowly behind me, trailing me. 

I was so afraid I just entered the closest store because I wasn’t gonna spend another second outside. I ended up staying in there for a good 30 mins pacing before finally leaving. I ran so fast to my car, jumped in, locked my doors and sped out of the parking lot. As I approached my car I was even making sure the tires weren’t slashed because he did not sound like he was fucking around when he said that to me.

Yes, this scared me shitless, but more so it angered me so deeply. What kind of world do we live in that this a normalized encounter. That a grown man thinks it’s acceptable to say such a thing to a young girl because she didn’t acknowledge his advances. Why would I?! I do not know this man, why would I want to spark up a conversation in the first place, let alone in the location I was in.

"My partner and I have been together for 15 years. They were always kind and welcoming to me prior to this, though I am coming to suspect that they are a narcissistic family system. 

We are childfree, not entirely by choice, and I have been in a lot of grief over the past few years following a miscarriage right before the pandemic.  We both have creative careers and unpredictable income and simply cannot afford to have kids anymore (we’re in the US) plus I’m in my 40s and I struggle with my mental health.

The issue is that they are completely obsessed with grandchildren. Just as one example, my MIL openly wept when my partner told her we weren’t planning on continuing to try for kids. There was stony silence when I told her about my miscarriage, after which she did manage a sentence of sympathy. But no one ever acknowledged our miscarriage again. They constantly talk to us about my SILs babies (she got pregnant back to back twice immediately after my miscarriage), and constantly text us unsolicited photos of her children. Our SIL never even does this herself.

My partner has tried to talk to them about this several times and their behavior has not changed at all. They are so obsessed they act like they just had babies of their own and like we have nothing to offer anymore, like we’re total losers.
I suspect they think I’m at fault for us not having children even though there have been multiple factors at play and we have utterly agonized about this together for several years; we’ve even almost split up over it and have been trying to salvage our relationship.

That being said… y’all. I do not know HOW people have careers as brand managers or social media runners, because my mental health has never been lower.

For example “where are you located?” Almost every day we’re asked. Our address is the first thing on our media pages and on Google, as well of the DOZENS of articles that include our address as well.

She spends about 8-10 hours a day sitting on the couch watching renovation shows on her phone, but probably not a 15 minute window goes by that I'm not asked to bring her something (drinks, vape or phone charger she seems to always lose, blankets/delivery packages/etc). I'm constantly told how she plans to do X renovation, but in my head every time I just hear ""I'm going to sit on a stool and tell you what to do"", which is exactly what happens when the rare burst of motivation gets her moving. Of course that motiviation always seems to kick in at 4:45 right before I'm done with work for the day so I can take care of it all, with some flippant comment about ""I just don't know where the time went today"". If a mess happens (dog throws up, she spills a drink, knocks stuff over), I end up cleaning it up while hearing ""I was just about to take care of that"" 20 minutes later.

"So about half a decade ago, I (17F) had a boyfriend. I was about 12 or 13 years old and he was about 16. He was a good friend whom I knew very well for many years. He was nice, understanding and supportive of me during my father’s illness.
I have never been the kind of person to show a lot of emotion therefore I think this has manifested itself inside my mind.
Let’s call him Jacob. Jacob had slept over many times so this day was nothing special. We were alone in my room, mom and dad had gone to sleep, I think my sister was out drinking or smth, don’t really remember. 
Now a quick side note, I developed very fast in certain areas, meaning I didn’t look 12.
It’s all a little hazy because it’s been so many years, but I remember we were laughing and it was hot outside so I was maybe wearing a t-shirt and shorts? Anyway, I remember him placing his penis between my legs, right at the entrance (still clothed). And as a person, I am horrible at saying no to someone. You could have a horse trample me and I’d still not utter a word. I someone steered the situation away from going any further, and the next morning, I broke up with him and haven’t spoken with him since. 

My problem is, that I used to be so confident. I didn’t care about what anyone thought or did, but now I’ve become so self conscious. Jakob messed me up so badly that I have a lot of trouble even speaking to guys. I get afraid and feel my heart quicken. And not in a good way. What’s worse is, a few years later, another guy did almost the same thing, where I said stop and got blamed by my friends for the whole situation. 

I don’t know what to do. Therapy isn’t helping and yesterday Jakob contacted me. I’ve been sick ever since. 

I’m sorry if this story is a mess. I’m writing as I’m feeling I guess",I was just too young,18orbi1,1703285879.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18orbi1/i_was_just_too_young/,
"I am tired, really. My (19F) mother obviously has a favourite daughter and it's not me. I have two sisters (25 and 30), the oldest, let's call her Tina, is a spoiled adult child. She was spoiled since she was a kid since our parents were extremely rich. Due to their dumb ideas and stupid spending, we ended up poor.

Dad left and mom refused to work so she put my middle sister, let's call her Jenny, to work at 14. At 14 she fed and provided for us alone because Tina and our mom refused to work at all. Mom demanded I'd do every single house chore and so I did until I turned 18 and started to work. Up until now, only I and Jenny are working and providing. I work from 2pm to 10pm and I get home extremely tired obviously. Tina is going to college only now at 30, which is alright but she spends most of her time at home. Mom is never home, I have no idea why and I don't give a single fuck since not having her at home is much, much better.

Somedays, I get home and mother still yells at me to do house chores. I had no problem washing the dishes until I got a fracture on both legs due to excessive work (I can't sit at work and I carry too much weight there) so I can barely stand and walk now, which has resulted in me changing my position at work to one I can sit most of the time. When I get home, though, mother started to demans more since I got my fractures.

She says it's because I'm too fat (I'm not, 55kg for a 1,60m person is absolutely normal and adequate, I also work out a lot) so I should stand more and keep doing house chores because ""there's no one else to do it"". I told her that Tina sits around almost all day and has hours and hours of her day to wash the dishes. She simply dismissed all I said and told me that ""everyone should do their part"". I got pissed, neither her and Tina does their parts so I tols her I'm going to quit my job then to fully focus on ""helping her"". It was a bluff obviously but she got even angrier and asked who was going to provide for us then. I said she had another adult daughter and also she could provide for us herself.

She started to yell a bunch of thinghs that didn't make sense so I simply walked to my room and has been locked here since.

"After our dog's death my mom decided that it was ready for us to get a new puppy after TWO WEEKS of our dog's death. So now the puppy is now 10 weeks old and keeps on biting us yesterday the puppy bit so hard that my mom's finger started to bleed. We keep on trying enticing the puppy with toys that he could bite/chew on. But it doesn't seem to work just 15 minutes ago I tried to clean up the yard and then the puppy started to attack my pant leg and my ancle. And of course dumb me thought wearing sandals was ok. Then he decided to attack my arm while I'm trying to clean up the yard. Of course I scream because the puppy had hurt my arm. Then my mom came out to yell at me for screaming at the puppy. ""Cause he's just a puppy, we could be kicked out by our landlord for us screaming and yelling."" I wouldn't have screamed if the puppy didn't hurt me. I'm scared of that dog hiding right now in my bedroom. If it's possible to have some advice to help the puppy not bite us hard. That would be greatly appreciated.

"In short as a prelude, my GF and I bought a new house, started a renovation, expected everything to be ready  during summer. 

Yep, it wasnt. Then we expected everything to be ready during fall

Yep it wasnt. I was desperately busting my ass but as it goes, not enough time, shitshows everywhere, work suddenly decided that its gonna take majority of my time one way or another. 

I tried, I fucking goddamn tried. I was hoping that after a year of nonstop work I will have at least the christmas but the reality is the house is nowhere close to having any meaningful christmas. The kitchen is incomplete and will be coninued in new year, the bathroom is incomplete and I have to finish it this month because my GF has to move in. So not even the ""spend time together"" cuts it, I need that time to get shit done. 

Nowhere to cook the dinner, no christmas tree. Nothing is prepared. In fact we realised none of us had time or even mood to get presents for the christmas. The grocery run was not even done yet, we would have to go tommorow and thats gonna be hell on earth, the shops will be bursting in the seams. I spent last week watching a contractor putting together our kitchen while I still had hope of ""yeah he will manage, it will be done, everything will work out."" Well he didnt manage to get it done. Nothing worked out as I wanted.

So the sensible thing to do is admit a defeat and cancel the whole shitshow because it doesnt look like anyone would actually enjoy this and it would end in some hasty parody where everyone would be pissed off and nothing would work.

"  
I've spent the last few years pretty much isolating myself. I get along with other guys 'ok'... it takes some effort, but I can hold a conversation (most times).  
For the past month I have been on at the job training. At this training was a woman from another facility. The training covered people from all over. She was plain, had a great smile. I found myself kind of developing a crush. The training ended a few days ago.  
Which of course went no where.  
I came up with every excuse to not go for it. I'm in my early 40s and never really dated. I've always been introverted, and never had enough of a desire to engage a woman. For a few days near the end when I looked over, I caught her looking. Not always smiling, about half the time and others just a plain look, but it was fairly often. So, add that uncertainty, but I'd never see her again afterward if things went south. I'd go for it, right?  
Every chance I took to think about it, how it might work, I tore myself down. ""She'd be totally disappointed."" ""You have no social skills, how the f\*\*\* do you think you'd pull this off?"" ""You'll make an ass of yourself."" ""Make all the effort you want, she'll discover you're a fraud."" or even hell most often, ""You're a loser.""  
We had one or two training related conversations. That's it. So, on the last day of training, I addressed her as ""Miss XXX, enjoy the holidays,"" and went my own way.  
On top of an already bad day, I felt like shit. The whole commute home (double the normal due to holiday traffic), I pretty much trashed talked myself.  
And that's all I do is trash talk myself in such cases. Not in the aftermath, but in process as well, trash talk myself to make sure I end up miserable.  
Every. Damned. Time. After any interaction, say a store clerk who I see every week, we'll converse and I'll tear myself down for any imperfect part of the conversation. Even if there wasn't one, I'll do my damnedest to find it. Every. Damned. Time.","F, all I do is tear myself down",18oqwoj,1703284711.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18oqwoj/f_all_i_do_is_tear_myself_down/,
"Most of my(16F) life I was a tomboy, “not like other girls” kinda gal. As ashamed as I am of my last phases I’m now pretty much over it and feel like I’m slowly becoming the best version of myself.

Well it seems like my peers don’t share the same sentimate because I aalways feel like they view me as the same as I was 4 years ago. I had blue hair, wore a tight pony tail EVERY SINGLE DAY (I’m not exaggerating) and never even considered the idea of makeup. Now I wear mascara everyday, always try wear my hair down and styled and am back to my natural hair colour. 

I have a skinny blonde friend who has always been gorgeous and I’ve always been jealous. She has a great body and while I’m skinny I’m not as good looking as she is. Whenever I feel like I’m getting close to a guy or maybe they are interested, it always turns into them wanting to get with my friend. 

I know it’s not her fault and I don’t blame her at all but it still hurts. I’m never considered pretty by any of my peers and I know it’s not suppose to be THAT important but it still hurts.

"Hi , this is going to be a long one… I (f22) recently found out that my aunts husband masturbated in front of my cousins 4 year old daughter. 

My family is drama and trauma but this one is just so surprising so I have to share to get this off my chest.

Some code names:
My mom = Debbie
My oldest aunt= Isabella
Isabella’s husband = cliff
Isabella and cliffs three kids= Anne, Liam, Greg. 
Greg’s wife and kids= Selena. Emma and Aron. 

On to the story: Emma is 4 years old and her brother is a few months old. She had another brother who passed away as a newborn when she was around 2. Emma told her parents Selena and Greg that her grandpa cliff masturbated in front of her and said “ shh it’s a secret game. 

Selena and Greg talked to Greg’s mom (cliffs wife) and she said that they have to confront him to find out if it’s true. Isabella( my aunt, Greg’s mom and cliffs wife) went trough is phone and computer but said she didn’t find anything. So Gregg and Selena confronted cliff to ask if it was true. He has never once denied it, he has only made weird comments and explanations. He has never said he didn’t do it. Emma doesn’t want to se her grandpa and says she is mad at him. 

Isabella and cliff hade a trip booked to Spain and so they went. After they came back Isabella could not be contacted and she texted my mom Debbie that she loves her and their sisters but that she needs too go no contact for a while. 

Gregg and Selena are moving away from the small town where they ( my cousins and aunt + hubby) to where the rest of us lives. They haven’t found a place yet or jobs but they knew they had to leave. They have just renovated their house and their middle child who passed is buried in that small town. But they felt they had to leave for their children’s sake and I agree that they are doing the right thing. Emma is clearly traumatized and they don’t want to risk something else happening. 

Cliff has now started messaging both Gregg and Selena that Selena is a liar, a bitch and just makes stuff up and that Gregg shouldn’t listen to her. And said things like “ as you dad I have helped you trough life, I made your life, you should be grateful for me”. He has also texted Anne who is my aunts biological daughter and cliffs adopted daughter that he will make sure she is off the will and that he wishes that he never adopted her and that he never wants to see her again because she simple sent a text asking why he was being so mean to Selena and Gregg and asking why he’s not denying that he did it. 

To add to this mess  Liam (sibling to Gregg and Anne) and his fiance  has broken up, one reason being that she never takes care of their child and instead goes to play tennis or drinks wine with friends. He is gonna try to get some custody of their son, so he is nervous about all this coming out about his dad (cliff) as it could affect his chances to get sole custody. He recently also bought and renovated his dream house in that small town, which his ex contributed to. So he wanted to buy her out, she put in 1 mil so he will give her 1,5 mil. But no, she is greedy and wants 3,5 mil for her troubles….

My cousin Liam has checked in on my aunt that she’s okay and alive. But she still does not respond to family. We think he is manipulating her. And that’s were we are at, he is not reported to the police yet as Selena and Gregg don’t want to. I think he should be reported because he works in a church and is a part of christenings and as a fireman who takes care of children in emergencies. My cousin Anne is so afraid that he’s done something to her two daughters as well as he has been visiting them a lot. They are around 7 and 9…

The rest of my cousins are mostly girls so I feel weird that there is a possibility that he has assaulted some of us when we were little. 

Idk anymore this is not the first family trauma or drama to happen in my family. We have psychological abuse, childhood trauma, people in prison, people who lie to their kids about being married when they are not cause they had to divorce bc of tax fraud, drug abuse, leaving, social services involved and even stealing other people’s identities. 

So I just needed to get this out of my head.

"The title is really telling the whole text what it is about (17m). I have always felt extremely ugly and it’s extremely unbearable too. No matter where I go, I always look at myself in reflections as a bad tendency I’ve picked up and judge myself, even when I am at home. I heard the quote “everything is 75% genetics and the rest is something you can approve”, I don’t know if that’s the amount it was, but that just pulls me down even more as I know most isn’t changeable. 

A lot has happened to me during the start of my realization of being ugly. My aunt and uncle died from cancer, my grandpa has been diagnosed with cancer, everything has gone down hill and it’s really not helping my mindset at all. 
I look in the mirror and I try to think “well, imagine this. Many youtubers looked not so attractive when they were at your age, but they blossomed and aged like fine wine, so why can’t that happen to you? Markiplier, Jackspeticeye, Pewdiepie, all of them looked not that great in their teens, but look pretty good now”. Sure, that gives me a minute of confidence, but then I put a photo of me now next to a photo of let’s say for example Markiplier at around my age or close, and somehow I just think he looks more attractive than me. He looks more happy, enjoying life more while I look like a depressed person who has low set eyebrows and forcefully have widen eyes to make my eyebrows be higher so I look more happy, even though I don’t. I don’t want to have a rest face that looks like I am angry all the time. And trust me, people even commented on my resting face, saying I “look unapproachable and not happy at all”. 

I look at my friends and they are way more attractive than me, and that pulls me down even more because then I start distancing myself from them because I don’t want to feel ugly around them, and even they are confused of my action. 

I hate my appearance like there’s no tomorrow, I look at others who seem not that pretty now and think “huh, I can see that after a few years he will become attractive” but when I look at my face I don’t think the same. I just think it’s over.

I hate everything about my face. My nose is too big, my eyebrows are too blonde, thick and too low set, my eye shape is awful, my eyelashes are too blonde and short, my lips and mouth is too small, I have baggy eyes with redness across my face, lines under my eyes, chubby cheeks making my smile look uglier than it has to look, awful jawline, awful head shape, I hate my hair because it’s ginger and I hate when it’s long, short or medium, my nose is too upturned, the list just goes on.

"I'm a woman in my mid 20's. 
I don't know since when I started getting hooked on reading stories of people (men) cheating on someone (their wife/gf) and someone (women) getting cheated on or someone being a mistress, but now I look up these topics literally weekly. Fictional or real, as long as it's a heterosexual relationship and the the relationship is described as initially happyish and healthyish and there is this big betrayal - I am obsessed. I recently discovered that there are subreddits of both groups and everything in between, so obviously this has been a new cryptonite for me. There are people describing soul shattering betrayal and trying to move past it and either move on or reconcile and people currently or having been committing adultery shamelessly or being the other woman/mistress - all of these I've been reading obsessively. Especially the contrast, often those poor wives describe their excruciating emotional pain or they seem to be finally moving past the betrayal, only for the husband doing it again, and then the cheaters/other women describing how the wife thinks the affair is over yet they're still sneaking around. 

There seems to be incredibly many stories around internet where the wife refuses to let go of the husband who constanly disregards her and she seems to be spiraling into this almost ""prison ward"" where she has to monitor everything her husband does - down to all phone activity, facial expressions and duration of bathroom visit.

I genuinely do not understand this obsession of mine. I have never been in a serious relationship and don't plan to, the only cheating story in my life was over a decade ago when my older sister's husband left her for another woman. Also I would never want to be an other woman (a probably necessary disclaimer).

To describe what I feel when I read these stories, my heart is usually pounding, palms sweating, gut is twisting. I don't necessary feel good, but often the fictional, highly erotized stories (where the wife is betrayed by a husband who loved her &amp; she loved more than anything yet chooses to forgive) do turn me on. Would this be called masochism? Only I have never been betrayed nor do I have anyone I'm afraid might betray me. I don't symphathize with the other women but could this be me somehow internally hating yet pitying other women who choose to stay and often destroying themselves in the process. I never engage with the stories in any way.

I've come to the conclusion I must be a bad person and/or a pervert. Although I rarely ""enjoy"" the real life stories, I still consume them as an outsider and flame some weird rage inside of me. I most definitely feel the biggest hatred towards the men in those situations but also pity the women and see them as pathethic. Maybe internalized misogyny? Or maybe I'm just subconsciously deeply afraid of ever letting a man walk all over me and forgiving cheating.

(Btw none of the stories I fixate on are about physical abuse or obviously criminal behaviour, those never turn me on the slightest nor do I want to keep reading them. With those I only feel rage towards the husband.)",I'm (mildly) obsessed stories of cheating and getting cheated on and I don't know why.,18oq57b,1703282561.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18oq57b/im_mildly_obsessed_stories_of_cheating_and/,

"My (32) mom (60) died three years ago from cancer. From diagnosis to death were 20 days. I was by her side when she left and miss her terribly. 
I adopted her cat (I used to live with him in my teens), and I loved him like nothing else. 
I lost him last year and it was a terrible blow. 

But I took another living thing with me: When I cleaned out my mom’s apartment, I found a plant. 

It was an avocado that I planted and left behind when I moved out with 18. 
I was so happy that she kept it all these years! I took it with me and since the cat died, this avocado plant is the last living connection to my mother. 

I nourished the avocado and it grew more than a meter in the last three years. I care for it with all my love and it survived two moves with me. 

I told my friends and close people about the avocado that returned to me after all those years through the care of my mom. Everyone knows how much I love my avocado tree. 

Today I made a picture and the avocado was in the frame. Apparently my phone can now identify plants from pictures.

"Well to be more blunt, I need to know survival tactics on dealing with my narcissistic father. 

To paint the picture, he’s everything a typical narcissist would be. Self centred, victim mindset, so childish for a grown man, and I think the worst part is how he’s always using his traumatic upbringing as an excuse for every negative thing he does. It’s so exhausting. 

A typical episode that is driving me nuts is how he’ll explode emotionally when he’s drunk. He’ll never address an issue sober or even address the issue to resolve it. He just uses you as an emotional punching bag for his past demons that he’s fighting today. 

We tried to suggest therapy but he says that he’s stuck in his ways and isn’t interested in learning new things despite us telling him how much pain he causes us because of his ways. 

The most dangerous part is that he can get violent for anything he justifies. I’m at a point where he can’t do much more harm to me but oh my god the way my heart breaks when he hurts my loved ones. 

I don’t know how to cope anymore. I’m a sane individual but these days I’ve been getting such vivid thoughts of hurting him. I have so much hatred building inside me. 

I don’t think I’ll act on these violent thoughts but it’s so scary to think that deep down I wanna cause so much pain for him. 

I’ve tried being the bigger person. I’ve tried ignoring him. I’ve tried speaking to him about these things.

After two years of psychotherapy I feel so much better. I built up a life and there are moments of connection to other people, there is love, there are friends and there are conflicts for which I have developed healthy ways of dealing with. I'm proud of myself and at the same time I'm very grateful for the help I have recieved. For the moments that were meaningful.

"
I've been separated from my wife for a few months due to not feeling appreciated. I went on vacation with some friends and met this girl at a club. We hit it off and ended up going home together. We had amazing sex for hours and fell asleep together. We laid together and talked for hours the next morning and I really felt like I found someone. I went back home to LA and she went back to Florida. 

We continued to text all day for the next week. I got excited everytime I saw her name pop up as a notification. The conversation was perfectly normal, we were discussing things like life goals and aspirations etc. Then, out of nowhere she stopped responding to me. And it's been a week. I've officially been ghosted. I thought this girl was different. I thought I found someone who I connected with on a whole nother level. I've met girls since being separated but it was nothing like this. I felt like I understood love at first sight. 

Now I'm an emotional wreck just wondering what I did wrong and why it didn't work. I think about her every second. Depression is creeping in. Insecurity is creeping in. Low self esteem is creeping in. We could have been great together. Even she admitted that she felt an intense chemistry. I hate heartbreaks.

"I always thought I had chronic anxiety. I used to think therapy was a joke- probably bc I never won the good therapist lottery. Last year I was uncontrollably crying. My life was so lonely. I found it hard to work. I always dated abusive people- fixer uppers/projects.  I hit rock bottom after the holidays and I desperately reached out to a therapist- and I finally found my match. We have been working together for one year! I have many years to go but my life has changed drastically in just one year of focusing on myself. 

My therapist is certified in trauma therapy. It took around 10 months of therapy for a light bulb to go off in my head. Chronic anxiety? Every time I would try to recall something, it would just be flashbacks of abuse or traumatic experiences. I didn’t know these flashbacks were even flashbacks! I thought I was just having memories or ruminating. 

Growing up I had to show no emotion. Showing emotion means you are weak and stupid.  My mom was cold towards her children and career focused. She did not believe in boundaries and codependency was her main issue imo. I raised my siblings. My household was a very abusive environment from the womb. I won’t  bore you with details of the awful life that I survived. 

From years of suppressing my emotions to survive (stay safe as a child)- my brain created this pattern. It was safer for me to label everything I felt as anxiety. It took a ton of self awareness, and a feeling wheel (seriously)and grounding practices and therapy to overcome “anxiety”. I actually feel anger, sadness, even happiness. It broke a cycle- a nightmare I kept reliving. Now I’m working on what do I do with this anger? I forgive the people and I know I’m allowed to feel anger but I don’t want to feel anger- it sucks. So yea I’m a work in progress.

However- the irony is that I got a great job. A job I love. In this job I have to professionally react to abusive behavior. I feel right at home. 

I’m so grateful for my therapy. I’m now working, and not laying in bed, pulling out my own hair, contemplating suicide. My family moves to a better neighborhood next week. I have more confidence.

"I was shocked, and it’s not something I would ever do personally, but let me give more reasons why I wasn’t affected as strongly as I feel I probably should have been. I was beaten growing up. Everyone I know was beaten or at least hit or smacked or had really mean things said to us to make us fall in line. I realize that I am projecting the life experiences I have had onto this old woman, and thinking “I wonder how many kids she beat or hit or smacked or said really awful things to.” 

I’m thankful that child rearing is moving away from physical discipline and punishments. I’m of the camp that discipline and punishments are two different things. Discipline is teaching, punishments are like revenge. I’m fully prepared for the many commenters saying “I was hit and I’m fine!” and “Kids today have it way too easy.” Good. I’m glad they have it easier. I’m a firm believer in breaking the cycle, and not taking anger out on other people. I’m not perfect. I’ve raised my voice. However the things I say are different. I’m not dishing out low blows that are bound to give my kids body issues. I don’t use the private things they tell me against them. I don’t lord their secrets over them. I don’t punish them for telling me things I don’t want to hear. You know what? My kids are miles more respectful than I was as that age, and I think it’s because I’m not creating an environment of tension. I’m not becoming an adversary for my children. I am someone they can trust when they are scared and something is bothering them. 

I can’t lie, a small bit inside me, the shocked part of me, was upset with the video.

So the past few days i been feeling shit with my body due to my pms. Today tho I sent him a pic and all he would say is abt the bathroom that reminded him of the bathroom in one of our trips. I felt so bad i deleted the pic. I told him he made me feel like shit cause he couldn't even say ""pretty"" and that was the second time he was saying something abt the bathroom and nothing abt me. I have no social media, im not a show off person at all but I do value his opinion A LOT. Sometimes i think way more than I should cause otherwise I wouldn't feel so shit needing his validation. But I miss him, i miss intimacy with him. And he is not even trying to make it happen for a while now.

"I (26f) have been with my boyfriend David (28m) for 6 years. We met in university and continued the relationship after we graduated. He chose to continue his education after undergrad, and I went to work in my field of study. Throughout our relationship his income has been purely student finance, whilst I have contributed from my wage and would occasionally work a few extra shifts for a bit of extra money. We split our finances roughly 70(me)/30(him). We weren't struggling financially, but we also weren't always fully secure if that makes sense. 

He's currently finishing his PhD and has been getting a stipend from the university to support himself. Because of covid the project got delayed and he is having to extend his course. He told me it might be anywhere from 3 months to a year. However, around September (the time he was meant to finish) he was told the university would no longer be funding his stipend as the time period was over. His project manager managed to get some grants to help but those ran out in December and there is no money left. 

He was told before September that the money was running out and I told him that I would not be able to support both of us and the house for long on just my salary. We have no real savings and I could realisticly manage 1-2 months. I was very upfront about this and he promised me he would start looking for part time paid work.

I know he has applied for work in his field at his level (masters/post doc PhD), but his field is super specific and there aren't many roles in them, and the ones he has applied for he has been rejected for lack of experience. I know its upsetting and frustrating for him, because they keep saying he needs experience, but no where will hire him so he can gain the experience. 

The main problem is I don't think he's really looking for anything else. In the past when I brought up having a weekend job to help a bit more with the bills and be a little bit more comfortable, he scoffed at the idea and said that he was doing a PhD and ""shouldn't have to work stacking shelves or in a pub"". I was really annoyed with this because there's nothing wrong with honest work, and having some qualifications doesn't mean you're better than anyone. I know people with masters who work in retail or food services either because they couldn't find a job in their field, or they realised they really liked the work and wanted to keep doing it. It doesn't make them any less of a person or less intelligent. 

I keep asking him about work and jobs because I'm getting so worried about bills and the cost of living, and he told me that he has been looking for ""every kind of job imaginable"" since mid October, but that no one has responded back to him. I'm starting to think he's not really looking. There's usually loads of seasonal work for Christmas and we live in a fairly large city with lots shops and restaurants. I've seen so many signs and posting for part time workers. I don't believe that every one of them has ""ghosted"" him.

I've offered to look at his CV to see if there was any issues, and one of our friends is a manager at a shop and has offered to help with interview prep and writing his CV (friend has no job openings or would definitely hire him). He just tells me that the jobs don't look at CVs and none of the applications asked for one, which sounds really shady. 

I've asked him to go to the job centre to try and get professional help to find a job, and they can help with his application, but he said its booked up for months and he can't get an appointment. I asked if he could apply for job seekers allowance since he now qualifies for it, but he said that was also done at the job centers.

I've become so suspicious of him over the last few months, I don't believe him anymore. I know I'm wrong for this, but I looked through his computer and emais to see if he was actually looking. I found nothing appart from jobs in his hyper specialist field. Nothing else.

I'm so stressed about all of this, and he knows it. I've literally broken down in tears from the stress and extra shifts that I've had to do. I'm so tired all the time and I don't know how long I can keep this up.

"She is 70 years old and has a variety of mental health issues. My grandma and grandpa are raging alcoholics, therefore, my mother moved in with my great-aunt at a young age, she raised my mom. Since then they've lived together. My father is a pos and was never really around and when he was he was extremely abusive.  So my great aunt stepped up again and raised me and my brother. She is my second mom to me. In 2020 she got COVID-19 and was in a coma for 3 months, it was awful and I was so torn up about it. But I had to move to a new city 2 hours away for college, and i still live in that city because I havent graduated yet. When she woke up she thought she was in the 1960's but strangely enough, she remembered me... kind of, she thought the nurse was me but she knew my name and kept asking for me. She slowly recovered but never completely. Recently she has been having problems with her heart and diabetes and has just given up. She's so depressed and in pain all the time because she needs a hip and knee replacement and her cognitive abilities are beginning to slip as well. I found out about all this Tuesday and my whole family is so pessimistic. They've just given up on her, and have decided we are just going to try to check some boxes off of my great aunt's bucket list.   But I feel like we could do more, but I dont know what I can really do 2 hours away.   
Here's why I feel guilty. When I was 12/13 me and my great aunt got into a fight. And she grabbed my hand and accidentally bent my finger back. I cried and honestly overreacted. We were mad at eachother for weeks but my great aunt really wanted to move past it. But I refused to, unless i needed something from her... for example if i needed a ride I would forgive her in that moment and then when I got what I wanted I would go back to being vile and ignoring her. It got to the point that one day she just burst into tears and locked herself in her room all night. I apologized through the door and went to my room. I am 21 now, but I cant move past how manipulative I was. How could I do that to someone how loved me so dearly and stepped up when she really didn't have to. And now that shes nearing the end of her life I just remember this instance and I cant stop sobbing. I was awful and I know I can't change it but it eats at me.

"I have been friends with this person for almost 2 years let's call him John. A little description about him, he is a social butterfly so naturally has tons of friends but only a few make it to his close friends list ( notice by a few I mean 20 something people and yes that's a few for him) . Overall he is a really  nice dude  and we definitely had a bond and I made it to his close friends list last year ( i think ) and was invited to his birthday party last year  ( literally 20 people out of 36 people in our class were invited , so idk what to think of it) . Now this year has really been a turmoil we happened to have a mutual friend let's say her name is Sam ( she was more like my best friend) who was going through shit and obviously me being closer to her sustained the consequences . she started to despise me , ran her mouth , used  a rift between me another one of her friends (lets call her jessi) and made a whole drama out of it and it obviously reached John who confronted me about it ( a month before his birthday) . He was obviously upset about it and I really didn't want a petty fight to ruin my last  school year so I apologized to Jessi via text because we literally have our finals and no common classes so umm yeah she left me in read . And now cut to almost a month after I find my friends, like literally the entirety of the class talking about going through John's birthday that I have no Idea about  major FOMO hit lmfaoo , also hurt like a bitch . I mean it does make sense because I would defo make Jessi and Sam uncomfy ( like why would he literally invite one friend over the expense of making other two uncomfortable) but I think what makes it worse is that I was invited last year and not invited this year when apparantly more people are going . I dropped a polite text on his birthday .next month I have my birthday coming up to which I really wanted to invite him before he dropped this bomb on me .( Yes I'm being dramatic)",Is not being invited to a birthday party indicate that the friendship is over,18onqaq,1703275762.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18onqaq/is_not_being_invited_to_a_birthday_party_indicate/,
"So the basic rundown is I am taking a college class through my high school and my friend is taking college through his high school but is doing it through a program that holds his diploma for another year. Anyway, we have very different living situations,He lives in an apartment with many pets he isn’t supposed to have. Now I am not shaming or making fun of his situation I was in a similar position when I was younger and my family worked very hard to get out of debt and to afford what we have now. My problem is that all he does is complain about it. He complains about not having a license but doesn’t accept my offer to teach him how to drive. He complains about how he has no money but he doesn’t have a job and doesn’t try to get one. He keeps messaging our group chat about how he doesn’t have enough money to turn the gas back on. Again I’m not making fun or getting annoyed at the fact that he is in this situation I’m annoyed that it’s all he talks about and he won’t look for solutions or answers. He is my friend but he just gets so upset whenever I mention any thing involving spending money. ‘I’m painting with my sister!”  ‘I have to borrow my art supplies from my teacher…”. “I’m going ice skating with my church friends” “lucky… ;^;” it’s a CONSTANT pity party!!

i’ll be honest, he doesn’t make it easy to constantly show i love him. he will yell at anyone and everyone, mom included. i don’t want to put the blame on him because he’s still young, and at that age, i have no idea what was going through my head. the worlds so much different from when i was 10 vs how it is being 10 now.

"I just don't trust the buddy. I've seen him hit on a woman (once). REALLY hit on her at a party. He's married and lives in another state - so his wife was nowhere around. Him and my b/f went to Reno together - the buddy flew out  from another state and they drove together on a road trip. I don't think anything happened, but the idea that hookers are legal there did cross my mind. As young men they had gone to a strip-club together, and the buddy had posted a memory of the place on Facebook and touted it as one of the best time's of his life. No details, but I knew the story (and the details) because my b/f had told me. My b/f has also slept with hookers in his past - when he was younger - and single.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy often posts these immature lewd / misogynistic and/or objectifying women type memes which are reminiscent of a pubescent boy who's hormones are raging. Doesn't add to any respect levels I might have had for him. 

Anyhow, when they got back from that 5 day road trip I looked at his phone. Nothing too crazy, but I did stumble upon a  message from the buddy talking about a sporting event in another state (he'd gone without my b/f) and he was mentioning as a side note to their text conversation that the women are the most beautiful he'd ever seen - and he wished he was 19 again. My b/f replied ""I'm IN"" I've always liked southern women"". That bothered me. Weeks go by. They take off on another sporting event and photos pop up with random women (just 3) over the course of a week. Just the two of them with a random pretty young chick between them - the buddy posts these on FB saying ""It's so good to be me"". My b/f and I have a discussion about it -as it bothers me, and he says ""Big party. All in fun. No Big Deal.  Get off my back. etc.""

I look at the phone again some time after our ""discussion/argument"" and he's mentioning to his buddy that he should have gotten naked with someone, then at least he'd have something to feel guilty about"". Then there's another (in the midst of many innocuous messages) that my b/f had said to some another guy ""who wouldn't enjoy whiskey and hookers every weekend? If you say no - you're lying"". The Buddy then replied ""Whiskey AND HOOKERS?! I'm In"".

Guys, what is going here? I know I shouldn't have looked at their messages. And I can't tell my b/f. He'd be livid. But I also don't want to be stressed out when he hangs out with this guy. They go out of state a few times a year for up to a week. It's just the two of them - both in their 60's - the buddy is married but never ever travels with his wife. They plan to go to New Orleans next year and I'm sure, a couple of other places as well.

Part of me feels like I should just let it go and not worry unless something actually happens that I find out about. I don't want to ""look"" for reasons to be suspicious, Part of me wants to keep looking at his phone to find more ""stuff"" that doesn't sit well with me.

Is this just normal guy stuff? I know that men (and women for that matter) will never stop looking and appreciating beauty, so what's up? Am I being immature and worrying needlessly?

"I’m experiencing that error for character limits, so the second part is in the comments 

First off: sorry for the crappy formatting. I am typing this on a phone but I’ll try to make it not as horrendous. This is mostly separate from my post in TIFU. Recently I decided to share some aspects of my life that makes it a living hell, and this is going to be one of the first few posts for that. I have a lot of… negative experiences gained in the short few years I’ve been alive, so I’ll probably be writing a lot more. I will not be saying my age for safety reasons- I am old enough to be on this site, but moving out is not a fesible option.


Context:

I (F) am the youngest in my family of four, with my dad, older sister and of course, mom. While I was a planned baby, my parents were far from prepared to properly take care of my sister and I, as they had a lot of baggage and were quite young when they had us. This lead to my family being dysfunctional, although the way that it was dysfunctional changed over time.

Growing up, I always knew there was something fundamentally different about how my mother treated me and my older sister. My sister, who looks exactly like my mom (moreso as a child, but the resemblance is still uncanny), has been so favored that 4 extended family members have reached out to me curious about the reason we are treated so differently. These family members, while I have a better relationship with in comparison to my direct family, are still not 100% trustworthy to tell things like my sexuality. I am a lesbian, and every member of my family is conservative, with a varying level of insanity per each person.

The relevance of me mentioning my sister looking like my mom has now been shown to probably be a contributor to how she treats her versus me. I’ll list a few reasons that made me realize how important looks are to my mom:

 1-When I was younger, she constantly obsessed over how I didn’t really look like her at all. She would, however, dote on anything I did have that looked like her

2- When I wanted to dye my hair for the first time, I HAD to go with purple (my mom has purple hair). It was the only acceptable color for me if I didn’t want it to be natural 

3- When I was getting bullied in elementary school for my looks and confiding in her, she literally said things like “I have that too. Do you think I’m ugly?” Which turned me into a 10 year old who was comforting her over 30 year old mother about her looks.

4- Just a few weeks ago, I was in a conversation with her and another family friend that is my mom’s age (By me being ‘in’ the conversation I moreso mean I was existing in their presence). During this, the friend brought up hair, and my mother said “Oh, I was thinking about getting AshamedToasters’ hair cut!”. Not only was the pronoun usage extremely weird, I had been adamant about not wanting my hair cut, which she has been obsessed with. (It took me till yesterday to realize what made me so uncomfortable about that experience)

There is definitely more here that I either haven’t realized is related or just isn’t as big of a deal to me, but this should show you what I mean.",I’m extremely paranoid 24/7 because of my mother,18omdru,1703271943.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18omdru/im_extremely_paranoid_247_because_of_my_mother/,
"I'll start by saying that her parents are so kind to me and she has told me how much they love me, but I cannot reconcile that with their actions. 

Before I even met them, my girlfriend ""Annie"" told me about her childhood. Her dad is absent and her mom is flighty and emotionally immature, so she was parentified at a young age. Some examples include her mom being completely unable to take constructive criticism; if Annie ever tries to stick up for herself, her mom's response is ""Well I'm just the worst mom in the world I guess"" and self-deprecates to the point where it turns into Annie comforting her. Her mom has a strained relationship with Annie's brother and frequently makes her mediate between the two of them. Her mom has struggled with depression her whole life, and while I feel compassion towards her, that does not excuse instances from Annie's childhood where her mom would talk to her kids about how she wanted to kill herself. 

Other things include her parents having a fake service dog vest so they can take their dog anywhere, something I think is highly unethical (and I think against the law in some places). This is more of a minor gripe, but they also go through tens of plastic water bottles a week because it's ""more convenient"" than tap water (which literally makes no sense to me). On top of that, they do not recycle even though their town has recycling. 

I know she agrees with me on a lot of this, but at the end of the day it's her family and she loves them, I can tell she really wants me to like them and I don't want to hurt her so I am hesitant to say anything, but we have talked about getting married, and I am not thrilled at the idea of these people being my in-laws.

"People enjoy my company but are too busy for me.

When I was a kid, my mother cut off contact with most or my family members, because she creates alot of conflicts, but cannot ever resolve it. Instead she shuts people out of her life and by extension (back then) out of mine.
There is no abuse or anything at play in these rifts, always just verbal disagreement a mature adult should be able to resolve.

I never met my father until today. My mother cut off aunts, uncles, cousin, grandparents - it was just my brother, sister, her, and I.

She wasn't and still isn't a very attentative person either, so I was a very lonely kid. If I told her about problems I had she usually didn't have time right then and if she asked a week or so later what was wrong, I had usually figured things out myself. Overall she's chaos and I stay way from her most of the year to keep my mental health in check.

As an adult, I rekindled alot of these relationships with cousins, grandparents, uncles etc.
They pretty far away so we sporadically keep in touch. All of them told me how sad they felt that they could no longer see me when my mother cut them off. They are genuinly sorry about the time we missed.
They are kind and take time when I really need them, but they all have very full and busy lives leading companies etc. and wouldn't reach out by themselves or would forget to answer sometimes until I follow up on them.

I do have very good friends these days so most of the time I'm very stable, but sometimes my mind spirals. I am not lonely, but I am used to a pattern of abandonment and not having my emotional needs met and I carry that hurt and neglect into romantic relationships and attach very insecurely. It makes me feel like I am unlikeable, though rationally I know that the fact that I have friends proofs the contrary. It's gotten better, but it almost feel like as long as this is the relationship that I have with my family, I won't be able to overcome this.

I chose not to spend Christmas with my mother and siblings, this year and instead take time to think about how I get out of this way of thinking.

"No I’m not writing this to “flex” or because I’m proud. I’m just confused. 

I’m an 18yr old female. 

Growing up, I’ve always felt some sort of hatred towards women, not with the way they look, but just with the way they are. I’m a women myself so I don’t understand why I feel this way. From what I can remember, I’ve liked girls since preschool, but I only had a sexual appeal to them. I was raped when I was 3 and multiple times after that by the same person and even more people. Men and women. Even tho it hurt, and I would cry, and god I hated the people who did it, I always had the urge to hump something or someone. I know I felt pleasure but I remember not feeling anything emotionally. I wasn’t happy or mad or ashamed, I kinda just blanked out. But I remember just wanting to see so many people naked, and just feeling like I wanted to have sex with them. This is all so confusing for me but it was even more confusing to me when I was kid. I didn’t know what the word pleasure was, or all these terms, so to use them while I describe younger me feels very strange. Since then, I’ve always felt some sort of rage against women. I cant stand when they speak, I cant stand them trying to encourage women, I cant stand feminism, I cant stand “women supporting women”, I cant stand them winning awards, I cant stand them in politics. I’ve felt this way for such a long time. I know it’s not right but at the same time I don’t care enough to change the way I think about women. I just want to know why I feel this way, why this happened. I was also never happy being a woman. I’ve always hated it. I still hate it so much. I don’t know if this could’ve been prevented if my parents would’ve been better. Maybe if my mom would’ve introduced proper anatomy terms and girl related terms instead of making up childish words for them, I could’ve been fine with talking about womenly topics. One time, my mom beat the shit out of me in 5th grade because she mentioned something about periods and it made chills run down my back and I felt so uncomfortable talking about it. I don’t know if abuse was the proper response to that. I still have a hard time saying vagina and period but I don’t get bothered anymore by hearing other people say it. I’m 18 now and I hear those words and even more because I have Sex Ed in school everyday. Since middle school I’ve always considered myself to be bisexual but since then I feel like I prefer to date men over women. I have always felt sexually attracted to both but never emotionally attracted to both. I also really want to have biological healthy children so I can only see myself being in a long term relationship with a man when I get older. As of right now I don’t think dating a woman would be so bad but at the same time I don’t get along with a lot of women to be in a relationship in the first place. I rather just have sex with a woman but I kinda wish they would shut up. I’ve been emotionally attracted to some women before tho. There was one girl in my class last year that was a friend of a friend, me and her got along really well, she was stunning, had a good attitude, and she really wasn’t like the other girls in our school. But then one day I went to work and found out that one of my coworkers started dating her. My coworker was so happy and couldn’t stop telling everyone, she was fan girling, she was bouncing off walls. I didn’t expect their relationship. Mainly because I knew they had only been friends for almost 2 months before that. My coworker and I never got along. I don’t work with her anymore but I can’t call her a friend so I’ll stick to “coworker”. We’ve known eachother since we were children. She’s always been this psycho, attention seeking, nasty, disrespectful girl. I didn’t expect my crush to date someone like her. I never planned on dating her nor did I have a chance. I just wanted her to stay single so I could admire her. After I found out they started dating, I stop liking her since I knew what type of people she liked and also to respect their relationship. This school year, I became really close with someone I had a casual friendship with last year. I’ve gotten to know a lot about her and holy fuck she’s perfect. We share the same beliefs, we both don’t like being around people, we rather spend time alone but we also like being together. We also don’t give a shit about other people, we only care for the ones we love. I don’t think I LIKE like her but I admire her so much. If she wasn’t straight I probably would date her. I do love her but I think it’s just in a bestfriend way. She’s really the only person I get along with. Besides that, I’ve had a hard time liking women emotionally. It isn’t an issue when it comes to men. They can be as nasty as they want and talk about stupid shit and fuck I just find them so attractive. Currently I’m desperately in love with one of my guy friends, we were talking but things kinda ended since we’re both dealing with a lot of shit. My minds all over the place but it had me thinking about how I haven’t dated a girl and I don’t think I ever will because I know I’ll be the issue in the relationship. Is it possible that I’m just straight now? It sounds stupid to say that but being bisexual and not being emotionally attracted to women apparently isn’t accepted. I know you can’t just become gay but with how things are going and with my mindset, I might just become straight I guess.

"I'm just here to tell you about my situation and to get it off my chest because I'm simply drowning myself by not talking about it properly with someone. I am a 23 year old girl (Non-American), a psychology student about to enter my senior year of undergrad. I also joined a scholarship program which helps students with financial needs. Everything was normal, until I was notified by phone that the amount of my scholarship for this half of the year has been withdrawn (90 dollars, which may not be much for you Americans but in my country it is enough to start the university semester and also with the payment of transportation since I leave classes at 9:00 PM when there is no public transportation). The question here is that I did not withdraw the money and much less my mother who is the only person who also knew that I was part of the program and who is the only one who has the information about how to access the scholarship money. I have the suspicion that it has been someone who works for the program who has stolen my information and I have told the people in charge of the program and they have opened an investigation and the bank as well, but that does not give me back my 90 dollars, that does not take away the enormous weight I feel having been fired from my job after cutbacks, the stress of the last year that comes with force, being a burden to my family and now simply some malicious person has stolen my only student support has broken me completely.

"A few months ago I became hypersexual and more sensitive to my wife’s needs and emotions.  While this has been a surprising but welcome change in our sex life, I am a little concerned.  Could a brain tumor be the cause of this?  We are talking going from being a typical apathetic jerk off to super attentive guy.  My wife and I had a dead bedroom for almost 4 years ( 11 years married) up until a few months ago.

"It's my bf's birthday today. We had originally planned to go out for a meal along with our son. This afternoon he tells me that he's been feeling stressed and low emotionally. He does tend to get a bit low around Christmas. So he wasn't sure if he wanted to go out for a meal. Which was fine I just said that we can do something at a later date when he's feeling up to it, if he decides that he doesn't want to go today just let me know.

He called me about 2/3 hours after that conversation saying that he didn't want to go out for meal. Only then to tell me that this afternoon he had a message from his daughter (She's from a previous relationship, he's only just started having contact with her) she asked him if he wanted to meet her to go out for a drink. So he spent the afternoon with her then he took her to starbucks and had hot chocolate and cake as her birthday treat to him.

His daughter is late teens and he's only been back in contact with her for a month or two. She's not been interested in contact with him until now. We've been together 10 years and I know in that time alone he's attempted contact multiple times.

I feel bad for being annoyed with him on his birthday and I know if I say anything it will cause an arguement. But he'd already made plans for his birthday with me and our son. He's cancelled last minute on me and our son but decided to take his daughter up on her last minute offer after she messaged him today.

It's pissed me off. It feels like he's ditched us and our plans for her last minute offer.
I know I'll look like the arsehole if I say anything but it's made me angry to the point of I have nothing decent to say to him and honestly don't want to be around him right now.","Feel like I'm the bad guy, need to rant.",18olkjj,1703269783.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18olkjj/feel_like_im_the_bad_guy_need_to_rant/,

"I went to this bar tonight and this experience really didn’t sit well with me. The bartender asked me if I wanted a drink. I started telling him about some of the different drinks I’ve had and if he could recommend or make me something like what I had. He said he couldn’t hear me and he was demanding that I speak up so I got louder. Then he was like ok well out of those drinks which one do you want. I said I guess a (insert drink name). He then told me the price. I told him I can’t find my card so can I do Apple Pay. He seemed upset about that and he asked if I was closing my tab and he seemed upset about that too.
Honestly I don’t drink a lot and the way he was talking to me made me not wanna be up there at the bar. Everything he said was with this angry kinda sarcastic tone. When I was getting my Apple Pay ready he was like “goddamn it man hurry up.” It took me like a minute but he was like I got other customers. 

So it was my mistake cause I handed him the phone even though it wasn’t on the Apple Pay screen cause I got nervous cause he was rushing me and he got more frustrated.
I don’t know if he already didn’t like me cause I go to that bar a lot and I rarely buy drinks. I mostly just go to meet women or hangout with friends.

"At my workplace, I'm the weekend guy. I work Fri-Mon while everyone else works Mon-Fri. So I guess, technically since I'm the only person who works 2 out of 7 days a week, I guess that would make me sort of a manager. 

Anyways, they've been talking about arranging a holiday party for the last 2 months and the suggestions have been all over the board. We could do this, could do that, could go here, could have it right at the depot. So all this indecision certainly muddied the information of where this party was going to be. But I did know a time. Wednesday. Everyone gets a half day, meet up at the depot, and then off to the party. 

So Wednesday comes and being the only employee not working that day, I show up to the depot at the given time. The place is dark. All the work trucks are gone, and there's no sign of where everyone went. Now the depot has two divisions, the service team, and the drivers. The drivers are having their little party separate from ours and they at least had their party figured out. A bowling alley not far from the depot. So I swing by.

I see familiar vehicles from drivers parked there, but I know that wherever this party is, there's going to be a fleet of our trucks out front. So the service party is not here and it would feel wrong to crash this party. 

Now I realize I could have called someone and gotten the info, but it's kind of an awkward social interaction that I don't care to have. ""You mean no one told you where the party was?"" In my mind, it's much more comfortable to be too cool or busy to go to the party versus ""Wait, we left you out of this? Forgot about you."" The cursed thoughts of the socially awkward.

...Plus, it's a work party...can anyone really, honestly tell me they want to find an excuse to spend their off day at work? In the end, yes, it felt socially awkward, and I didn't care enough about it to make a big deal about it. I just went home and continued with my actual preparations for the upcoming holiday.

Today at work my boss asked why I didn't come to the party. Was I too cool to hang out with the rest of the team? I swallowed the outburst I could have said that would have again made things awkward and just created a bullshit generic excuse that I was busy with other things to get ready for the holiday.

"This happened maybe a year or so ago. I just had my usual doctors checkup and after all the tests were done, I was told I have diabetes. Diabetes runs in my family, and I am a pretty big gal, so I wasnt too surprised but I was still a bit in shock. I didn’t really know what to do or how to feel.

  While heading home I was struggling with what to do or how this could affect my life. I decided I wanted to try and get healthier and cook more for myself and possibly my family as well. When I finally got home I was planning on starting off with I have diabetes and because he has goat, I should probably change our diets to be healthier.

  So I went up to him while he was playing with our dog and told him, trying to hold back my tears. He just looked at me, then laughed. He told me he wasn’t surprised either, then laughed again. I didnt know how to react so I mostly went quiet and when I got to my room, I just sobbed into my pillow. 

A year later, our relationship has become strained. Ever since that day I stayed to myself, I spoke to him less, I asked and did less for him. It hurts because I was always a daddys girl, out of all my siblings he was closest with me. Im not blind, I know he is also flawed and not perfect just because hes my dad. But that day made me see him in a completely different light and honestly? Ive never been able to forgive him. The second he laughed at me I just subconsciously decided to ignore the diabetes. I didn’t change my lifestyle or diet too much. I never even tried doing research on how to help myself.

" I was ugly until I turned 19 or so and now at 35 I’m experiencing it again. Having been both ugly and attractive I’ve seen both sides of it and I don’t like this side of it. It’s like I don’t even *exist* to men. Watching pretty girls get numbers, DMs on insta and people constantly trying to get their attention is decimating my self esteem. At this age it’s abundantly clear that attractive women get treated a lot more like human beings. I’ve always been of the mind that looks shouldn’t be the most important thing and that I shouldn’t have to wear makeup and a perfect outfit every time I leave the house but reality has shattered that idealism and caused deep, deep depression. Guys seem to only care about women’s looks and I’m so socially anxious because I know I’m getting judged on my appearance that I tend not to be too open or bubbly. I feel like I don’t even count as a woman to others if I don’t put in serious and constant effort to appear physically attractive. I do wear makeup and dress well but don’t care that much about fashion or hairstyles because that just isn’t part of my personality. I’m also naturally introverted and people seem to only like girls who are bubbly and open.

 As a server it’s worse. The attractive servers definitely get better tips on average. My boss is nearly fifty but men are obsessed with her because she’s very thin and when they come in and see me instead of her I can see the look of dissapointment and avoidance on their faces. Not only am I not attractive, I’m sort of dumb. None of the money making modern jobs appeal to me in the slightest. I like art and history and language not engineering and programming and numbers. Office work would probably make me suicidal so to top it all off, I’m also too poor for plastic surgery.

 I am six feet tall, very fair skinned and I have hooded eyes. I’m not obese but I’m not obviously super thin either. I’m a size 10. My teeth aren’t obviously crooked but are off center and I don’t have a super wide smile and I don’t have thousands of dollars to spend to fix them.

 I just honestly don’t see the point in going on because I’m obviously of no value to society. People don’t hit on me at all and no one ever asks me to just hang out even as friends.

 It’s not that I need the attention so much as it’s affirming to one’s self esteem. If I’m not getting hit on at all it’s pretty obvious that I’m not attractive to anyone.",Being alive is pointless as an ugly woman,18okoo0,1703267452.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18okoo0/being_alive_is_pointless_as_an_ugly_woman/,
"Been with my Hubs for 4 years. I feel like he asks some really basic ass questions for doing life at damn near 40, but he just throws it in my face and says he doesn’t want to be berated when I answer him.  I don’t think my comments to him are berating because I would say them to anyone who asked me besides a child. I will usually give a look like “are you serious right now?” Then he insists I explain whatever it is he is asking about, so I do, and he gets upset.

Now I will say I am exhausted at the point of having to tell him everything so there is definitely a tone and exasperation. You name it he has probably asked me how to do it. 

He does the same thing with conversations. He complains that I don’t talk much, so when I do have something to say I would think he’s listening intently. 

The other week he asked how it was going at home (I’m a SAHM) I told him what was on my plate for the following day (detailed) even though I didn’t want to, I would have rather just said everything is good, but he would have been upset with that answer. After listening he stated back to me “yea that sounds like a lot, I understand”. The following day he comes home and asks me how my day was, so I say “hectic” because he already knows the details of what I had to do. He then looks at me and says “oh, why was it hectic?” I could have lost my shit. So I said, I told you yesterday all the things I had to do, all those things happened today. Then I proceeded to take a shower. When getting out of the shower he came back and said he couldn’t remember anything I told him the day before and he wanted me to tell him again. 

This isn’t the first, second, third or fourth time that this has happened. It’s a weekly occurrence at a minimum, to the point that I told him I was concerned about his memory. he then comes back to me telling me I gaslight him and that’s why he can’t remember anything, I’m driving him to the point of insanity basically. His reasoning is bc before he knew me his memory was “fine” When I ask, if that’s true why would you stay with me? All he says is well, we’re married, we made a promise we have to keep.

"Well pretty much the title. I got an internship at a place, met my coworkers and we all got along so nicely and even went out from time to time, at least that’s what I thought.

First I found out some of them went out without me all the time, which hey, totally normal this group in specific was closer to each other and they shared uni classes together. 

We always seemed to click, talked a lot and played card games whenever the work got less busy and stuff. If I’m being honest I used to consider them friends because I really did like them.

Well fast foward now, at the end of the year I was hanging out with an old friend of mine who goes to the same university as all of us, and she told me this group talked horrible things about me behind my back constantly. That I’m lazy, stupid, do everything wrong and the only reason I’m not fired it’s because our boss likes me.
It’s true me and the boss are close, as in we both had difficult upbringing and weird relationships with our mothers so she helped me a lot when it came to those matters, and we got closer. But I never thought of it giving me “a special protection” or anything of the sorts. She’s just nice to me sometimes..

I’m feeling like the most stupid person in the world, I clearly didn’t read the signs and took their friendliness at face value. I can’t help but think about all the times I’ve shared personal stuff with them and how they probably told other people or made fun of me.

"this might be a bit silly, which is why i opted to come to reddit instead of complaining to my coworkers. 

we did secret santa at the office and i’m super upset over it. i didn’t want to participate to begin with because of finances, but i work w my mom and she signed me up w/o asking and pulled for me. i got my boss, and he loves disney/marvel etc. i followed the suggestion paper very closely, and got him a limited edition scarlet witch funko pop that came with a comic and a mint condition spiderman comic from ‘98 (part 2 of “web of spiderman”) i thrifted a long time ago for myself but didn’t have room to display and figured it would go to a better home with him. 

as all my coworkers were opening their gifts, it was obvious that everyone went above and beyond. stanley’s, VS pajamas, nice candles, nail polish, lotions and blankets, etc. it was exciting to see everyone opening their things and being pleasantly surprised, and it seemed everyone put a lot of thought into their gifts as we’ve all worked with eachother for years.

i open my gift, and i can’t hide my disappointment. it was obvious my secret santa had thrown whatever their kid got for christmas into a bag and was done with it. (i’m the youngest in the office and i love cutesy things and decorating my desk, but i feel that’s different from actual kids stuff) 

they gave me “piggy paint”, a brand of toddler nail polish that is nontoxic for babies so they can put their hands in their mouth and not get sick from the polish, expired halloween candy (it still had the halloween wrapping on it- gave like 3 bags of skittles to my BF when he brought me coffee to cheer me up and he said they tasted like alcohol) and a really cute hello kitty christmas card that wasn’t filled out but i’ll probably use and give it away because it was a card.

im grateful for the candy and the card, and the piggy paint i’ll give to my friend for her goddaughter, she’s 3 so i think she’ll like it , but i can’t say i’m not upset over it. i spent so long searching for a gift , and was happy for my coworkers who seemed to do the same and receive really thoughtful gifts. i don’t want to sound greedy or something, and i guess it’s my fault for getting my hopes up in the first place. 

everyone has been excited to find out their secret santa, but i haven’t asked about mine. im terrible at playing a poker face, so i don’t think i could hide my reaction. my coworker laughed when i showed her the nail polish and asked if i pissed someone off and they were calling me childish.

"I’m so heartbroken. I feel like I will never heal.

My husband and I have been together for over 8 years. For the vast majority of this, he had been cheating on me with his ex and practically every other female he ever encountered. We have 2 kids together and I have one from a prior relationship but he’s pretty much been her dad since her father is deceased. 
I hate that the only information and details provided to me are the ones I’ve discovered, then told I found everything, only to find more later. I am so angry that everyone else knew including his family and friends, but no one cared, and I looked like an absolute idiot. I am upset that this is all blamed on being an avoidant. I am very sad that I was so excited to finally have a family-in-law because I was an only child… to find that they’ve only ever hated me and spited me every chance they got and I’m not sure why. I am absolutely heartbroken that the one person in the world I gave my trust to…. Abused it from day 1 of meeting. I feel so used. Alone. I feel broken. So broken that I can’t put myself back together, even though I’ve been trying for over 2 years, despite therapy… which….even my therapists gave up on me. My heart hurts terribly most days. So much so that it feels like I’m actually dying. And then to find out, tell him to stop, and he continues to do it… even if he isn’t now…. like why am I good enough for no one? My own parents didn’t even want me. My dad blames me for all his problems in life even though I haven’t lived with him or asked him for anything in 17 years. My mom just left me with my dad one day and never came to get me. Now my own husband doesn’t even want me. What is wrong with me? 
Why am I not deserving of love? Respect? I feel like I tried so hard to be my best for him because I loved him so much. More than anything. For the first time in my life I felt happy, but none of it was real. How do you tell someone you love them while keeping your ex around, and many other women, despite your gf/wife telling you that she doesn’t feel comfortable with you being in contact? And then say you won’t, but continue to do it for years? Of course it’s because I’m not worth anything of value. To anyone. 

Continuing to live every day is an extreme challenge and it only gets worse as days go by.  I just look back on every memory… every event/milestone… and it was all a lie. Those times we talked about certain things… he was really thinking of her. Like trying to have me be her or something, and I’m mortified thinking about it. Being present for her while I’m having our kids. Spending time with/on her, while neglecting me. When all I wanted was my husband and someone to share experiences with… he didn’t. Always putting his friends before me because I’m disposable and don’t matter. I’m just someone to have sex with when he wants and someone to cook and clean, pay the bills, he works too but I make more. I’m the one to work two jobs. The realization that he NEVER wanted me and was using me and that he just felt okay lying to me sucks the most.

I ignored some red flags because I had been out of the dating world for so long/almost my whole adult life that I just didn’t know they were red flags. Which I hate myself for, now. 

I literally don’t think I can take this pain anymore and I would much rather just be done. For good. Every day it’s just suffering and a daily, minute-by-minute reminder that I’ve never been good enough for anyone and I never will be. I’m not interesting, pretty, smart, funny, quirky, or sociable. I’m good for working and cleaning though. I guess that’s all I amount to. And it’s a sad life. So who could ever love me? Who would want to spend time with me? Why would they? 

I’ve never felt so alone. I have no one to talk to. I have no friends. I have no one who I can trust to tell anything to. I never have. The one person I should have been able to trust, let me down, so unexpectedly and repeatedly. I feel so stupid bc I sound like a teenager who went through their first breakup. But this is just torment at this point and I’d rather just be dead so I don’t have to feel this anymore and my kids won’t have to have a memory of their broken mom who couldn’t function sometimes because the heartache was too much for her  to bear. I feel like such a burden. 

I’ve put plenty of thought into it before. And it never changes. I want to be done. Life has never been good to me; it’s always been a struggle, so what’s the point in continuing on. I don’t have any good memories at this point and the ones I thought were good, were all lies. The births of my kids will forever be tainted with the knowledge of them talking/messaging while I was in labor and delivering them. If he wanted her so badly he never should have stayed with me and had kids together. Why do this to someone? It feels so cruel. I’ve lost so many nights of sleep to crying, thoughts about everything and trying to make sense of it all. 

After all this and I still want nothing more than to sleep next to him at night, to be able to love my husband, but I can’t because it was never, not for one day, real. I’m trying to keep the boundary that we can’t be together ever again… but it is so hard. Like wtf is wrong with me. Why am I like this? I hate myself for being like this.

"I had sex with my best friend last night and I don’t know how to feel…
I just got out of a relationship a few months ago and have not moved on or healed in any way, I don’t talk to anyone or even look at woman thinking about dating… 
I’ve been friends with this other girl since freshman year of high school and that was almost 7 years ago. I’ve never really been physically attracted to her but we’ve always got along well… also just so y’all know me and my ex were in a no contact kinda thing, I hadn’t heard from her in a few months but it’s near Christmas and I did send her some gifts praying she’d text me again …
Anyway, I travel for work and me my best friend have been FaceTiming lately almost every night, I looked at it as close friends just talking.
She looked at it as way more than that.
Well I was home this weekend for Christmas and I went to see her not knowing any of the feelings she had and while we’re hanging out my ex texted me thanking me for the gifts and my friend saw it and didn’t say anything.
We’d been hanging out for about an hour when my ex eventually called me.. long story short I ended up leaving to FaceTime my ex because I do still miss her and I’m still so in love with her.
While on the phone with my ex my friend confessed her feelings and said when I left she was so hurt and was bawling, I gotta say I really did not see it coming. I know I’m stupid but it just smacked me in the face. 
After I got off FaceTime with my ex, my friend messaged me asking to come see me… 
I said yes. One thing led to another and we did the deed and then slept in. When she woke up she literally said she thinks we’re soul mates and in my head I was like wow wow wow slow tf down… I was in such shock because I knew she was already to attached.
In high school we said Said if we’re both single after so many years we’ll get married and she was serious. I didn’t even remember we said that until she brought it up.
And  honestly it was such passionate sex and I feel like we were both so desperate… I knew it was wrong but I have no idea what to do.

"This is such a silly confession, but I'm just so happy about it, I wanna share it somewhere. 
I'm not the best baker. I was just about to text my friends to gloat that I finally managed to figure out how to make pretty good muffins after a week of trying different batches: now I can make them for our dinner that we have scheduled for next week. I then remembered the small detail that the muffins were supposed to be a surprise. 
See, since there's three of us, doing a secret Santa didn't make much sense, so we decided to buy two little, low budget presents each. I found some cute fuzzy socks that are folded and boxed to look like cupcakes and I thought it'd be funny to also bring muffins to go along with the presents. I've been on an (unsuccessful) job hunt for a while, so I thought I'd save some money and make them myself, and honestly? The small, silly accomplishment of setting my mind on something and figuring out how to do it cheered me up a little more that I'd like to admit, after facing quite a bit of rejection lately.

"After one of my biggest achievements, I just need to digest some of I’ve been through.

I grew up in my grandma's cozy house—small, but full of charm with furniture so old I’ve found similar pieces in museums. Now, I'm convinced that when I have my own place, I want it to feel just as warm and welcoming as Grandma's. Maybe even steal some of her stuff;). I was a happy child.

At 11, I moved to the U.S, living in a hotel until we found an affordable place. My first friend an unlikely one one – the friendly custodian who smiled at us as we ate the less than ideal hotel food before school.

Middle school was hell. I could barely hold a conversation in English. I was mocked and bullied, physically and verbally. Despite this, I somehow still got good grades. I missed so many days in 8th grade trying to escape the bullying I got sent a letter that if I missed one more day I was at risk of repeating the grade, despite keeping straight A’s. 

Obviously, I fell into depression. Throughout middle school, I wasn’t a person, I was a shell. Yet when my parents saw me unable to get out of bed and go out, all they saw was a brat. They never asked what was wrong. I do not fully blame them now, they were and still are working two jobs just so we can eat.

I did better in high school. I learned the school system on my own. I went from being unable to talk in English to winning state and later national writing competitions. Twice.

I work as an intern in a museum where I teach kids about science. I do not get paid, but I love it. Actually, when one of my kids found out I didn’t get paid she told me she’d tell her mom to give me a job because she works for the city. Kids are the cutest, aren’t they?

Driven by the memory of my grandfather lost to addiction, I immersed myself in neuroscience. I write about drugs and their impact for a nonprofit that works to prevent teenage drug addiction. One day a student I didn’t know approached me and told me how one of my articles had eased her struggle with drugs, making her feel less judged. Guys, I have made an impact! And how many people’s lives I’ve touched in a way I haven’t even heard of? Isn’t this so beautiful? I want to continue doing this!

So, I hope you understand that I've poured everything I have into keeping up with my peers, despite starting the race later. I've tried relentlessly, done everything within my power, and yet.

I got accepted into one of the best universities in the world, one you’ve likely heard of. However, joy turned to heartbreak as the financial aid letter revealed a $50k/year cost. 

I just have $4,000 I’ve gathered from scholarships due to the writing I do. It’s so fucked up, but my grandmother wants me to inherit her house. I thought maybe I could sell it… 

I cried for hours. I am at a loss. I want to go. Please don’t tell me to go to community college. Don’t tell me to go to the cheap option. Please don’t break my heart more than it already is broken. I don’t want to go to the cheaper option, I deserve it just like the rich kids do.",Got accepted into one of the best universities in the world… I can’t pay it.,18oj4c7,1703263301.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18oj4c7/got_accepted_into_one_of_the_best_universities_in/,
"This really does need to get off my chest! 

My dreams of Christmas as a child were of a pretty low standard. To put it bluntly, I was raised in an extremely abusive household by alcoholics so Christmas mostly felt like any other day. If 1 thing went ever so slightly wrong it would set them off big time. Quite often, the neighbourhood children’s houses would be fully decorated and they’d invite us over sometimes to play (they felt bad for us mostly) and I would always be in awe of the general atmosphere I felt there. 

As I was sipping my coffee in the kitchen looking out of the window into the car park I suddenly realised….. I did it. I’m standing in the kitchen of a clean home I rent, it’s warm inside, paw patrol the movie is on our tv with both kids watching in fascination (their first movie) with the lights dimmed like a movie theatre, candles are light, the bathroom smells so fresh and the entire home smells of freshly cooked food! 

I have great aspirations for Christmas as the kids get older but I’m just so happy that I finally  came to the realisation that I AM better than my mother. The words she said to me day in day out aren’t manipulating the way I think anymore! I’ve come so far in terms of my own growth!

My plan now is to just forgive and forget because I want to set a good example for my kids. I will always approach with caution and I will never trust her but I will not hold a grudge against her anymore. I want to be the bigger person and really grow and change my morals/values.  Holding grudges gets me nowhere, I want to learn to be humble, forgiving and accepting - these will be my New Year’s resolutions!

"I don't like my BIL and SIL. There I have said it.
My BIL is nice but he acts like he knows better and can do anything. His wife thinks she's god's gift to humanity. She thinks very highly of herself yet hasn't achieved much in her life to back this up, IMO.

"(posting one more time due to some issues) Planning to post this on an anonymous account; unsure if she uses Reddit. Won't use our native language; I'll go with English. Let's call her Céline.

**CHILDHOOD**

We were each other's first lovers. I was 12 and she was 11 when we started dating. Childhood love, but special. Saw her in the first week of school; still remember the very first time. She was the most beautiful girl. Love at first sight for me. Got shy and escaped so she wouldn't see me. Couldn't find out who she was for weeks.

Now, let me talk about one of the side characters. Let's call her Daria. My mother’s best friend's daughter, and they would come over all the time, so Daria and I were close, but I had no feelings for her. Found out she was in love with me later. Daria and Céline were besties, but I didn't know about this. One day, Daria asked if I had a crush on anyone, and I talked about Céline without knowing her name; I was basically describing her appearance. Daria ended up screaming, ""ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CELINE?"" I didn't know her name was Céline, so I said I don't know, but then she started talking about setting her up for me (poor girl; she tried gaining my heart by setting up her bestie), and I said okay.

After some time, we started sending each other letters through Daria, or we'd drop them at our school closets. I wish I'd kept and hid all of them somewhere in my room; it's one of my biggest regrets. Those letters gave me butterflies back then; we were dating but had never met alone. We'd meet in the shelter of our school, and there would be Daria and one of my other friends with us. We'd talk for a few minutes before one of us would get shy and run away. We were like this for months, talking through Daria. Céline would give her questions, and Daria would ask them to me. Later, our teachers were annoyed by our relationship, and her father found out about us. We had to end it. She then changed schools, and I didn't see her again for a really long time. But girl, I still get butterflies and smile whenever I think about our past. I was madly in love with you. Well, the funny thing is, we probably didn't talk to each other for more than 10 minutes in total face-to-face; we weren't messaging or anything either, but we were dumbly in love with each other.

**The First Time I Saw Her After 2 Years**

Taking private lessons from a teacher (let’s call him Jack) for my science class; turns out she takes lessons from the same teacher too. One day I went to Jack’s place, but there was someone in the room before me, so I had to wait for my turn. Then Jack came out of the room with a girl; it took me a few seconds to realize it was Céline. I was like, ""WHAT THE HECK IS SHE DOING HERE?"" and panicked. She called me “hi brother Jesse” (gonna be calling myself Jesse). She called me brother; we use brother for someone who is older than us in my country.. Some sort of a respect thing. It had a shocking effect on me. She did it so that Jack wouldn't understand the thing between us. But then he started smirking at me, “Jesseeee… who is thaaatt??” I didn't tell him anything, but he figured it out AHHAAHAH; he then made fun of me for the rest of the year. It was truly embarrassing.

**The First Time We Talked for a Few Days**

I don't exactly remember when we did this, but it was probably 5 years ago, not really sure. Was still in contact with Daria, I asked her if Céline had an Instagram account. She had one, but not many followers or none at all. I texted her, and she showed interest in my hobbies. Bro, it was the first time someone didn't make fun of my interests and hobbies. Felt good, but one day I woke up and couldn't find her account again. No idea why, but I guess she didn't want to keep talking to me.

**Running Across Each Other for the First Time After 4 Long Years of Not Seeing Each Other**

This happened last year. On my way to the gym after school, and she was returning home from school. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her; I started smiling and laughing and kind of screamed, “Céline?! WHAT’S UP?” She smiled and got a little shocked too, but we didn't talk that much; it took a few seconds lol. We probably got really shy. She was as beautiful as my kid version remembered.

**Accidentally Finding Her Spotify**

Used to be a weirdo who would stalk people’s Spotify accounts and make fun of their taste in music for my joy. Well, one day I accidentally found an account named “C” I knew it was her because I found the account on one of her friends’ accounts. So I followed her. MAN, SHE HAD THE BEST TASTE IN MUSIC EVER. It was my first time seeing a metalhead weirdo like me. We live in a rather small city, so. She listens to other genres as well, and I listen to them too. It felt like I found my soulmate, but I didn't know if she had a social account (I was no longer in contact with Daria so couldn't ask her), but then she put a different name on her Spotify, which made me think it was someone else, so I unfollowed her. Later, I found out she found my account and followed me again just after a few hours. Man… that was so hot ngl AHAHAHAH I was pretty sure it was her after that.

**Falling in Love Again**

We ran across each other again a few months ago. I was talking to a friend outside, then I saw Céline. I got so happy; I don't know how to explain the feeling I had when I saw her. I was like “HEY CELINE!!” Oh man, the way she smiled at me when she saw me; we had a small talk, and that’s when I asked if that Spotify belonged to her, and the answer was yes. I tried finding her Insta for almost 3 weeks; during this time, I was thinking about our past, what kind of a person she might’ve turned into now, blah blah. We had a similar taste in music, so I thought she’d be the female version of me (which I was right about). I sent requests to some accounts I found on her school’s Insta account. They were accounts that had movie characters on their profile picture and had cool names. Turns out none of them were Céline. I ended up asking a really old friend from middle school, she luckily knew her account. I sent her a request, but she didn't do anything.

I wanted to text her so bad, so I thought about talking to her through Spotify playlists. I made a playlist for her; she noticed it right away, made a playlist as a reply. She would name them things like “to my literally first lover” “first love never dies.” I WAS SO HAPPY; we talked like this for 4 days. It was straight out of a movie. Literally what I was hoping to find my whole life. A love out of a novel. She then gave her number through a playlist. I texted her, and you know, people have talking stages; that didn't happen. We started talking like lovers of 8 years instead of not talking to each other for 8 years. She was literally the female version of me. She’s an INFJ, and I’m an INFP, so we got along really well. We talked until late hours that day, I stayed up late for the first time. It felt like I finally found the love of my life. The next day we met, I wasn't expecting this, but she hugged me right after seeing me. This made me so happy. I felt so comfortable being with her, she felt like ""home"" that night, like a ""safe place"" We weren't shy at all, we were really comfortable. Didn't struggle to talk at all. Actually, WE TALKED FOR HOURS WITHOUT SHUTTING UP FOR A SINGLE MOMENT. It was like we never broke up, we knew everything about each other. My lifelong friends never made me feel this way; I never had this kind of fun with anyone before. We then sat somewhere and kept talking. We randomly held eye contact for some time, and then I asked her if she’d like to hug. We started cuddling afterwards. It was my first time cuddling with someone. I'm a guy who waits for the right person to do these things, and I was sure she was the one. Before dropping her home, we had a long hug (I wish I could take the time back to this exact moment). I just miss the smell of her hair and feeling her close to me so much... I miss my safe place.

After I got back home, I think I kind of rushed things; I literally told her that I love her. The next day she told me things went too fast, and she feels really uncomfortable. I tried changing her mind, but nothing had worked, so I respected her decision. She then removed me on Insta, later on Spotify. Dumb me; I asked her why. Like, just let her go; she has all the right to remove you. We then started running across each other almost every day. I really have no idea how this was happening. I'm an atheist who makes fun of people who believe in these things, but even I started thinking the universe was sending us a message. Sometimes I would change my way before she saw me to not disturb her. She'd smile when she saw me too. Oh god I miss her smile more than anything... I couldn't take it anymore and stopped going outside. I wanted to go out for the first time after 3 weeks and saw her again; she looked tired, so I messaged her how she feels and all, she replied a week later. We randomly started talking again. It was so much fun, we talked as if we had never stopped talking. I then couldn't resist and told her that I can't forget about her. She was really kind to me while explaining her reasons; she wanted me to be happy too. It’s been a few weeks since we had that conversation.

I made a playlist a few days ago; she made a similar playlist after a few hours, had the same song on top, it was full of French songs, named ""Before Sunrise"" and all. I couldn't resist again and asked her if it was for me. Also asked if she doesn't know what she wants and that is she trying to make me not forget about her. I didn't think this would get her angry, dumb me; it was really disrespectful of me. She wrote long messages about how she doesn't try to make me upset; she doesn't have any bad intentions and all, and she is totally right. But I never thought that she tries to hurt me; really, I never thought anything bad about her. She could make me cry for days, and I wouldn't say a single thing bad about her. I think she accepted my apology; I'm not sure, but of course, we won't keep talking. I just don't want her to hate me; I will never be texting her again. For my own good and hers. Seems like the playlists were just a coincidence :/ I think I hurt her today, and I hate myself for this. She blocked me on Spoitfy... How could I do this to her? How could I hurt such kind soul like her? I will never forgive myself for this.

**My Thoughts About Céline**

She is probably one of the most special people for me; she is my first love. I had never totally forgotten about her. A few years ago, I realized that throughout my whole life, I was either trying to find someone who looked like her or had the same name as her. Like my type in women is the same as she looks. None of these were intentional. I’ve always wondered how she was doing my whole life. There was a point when I was thinking about naming my daughter Céline in the future. Which would be very disrespectful towards my partner, so nope, I'm not gonna be doing this.

**To Céline**

Maybe you have some traumas from your past relationships; I really don't know. Maybe that was the reason why you got scared when I cared about you. Maybe it’s a different reason; I have no idea. But I know that you're not psychologically feeling well. I was ready to do anything to make you feel better. We could’ve gone through these hard times together. I would never judge you about anything you do, I’d be your biggest support. We both understand each other and our relationship would be the most beautiful thing ever. Sometimes I can’t stop wishing you gave this a chance but I also know that you need time on your own lately. I only want you to be happy that’s all I want so please don’t think that you hurt me by rejecting me. I’ll be happier than ever if I see you smiling :) I’ve never stopped loving you ever since our childhood, and this is why I still couldn't forget about those 2 days we spent together. I would’ve given my life for you; I’d still do it without hesitating. I guess there’s nothing else I can do but to respect your decision, but I just can't stop thinking about you. I just can't do it. I don't want to do it. You’re the first person who showed me what love is. I was so ready to make you the happiest girl in the world. Sometimes I can't stop thinking if it would be wrong to get you that Will Graham clock or Tamino record for your birthday. I'm probably not gonna do it. We sometimes talk for a few days once every few years, just like in the Before Trilogy. Maybe we'll talk again in 4 years, who knows? I couldn't stop smiling while writing our memories, I’m just so happy to have someone kind an amazing like you as my first love. And now I can't stop crying knowing that I’ll never be able to give you a love like in the movies, a love that you deserve. I always go to that place we cuddled; I sit there for hours without doing anything; it reminds me of you, and I can't stop it. Yes I’m in depression for months, feeling like a piece of shit but I truly don’t care if you’re not gonna be comfortable with me. If you ever return one day, I will be prepared to offer you a love that surpasses any experience in life. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, with the kindest soul and exceptional understanding. I’m so proud of you for keep trying your best in life too!! You’re the strongest person I know. Thank you so much for the memories you gave me. You’ll be a story that I tell my grandchildren. My love for you exceeds everything, Céline. I will always cherish you as my first love.

"I (28f) have always wanted to be a mother. I never had any other life goals than the get married and have at least one baby by the age of 25. It was the only thing I have truly ever wanted in life. 

I never made that goal by 25 but I did get married recently. My husband (30m) has always wanted to be a dad so at the beginning of this year I stopped taking my birth control. As the months went on, I slowly started feeling more and more discouraged. The world around my is collapsing, nothing is affordable, schools are basically trash now because of virtually zero funding, workplaces are becoming more and more anti-parent so they prioritize the company over giving parents enough time (or money) to be with their child and there’s no assistance for finding daycare (adding to the fact that most daycare places cost more than a mortgage per month). The United States of america is begging for women to give birth yet does not offer any assistance during pregnancy or afterwards. 

On top of all of that, my body seems to be struggling to have a baby. Almost an entire year has gone by and my body is still not regulated. I’ve gone to doctor after doctor and they’ve told me everything is fine, but I still don’t get pregnant. And it’s not even the same every month, some months I don’t even ovulate, or when I do it’s not regular.

"I was reminded of what I used to say when I was a kid while listening to a reddit video from rSlash while I was cooking the other day and now I feel bad about it. My parents had separated when I was 3 years old and I would go to my dad's every other weekend as part of the agreement through the courts. I loved going to see my dad, would sit with him, watch TV, go on the computer and play with the dog he had. Sometimes see family and my other two older brothers (I share a mom with one, and a dad with the other two) But then, I was about 11 years, he just stopped talking to me. I would call, leave messages at his house, even at the lodge he would go to. I would get no answer or return call. I was angry, hurt, and felt abandoned so I had developed anger problems and would hit (objects, not people, or at least not hard like a slap to the arm), scream and cry when pushed too far. 

Mom knew why I was upset, as did my brothers and tried to help me. 

Because of how much I was upset with my dad, I would say that 'he could drop dead for all I care!' or 'If he dropped dead, I wouldn't cry for him'. Or even if my family (dad's side of the family) came to my work or house, to let me know that he had passed and I would just be like 'so? why should I care? The man stopped talking to ME!'

That was what I had told myself for years.

Even when I had confronted him when I was 17 I still had no love for him though I had stopped saying most of the things I'd say. Only that I wouldn't cry when he died because by then, mom remarried and I had my stepdad (still miss you) who raised me with mom. I would try to talk to him, but got fed up with being the only one to reach out so just gave up. Telling myself if he cared, he'd reach out to me.

Never did.

Was hit by a car, broke both bones in my elbow and had contacted my dad's gf (now ex as they separated years ago now) to let him know. He never called me after wards or anything.

My dad's sister died (whom I didn't really know, or know I had an aunt had to ask my mom) was the first time in years I had seen him. If it wasn't for my brother's being with me I wouldn't have known it was him as he was cleaned shaved. (dad always had a beard or moustache) After the service, I had clung close to my brother's as I didn't want to be alone with our dad, then we all ended up going to his house. Had just wanted to go home (had only slept 3 hours because of work so had to get my mom to get me, since I didn't drive) Mom and dad talked, she gave him her cell so he could have called whenever he wanted.

Never did.

Wiped out on my ebike, had bad road rash and a bad bruise on my leg (also had torn the soft tissue in my knee which didn't find till 4 years later) Posted the picture on facebook and my aunt shared and tagged my dad in the picture.

No message, no call, nothing...

Then finally on January 28th of 2022.

I was at work when my aunt tried calling my mom on facebook (she didn't have mom's number and mom had her phone on do not disturb as this was around 7am) Mom called work and needed me home and I was confused. Work wouldn't tell me what mom said, called mom and she wouldn't tell me either. So, after I grabbed her a coffee I went home and she asked me to sit down. So I do and asked what's going on.

She tells me that my dad was found dead that morning. It was suspected that he had been there for days, lying on his kitchen floor and the remains of a shattered glass near. His neighbors had seen lights left on, mail unchecked, a door left open so they called the police of their area (dad lived less than an hour from me) They suspected it was a heart attack that did it.

When I was told, I just stared at my mom and shrugged saying 'okay.' I didn't really react or anything, just got back up, went to my chiropractor appointment, picked up my game and sat in the basement for hours. I didn't play it till the next day. I should be upset yes, I wanted to be but I wasn't. I felt bad actually that I hadn't cried for my dad.

Honestly, I didn't cry till maybe a month or two later while going over all of his things. I just broke down crying and I didn't fully understand why that was. Crying for a man who I had felt abandoned me for years. My aunt told me that even though he wasn't there he still loved me and kept all the things that I had given him over the years and he just had a lot of inner demons that he couldn't face or wouldn't know how to face.

Over a year later, I'm reminded what I used to say and I feel terrible for it. Even now, I'm trying not to cry, my hands are shaking while I'm typing this. This has been bugging me since last night and I just don't know if it was something that I had somehow predicted would happen or if it was just happenstance. All I know is that I feel bad for what I said, and I know that I can't change that. It just bothers me now, and my aunt (mom's sister) was right. I just wanted to be angry, I didn't mean the things I said in anger, I just wanted something to be angry at, both before and after he passed. Though after he passed I was angry at something else.

I feel like I was a horrible daughter to him even though to a degree I had a right to be upset. Because of something I said almost 20 years ago had came true. I haven't told my family this, I don't know if I could. Mom knew that I had said that if dad died, I wouldn't cry, as did my mom's side of the family but... I just kind of feel guilty.

"There's a lot to be complained about but to keep it simple I think doctors and nurses fundamentally don't do their job. At least in the sense that their job should be to give their patients the best treatment they can to improve their quality of life.

I can't say how much is the fault if the insurance companies but I can say that most doctors and nurses I've seen have been incompetent, uninterested, and usually both.

It feels like the majority of the time I go to a doctor or nurse they either do nothing useful or they make outright bad suggestions. Some examples are when I went to the doc complaining that I most likely had covid and he dismissed me as having allergies(even though I told him clearly I knew I had covid) and then I of course had covid. I told another doctor that I had an ingrown hair but they insisted it was lime... it wasn't, good thing I refused antibiotics. And really the worst of it is with my girlfriend who has very specific health issues, partially genetic. I'm extremely well read on it and had to be the one to convince doctors of what she had after they kept dismissing it as fibromyalgia or general pain and even then they go against my suggestions and prescribe things that make her feel worse which is heart wrenching. I managed to help her by suggesting supplements and lifestyle changes but sometimes it's really helpful to have prescriptions for difficult issues. What's infuriating too is that she got much worse from all of the doctor prescriptions(many of which felt completely stupid to me like ssris) but I was able to make many improvements despite no medical training, only my own curiosity and the fact that I'm really unwilling to suggest anything I consider to be risky while doctors seem to just not care if you come back with horrible symptoms or worse.

The thing that really seals it for me though is the ego. I consider myself a good professional who knows what he's doing but if someone kindly told me that they think they have a better idea on something I'm more than willing to hear it out. And on that topic I may disagree with a customer but if he feels strongly about the service he wants I don't act like I'm his parent and he has to obey me. But with doctors all this seems to go out the window. If you so much as suggest they could be incorrect about something they immediately take it as a threat and hit you with the ""oh you think you're a doctor now"" line or something similar. Which is funny to me because if you're so confident in your ability why would you get so upset by someone stupid just making a suggestion? But this is really annoying because I want to pay for a service like absolutely anything else, but doctors seem to think they're above that and ought to make decisions for you and that you have no business questioning them about your own live. To me this is inexcusable from a profession that's supposed to be helping people.

I've also had many times where I ask from specific tests only for them to be refused or they agree and then just don't prescribe it because they're either being rude or somehow don't understand what the blood test is. It's really annoying to show up to a doctor after reading entire books on thyroid issues and they don't know literally anything besides to test TSH for example and then dismiss any concerns. This isn't a particular issue for me but I know lots of hypothyroid people that are dismissed and I had to insist to them that they beg their doctors for full testing over and over only to discover I was right... and even then they usually don't prescribe enough to make a difference

I hate to act like a know it all, it's really not the angle I'm trying for but I know some people might take it that way, I just get extremely invested in researching and testing things. But I do think doctors and nurses are not held to a reasonable standard, and when they don't know something they should be transparent about that so a patient can either work with them from the bottom or find a professional that's more suitable.

I can't say how much is just due to the pressure from pharma companies and insurance putting pressure on them. But if that's the case it again means doctors should be transparent about this, and really doctors should be in a partnership with their patients not the insurance or pharma companies.",Medical professionals are given way too much of a free pass to be terrible at their jobs.,18oiacd,1703261093.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18oiacd/medical_professionals_are_given_way_too_much_of_a/,
"Firstly, I want to apologize for any grammatical mistakes, and I understand this story is a bit lengthy. I'm an 18-year-old female who has been enduring immense suffering due to my father for most of my life. Since my birth, I can't recall a time when I haven't made a mistake and suffered physical abuse because of it. This ranges from slaps to beatings with belts or shoes and much more.  
  
I grew up and live in a Middle Eastern country where this kind of thing is unfortunately not uncommon. It's hurting me mentally and physically. Every time I voice something I don't like, disagree, or show the slightest hint of disrespect, I face physical abuse. But it has escalated to a point where my dad allows my older brother, who is two years my senior, to hit me too. Responding to him only leads to fights, ending with him hitting me.  
  
One traumatic incident that stands out is when my dad instructed my older brother to pick me up from the gym. I'm not allowed to use a taxi or Uber. As I got into the car, he began cursing me, calling me useless. I tried to ignore him, but he deliberately provoked me. When we stopped at a traffic signal, I left the car and started walking home. He drove slowly alongside, honking and yelling at me to get back in. This drew attention, and concerned people approached, asking if I knew him or if he was a stranger. I lied, saying I knew him, to avoid causing a scene. Reluctantly, I got back in, only to be punched in the face, resulting in a black eye. My dad blamed me for talking back and leaving the car, doing nothing about my injury.  
  
My only support was my mom, but she lacks power. She encouraged me to report to the police, and she took me to the hospital. At the police station, I showed them my injury, but I was discouraged from filing a report, making me feel guilty about potentially ruining my brother's life.  
  
This is just one of the many incidents, and I feel utterly destroyed inside. I'm lost and don't know what to do. To those suggesting I move to Europe or elsewhere, I'm not allowed to work, meaning I have no income. I'm financially broke and feel trapped in this cycle of suffering until I get married and sever ties, but how do I endure until then? How do I cope with my body being harmed every time I express something they don't like? I'm in dire need of advice and guidance.

"Please help. I need advice, badly. I don't know if this is a good sub for this, but I've not explored reddit much, so here I am. On mobile, sorry for errors.


Last sunday, my dad said he wanted to go out and get me a present, so he did. It's a big ass heavy box. He can barely lift it because of his knee. Couple days later we go out to run errands, and the passenger seat was reclined and there was trash for a drink neither of us like. 


I ask why the passenger seat is reclined so far back and he says he was moving it for my present. We have a wide trunk and hes used that excuse for his backpack before, and neither make sense. But whatever I let it go.


Yesterday, he had an appointment so we go to that. This is when I notice the trash in the side pocket on the door, and I'm like ""why do you not want to say who helped you, it's weird""


Then he tells me it's this girl who use to work with him and offered to help, so they met up had lunch and she helped him shop. Cool, right? 


She is barely 18. And he didn't want to tell me about it? Of course I'm going to question it. What 18 year old wants to meet up with her old boss?


Now, he says I'm reading too far into it, and sure yeah. But why couldn't he just tell me right off the bat? Instead he made it to be this big secret that he met up with an 18 year old to go shopping.


I'm not saying anything happened or will happen, I just don't think it's smart to meet up with an 18 year old in secret, no matter the context.

I know he's smarter than that, but 18 year olds aren't. And he refuses to see this from any other point of view.


This is the girl that invited him to her graduation, we got a pet from, he's driven her around when she's having a hard time.


I feel like shit about this, but it's just so weird to me that he would lie about it, even if it is just a ""white lie"".


The only time I was apprehensive about her is when he wanted me to go with to her graduation and I was hurt that he put more thought into her graduation than mine, and I explained that.


I understand I upset him, but he still took it as a slight to his character and how he can never do anything right, he can do whatever he wants he's a grown ass man, etc. 


This is what happens anytime I bring up a concern to him, even my own health. If I mention something that my mom did he brings it back to a way to pity himself and I'm left groveling on my knees trying to calm him. 


He still isn't talking to me and he won't eat. I know I messed up my phrasing and was brash, but was I right to question it?


At this point, I don't think he'll talk to me again, let alone look at me.

"As the title says I honestly believe the worst thing I’ve done in my life is tell people about my problems and depression.

It’s a commonly held belief in our age that the best thing to do when you are going through a dark period is to let it out. That telling someone how you feel can be like an escape from the bottled up feeling.

For the past 3 years I’ve been suffering from depression, I hate almost every day of my life, I wake up and I have 0 energy after spending the night sobbing, I go to the gym but I have no appetite due to a 24/7 dropping feeling in my stomach. I’m in a rut.

Before I was depressed I used to have some really cool friends I used to see every day. They where a real release for me and put a smile on my face for hours when we used to do literally anything. Some really shit things happened in my life and I told them about it, and they gave robotic “it will be alright” sayings which gave me temporary relief. But as I became more depressed and I reached out more I was cared for less - left on read days would pass before a reply, I would get left out of events and my energy draining ass eventually got fully ghosted without a single reason given.

At least before this happened the hang outs where an escape for me to temporarily forget my pains and focus on just having fun. Separating friendship and emotions was a way I could have something to look forward to on the weekend.

I came to the conclusion. Being a downer, being negative, being sad etc are traits nobody wants to be friends with. Guys don’t want to get emotional and find it uncomfortable to have a “difficult friend”.

But nevertheless after 2 years of struggle I found a new group of friends, who I was playing a character with. I pretended everything in my life was great and awesome and we had lots of fun together. But it was tiring, I wanted to just break down and cry and be heard by someone. Eventually basically the exact some thing happened. I become the special sad case nobody wants to spend time with when I started to open up. An energy vampire.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so lonely. I lost my gf recently. I lost all my friends. I lost my high paying finance job recently. I want to make friends,I want something to look forward to. At least being fake I can have some genuine laughs.

Reddit comments are just going to say my friends are bad people I guess. Maybe they are right, but I don’t blame them - these days I have nothing going for me. And trying to get new friends feels impossible out of university with no job or any existing friends.

"I don’t care if people see this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. 

I went to paramedic school the start of 2021. Went through two long years of classes, labs, and clinicals to prepare myself for my career field. I met some really awesome people while in school, people who I still keep up with today. Had some great instructors who have years of experience and was able to better prepare ourselves for the job at hand. 

During my last year of the program, my wife told me amazing news that we were having our first child! I was beyond the stars about how excited I was to be a dad, but realized how much harder my schooling was going to be juggling school, my personal life, and now being a dad. Her due date was at the start of the last semester. That was probably the hardest obstacle I’ve ever faced. 

My last semester of school was nothing but clinicals. I spent 650 hours on an ambulance (for free I might add) away from my daughter. And when it was finally over, I was so relieved to be finally done with everything. The only that stood in my way were my hands-on psychomotor test and the cognitive test. 

I knew going into my psychomotor it would be easy. Like 90% of the world, I’m a hands-on learner. And I passed that with flying colors. But I knew that the cognitive standardized test would be the hardest test I’ve taken in my life. 

Which brings me to the whole point of this. I’ve taken that cognitive test 5 times and failed. I have one more attempt at it before I would have to completely redo the entire program again to be able to test.

I have never struggled with something so much in my life. And believe me when I say that it isn’t from a lack a trying. I have changed my study habits, bought third-party studying apps, reread my books, rewrote my notes, asked people for help, tried approaching the questions in a different manner. And nothing seems to be helping. I feel like at this point, there is no beating this test. I feel like it has beaten me. 

And I’m heartbroken that I’ve worked so hard to be for this and have fallen short every single time. I fear that I’m not setting a good example for my daughter because one day she is going to face an obstacle in life and she will realize that her dad never saw something all the way through and that she doesn’t have to either.

All of my (27m) relatively new social relationships are failing. I moved a couple of years ago, and I’ve made only a couple of new friends at best in the new city I live in. I’m constantly facing rejection and it’s really weighing down on me.

I’m trying to look at the situation rationally and positively. I understand that while I’m getting older and social groups are getting smaller, there is also likely something about my personality that is turning people off.

"This is something really stupid that I've been crying over. Not sure what to do with pent up feelings, so giving a go at writing it out.

My boyfriend(D) and his friend's (call him F)-now ex- girlfriend(H) got into an argument. It was a whole shit-show, both sides were in the wrong. 
F tried talking to me about what was going on, to where i explained i had wanted no involvment in any of this and didn't agree with how D pr H handled things. He showed me some pretty heavy stuff about my boyfriend and told F that I'd be discussing this convo with him. F said he'd prefer not, but I can leave any specifics out. He said to just tell D he's disappointed. 

This all progressed to him being mad at me about it and said he read through our texts, and also thinks I've been disrespecting him. I went back to read, but most of it was just helping him deal with H's outbursts. I explained im sorry for ever giving that impression, and explained how i never lost any respect for him and still saw him as a friend. He called me delusional and blocked me.

Tried talking about it to another friend who mostly knew what was going on, who tolde that F was going through something and he'd just be broken up with, that F's words and actions didnt make sense and i should give it some time.

I did that for over a month, then my father happened to send me a lot of money as a gift, cause he got his pention. The only thing i truly wanted to do with it was share it with my friends, so i texted in the groupchat to organise a meal. Some said they'd be down and there was some talk of it, but one guy said he'd let me know regarding his schedule, which never happened.

Time flew by and i felt bad that it hadn't been done yet, and with Christmas coming up, I figured it would be easier getting everyone - even F - a small gift to show my appreciation over the years, to show F that even though he's mad at me that I don't have any hard feelings. 

I got the gifts, sent a text into the groupchat over 24h ago saying i would like to pass them out, bring them to people, or if they had some time to meet up too.
It's that last text in the group, there hasn't been any answer.
This already broke my heart, i feel so embarrassed and just generally hurt. It was just something small and nice that i wanted to do.

I end up getting a text from a different friend, explaining that though he loves me and does see it as a lovely gesture, that he can't not say how inappropriate he deems it as it could hurt F's feelings. That it was the wrong time to want to give out gifts.

Part of me understands his reasonings, but i feel this hollow pain inside, where all the hurt and embarassment was. None of the other friends said anything, out of 7 people.

We were each other's first lovers. I was 12 and she was 11 when we started dating. Childhood love, but special. Saw her in the first week of school; still remember the very first time. She was the most beautiful girl. Love at first sight for me. Got shy and escaped so she wouldn't see me. Couldn't find out who she was for weeks.

  
Now, let me talk about one of the side characters. Let's call her Daria. My mother’s best friend's daughter, and they would come over all the time, so Daria and I were close, but I had no feelings for her. Found out she was in love with me later. Daria and Céline were besties, but I didn't know about this. One day, Daria asked if I had a crush on anyone, and I talked about Céline without knowing her name; I was basically describing her appearance. Daria ended up screaming, ""ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CELINE?"" I didn't know her name was Céline, so I said I don't know, but then she started talking about setting her up for me (poor girl; she tried gaining my heart by setting up her bestie), and I said okay.

  
After some time, we started sending each other letters through Daria, or we'd drop them at our school closets. I wish I'd kept and hid all of them somewhere in my room; it's one of my biggest regrets. Those letters gave me butterflies back then; we were dating but had never met alone. We'd meet in the shelter of our school, and there would be Daria and one of my other friends with us. We'd talk for a few minutes before one of us would get shy and run away. We were like this for months, talking through Daria. Céline would give her questions, and Daria would ask them to me. Later, our teachers were annoyed by our relationship, and her father found out about us. We had to end it. She then changed schools, and I didn't see her again for a really long time. But girl, I still get butterflies and smile whenever I think about our past. I was madly in love with you. Well, the funny thing is, we probably didn't talk to each other for more than 10 minutes in total face-to-face; we weren't messaging or anything either, but we were dumbly in love with each other.

  
**The First Time I Saw Her After 2 Years**

  
Taking private lessons from a teacher (let’s call him Jack) for my science class; turns out she takes lessons from the same teacher too. One day I went to Jack’s place, but there was someone in the room before me, so I had to wait for my turn. Then Jack came out of the room with a girl; it took me a few seconds to realize it was Céline. I was like, ""WHAT THE HECK IS SHE DOING HERE?"" and panicked. She called me “hi brother Jesse” (gonna be calling myself Jesse). She called me brother; we use brother for someone who is older than us in my country.. Some sort of a respect thing. It had a shocking effect on me. She did it so that Jack wouldn't understand the thing between us. But then he started smirking at me, “Jesseeee… who is thaaatt??” I didn't tell him anything, but he figured it out AHHAAHAH; he then made fun of me for the rest of the year. It was truly embarrassing.

  
**The First Time We Talked for a Few Days**

  
I don't exactly remember when we did this, but it was probably 5 years ago, not really sure. Was still in contact with Daria, I asked her if Céline had an Instagram account. She had one, but not many followers or none at all. I texted her, and she showed interest in my hobbies. Bro, it was the first time someone didn't make fun of my interests and hobbies. Felt good, but one day I woke up and couldn't find her account again. No idea why, but I guess she didn't want to keep talking to me.

  
**Running Across Each Other for the First Time After 4 Long Years of Not Seeing Each Other**

  
This happened last year. On my way to the gym after school, and she was returning home from school. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her; I started smiling and laughing and kind of screamed, “Céline?! WHAT’S UP?” She smiled and got a little shocked too, but we didn't talk that much; it took a few seconds lol. We probably got really shy. She was as beautiful as my kid version remembered.

  
**Accidentally Finding Her Spotify**

  
Used to be a weirdo who would stalk people’s Spotify accounts and make fun of their taste in music for my joy. Well, one day I accidentally found an account named “C” I knew it was her because I found the account on one of her friends’ accounts. So I followed her. MAN, SHE HAD THE BEST TASTE IN MUSIC EVER. It was my first time seeing a metalhead weirdo like me. We live in a rather small city, so. She listens to other genres as well, and I listen to them too. It felt like I found my soulmate, but I didn't know if she had a social account (I was no longer in contact with Daria so couldn't ask her), but then she put a different name on her Spotify, which made me think it was someone else, so I unfollowed her. Later, I found out she found my account and followed me again just after a few hours. Man… that was so hot ngl AHAHAHAH I was pretty sure it was her after that.

  
**Falling in Love Again**

  
We ran across each other again a few months ago. I was talking to a friend outside, then I saw Céline. I got so happy; I don't know how to explain the feeling I had when I saw her. I was like “HEY CELINE!!” Oh man, the way she smiled at me when she saw me; we had a small talk, and that’s when I asked if that Spotify belonged to her, and the answer was yes. I tried finding her Insta for almost 3 weeks; during this time, I was thinking about our past, what kind of a person she might’ve turned into now, blah blah. We had a similar taste in music, so I thought she’d be the female version of me (which I was right about). I sent requests to some accounts I found on her school’s Insta account. They were accounts that had movie characters on their profile picture and had cool names. Turns out none of them were Céline. I ended up asking a really old friend from middle school, she luckily knew her account. I sent her a request, but she didn't do anything.  
I wanted to text her so bad, so I thought about talking to her through Spotify playlists. I made a playlist for her; she noticed it right away, made a playlist as a reply. She would name them things like “to my literally first lover” “first love never dies.” I WAS SO HAPPY; we talked like this for 4 days. It was straight out of a movie. Literally what I was hoping to find my whole life. A love out of a novel. She then gave her number through a playlist. I texted her, and you know, people have talking stages; that didn't happen. We started talking like lovers of 8 years instead of not talking to each other for 8 years. She was literally the female version of me. She’s an INFJ, and I’m an INFP, so we got along really well. We talked until late hours that day, I stayed up late for the first time. It felt like I finally found the love of my life. The next day we met, I wasn't expecting this, but she hugged me right after seeing me. This made me so happy. I felt so comfortable being with her, she felt like ""home"" that night, like a ""safe place"" We weren't shy at all, we were really comfortable. Didn't struggle to talk at all. Actually, WE TALKED FOR HOURS WITHOUT SHUTTING UP FOR A SINGLE MOMENT. It was like we never broke up, we knew everything about each other. My lifelong friends never made me feel this way; I never had this kind of fun with anyone before. We then sat somewhere and kept talking. We randomly held eye contact for some time, and then I asked her if she’d like to hug. We started cuddling afterwards. It was my first time cuddling with someone. I'm a guy who waits for the right person to do these things, and I was sure she was the one. Before dropping her home, we had a long hug (I wish I could take the time back to this exact moment). I just miss the smell of her hair and feeling her close to me so much... I miss my safe place. 

  
After I got back home, I think I kind of rushed things; I literally told her that I love her. The next day she told me things went too fast, and she feels really uncomfortable. I tried changing her mind, but nothing had worked, so I respected her decision. She then removed me on Insta, later on Spotify. Dumb me; I asked her why. Like, just let her go; she has all the right to remove you. We then started running across each other almost every day. I really have no idea how this was happening. I'm an atheist who makes fun of people who believe in these things, but even I started thinking the universe was sending us a message. Sometimes I would change my way before she saw me to not disturb her. She'd smile when she saw me too. Oh god I miss her smile more than anything... I couldn't take it anymore and stopped going outside. I wanted to go out for the first time after 3 weeks and saw her again; she looked tired, so I messaged her how she feels and all, she replied a week later. We randomly started talking again. It was so much fun, we talked as if we had never stopped talking. I then couldn't resist and told her that I can't forget about her. She was really kind to me while explaining her reasons; she wanted me to be happy too. It’s been a few weeks since we had that conversation.

I made a playlist a few days ago; she made a similar playlist after a few hours, had the same song on top, it was full of French songs, named ""Before Sunrise"" and all. I couldn't resist again and asked her if it was for me. Also asked if she doesn't know what she wants and that is she trying to make me not forget about her. I didn't think this would get her angry, dumb me; it was really disrespectful of me. She wrote long messages about how she doesn't try to make me upset; she doesn't have any bad intentions and all, and she is totally right. But I never thought that she tries to hurt me; really, I never thought anything bad about her. She could make me cry for days, and I wouldn't say a single thing bad about her. I think she accepted my apology; I'm not sure, but of course, we won't keep talking. I just don't want her to hate me; I will never be texting her again. For my own good and hers. Seems like the playlists were just a coincidence :/ I think I hurt her today, and I hate myself for this. She blocked me on Spoitfy... How could I do this to her? How could I hurt such kind soul like her? I will never forgive myself for this.

  
**My Thoughts About Céline**

  
She is probably one of the most special people for me; she is my first love. I had never totally forgotten about her. A few years ago, I realized that throughout my whole life, I was either trying to find someone who looked like her or had the same name as her. Like my type in women is the same as she looks. None of these were intentional. I’ve always wondered how she was doing my whole life. There was a point when I was thinking about naming my daughter Céline in the future. Which would be very disrespectful towards my partner, so nope, I'm not gonna be doing this.  
  
**To Céline**

  
Maybe you have some traumas from your past relationships; I really don't know. Maybe that was the reason why you got scared when I cared about you. Maybe it’s a different reason; I have no idea. But I know that you're not psychologically feeling well. I was ready to do anything to make you feel better. We could’ve gone through these hard times together. I would never judge you about anything you do, I’d be your biggest support. We both understand each other and our relationship would be the most beautiful thing ever. Sometimes I can’t stop wishing you gave this a chance but I also know that you need time on your own lately. I only want you to be happy that’s all I want so please don’t think that you hurt me by rejecting me. I’ll be happier than ever if I see you smiling :) I’ve never stopped loving you ever since our childhood, and this is why I still couldn't forget about those 2 days we spent together. I would’ve given my life for you; I’d still do it without hesitating. I guess there’s nothing else I can do but to respect your decision, but I just can't stop thinking about you. I just can't do it. I don't want to do it. You’re the first person who showed me what love is. I was so ready to make you the happiest girl in the world. Sometimes I can't stop thinking if it would be wrong to get you that Will Graham clock or Tamino record for your birthday. I'm probably not gonna do it. We sometimes talk for a few days once every few years, just like in the Before Trilogy. Maybe we'll talk again in 4 years, who knows? I couldn't stop smiling while writing our memories, I’m just so happy to have someone kind an amazing like you as my first love. And now I can't stop crying knowing that I’ll never be able to give you a love like in the movies, a love that you deserve. I always go to that place we cuddled; I sit there for hours without doing anything; it reminds me of you, and I can't stop it. Yes I’m in depression for months, feeling like a piece of shit but I truly don’t care if you’re not gonna be comfortable with me. If you ever return one day, I will be prepared to offer you a love that surpasses any experience in life. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, with the kindest soul and exceptional understanding. I’m so proud of you for keep trying your best in life too!! You’re the strongest person I know. Thank you so much for the memories you gave me. You’ll be a story that I tell my grandchildren. My love for you exceeds everything, Céline. I will always cherish you as my first love. Wishing you the best in life. Take care.",Talking to First Love After Years,18ohakq,1703258423.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ohakq/talking_to_first_love_after_years/,
"I have had body dysmorphia since I was a teenager. I had severe acne worse than anyone in my class. I felt subhuman and ashamed to talk to anyone. I felt disgusted to go out in public. Whenever I did, I would always compare my skin to everyone else. Why must everyone have clear skin but me? 

Sometime in 2019, I cleaned up my diet, went to a dermatologist who prescribed me tretinoin and finally there seemed to be progress. Finally my skin was clearing up. But just as my skin cleared my hair started to fall out. Just when my confidence was coming back, everything was crushed again.  
I hoped that this was just body dysmorphia and maybe the mirror is lying to me. Maybe my hair is perfectly fine and my mind is playing tricks on me. Then one time after I got a buzzcut, my friends commented that my hair seemed thin. The fact that my worst fears were confirmed sent me into complete depression and severe anxiety. I couldn't accept that I'm going bald.

  
I went to multiple dermatologists, most of them said my hair seemed fine. I thought they were all lying to me. Then in 2021, 1 dermatologist finally said yes your hair does seem to be receding slightly but the rest of my hair was still thick. She prescribed me finasteride and minoxidil, which I have taken for over a year now. I have no side effects but I also have no effects. I don't know if it worked or not some days it seems like my hair has improved some days it looks like it has worsened. Some days it seems like my hair loss stopped some days it seems like I have shed a lot of hair. I keep obsessively checking the mirror to see if there is a change.

  
I constantly worry that I might be the unfortunate 10% of people for whom finasteride does not work, especially given the fact that my grandfather went bald very early. Im conflicted on whether or not I should switch to dutasteride because while it might work better I don't think I'm mentally capable of handling a shedding phase that might result from it. I also read somewhere that you can't get a hair transplant until you're 25. How am I going to last 3 years like this? Every day is a living hell.

  
I cry in the shower every time. I overthink my hair loss and worry that I might also be getting diffuse thinning on top of a receding hairline. I wear a cap everywhere I go. I cry in the shower. I cry myself to sleep. I can't accept going bald. I only just turned 22 and honestly even if I was 50 I don't think I can accept hair loss. I feel even more subhuman than when I had acne.

  
If my crown started to thin, I don't think I could take it anymore, I'll probably just end my life. Because it's worthless. I could be Jeff Bezos, one of the richest people on earth, be very smart and have accomplished a lot but at the end of the day, I'll still be bald. I'll still feel a sense of inferiority over the common man. I'll feel ashamed to look another man in the eye, constantly bowing down in my shame. Constantly comparing my hairline to everyone I see.

  
And no this isn't about getting girls. This is just my sense of self worth and self confidence. I don't even care if I got erectile dysfunction. I don't even wanna have kids. Im pretty much asexual and aromatic anyway. I even considered chemically castrating myself if it means I can keep my hair. I just want to look normal like every other 22 year old. I just want to look human.",Im balding and I can't take it anymore,18oh6w6,1703258147.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18oh6w6/im_balding_and_i_cant_take_it_anymore/,
"As most women know it can be time consuming to reach an orgasm (I usually use a vibrator during masturbation and it doesn’t take that long 5-10 minutes) but whenever I’ve slept with a man I cannot orgasm solely from penetration. 

My bf knows this because I’ve told him many times. Sex with him feels amazing and penetrative sex is something I love, it feels amazing and I crave it but it doesn’t make me orgasm (again I’ve told him this). But he’s partial to me using a vibrator during sex. He told me early in our relationship that he felt he wasn’t good enough for me because I wanted to use it during intercourse (I did tell him it’s not that he doesn’t feel good it’s just that I need that stimulation too in order to orgasm). He tries his best to continue to have sex with me and ignore when I ask to use the vibrator but usually gives in. 

What irritates me the most is he likes to chose positions that feel the best for him to make him orgasm fast. Then says he’ll get back to the position that feels the best for me after he gets hard again/ recoops or whatever.

I'm very insecure about the size of my penis at a young age of 21 and it's the main reason I'm still an involuntary virgin. my size is 5.5"" non bone pressed and 5.5"" girth which quote on quote not impressive according to current social standards and women.

As the title says, I (F 24) think my mom might be a little toxic but I love her. She can be the greatest person ever but lately, she has behaved in a way that just makes me confused on what to do. I.e I have gained a lot of weight and I’m overweight.

I am trying so hard to get myself together to lose weight but I have to be careful not to fall back into my ED. Now my mom has made several comments about my weight despite me asking her not to. She also acts as if she knows everything because she’s older, trying to tell me that whatever research I have made is wrong. When I tell her to stop talking about certain stuff she gets annoyed saying stuff like “You can’t ask me to just lay flat on the ground because you apparently know everything.”

My entire life the things i was most anxious about were my friends secretly not liking me, and things i had done in the past.

i’m an outgoing and loud person so there are a lot of really embarrassing things i did i thought were funny and would do in public before i sort of reigned myself in. but i used to spend hours at night haunted by things i used to do. i would spend so much energy trying to find a cure to forgetting bad memories. and then i realized what i was really anxious about.

same with my friends not liking me. i would go home and analyze every conversation i had that day, and wonder if they didn’t like me.

it’s my fear of lack of control. i wasn’t just cringing at my past self; most of my anxiety came from the fear of what other people did. what if they actually do remember the things i used to do, and make fun of me about it to this day? what if they have a secret collection of embarrassing pictures of me they laugh at all the time? what if they screenshotted the conversations i had with them and posted them somewhere i couldn’t see so i could get bullied? i realized all of that was highly implausible. but my mind kept wandering.

so now i know WHY i have anxiety, i just don’t know how to cure it yet, lol. furiously stealing everybody i know’s phones and scrolling through their photos to delete any possibly blackmail they have of me like my brain wants me to wont do lmao. so ig i’ll just wait it out lol.",I just realized the root of all of my anxiety and everything makes sense now.,18ofw43,1703254526.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18ofw43/i_just_realized_the_root_of_all_of_my_anxiety_and/,

A few months later I saw on Twitter that he had started dating a girl from his city, which hurt me a lot but I accepted it and decided it was better to walk away. But he never posted anything about her and never told me directly that he was dating, and I always thought that was really strange. He had a habit of posting indirect messages on the Internet, specially on stories and sometimes it seemed very obvious that it was meant for me. Now in November he posted something like ""loneliness is not being alone, it's when someone loves you and you don't have it on you to love them back"", a lyric of a swans music. I found it very strange and thought they had broken up. Soon after that, he started talking to me again like before, sending me messages frequently, asking for photos, commenting and reacting to my stories, I was so happy because I was still in love with him, and I really thought he had broken up with her. He sent me two letters in the same envelope, written almost 2 months apart, and a developed photo that he took on one of the days we went out together, and I thought that meant he was still thinking about me. I even wrote a long letter in response, but before sending it, I decided to check the profile of the girl he was dating and discovered that in fact they were still together, and the only days that he took a little longer to answer me, it was because he was with her. It broke my heart into a thousand pieces. I spent a few days thinking about it and thinking what should I do, until I finally decided to block him from absolutely everything, delete his conversations and number and try to move on. I'm not here to ask for advice, I know I did the right thing. I just really wanted to get it off my chest because I'm heartbroken and even after all this I still really want to cry because I miss him so much. I'm completely destroyed, I just want to forget that he exists once and for all. If I could rip him out of my heart with my own hands, I would. Has anyone ever gone through something like this? If he was still dating her, why did he come and mess with me? I had already accepted that we wouldn't talk anymore when I saw that he had started dating. He came back just to mess with my head, but for what?

"I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or if I should be worried.

So he ghosted me 3 times while we were in the talking stage and I cut it off a month ago. We never officially dated. THAT IS IMPORTANT!

He introduced me to his friends (including females) and we became close. After I cut it off we all hung out minus him and he found out.. he wasn’t happy. Let’s call my ex David.

David went on a rampage and posted all over social media his feelings about us.

I was a little bitter because he introduced me to cool people that are genuine and then he ghosted me again. I wasn’t hanging out with them out of spite, but I see how that could anger someone. However, his response was anything but within normal range. He posted inflammatory comments public about us collectively and individually said his feelings to everyone except me. Remember I said I was bitter already, and him saying that twice upset me. 

He tried to message me casually as a friend for an unrelated question and I told him don’t try to talk to me. I called him out on how I gave him nothing but love and he kept leaving me for months with no contact. I was fed up.

He told all of his friends we dated and I played him.

He tried to gaslight me and turn it on me so I just cut it off and left it at that.

You’d think the situation is done right?

Wrong.

A week later David started messaging me on EVERY social media platform saying how he missed me. I guess that’s normal. What he did after is not.

He repeatedly continued to message me despite me not responding. He’d delete the messages he sent me on Snapchat and then message me again. I told him several times no, I don’t want to be friends and I don’t want anything to do with him.

A week later he rinses and repeats. He would text me a long paragraph or two again. I told him NO several times. By this point I removed him off of everything and deleted his number. This morning, he sent me a friend request on Facebook. Seems harmless right?

Wrong.

I’ve been seeing his car parked near my office like a block or two off. I know it’s him because of the license plate and the make/model. At first it was just angering when he’d message me after I told him to stop.

Now I’m actually getting scared. I feel like I should get a restraining order against him but part of me gaslights myself into thinking I’m being dramatic.

"I know how the title sounds but bear with me. Im not homophobic, my reasons for being mad at him are not for him coming out. 

 I (29F) had my husband (32M) come out to me last week, abruptly ending our nearly 5 years of marriage. We met on Reddit, dated long distance for a year (different countries, similar cultures), spent nearly six months of face to face time, got engaged for a year, and I immigrated to his country so we could finally be together. I left everything behind.  We had at the start what I would see an ideal marriage: Great communication and problem solving, amazing intimacy, both following our dreams and supporting each other. He was truly my best friend. 

From the start of our marriage (I’m talking we just got home for the honeymoon we left for the morning after we married) we began having intimacy issues. Months long dry spells with sporadic intimacy after we talked about our problems.  We would sit down and talk about it every few months, and there was always a reason, all valid but widely ranging. Covid hit when I first moved here, then a family member of his got incredibly ill. I quit my job and took care of them until they passed. He decided to continue school again, there’s a lot of stress. Depression, anxiety, resentment. He saw doctors, took medication to help, I supported him. I couldn’t blame him for it. 

The last few months have been brutal. He pulled away again from intimacy, but then also completely emotionally detached from me. We argued a little, emotions were high, but he proactively decided to go to therapy. I’m so proud of him for this, because it was the catalyst for last week. I’ve been having health problems that have been warranting many doctors visits, tests, with a possible surgery on the horizon. It’s affected my whole life, I’m weak and I can’t do the managing of the home or running my business like I used to. Since that he’s completely detached and spends his days off out of the house.

That brings us to last week. He came home from therapy and immediately wanted to talk. I was shocked but happy he wanted to open to me. We sit down, and I can tell he’s struggling. And then he tells me he gay. I was floored to be honest, I didn’t even really react. But I realized I’m the first person he’s coming out to, so of course I cried but I told him I was so thankful he was honest with me no matter how hard it is. That of course I’m upset at the situation, but I’m not angry with him. We talked for an hour, him telling me his feelings, me mostly saying “I don’t know what I’m going to do” since where I’m at in my immigration, I’m going to have to move back to my home country. We agree we want to go through this amicably, because we still have love for each other even if it isn’t romantic.

I had to take a break to call my mother, since she is coming into town tomorrow to stay with us for two weeks for Christmas. Joy! I come back in and we talk more, mostly me asking questions, and he laid it all out on the table for me. Hours of talking about the process of him finding it out, the root of him getting here, and how he basically is very unhappy for decades because he doesn’t know who he is. He never had. The only thing he’s sure about himself is that he’s gay. This is the first thing that made me upset, because I felt like I have been dragged across countries to be apart of his identity crisis. He felt like this before we even met. It made me start to question what we shared and built together, since he said that he couldn’t identify music he likes anymore or has lost interest in coffee because he so unsure of his identity (his examples, not mine).

We got quiet and I asked if he has any questions for me. Nope. He tells me he “didn’t think past telling me”. No checking on my feelings or where I’m at or even how I feel since stress triggers my health issues. And then just silence again. He decides to go tell his mom and left for 4 hours.

He came home late that night and I was cordial. I asked him how it went. He says good, then goes in for a hug. I said I was good, that I’ve been just feeling negative about the situation with time to think. I take my part on this, I was a little confrontational with him. I was upset, my emotions were on high. I told him I felt this was all cold and rushed, I understood he felt the need to tell me right away but the ramifications sucked. He ended our marriage while I’m sick, on the drop of a hat and in one evening, and the day before my mother gets here. And he didn’t ask how I’m doing, or anything else for that matter. I addressed how his therapist prepared him for me “screaming, throwing things, and kicking him out”, which I felt was such a gross misjudgment of my character. I’ve never acted that way towards anyone throughout our marriage, not to mention my entire life, including him. I was being pretty direct, my feelings were hurt.

He exploded, telling me he came home for us to sit and watch a show like normal then go to bed. Im mad that I feel like I’m not allowed to process whats happening properly. He tells me I’ve fucked him up because I get upset that he cries when we fight. Mind you, I had said nothing about crying yesterday, and he cries during every hard conversation we’ve ever had. Anytime we have to talk about something hard, and I have to talk about how something made me feel, he cries and beats himself up to the point that I start worrying about his mental health. I’ve gotten to the point where I feel like I can’t express myself. After years of talks going like this, and him crying at me during every hard conversation, I called him out on it. It started to feel manipulative, it ended hard conversations early many times with me hugging him till he stopped. He comes back out with a bag and then drops a bunch of his repressed feelings on me: I’m so mean and unreasonable, that we can from now on talk through lawyers. That I’m the reason he has low self esteem because I tell him “there’s a reason the kids at work are mean to you” (he says they don’t like him because he cracks inappropriate jokes and beat that joke into the ground. About North Korea, communism, and misogyny to name a few. His words, not mine. I told him someone could report him and get him fired, joke or not, and maybe the younger gen kids don’t like him because of what he says). He left with a slammed door and we haven’t talked since.

I’m sitting here shellshocked, over the span of an evening we went from happily married to we are now only talking through lawyers. He left and hasn’t been back, we’ve hardly texted. He abandoned all the responsibilities, and I’ve been keeping the house and all three animals in functioning order. I’ve been packing my stuff up with the help of my mom. I’m going to the lawyers next week to get papers started on my own. His family hasn’t even reached out to me. I just feel so dead inside right now, and have no one to just vent this all to. If you got to the end, thank you for taking the time.","My husband and I are divorcing as he’s come out as gay, and I can’t help but be upset with him (long read)",18of0c9,1703251959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18of0c9/my_husband_and_i_are_divorcing_as_hes_come_out_as/,

Before leaving home I remember being super upset about leaving my cat behind. She is my baby and I miss her everyday. Right now she’s in the care of my mom and her partner, but I find it hard to trust anyone else but me when it comes to my baby… I remember telling my mom, “what if a war breaks out? Will you take care of her then?”

Turns out my gut feeling was right and a war did break out. My cat is fine, but being away during a time like this only magnified my feeling of loneliness and homesickness and I can’t afford to fly home for the holidays.

I miss my cat more than anything else; when it comes to friends I’m not worried, but I don’t know how to cope with being away from my baby for so long.

"long story short: was with this ex for year and some change, during when she fucked other people on the side. For the whole duration.

He’s 60, but his moronic views starts earlier than that so I would not give in to the excuses that he’s old. He could borrow money under the company’s name with his friend co-signed it. Well, his friend then would found out his mismanagement but then he could cut his balls for all I care. Maybe that’s how he’ll learn consequence.

This is going to sound terrible, no matter how I explain anything. I understand I am very flawed. I understand I make terrible mistakes. I understand what I do is unhealthy on multiple different levels. 

I just can't wrap my head around why I would become abusive. Physically and verbally. Part of me does not believe he is telling the whole truth. I ask him to explain what I did, and he doesn't want to. Fair enough. No one owes anyone anything. 

We're both drinking in this scenario, by the way. I guess he can just handle his alcohol way better than me. 

The parts that I remember don't fully line up with his. I don't know if I'm choosing to believe/remember things differently. Or he is correct. I also don't see what he would gain by lying to me. 


He is telling me I punched him in the back of the head when we were going to bed. Why would I do that? I remember pulling blankets to me, facing away from him. And him getting angry that he has no blanket, so stupid drunk me pushes majority of the blankets behind me. I woke up facing away from him. Why would I turn around/ get up just to punch him? 

I do remember him making a comment earlier in the night about somthing. And I later, unprovoked talked about it. And I would agree I was very blunt about it. The original comment was somthing about me and I said how I don't like it. I don't want to give details about this topic to reddit. 

I also remember self loathing. 

He said I made other comments that really hurt him. He is angry. He wants me to remember what I said, without him telling me. But I don't even remember what I supposedly said. I told him the parts I remember.

Unhappy with the idea, I told him that if he chose to see her, it meant choosing her over me. I asked if she knew about our relationship; he said no but would tell her when asked.

Feeling sad, I told him it's over if he decides to go. Despite this, he still wanted to go, so I ended the relationship.

Curious about his ex, I asked if the uncertainties from before persisted. He replied a day later, saying he's still lost, wants to isolate himself due to a cluttered mind, and is still thinking about me. I expressed the need for a final call even if he wants isolation, so I can move on. It's been two days, and he hasn't responded.

It’s not unusual for us to have verbal spats, but unlike usual, he started hitting me over and over even after I’ve tried to apologize to calm him down. And what really surpised me was he strangled me, and nearly slammed my body at the coffee table.

My brother used to be my bestest friend, someone I could talk to everything about. Someone who I felt safe with. I was so scared of losing him that I begged forgiveness from him and we were back on speaking terms for a couple of hours.

I’ve talked to my parents about this, and they said I should just forgive and forget. But I’ve tried, and I don’t think I could do this.

"I (14F) resent my family. My life is going to shit and I feel like they’re the only people to blame. There is no way around it. I wouldn’t be where I am, I wouldn’t feel the way I would, and I would definitely be 20 times more confident if it weren’t for them. Of course, I’m not claiming to be innocent. But I do feel that there is a big difference in who did worse.  
  
Intentional or unintentional, they ripped me to shreds. They killed me piece by piece. I only remember very specific things from when I was younger, but if you expect me to recap to you, in detail all that happened over a year ago, it’d be a mess. I’d talked to the people who repeatedly hurt me about it. Specifically those that mattered like my parents and brother, but I was invalidated to the point where I had to lie. I lied so much that I, myself, barely remember the truth. And I suppose in a way that makes me just as bad a person as they are.  
  
And I feel stuck. They have me in a place I’ll never get out of. The lying has me at a point where I feel sick with the need and want to know the truth about my own life. The truth that absolutely nobody knows because of my lying.   
  
Among other things, they have me in places that could inevitably cause my life to fall apart sooner or later. Things that make me wanna end it. Of course, some other things I caused myself.   
  
Wouldn’t be the only things making me wanna end it. They had me convinced I was the one ruining their lives. My mother and brother specifically. This was to the point where I had been screaming about wanting to die at the mere age of ten. Sometimes I think about the ways people used to describe me, or the way my father (whom I started living with a month ago) described me. And I genuinely think that somewhere along the way I lost myself. Or that I could’ve never been the person they described. Because it’s the person I aspire to be. The idea that I could’ve been who I want to be once is so foreign.   
  
Sometimes I wanna cry. I can’t. I genuinely wanna break down and sob for hours. Just to feel  something. I can’t cry for more than a few minutes. And closest I get to feeling anything is a panic attack that involves 0 crying. I feel like they stole that. They had ridiculed me for crying, yet coddled my brother (15M) his entire life. He can cry. He can hit me. Do whatever he so pleases. Yet I can’t? But genuinely I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard it hurt. I still remember the last time I had a proper cry, sobbing and screaming my heart out, and best my father could do was sit there next to me and crack jokes with my brother.  
  
My parents and brother had be convinced my father hated me, that I was a terrible person, that my personality was shit, I was objectively unattractive. all by the age of ten. Among other things. Those specific things are partially what got me where I am. Some of the main focuses.  
  
Sometimes it feels useless talking about it. Because sometimes I just feel like getting it all out. You know saying it, typing it, doesn’t make a difference. Just getting it out. The full story. From the start to the most recent. And I get journaling. But is it so wrong that I’d want raw input. Someone to tell me where it went wrong. Why it all happened. Someone to help me make sense of it?? Instead of just defending the behaviour of my family, and justifying the hurt they caused me. I just want that so bad it makes no sense.

"I'm afraid of my dad. He has unrelenting anger issues and I can't tell him how I truly feel about him for fear of his anger getting the better of him and him trying to hurt me. I also don't want to get into a fight with him because then I'll probably go to jail. He abused my mom when she was pregnant and made terroristic threats to his job. And it's just sad because as a child my view of him was so incredibly naive and innocent. That is... until he showed who he really was, and completely stepped on my innocence. The first time was because he called me and my siblings ungrateful for absolutely NO fucking reason, and then threatened me, calling me ""boy,"" and ""motherfucker,"" and that he'd ""beat my ass."" The second was when I wouldn't illegally buy him a gun on his birthday so he threw a phone charger at me. It just makes me feel so incredibly alone... and depresses me to a great extent. My step-dad is also a childish narcissist... and my mom has always just put up with them. So yeah.

"There was a messy situation two years ago in my friend group (all adults in their 30s) involving cheating. One of the cheat-ees found out when he was drunk and choked his (now ex) partner and destroyed a bunch of her stuff. 

Our mutual friends think she’s lying but since I watched this guy behave verbally and emotionally abusive for years I didn’t think she was lying. He has a history of sexual violence (stealthing women) and had a “crazy ex” story where “she was lying about things and he was wrongly accused” which was believable until watching his behaviour in the current relationship. 

Long story short I am no longer friends with either of them and refuse to hang out with those old
friends who act like he didn’t do anything wrong, with one exception. The other cheat-ee is a family member and I haven’t been willing to cut them out of my life. 

We had a talk where I expressed my
disgust about domestic violence and my discomfort that they were still hanging out with a domestic violence offender but I said I wasn’t asking them to choose between us.

I regret not giving the “choose” ultimatum. I periodically get invited to things he’s going to and I fucking hate it. I don’t want to be a person who hangs out with trash and it hurts that my family would choose to spend time with him over me. 

I feel like it’s too late to change anything about this and I need to learn to accept things as they are but it still sucks.",I regret not giving an ultimatum,18octzz,1703244461.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18octzz/i_regret_not_giving_an_ultimatum/,
"First off, I must tell everyone that I live in a very conservative, religious country. Women’s rights are the lowest priority here. It’s been 20 years to my marriage. I always suspected that my husband is gay. It was an arranged marriage, like many are in my country. I’ve previously found gay porn on our computer and I once discovered condoms in his bag when he was leaving for a “work” trip. 

My husband has always treated me like shit. He’s a complete narcissist. I don’t think he’s ever loved me because he may not be capable of romantic love towards women. He’s always been extremely angry and has a bad attitude towards me no matter what I do. He has slapped me and pushed me around, swore at me, screamed at me, choked me, threw my things across the room, threw things at me, and said horrible things to me many times. He pretends to be a great human being in front of others, but I know what he’s really like. 

However for the sake of my kids I never let anyone know how he really is so that we maintain a respectable reputation in society. I couldn’t leave him because my parents always asked me to stay with him as they probably didn’t want to take my responsibility. I got married very young, when I was only 21. I never worked and was always a housewife taking care of my 2 kids. I was always financially dependent on my husband. We moved countries a few times due to his job and I was always a stay at home mom. 

I confronted him about his being gay due to the things I found and also because he never really wanted to have sex -and as he got older he couldn’t even get it up for me anymore. Anyway, after how he behaves, I don’t even want him to touch me. I always prayed to God to let me find some solid proof of him being gay. Today I found it. He left his laptop at home and I checked his email. He had sent his “lover” many messages. His lover lives in another country but has been supported by my husband since 6 years! 

He goes over to meet him and he has even visited our city and probably even been over to our house when I wasn’t at home. I suspect that the lover’s education has also been supported by my husband and he even attended his graduation. The air tickets for travel have also been sent by my husband. 

So apparently my husband is totally in love with this man and the way he writes to him, he has never spoken with so much love and understanding to me ever! Apparently the lover has found a steady boyfriend in the other country where he lives and they now live together. My husband was really heart broken about that in his email to him. 

Also my husband confessed in the emails that he regularly had sex with men and even had another guy he had sex with before this guy who he “loved.” Now I’m so afraid of catching some disease especially as he admitted to having sex with multiple men. 

So I already knew that there was something going on but I still cried. Not for him but for so many years of my life wasted. I feel like I never had anyone who really loved me, in spite of being a good wife. A faithful wife through everything. One who never told anyone about what he was really like. Everyone always appreciated how pretty I am till now but little do they know that I never had a man who loved or wanted me in a romantic way. I don’t think I deserved this.  

Now I don’t know how to proceed. I took lots of pictures and videos as evidence and saved them online. I still don’t want any of this to become public knowledge as it’s going to ruin my kids lives, especially in this conservative, religious country I live in. When I confronted him before on my suspicions he became extremely angry and violent. He denied that he was gay. He gas lighted me. I’m scared of confronting him with this new evidence. Sometimes I feel like he could kill me in a rage. What do I do now? Just for info, My kids are grown.

I had two friend groups that I dearly loved, but they both ended so poorly I had no choice but to physically disengage with them. One group was just purely toxic and was bad for my mental health and the other group encouraged my active addiction to alcohol and would keep pushing me deeper and deeper into that addiction by often gifting me alcohol and constantly reminding me how stupid I was for giving in to it even though they were the ones supplying me with it. 

My addiction sent me to the hospital and almost killed me. So I had to do what was best. I cut off everything toxic in my life. I cut off alcohol and I cut off these so called “friends.” Ever since I did so, I’ve felt insanely lonely because I haven’t had the confidence to go out in public and make new friends.

"Throwaway.

Me (f29) and my husband (m28) are both software engineers. We both have around 6 years of experience, and have very similar credentials/degrees. While I do okay, my husband is the smartest person I've ever met and is brilliant at his job. We're both from a third world country.

Recently, I got an offer from a company to move to a first world country in Europe in a lead position. We were both of course thrilled and moved here a few months ago. While my career is going alright, he hasn't managed to get even an interview here. This particular city we're in is known to be a tech-hub in Europe, and we were sure that he'd have no trouble finding a well-paying job here. But so far, no luck.

The problem is not him finding a job, I honestly wouldn't care if he chooses to never work. But I can feel him getting demotivated day by day, I can see his excitement dying down. He wakes up late. He doesn't apply to any jobs anymore. In our industry, internal hiring is very common, which means you have a very low chance of getting a job without a referral. He's adamant on not getting referrals from people he's not best friends with, it hurts his pride. While I respect his decisions, he also often shuts down and is very bothered about the whole situation. He's been working at the same company that he started at for the last 6 years, and he's never looked for another job until now, so I'm sure the whole concept is a bit foreign to him. He has now just stopped trying, and I feel like I was the one who caused all of this. Maybe he wasn't ready to be looking for a new job. I know the job market is literally the worst nowadays, but I can't bear to see him so down everyday.

"Hi! First of all English is not my first language so I’m apologizing for my future mistakes.
Hey everyone, I just want to explain my situation because I don’t know what to do anymore.
So my father the last year brought my mother an Apple Watch for Christmas (it was her dream gift because she loves walking) anyway he asked me if like it and I always say no. I don’t like the Apple Watch so I made it clear that I don’t like it. This Christmas gift from my father is an Apple Watch and when I say that it’s a waste of money he got angry and says that I’m ruining Christmas by being ungrateful. Now I know that it sounds that I’m ungrateful so I want to make clear some points:
1. My family is not rich, but we are good. I’m studying in uni and I’m not living at home, so my parents pay the rent of my apartment (this is very common in the country where I live). So I never ask for expensive things for Christmas/birthday.
2. The last week I went to the dentist and I found out I needed to have my wisdom teeth removed (very expensive here), and when I said this to my father, he said that I have to wait because is very expensive (an Apple Watch is more expensive btw).
3. This summer my father received a bonus at work and gave gifts to me, my sister and my mother. He wanted to give me an Apple Watch but I made it clear that I didn’t like it and I got an IPad (I use it for studying so it’s not a waste of money for me)(my mother and my sister already have an Apple Watch btw), so it’s not true when he says that I never said that I don’t like an Apple Watch.
Today he says again that I’m ruining Christmas and i don’t appreciate the gift when for an entire year I said that buying me an Apple Watch is a waste of money, so I’m thinking of returning to my uni apartment and spent the Christmas alone there (I prefer to spend it alone rather than stay here).

"Two days ago I developed an abscess where there was previously a small cyst.

"Yesterday morning around 5 while at work I got a text from my husband to call him when I get off. Asked him if he was ok and he said he’s at the hospital. Figured it was his Dad again as he is in Arizona for his Dad’s birthday and Dad had a stroke in May… 
I call him immediately and as soon as he picks up I know it’s not Dad by the sound of his voice.
He tells me he’s in the hospital after a fall with broken ribs , a skull fracture and a brain bleed…
I try to get out of him what happened and he’s not making much sense so I call the hospital and they tell me that he’s in ICU with several brain bleeds potentially life threatening but ok .
As the day goes on his parents go to see him and mom says he is not himself which I knew by talking to him.
I finally get a few hours of sleep and call the hospital as soon as I wake up.
Nurse tells me he’s still in ICU and he’s got a 1.5 cm epidural hematoma, a subdural hematoma , a  parietal bone skull fracture , several broken ribs etc
I call my husband and he’s having word finding problems and can’t form a sentence to give me info he wants me to know.
To put the icing on the cake he already had a TBI, PTSD , Depression etc.
He’s a combat Vet and we are in the VA caregiver program.
First I was his ft caregiver which made him get better then with the cuts in spending ( VA) they put us ( among thousands of others) on a much lower tier and I had to go back to work ft.
Shit hits the fan and he keeps getting worse. Then his psychiatrist decides to cut him off his sleep meds ( Ambien) and now the downward spiral starts escalating.
First he takes Benadryl to sleep in doses that would knock me out for days. That quits making him sleep and now he starts abusing NyQuil.
He’s downing bottles of it…
He hides it but I find it.
I inform the VA with zero results.
The VA Social worker was here in October for the annual home visit, I tell her IN DETAILS how bad it’s gotten and how terrified I am of something happening to him while I’m at work…
And now it did….
Apparently he had downed God knows how much NyQuil, was on the patio ( at night) of his parents place , tried to get down the stairs and fell severely injuring himself.
He didn’t even realize he fell and was injured and went to bed.
He wakes up with his shoulder and head hurting and finally goes to the hospital at 10.47 pm the day before yesterday and as soon as they do a ct they take him by ambulance code red to a bigger hospital where he is now…
I’m in a different state at home and I’m losing my mind…
Not only out of complete shock and fear for his life and health but because I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. For years now I have been begging the VA to let me be his fulltime caregiver again as he needs 24/7 care …
I was told the reason I want to be his ft caregiver is because I’m too lazy to work….
Now my Husband of 15 years is in the ICU with severe head injuries…
God only knows if he’s going to recover…

"about a year ago i met this really amazing man at work. i felt like we clicked instantly and as soon as we started talking it just never stopped. i had genuinely never felt this way towards a man before and it was just an amazing feeling. the thing is, he had a girlfriend of 7 years that he never mentioned to me but i heard about from our coworker. i tried to keep my feelings to the side and went on group hangouts that included him and his girlfriend. i had told him i didn’t want to hang anymore because i felt some type of way about him and i didn’t want to be disrespectful to his relationship. he was persistent though and wanted to remain friends and said it could be platonic. we started going out with our coworkers more(without his gf), drinking a lot, staying out late, etc. we would all be out until like 4 am or crash at a coworkers. then he started hinting that he may have feelings for me too and saying things like he’s never gonna get married(even tho his gf assumed it would happen.) this is all happening within a month. the night of nye we go out with our coworkers and end up drinking a lot. his gf was supposed to meet up with us but ended up going home. him and i went back to our coworkers and slept on the couch. i did try to kiss him but he rejected it and i felt awful and profusely apologized in the morning. i was so worried he wouldn’t want to be friends anymore i felt so awful. (during the conversation thought he did admit that he had kissed one other girl during his relationship.) anyway, we’re still hanging out with our coworkers but he is texting me that he likes me and whatever. i said if he wanted to do anything then he needed to break up with his gf first. then him and i went to the movies and drank a bit, we got in his car after and we finally broke this tension we had for the last month. it was great and euphoric. i felt bad immediately after i had got home though. it was just so confusing because i had genuine, strong feelings for him. a few days later we slept together again and then talked about where to go from there. it was just emotional and messy and i felt bad about all of it. that same night he broke up with her and told her the truth. they were together 7 years. why couldn’t he had just broken up with her first if he wanted to “be with me”?? i have been cheated on so, so many times and i know exactly how she felt. it’s an awful feeling. him and i kind of slowed communication down a bit but he still was saying that he really likes me and wants me. so a week later we’re hanging out again and now almost a year later we are ending our relationship. it has been rocky because we didn’t start off on the best note plus we had unresolved issues from previous relationships. lately i have been feeling very guilty(?) or i don’t even know but i just wonder how his ex is. how she handled everything, how’s she doing now, the effects it’s had on her. i just really wish we had just waited until he broke up with her but he was too scared to do it. he had made it seem like he wanted out of it and it was more of a friendship at that point between them. i wish i could redo it all so we didn’t hurt someone in the process but things didn’t go well for me and him so maybe it’s our karma?

"Ok so I (17m) have a twin sister and if I’m being honest, our mom has always seemed more partial to her. She’s always far quicker to give her hugs and compliments and she seems a bit more emotionally distant to me. I’ve noticed it my whole life and I’ve tried not to let it bother me but things finally came to a head recently.

I don’t really wanna get into the inciting incident that started this (long story short, we’ve been looking at colleges and I was upset because it seemed like she wanted my sister to stay local more than she wanted me to) and I told her she loved my sister more than me our whole lives and she didn’t give a shit about me and I’m still not sure why.

Today she came in my room and asked if we could talk and she said there’s something she felt it was time to tell me. Then she opened up about her childhood (something she’s never done) and explained that her father abused her sexually and she had brothers who abused her too, and it instilled a deep distain towards men in her. She told me she’s been meaning to go to therapy and get help, but she told me it breaks her heart that she ever made me feel like she loved me less than my sister and she’s been trying my whole life to “get the fuck over it and grow up” and that “it breaks her heart that I haven’t had the mom I deserve.” She started crying and I hugged her and told her I loved her and she was a great mom and I was lucky to have her.

Afterwards I suggested we go out to dinner (just the two of us) and I could pay, and she said she’d take me up on that under the condition she’d pay. So we had a really nice dinner and we talked and I felt I connected with her in a way I hadn’t before. I can’t really explain it but I felt like I saw her and she saw me in a different (but good!) way.

Overall…gonna be honest, I feel terrible because I feel like I made her trauma all about me. She’s a wonderful person and I don’t know why I’d accuse her of not loving me like she loves my sister. Alls I know is that I’m gonna be better to her and understand she’s doing her best (as we all are).

"I (f19) decided to do a gap year after finishing school and ended up in a country that is vastly different from my home country in culture, behavior of people and in general just the way of living.

I was actually supposed to stay in that country and do the volunteer work that I signed up for until summer of 2024 but I went home early.

My decision to leave early was mainly fueled by my declining health. Due to the geographical region of the other country, I had some really severe and especially constant migraines that basically forced me to lay in bed all day when I didn't force myself to work. Medication wasn't helping me and so I arranged with my organisation to return to my country and seek treatment there.

Now while all of this had been happening, I had been living with a host family. I wasn't really enthusiastic about living with a family and rather wanted to live in a shared place with other volunteers (I was the only volunteer that was placed in a host family, despite the others wanting one and me refusing). Also the fact that the family seemed to just throw their money out of the window while I was raised to cherish every cent, really put me off but I still decided to give it a try.

For the first months, it went well. The parents and I talked about our cultures and differences, they laid down their rules about living in their house - my two duties were that I had to clean up after myself, teach them my culture and teach two of their children my native language while speaking English with their eldest child and the host father to improve their language skills. I didn't really have any expectations or rules, so that was pretty much it. 

But soon the first problems arose.

The host parents were nearly never there and I had almost no contact with them. Their maid that was there to clean the house and watch over the kids was often the only person I saw at all and soon I just became accostumbed to the fact that we were not really going to see each other much. I wasn't really upset about that, for me, it was actually easier that way because I didn't have to force myself into uncomfortable situations.

But once or twice when the parents were home, they really obsessed about what I had been doing since we last saw each other. Always asking questions, telling me to tell them more and and and. 

I was kind of thrilled that they actually seemed to care about it but the host mother was kind of weird about it. She only spoke the foreign language, so we had a pretty huge language barrier despite me actually knowing the basics and a little more of the language (but the dialect was weird there so that didn't help me much tbh) and even though I and basically everyone in the family told her to slow down and speak slower, she never did.

Sometimes she would say something in her language really fast, just to laugh after. And then when she noticed that I didn't understand what she said, she laughed even harder without explaining and then moved on.

In the beginning, this behavior didn't really faze me that much. It was just her way of talking and it must be pretty awkward for her to change her way of being just to communicate with me, so I understood her dilemma.

But the more the months moved on, the relationship between me and the host parents became kind of tense. They didn't just ask me what I did anymore, they confronted me and they always picked the most inconvenient times to interrogate me too, like they had some kind of sixth sense for it. It was terrible.

And then the situation in the host family changed drastically after something happened that I have only referred to as the 'shower incident'. 

One time when my host parents were away with their two youngest children - they had been away on a camping trip with the whole family and they had only told me like a few hours before their trip while planning of being away for a few days - their oldest child (m16) was still already back in the house. 

Maybe he was dropped of or something, I only heard doors opening and closing and saw him in the corner of my eye. We didn't talk.

Later in the evening, the family still hadn't been back, I decided to take a shower and then go to bed. But as soon as I had undressed and gotten into the shower, I noticed some small rectangular box lying on top of the shower. I thought of it as weird but tried to ignore it and just finish my shower. But eventually my curiosity won me over and I stood on tiptoes to take a glance at the device and find out what it was.

It was a mobile phone. Just lying there.

Immediately I had the thought that maybe the host family was trying to film me in the shower but I quickly shook that off. I didn't want to be an asshole by just assuming things and maybe it was just lying there. I didn't even know If it was recording.

So I actually climbed a little higher and took the phone of its position. It was in camera mode but didn't seem to be recording. At least there was no obviously blinking motion that showed any indication of it.

I set it down again and finished my shower but the feeling that something was off didn't let me relax until I checked that phone again.

And this time when I was checking the phone, I saw that the camera mode was showing me that some videos had been made earlier and there was a preview of them. So despite my bad feeling of snooping through someone's phone, I checked and watched the video. The mobile phone was actually perfectly placed to capture the entire shower (it was rather big) and I actually saw my host brother, the oldest child, put the phone there and keep arranging it to put it in the position it was in earlier. And then, after skipping through a large chunk of the video, I actually saw myself entering the shower, stare at the phone a few times and picking it up until this moment.

I immediately panicked.

I didn't want this video to remain on the phone, so like an idiot, I deleted the footage without taking any evidence or just keeping it until the host parents came back. I turned the phone off and left the bathroom, leaving the phone in an really obvious place in the bathroom (although hidden from view when you just walked into the bath but actually easy to spot when you stand in front of the shower) and went to my room.

My heart was racing and I honestly wasn't sure what to think. So I did the thing that I normally do when I encounter problems that I don't understand really well: I wrote messages to my friends and family.

I started with an an awkward 'Hey, I think I was just filmed in the shower?' because I was just so in denial that someone would ever film me or that I was ever going to be in a situation like this.

Nobody from my family was awake because of the time difference and most of my friends had the same problem but there was one childhood friend (also f19) of mine that was also in the same country doing a gap year and I hoped that she would reply soon.

While I waited, my host brother came to my room and asked me where his mobile phone was. I was confused. I told him I left it in the bathroom but he said he couldn't find it. So I went to the bathroom while nervously making small talk with him.

(HB=host brother)

Me: I changed the position of your phone because I took a shower  
HB: Oh? Was it recording?  
Me: Yes, it was. But I deleted the video  
HB: Oh... that was for a project for school

We found the phone immediately, no idea why he didn't find it before because It was still in that really obvious place and we bid each other good night.

I was instantely relieved that he had only filmed the shower for a school project and send follow-ups to friends and family: 'Nevermind, apparently it was an accident'... until my childhood friend replied.

I explained the situation to her and she immediately told me that the project thing was an excuse. I didn't believe her. But the more people responded to my text messages, the more I realized that literally everyone was thinking the same thing. He did it on purpose and I just fell for a really stupid excuse - also everyone was horrified. 

The days after that I couldn't stop thinking about it, I talked to more and more friends and even to my work friends that I had made in the country and everyone told me something different to do. 

My friends told me to talk to the host brother and confront him, my family told me to tell the parents and a few people told me to just man-up and forget it happened. They also reminded me that just because I had deleted the video, it truly wasn't completely gone and I felt like such an idiot because I had forgotten about that part :)

I knew I wanted to talk about it with the family but honestly? Talking to the host brother made me really uncomfortable, despite knowing that going directly to his parents was an asshole move. And I am really sorry about that but I thought I could be selfish just this once in that situation.

I told the host father. Him and me had always a rather positive relationship, even though he was even more often gone than his wife.

Talking about the situation kind of felt like reciting a movie you had seen, at this point I had talked to so many people about this (in multiple languages even) that I just wanted to be done with it. He took me seriously, he believed me and told me, he wanted to talk to his wife first and then approach me together with her. I told him that I only wanted them to speak to their son but he shouldn't get into trouble because of this. He's only 16 and we all have probably done some stupid things when we were young.

The same evening, the parents both knocked on my bedroom door after I had already gotten ready for bed. They asked me to come down and have a conversation about what happened and I agreed.

After getting dressed real quick, I came down the stairs and was greeted with the sight of both the host parents sitting on a couch, their son beside them and an empty recliner for me. I felt so awkward sitting down and although I'm not really a nervous person, holding eye contact was pretty much impossible in that moment.

They took turns apologizing to me. The father told me that this was serious and he didn't want me to report them: 'Let's just start anew and act like the family we are. We can move past this.', the mother used Google Translate to speak to me which made everything even more awkward because she kept making dramatic pauses which obviously led to Google Translate cutting her off in the middle of her sentences and the host brother told me: 'Don't worry, I didn't watch the video and here's my phone, so you can empty my trash can. I want us to move past this and get to know each other as brother and sister'. 

Honestly, that last sentence from the host brother kind of gave me the creeps but I nodded along to each and every apology. The host father asked me how I felt about the situation and I just said that I'm glad we cleared it up and that we can move past it.

And after I had said that, the host mother immediately changed gears so fast, I almost got a whiplash. One moment we were talking about the shower incident and the other moment we were suddenly talking about how distanced we had become and this was not a famly and how this was my fault because I didn't try hard enough. I was confused and honestly exhausted, so I promised that I would do better just to be able to go to sleep.

I was looking forward to a normal atmosphere. After all, I didn't really feel weird about the situation and only friends and family of mine made a big deal out of it - I wasn't upset.

But the host mother obviously was. She berated me for little things that they didn't even tell me about in the first place. Apparently she wanted us to separate our clothes in the wash and she had always wanted that? That rule had never come up before and she basically screamed at me when I did it 'wrong'.

Now, this was only the time when my health basically took a slide into a pit. I was always tired and the only thing I did, was get up, work, watch Youtube, sleep and repeat. And this went on for months.

I told my host family that I wasn't feeling well and after talking about if with my family back home, I decided I wanted to go home.

I sought out my host family and basically cornered them in the kitchen one morning, to explain to them that my health wasn't getting better here and the doctor appointments (I'm used to free health care) while being very expensive didn't help me at all. I directly told them and even in their native language that I am going to go home, this is my plan.

They were very quiet but they seemed to have accepted it.

Boy, was I wrong.

I went to my organisation, I went to doctor after doctor after doctor just to figure out what's wrong with me, so I was able to leave eventually and then one evening, after I came home really late and stood infront of a closed gate and had to wait for one of the family members to return home, everything escalated.

In the past, there were a lot of times when I had to wait infront of the closed gate to the house. I never got a key to the house and only got an app to open the door for a few weeks until that code ran out. So I was kind of used to waiting. At some times I stood infront of the door for multiple hours in the cold, while nobody responded to my text messages or my inqueries when they were going to come home.

So this evening, after waiting a few hours in the cold, I was kind of fed up already. And sadly, my host mother took that evening to force me into another discussion about how much she hates my attitude in this family and how much of a brat I had been.

But this time she didn't just accuss me, she actively asked for my opinion. 'Why do you think our relationship doesn't work?! Tell me your opinion!', I told her that we are just too different and things like that just happened.

She then asked me multiple times to come up with a solution - she probably wanted me to apologize and promise to do better but I already knew that 1) I was not going to do that because I don't grovel at someone's feet and 2) I was going to leave in a few weeks tops anyways - and I told her that It didn't really make sense for me to change my behavior in the last weeks because I'm going to go home soon.

She blew up on me - told me that they wasted their time with me and could have had someone better, that my family is fricked because I have no manners and no social skills and that I was a brat for not letting them know that I was leaving.

I reminded her that I DID let them know that I was leaving. They were the first to know actually and that I was sorry for their experience and that I would get out of their hair as soon as possible, I was even going to ask my organisation to sleep at their office where some one bed was free.

She told me that she didn't want me to leave, she wanted a solution to which I replied that I had none except stay at the office for the last nights and that interrogation actually repeated multiple rounds.

In the end, she told me that she was going to speak with my organisation to improve my behavior and we were all going to have a conversation together and fix this situation. And as an afterthought, she again reminded me that we had to separate our clothes because and I fricking quote: 'My son is not going to behave If we don't do that'.

I don't know what she meant by that and I didn't ask.

During this entire conversation I had stayed completely calm, I never lost my temper and I speak to her politely despite her actually insulting my family right into my face. But I knew that I just couldn't stay in this house any longer.

The next day I actually had to meet up with a person from my organisation for another doctor's appointment and told them pretty much everything about what was happening in the host family, including the shower incident which I had kept secret for months. I begged them to let me sleep in the office and they agreed.

Apparently the host mother didn't go to the office person like she had threatened and so the office person basically ran their door down to get me out of this house.

I packed my things and the day after tomorrow I was out of the house and could finally breath again. I hadn't even noticed that I was always tense in that house and basically always on my guard. And being again with the other volunteers helping my mental health extremely.

It took one to two weeks and I just came back exactly 10 days ago. Finally back again in my country and with my family and my migraines have softened while I'm currently looking for a doctor.

I could have maybe acted better in some situations and maybe I was a dick to them in some moments. I feel kind of bad not writing them goodbye messages (they suddenly left the house when I was supposed to be picked up, so we didn't tell each other goodbye) and maybe the host father deserves some kind of explanation about this whole thing but honestly? I'm also really glad it's over.

Tonight I (19F) sat down with my boyfriend (18M) and his parents to talk because I could tell there was tension between me and his parents. I basically told them about how I feel like I get blamed for things my boyfriend does. For example I have pretty severe anxiety and he has a pretty big family so sometimes I need breaks from that and I will remove myself from everyone else and go calm down and normally my boyfriend follows me to make sure I am okay. While I appreciate it I have never asked my boyfriend to do that and in fact I always tell him to go back and spend time with his family. His parents especially his mom think that I am taking advantage of the fact that he cares about me and that I am taking him away from the family. Like I said I never make my boyfriend follow me or come with me when I need space from his family!! They literally said that they think I am manipulating him! Like if they have such a big problem with my boyfriend checking on me then that is something they need to take up with him not blame me!

"I (20F) am currently in university. My story began a few months ago while I was studying in the campus library. A guy randomly approached me and asked If I could chat with him. I didn’t want to come off as rude and said sure. He seemed like a nice guy and had many stories to tell. We talked for a good 2-3 hours. He talked about how he’s currently struggling with his family and that he’s not very outgoing. He then talks about how repetitive his life is. I felt sorry for him and as a nursing student i felt it was my duty to provide some sort of moral support. After our chat he asked for my socials and I gave him my insta.

I didn’t want him to think i was leading him on so i said “You seem like a nice guy but sorry I am not interested in anything romantic”. He replies soon afterwards. I was afraid to read the message because typically in the past when i reject a guy they would immediately become hostile and aggressive towards me.

"Tw for mentions of mental abuse, physical abuse, and slight mention of sexual assault



My mother and i have had a strained relationship for a veryyyy long time

She mentally and emotionally abused me for a long time, she would scream at me, degrade me, fatshame me. She once even called me an attention whore when my therapist told her i was feeling suicidal (she even saw my self harm scars and still called me that) she used to scream at me after i pulled 15 hour shifts for not washing my siblings dishes

She made me raise my siblings
Making me grow up a lot faster than i was ready for. I took on a lot of responsibility from such a young age.

She would also bring shitty men into our family that hated me / treated me bad or were down right weird to me

She also never thought my brothers could do wrong. She always said they were in the right and took their side, she always left them alone with me and this led to me getting harassed, severly bullied and at one point even sexually assaulted by one of my brothers. She never really knew, yet when i dropped hints she was adamant he did no wrong. And knowing she would never fault him for what he did to me i just. It sucked.


Anyway that is just the short of it, cut to years later and a couple weeks ago we had a long talk that started from her asking if she was a shitty mom. I was hesitant to say yes cause she threatened to kill herself once before, but i decided to be honest, i told her all the shitty things she had done to me, the way i felt and how badly it fucked me up

And she ? Apologized. This is a woman who has never backed down from an argument who always told me i was in the wrong. She apologized and i was shocked. She even asked for forgiveness 

Now im struggling with the what do i do yknow. Idk if i forgive her, or i keep our relationship as minimal as i have been. I do miss her, i crave that mother, daughter bond. But part of me is also scared that its all gonna turn around and be the same and im gonna end up getting abused.

I don’t have plans, but I no longer have that feeling of ‘as much as I want to kill myself, I won’t’. It’s morphed into ‘I am ready to free fall, I am ready to let it happen.’  The feeling of resistance is gone, and instead it’s been replaced with a welcoming sense of relief, like I’ve been waiting for this moment of acceptance. Acceptance that it’s going to happen. Instead of that feeling of I can’t let it happen.

Lately, I haven't been able to stop fantasizing about being single again. I feel like everything should be great with us. We have overlapping hobbies but also our own interests, we spend a lot of quality time together, we go out, we communicate well, we are on the same page about big life decisions like children, etc. We are on the route to marriage too. We had set a soft timeline around the end of 2024 to start thinking about proposals.

Despite this, something still feels like it's missing. Like any relationship, there are downsides. She doesn't always show interest in what I'm saying, she can be careless and forgetful, she is pretty clumsy. There are also some health components that prevent her from doing things like hiking or really any traveling in less accessible countries/cities. I typically go with friends for hiking and she needs a wheelchair for trips which can be... frustrating as the designated pusher. But I also know she hates it and would never choose this if she didn't have to.

What I'm really worried about is that I'm attributing personal mental health issues to her. I suffer from a lot of anxiety around health and finances. Last week I had a pretty bad breakdown about stagnation in my life and almost made some extreme, rash decisions but calmed down and talked to some friends. Since then I can't sleep without melatonin which I've never had to take before. Part of this was also what I think was guilt about my thoughts of breaking up with her. Long story short, I have a plan of action regarding my anxiety that is really helping me put priorities in order. The one thing I'm stuck on is whether I continue this relationship.

It feels like I love her, but maybe I'm not in love with her? I deeply cherish our quality time in the moment, but am so relieved whenever I can be alone. I feel terrible thinking about what she would do if I broke up with her. She makes jokes about dying, and she also makes very little money compared to me and we are in a HCOL area.

I'm completely flummoxed. Every day my mind flipflops on what to do. I know I shouldn't make rash decisions but I also don't know how long I'm supposed to wait. Will I ever 'know' she's the one? Is it normal to fantasize about being single? I feel very lost and afraid but I don't want to string her along while I'm just sitting here thinking about a life without her.",I can't stop thinking about breaking up with my long term GF,18o8j8z,1703226812.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o8j8z/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my/,
"Like the title says, I truly want to end it all I’ve struggled with mental health problems all my life and I always believed it would get better but even now that I feel like my life is all around better then it used to be I still want to kill my self. 

There are some things I just can’t change about me and it has ruined my confidence and self esteem so bad to the point it’s mentally draining and I want to end it all. The only things that prevented me from going through with it earlier this year was my mom and my dog, and my mother had since passed away and I know I will never have a person in my corner or support and help me like that again. 

I believe at this point in life I am just a waste of a person, and hopefully I can build up the courage to go through with it next year.",I really want to kill myself,18o8gue,1703226569.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o8gue/i_really_want_to_kill_myself/,
"So after the comments on previous part, I decided to confront her. I asked her why is she distant all this time after I stopped talking to her once. And told her that I think she is still hurt. She said that she is still not over that and definitely affected how's she taking to me now. She also said that we are good now but there's a lot of work and she is getting stressed and tired. ""I'm just getting older"" she said. What do you think this means?",I have an unusual relation with my dad's secretary part 2,18o8dhe,1703226203.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o8dhe/i_have_an_unusual_relation_with_my_dads_secretary/,
"On my last post when I explained my mistakes, I was told several times that it was clear she wouldn’t divorce me so I needed to do it myself and tell her it was “because she deserves someone better.” Which I truly believe she does. However, even after everything she found out, she told me she was still willing to try and work on things together. But she did say that she has given me “way way too many chances and the next mistake that happens she’ll turn my ass in for all its worth.” Which I think is fair I guess. 

Now, I never had sex with this chick from the bar. Granted, I asked to, but bottom line is I didn’t. We just kissed and talked. And like I said, my wife will come here soon to visit me. 

For those who don’t know, in the military, adultery is against the law. The last person in our section who got caught cheating went from an E7 to an E1 and now lives in the barracks at 53 years old. My wife has all the power in the world to do the same to me if she wanted to. She literally has 109 screenshots saved to an album “just incase.” 

Back to the topic of my wife visiting, she told me that I needed to get an STD test because of how big of an issue AIDS is here. She said she wasn’t even willing to kiss me if I didn’t, as many STDs are transferable by mouth. Normally, I would take a test no problem. However, here, I can’t. It would be an automatic article 15 and open case because of the infidelity rule. I told my wife this and that she would either need to just trust me, or get herself tested when she gets back home if it’s that big of a deal. I get that telling her she should just test herself may have been harsh, but I really don’t have anything to test for. 

(Edit: wife just sent me a clinic in the city we will be staying in where it can be done completely private. as soon as she is here I will be going and getting tested. she said “I know you aren’t too stupid to use google. Pull your big fat skull out from between your ass cheeks and think.” hope you all are enjoying my beating because I’ll take it for as long as I have to.)

Also, I’m fully aware I deserve it, but damn my wife has been ruthlessly mean. For example, when I told her I would be unable to get the test and why, this was her response:

So you mean to say maybe you shouldn’t have done what you did? Like it’s against your literal job. Does it make you worry at all that you fucked me over and I have all the power in the world to take everything away from you because of it? And not just a “drunk kiss” but begging for sex with another girl, talking to her for multiple day by going out of your way and using your friends phone and secret apps. Like I thought at the very least you cared about losing your career. At least when I asked why you wouldn’t cheat before you would literally say “because I would lose everything and I love you” but you just couldn’t care less about losing everything. To you it was fucking worth it you disgusting pig. But like I said. If you won’t get tested I’m not doing anything with you. I don’t want your chlamydia or aids. Also don’t ever tell me I need to trust you again. 

She’s also been bullying me a bit in subtle ways. Telling me things like “I wish I had your shoulders. They’re just so nice and feminine.” And “your confidence is a bit too tall for you right now.” She really likes to ask if I’m keeping up, or if she needs to go back and explain in a simpler way for me when she’s talking about really normal stuff that most people know. And the one that really digs in is “You may have the size to cheat, but I can’t believe you’re so willing to show another person how fast you finish. If I were you that is the last thing I’d be willing to do. That’s so embarrassing for you.” 
That one stings. But if it helps her blow off steam then it’s ok. It does make me nervous that she’s generally is pretty vanilla, and now all of a sudden is very interested in trying cock and ball torture.",UPDATE: I cheated on my wife and she now knows,18o8c2s,1703226059.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o8c2s/update_i_cheated_on_my_wife_and_she_now_knows/,
"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now. Things have been rough recently and I guess I'm feeling a little neglected, I want us to work and I try to work on things but I feel like it's one sided. If I tell him there's an issue he just ignores it or pretends like it's not that serious. It seems like he tries to ignore whatever is making me upset until it goes away but if I don't talk about it or don't see a change then I'll never get over whatever's upsetting me. It's starting to make me resentful, I really want to fix these things before it goes too far but I don't know how to make him understand things are bad. I've already tried to explain to him that things are bad enough that I'm close to leaving if he doesn't work with me on our problems but I don't think he's taking me seriously.

So for the past few months one of my coworkers has started texting me more and flirting with me, basically he's made it pretty clear that he wants to sleep with me. I haven't exactly said no either or done anything to stop his advances. I don't want a relationship with him or anything but I am attracted to him and recently I guess I've been flirting back. It's even worse because he also has a girlfriend. I feel bad for her sometimes but it almost makes it more exciting in a way and I feel like no one would ever find out because he also has a lot to lose if we slept together and it ever got out. I know even thinking this far into it and considering having sex with him is already going too far but I'm thinking about it more and more recently as things seem to keep declining in my relationship. Sneaking over his house or having sex at work, hiding that from everyone, It just seems exciting, even just sneaking and texting him right in front of other people gets me kind of excited. I know I need to just shut it down but part of me doesn't want to. I like that he's attracted to me and giving me attention and I like the sexual tension and sneaking around. 

I know how this sounds and I'll probably get told I should just leave my boyfriend but I don't want to, I still love him and I do still want to work on things, I just dont know how to make it clear to him that he needs to work with me. Telling him what I'm feeling isn't really an option, as he also works with this coworker and it will just mess up everything at work (any of us leaving this job is off the table as well) plus I feel like he won't trust me anymore so it'll ruin things further, it might even end our relationship right then and there. I know I'll feel guilty if I did ever do anything with this coworker but i cant help but think about it still. I'm not sure if things are even fixable at this point or if this relationship is already doomed but I can't help but keep trying for now.

I'm not sure what I was hoping to get from posting this, I guess I just really wanted to write this out. I used to journal but I don't feel safe keeping one in the house anymore since me and my boyfriend live together and I wouldn't want him to find it and possibly read this.",I've been thinking about cheating on my boyfriend with one of my coworkers.,18o8b4g,1703225962.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o8b4g/ive_been_thinking_about_cheating_on_my_boyfriend/,
"“Always a bridesmaid never a bride” sort of deal. I never had a partner in my life, or even a fling, and the very few people that actually showed interest in me were the kind of people that I knew I weren’t compatible with. And then I see some of the most gorgeous people ever that I feel I see a happy future with, and I will never be in their league. My expectations are too high where I won’t settle for someone who treats me like shit and brings out the worst in me, but then my own lack of self worth keeps me from showing interest in people I feel attracted to. I’m perpetually in that area where my expectations are too high but also my self esteem is too low.

School dances went by and I had nobody to go with. Prom happened months ago, and I didn’t even bother because I didn’t have a prom date, and all of the very few friends I had did have partners. I knew I would be too nervous on my own and would be too awkward as a third wheel, so I didn’t even go.

Everyone I know tells me I’m beautiful, funny, and smart, but if that’s true, where are the people who would love me romantically for these qualities? All my life, I’ve watched my friends pair off with people they have a genuine connection with. When will I have that connection? When will I be able to know what that feels like? It hurts so much, and nobody I could talk to would understand this kind of hurt because they’ve all dated or had a fling with someone at least once. Someone I could wake up beside, someone I could snuggle with and watch movies with, someone I could actually have romantic love for.

It’s not even a matter of me just not finding that someone yet. How long is ‘yet’? How long must I feel like I’m undesirable before I finally get that confirmation? I’m so tired of being the bridesmaid. I’m so tired of being the one watching those around me go into happy and loving relationships while my love life is nonexistent.

"On mobile so sorry for any mistakes 

So today I found out from my teammate in a sport I do, that my former coach who had stopped working with us because I had thought he had just had a kid and was feeling depressed staying away from his family, actually stopped coaching me and my teammate for a completely, much worse, much more disgusting reason. If any one knows what safe sport is, it’s a program in America that protects athletes from bullying, grooming, sexual assault etc. me and my teammate have been working with this coach for quite some time , about 2 ish years. We stopped working with them 3 years ago. The real reason we stopped, is why I’m sitting here unable to sleep, feeling sick to my stomach, is because he was grooming my teammate whom I am very close to. Apparently he had confided to someone that he was in love with them and wanted to leave their family for them, a minor. Looking back on it, I now see all the fucking signs and I can just feel to immense guilt that maybe I could’ve prevented this, I am so thankful to the person who actually reported my coach to safes port and practically saved my teammate from a life altering situation. This may have happened a while ago but I kept in contact with this coach and have received help from them a bunch, I have already blocked them on social media and other sources but it’s still so hard for me to process.

I was a horrible person when I was younger (about 10 to 15) I used to lie, cheat, manipulate, anything I could do to make people love me. Until I started going to therapy at the start of sophomore year because I hurt two people I loved. Now I am 18f (about to 19) and I have a pretty good understanding of what is bad and what is good. I got better at telling the truth and choosing what to do in a good way, and I’ve stuck by it. But now I’m living with the regret and guilt of what I did, to the point where I want to end my life.

I’m sure this will be fairly normal to others (maybe) but I been dreaming most nights of meeting other men that I find attractive and wake up so dazed and content over my dreams. I end up thinking about them all day thinking what if there was more men to meet. I’m a 30yo Female and I guess I didn’t have a huge dating history. I was shy for most of my life and had two not so serious boyfriends before my 20s. I met my now husband when I was 26 and let’s say he was not my type I was looking for someone different in every way. Somehow I decided to stay within my culture and play it safe.

"I already know this is a problem related to my low self steam and insecurities but I really need to talk about it and get to know other perspectives. Basically I started dating this guy, before that we had been friends over almost two years. I was so happy the moment he corresponded my feelings but since we started as a couple I started feeling so self conscious, now I have this anxiety of being perfect with him... The other thing is that I have developed this feeling that he fell for an idea about me and not me and now he is realizing that I'm not what he thought I was, and that hurts me because one of the things he said he liked about me is my smartness... what if I'm not as smart as he thought? If I'm not the only thing that is left is a pretty face, and I hate that feeling because if that's the case then I'm just an empty vase . Thirdly, my parents are really strict so I haven't experienced the same stuff as him so at this point I just see myself as someone inferior who isn't worth of his love, every time he sais he loves me I feel like he is obliging himself to say so or idk  because he in order to date with me had to do some sacrifices and know that he has realized that I'm not what he thought is forcing himself to love me so the sacrifice he made doesn't go to waste, is that I don't feel he is as attentive as he used to in comparison with the start of the relationship. Overall I feel stupid and ridiculous, he hasn't said or done something to make me feel that way but I can't prevent myself from comparing me to his ex-girlfriends and friends :(, for example we were playing a video game and I wasn't really good at it because it was my first time playing it, he kinda got frustrated due my stupidness while playing it and I couldn't stop imagining that he was thinking how much of a better experience was playing with this other girl...

My partner (24M) and I (23F) are in a long distance relationship. We didn't start long distance and we won't stay long distance. We work for the same organization but got different job locations - sucks but it happens.

Today we both had the day off and spent close to 3 hours on FaceTime catching up about our news from the last week and I happened to mention that I restocked on condoms.

For some context, when we lived together our sex life was great. We have similar libidos and like to try new things. We learned what made each other tick, what we liked, don't like, some things we always wanted to try. He wanted to try shower sex, I said sure! Despite what some people have to say about friction or whatever it worked out great for us. So we had our fun showers from time to time.

Back to the point, he excused himself from the call to shower  and I told him to have fun ;). A few minutes later I received a few explicit texts from him about what he would do to me if I were there and some plans of what he's going to do next time he visits me.

"Hello. I know i sound like an asshole, but my roommate is truly the most insufferable person to unfortunately be stuck with for an entire school year. 

Me (F18) and my roommate (F19) were paired as roommates through our college’s roommate portal. I chose the room first, then she chose me when she saw we were close in age and what not. 

We were paired in May of 2023 and at first she seemed okay, a little boring maybe. Though however I noticed after our first time facetiming in June 2023 that she trauma dumps a lot. (About her ex boyfriend, her childhood, etc.) Without warning, and without permission. 

I was like “maybe it was just a one time thing”, but we ended up facetiming a total of 3 times before move in and she did it EVERY time. I figured it was her only flaw, as she spoke very highly about her cleanliness and we agreed on all expectations. 

After we moved in August, things were going okay but i noticed every friend i had over, she absolutely couldn’t go ten minutes without finding a way to tell them about her ex boyfriend and how he cheated on her. 

It got old and annoying really fast, but i just rolled my eyes and went on, i apologized to my friends for her behavior later in private. 

I don’t smoke, but my boyfriend at the time definitely did. So does my roommate. She would constantly beg to smoke with him and use his weed but never provide anything in return. He hated it as well. He usually said no. 

We both vape however, and she goes through disposables a lot faster than i do so the moment hers is burnt, she is begging to hit mine. I’ll say fine whatever, but instead of just taking a hit or two off of it she will proceed to hold it for an hour and constantly use it until i have to ask have it back. 

I got sick of this very fast so i once hid my vape inside the front pocket of my bag and told her i lost it when she asked to hit it. She started looking all over my side of the dorm and i told her to stop, and she did. i then had to go down stairs to do laundry and when i got back upstairs she was holding my vape and she goes “look i found it”. I asked where it was (even though i already knew) and she said it was in my bag. I looked at her and rudely said “why the fuck were you looking in my bag”. 

we also take turn doing the dishes. i last did the dishes before thanksgiving. she still has not done the dishes. she said a week ago that she was going to, hasn’t yet. we don’t accumulate a lot since we live in the dorm, but it’s still fucking disgusting. 

my neighbor across the hall is a close friend of mine. my roommate assumed since we all hung out together one time that now she was best friends with my neighbor as well. everyday like clock work she would declare she was going to talk to my neighbor and would stay in her room for hours trauma dumping and doing all the things. one time my roommate texted my neighbor and asked if she could borrow something, my neighbor was gone so she said my roommate could go into her room and grab it. but what my roommate actually did was dig through my neighbor’s desk drawer and found most empty carts (for a dab pen) and took them. 

i didn’t know about this until more recently, when i learned that my neighbor also hates my roommate. because my roommate will come into her room even when my neighbor is SLEEPING. and hangout in there. (i’m still so shocked by this). 

anyway, my roommate, my neighbor and i had briefly talked about getting a 3 bedroom apartment together. i had found the best apartment within our agreed budget and have been working towards it. however my roommate keeps saying things like “IF this happens” or “just remember we might not be able to”. Because she doesn’t make nearly as much money as my neighbor and i do. which is fine, her job does give her hours. but that’s her fault for staying at a job that never schedules her. 

we all agreed to save money, but my roommate is TERRIBLE at saving. she will get paid and then turn around and spend all of her money AT HER JOB (it’s a retail store). then start complaining when she can’t afford necessities. (ie. gas, laundry soap, etc.)

also not to mention, i was doing all the work when it came to apartment hunting, setting up tours, talking to managers, doing math for how much it’d cost, etc. 

my roommate has the audacity to say she deserves the master bedroom because she “has the most stuff”. however, she makes the least amount of money, and has contributed nothing into researching for this. 

(my neighbor doesn’t care what room she gets). I argued that i deserve the master because i’ve done all the work for looking it up, and i’m even willing to pay a little extra in rent to have it. i told her it wasn’t my fault that she has more things because her family is more well off and buys her more stuff than my family ever could, and that she wastes all her money buying perfumes and stuff from her job. she said i was ‘making up excuses’ for why i should get the master bedroom.

"Back when I was about 19 years old or so, I was attending my local community college, working on getting my Associates degree (in preparation to attend a larger university). While I was studying, I met a girl who was in one of my classes.  

We connected instantly, and even had rhyming names. We started to talk in class, and I honestly felt like she had every possible quality that I've ever wanted in a significant other. It seemed like we had so much in common, including our sense of humor and personal values. 

I found out that she was younger than me though (around 16 years old, studying at the community college to earn credits for college earlier in her academic career). Knowing that this relationship wouldn't really be morally right, I stopped talking to her, left for a different university, and moved on with my life.

I never saw her again after that, but I noticed one day that her personal facebook profile was suddenly in my ""people you may know"" sidebar. Curiosity got the best of me, so I took a look. From what I could tell, she had all of the same qualities from before, but (of course) got even better over the years. It killed me to see that she is now married, and has children of her own. While I know it just wasn't meant to be, I couldn't help but feel sad about it.

I can't help but look back and wonder ""what might have been."" Everyone I've ever dated has been a huge (if not massive) disappointment to me, and here I am at 28, nowhere near marriage, having a family, or anything of the sort. I guess I just wish we would have connected again someday, but it wasn't meant to be.",I missed my chance with the girl of my dreams,18o7drd,1703222534.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o7drd/i_missed_my_chance_with_the_girl_of_my_dreams/,

"In our six months together, I've found profound love for my girlfriend, who battles chronic conditions such as endometriosis and mental health issues. Despite my sincere efforts to be a supportive partner, I occasionally sense a disconnect, fostering moments of isolation. Her health challenges, particularly during the three weeks of each month, make planning dates or engaging in typical couple activities challenging. While she battles pain episodes at home, she seldom invites me over for comfort or support. Intimacy has yet to unfold in our relationship. I am committed to providing unwavering support, but I find myself reflecting on the long-term impact.

"I (F24) had a heavy drinking problem when I was in high school. Heavy as in I would walk into class hungover half the week. I had been sexually abused the summer after my freshman year, and I turned to alcohol as a solution. It took me a long time to quit, but I did, and I was really damn proud of myself. 

My boyfriend (M23) and I got into an argument. We’re currently long distance, and I got upset with him because I felt like he’s felt distant lately, and when I asked him about it, he promised to spend more time with me (as much as we could over a Skype call). However, he didn’t follow through on this promise, and I got upset, and I told him I was upset. 

He hasn’t spoken to me in four days now. I tried giving him space for the first two, but I’ve texted him four times now since, and he’s opening my messages but not responding. 

I love him more than anything, and I’m so scared this is over. I just miss him. I hate fighting with him. For the first time in seven years, I started drinking again.

"I 21M have been seeing a girl 23F for a couple weeks, we met on tinder and it's been really good. We've been on several dates and she's stayed over at my place a few times. But recently I can't stop thinking about ending things with her. She's been in several abusive relationships and I think I might be one of the few guys that won't abuse her.

The other night she ended up coming to where I work with a couple of her friends so I could meet them. It wqs going fine until her friend got a call and started having a breakdown. Me and the girl's boyfriend weren't very comfortable with the situation but tried to comfort them the best we could. The two of them eventually left and it was just me and the girl I've been seeing.

I ended up riding my bike to work since I was low on gas, so we walked to a gas station where I left her for 10 minutes to go grab my car to drive her home. On the walk there she kept telling me how much of a good guy I am and that she loves me. I've only known her for 3 weeks. I know everyone takes things at their own pace, but I'm not comfortable with things moving this fast.

Everyone I talk to says I should just leave her high and dry, but I can't just do that, I got her a Christmas gift as we have become very good friends (at least that's how I see it). We are technically exclusive although we are not together. I did however throw the term ""non-verbal esculsivity"" and I think she took that as dating. She keeps calling me her boyfriend while I have never called her my girlfriend. Everytime some asks if I'm her boyfriend I always respond with ""I'm the guy she's seeing"" or ""I guess"". I don't think I can keep this going as I don't feel that way nor do I think I can. I am still very much not over my ex who dumped me two months ago and because of this I don't think I can love her.

We have plans to go shopping and do a white elephant on Saturday and I'm thinking of telling her afterwards. I don't know what else to do. She's really sweet and I hope to God that she finds someone who will love her the way she thinks she loves me. I still like her, but I'm not comfortable doing anything anymore. Eveytime she kissed me, I could give her an actual kiss back. I feel disgusted with myself for letting it go on still.

On top of everything she has a history with drug abuse and she's been clean since she's met me. I don't want her to keep doing those things, and I'm certain she will if I end things. I don't want to hurt her, but I can't keep doing this. I will end things by the end of the month. I am going to talk to my therapist tomorrow and get her opinion.

"When I wake up I feel numb and that tends to be how I feel all the time. I try to be happy and confident but I'm not its an act and I'm tired. When in at school my friends never seam to want to be around me and my girlfriend won't really like to talk to me around others, she even denied that we were dating on time. I think shes ashamed to be with me, but I can rationalize this as her not wanting to be teased for dating another girl. At school im constantly made fun of and teachers do nothing even when they clearly hear or see it happen. The principle and office people seem to only talorate me since I come in there to try and talk about what's been happening but it's a lost cause because nothing happens. I lost faith that they would do anything about two years ago when the school police officer watched as kids threw things at me and beat me with lunch boxes, even getting mine and hitting me with it, two of the girls laughing as they recorded the boys doing that to me. It's not like I was on the ground or anything but I was a peaceful person  and just yelled for them to stop and ran to the officer asking if he would do anything and he just told me that he thought they were playing and acting as if it was fine and did NOTHING. When I got away and went to the bathroom I had to call my mom to get me. She threw a fit to the principle on the phone he said he would talk to them. Nothing happened to them and the video got around. I lost all hope for help from the school when I came to them about a boy threating me at lunch and bulling me any time I was near him a mean comment would come out of his mouth. The principles response was to tell me that he would talk to him and to tell me to move away from him in the cafeteria because he liked ti sit next to the door, he assured me that he would speak to the teachers that I had classes with him in to make sure that he wouldnt be sat near me. The teachers responses to that was to sit him next to me and to put me in a three week long project with him. But that was two years ago now I try to handle things myself in getting better at it but those things still haunt me. The only reason I started being outwardly rude to the people that were rude to me is because thing went to far and I'm done trying to be nice. Im done being scared to show up to school. What invoked the change was me bending over to sign my name on a fucking stupid paper for my teachers project and a boy who had been saying mean thing to me in the halls of  which I usually ignored, came up behind me taking a pencil and THRUSTING HIS FUCKING HIPS TOWARDS ME and I didn't even  fucking notice because he didn't actually touch me. I went back to my desk and sat with my friend who told me what had happened. I thought he was fucking with me at first but he was adamant and then my other friend said that she saw it as well. It was my first hour of the day and I nearly cried right then and there but I was in class and it was something stupid ti cry about. Then I talked to my friends in pe about it and they comforted me for a bit. But my then friend now gf was the only one who stayed and comforted me. She also checked up on me threw out the day. Now a days it's hard to be genuinely happy of excited about things. I mostly feel numb but sometimes I feel a happy. But it's hard to feel happy when you are usually left out or in group setting with your friends seaming put on the back burner like you're not even there. I'm not ashamed of who I am I just wish more people can tolerate me. Being called a fag in school hallways is not how I saw my year going.

"Apologies for the rant but haven’t talked about this w anyone so it’s gonna be long

Me (m21) and this girl (20) dated for nearly 2 years. We met on the first day of classes our freshman year of college and have been best friends ever since… we started dating a couple months later, first real relationship for both of us.

Anyways, this past summer we decided we needed some space from another — had been at each necks for a couple months. We talked about going forward in extensive detail and what it would mean for our relationship. I made it explicitly clear I did not want to be in a exclusive relationship with her if she got with someone else, BUT if she wanted to move on to just tell me ahead of time and that would be fine. She agreed with this and said the same was fine for me. We both made clear at this time that we wanted to be with each other still, and that we needed to have clear communication if otherwise. 

Back from summer. At first we spent less time with each other than before, but quickly we were back to our old ways. 
We were doing everything/acting like we did when we were a couple, though we weren’t “officially dating” or whatever. Things were going well, well to the point I was going to officially ask her to get back together 

One day before my birthday I find out she had kissed one of my friends and he slept over in her bed. She kept this behind my back for a month… (I found out through the good ole Freudian slip). Since I’ve heard both sides of the story I think I have a fairly accurate picture. Essentially, she came on to him multiple nights advertising herself as single, they made out for 2 minutes and she stopped it, he slept there but she slept on top of the sheets. I told her we were done and wanted anything I had at her place in a few days. 

Upon arriving at her apartment she had a long thing written down to read to me. She basically explained it as if she was drunk, never intended it to happen, but also brought up she never understood we were exclusive which I couldn’t believe (A: summer conversations, B: makes no sense in tandem, C: ik for a fact if I was with some girl and didn’t tell her she have been pissed af)

My trust just feels betrayed. This was literally the one thing I asked her not to do and yet she did it with my own friend. Irregardless of any miscommunication that may have happened (which I don’t think did) Forget her being my gf, I simply wouldn’t do that to her because I respect her too much as my best friend. Now that I’ve realized that wasn’t a two way street I just feel empty. 

I know her, and I can tell she genuinely feels terrible she hurt me and she wants everything to be like it used to be… I do too. She wants to be around me constantly even if I pay her no attention; she’ll just sit and wait in hope that I want to talk to her. Theres been a couple times where I’ve given her the cold shoulder and I can tell she’s holding back tears but doesn’t want me to see her cry. She still will wait. 

I still want to be with her, she says she wants to be with me, I don’t really care that any of this happened I’ve had way worse things happen to me in my life tbh. 

So no I don’t need a Time Machine but I do need to know if I can trust her… I don’t know if I can do that, or even if I should do that. The hard part really is I have no one to talk to but her, which just makes her feel bad and doesn’t give me any outside view point so please y’all comment some shit it’ll cheer me up. If you made it this far you’re a mf trooper here’s a gold star ⭐️

Last year, my mom told me to give her the gift card. So, I have been doing that for 2022 Sept to 2023 Apr or May. Around May or June, I started to spend it on things like snacks and drinks for myself and would stall when my mom would ask for it.

"I am completely alone in life. I genuinely have nobody. Since I don't have anybody to talk to, I'm just kinda writing this here. I have struggled with really high functioning depression for about 5 years, but it's been pretty bad these past few months (I'm not having suicidal thoughts. That would be selfish and the coward's way out). Love is something I have had a pretty constant struggle with all of my life, with women, family, and friends. My father has been very hard on me all of my life, especially in sports and school. He has called me an embarrassment several times and is not good with emotions. Nobody in my family really truly loves me, believes in me, or roots for me. I have had a few girlfriends and situaitonships, but nothing too serious. This is pretty sad since I turn 18 in like a month. I have also slept with a couple of women which isn't bad. I've had very major struggles with self-love. When I don't think that somebody I enjoy being around ejoys being around me, I get super down about it. Like it absolutely destroys me inside. This doesn't necessarily apply to rejection or romantic stuff, only really with friends. That's really all of the background that I need to get started.   


The roots of my current struggle go back to august, specifically the first few weeks. I was that guy mentally. I was confident, I was tan, and overall I just looked and felt the best I have had in my life. I met a girl in my math class (let's call her B). She was a very pretty girl. She was smart, funny, and absolutely gorgeous. I would say that we are in about the same league ( I'm like a 7/10 for a guy. Not super tall, but relatively muscular and I have a pretty good face, sense of humor, hair and sense of fashion). Anyways, we started talking. I won't lie, she made the first move. I was into her, but she really put the effort in to start something. She invited me over to a pool party she was throwing, and that's the first time we really hung out. We totally hit it off and became good friends that night. It was the start of something more for the both of us. We hung out a lot more over the course of the next month and eventually went on our first date. I remember I was so pumped, especially after she said that she would really like to go on one with me. The date went spectacular. We painted, has some dinner, and then ate some ice cream together. I drove her home, and then we shared a kiss. I will not lie, I am not a bad kisser. This kiss was not a good kiss, probably the worst that I've experienced. We both just kind of fucked it up. So we went our separate ways and agreed that the night was really fun. We both said we wanted a second date, but I guess that she didn't. We went on fall break and she basically ignored me for a week. What I mean by this is that B would message me a fraction of the amount that she would before the date. I trusted her when she said that it was because she was busy with work. I trusted my own feelings for her. I very rarely do this. Me opening up and trusting a girl with my feelings is incredibly uncommon. I usually keep my feelings to myself. Anyways, after the week of the near silent treatment, she texts me. Here's the jist of what she said (OVER SNAPCHAT BTW):  


*""Hey I really enjoy hanging out with you, but I've been thinking lately. I just feel like there isn't that romantic spark anymore. I do love hanging out with you, but I don't see us dating or as a couple. I genuinely care about you and value our friendship. I'm sorry."" -B*  


*""I'll just be honest and say that dating reminds me of my past relationship. I just feel like I'm not fully healed yet."" -B*  


*""But you're the sweetest person ever and I like spending time with you. I don't wanna lose you as a friend."" - B*  


*""Just be fr with me, was it something that I did?""? - me*  


*""No it's nothing that you did. I just can't control the way I feel about people sometimes and I am so sorry if I've hurt you."" -B*  


(This conversation is dated around October 15th)  


This was really rough for me. After some more chatting, I found out that she broke up with her ex 2 months prior to this (which was right about the end of summer break). That is literally days before we started talking and she invited me to hang out. B purposefully seeked me out for romantic purposes knowing that she wasn't fully healed, with absolutely no regard for how it would effect me in the long run. I was basically her rebound bitch, which hurts because she was so much more to me. It just sucks because this happens every single time with women I talk to. Once they get to know me, they leave. Now, I could be the problem, but whenever I ask if I did something wrong they always say that I did everything right. Every. Single. Fucking. Time. It's always ""You're the sweetest guy ever, but"" or some other bullshit. The sentence that they give me always ends in ""but"" and why they can't be with me. For weeks, this absolutely destroyed me. I was unloved and left high and dry. Just like every other time. Now, nothing really happened in November. It was actually a pretty damn good month for me. I improved myself physically and mentally and have gotten so much better at the sport that I participate in. But damn, sometimes I would look at the paintings we made and feel the pain. I wouldn't know why I felt this way. I still found B physically attractive, but I was over her emotionally. So I kept wondering, ""Why? Why do I still feel this hole in my heart when I think about when we were together?"" Not too long ago, (literally like last week) I came to a realization. I am over her, but I don't know if I will ever get over the way that she made me feel. The way she would look at me in the eyes with longing. I don't ever know if I'll get over the way that she loved me. This is something I am still struggling with.   
Now, we get to the major current issue(s). The first one is my dad. He is being an asshole. He really wanted me to get all A's this semester, but due to me struggling mentally (mainly because of the aforementioned shit), I couldn't pull it off. He doesn't know that I struggle mentally (almost nobody does). But even though he doesn't know that, maybe he would find out if he actually cared. I told him that I really want to care about my grades, but I don't. Instead of asking me why, here's what he said:  


*""So you're saying that you don't give a shit about this family? That you don't care about what happens to your brothers? Your mother? You're saying that you don't care about my health and that I should sit at a desk all day trying to put in work because you feel like being lazy? Do you want to be like your uncles always mooching off of me? Doing drugs out on the street and never making a legacy for yourself?""*  


Man, he can be a dick. I swear all this guy cares about is money. All he had to do was ask why I felt that way, not blowing up on me. Granted, if I told him he would still probably just say that I have no reason to be depressed and that it's embarrassing to him that I'm not a stronger son. If you're reading this dad: Fuck you. Now, we can get to the most current issue.   


My friend group no longer cares about me. It's made of of four people: P (17m), F (18m), A (17f), and A's friend J (17f). I can sort of tell that they no longer give a fuck about me. I'm the reason that P, F, and A all know each other, so that makes it a little more fucked up from my perspective. I've brought this up before to P, F, and A but they all just kind of brush me off. When I'll tell A about how I'm lonely and having trouble with women, she hits me with the ""maybe you should lower your standards"", basically saying that I'm uglier than I think that I am and to deal with it. She didn't always used to respond that way. F is just sort of too naïve to know that there's something wrong with me and just forgets to include me. One time he was telling me about how he felt left out of the friend group because he didn't get invited to another thing that he knew that P, A, and J were doing when I didn't even know that they were together. I called him out on this and he basically just went ""yeah, haha"" and that's it. P just kind of ignores me now unless we are talking about him. This one especially hurts because I've known him the longest and we are definitely the closest out of everybody. We are that one duo in like four different friend groups (most of which we are only sort of a part of). Sometimes I'll try to show him something cool, like a song that I learned or some other bullshit. Most of the time he'll just go ""OH!"" and play something cooler. With the stuff that he can't top me at, he just goes, ""That's super cool dude, but-"" and then completely changes the topic or says that we have to go do something. Whenever I confront any of them about this, they just hit me with the ""What? of course we love you rar37!"" and then don't correct their behavior. I think that they don't even realize that they don't give a fuck about me anymore. They say that they love me, but their actions say otherwise. This is sort of relevant to the other issues because usually I can talk to these guys for support when I'm struggling, but the past month or two I haven't really been able to.   


Just for perspective, I have to lie awake at night with this bullshit. Every single night. I get home from practice, I'll be tired, and I'll have no distractions. I have to think about how I am truly alone in this world and nobody will get it (because I believe that my circumstances are unique, even though that they probably aren't). For about two and a half months very single night, everything in this post goes through my mind every night.   


This shit is all sort of boiling over. The pressure from my father and the near complete lack of love and support in my life are absolutely crushing me. There are also lots of little things that I haven't mentioned that add up to this. I do have my escapes from this pain. It's mostly music, the sport that I play, and the friends I have through that sport. Those are literally the only reasons that I haven't gone insane these past few weeks, knowing that at least some people enjoy having me around. I've just had a rough go these past few months, but fuck it we ball. I'm strong enough to make it through this alone, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't suck a lot. Anyone who actually read this far, thanks for actually hearing me out. I appreciate you.   


TLDR; I went through some bullshit with a girl, my father has insurmountable expectations (just in general), and now my friend group is abandoning me. The added pressure of lots of little things and those big events in my life is effecting me a lot.

"first time posting here, I have no one to talk so I just want to let this out haha.
I (26) met this guy (28) a few years ago, he sent me a fb friendship request and we started talking, just like a lot of people of course, but we started to have a lot of complications to see each other. In 2020 we only saw each other one time, I have to say that he lives in an outside town which is 30-40 minutes away from where I live, I didn't feel we clicked or some kind of sparkles or whatever but we had something going on, I wanted to know more about him and I guess it was mutual. Then COVID started and it was impossible for him to visit so we stopped talking, he even had a girlfriend idk if that same year or the next one, so we forgot about each other for a while. Earlier on this year we started talking again, we've had also a few complications due to the same reasons on the past but even if we only saw each other two times this year we keep talking, and the last time he visited me I was really nervous and anxious because I showed up earlier than him, but the moment I saw him I forgot about everything in our surrounding, I felt so comfortable, we were joking and talking about this and that, this time I felt a lot of peace and I have to mention that's not something easy for me, I'm a super introverted human and I don't enjoy a lot when I'm with other people even if I've known them for years. That time we hang out I wanted to spend even more time with him and now I'm waiting to see him again, 
 I feel so overwhelmed with all these emotions that I didn't want to feel again, but it just happened and now I'm afraid that he's not so into me like I'm with him haha, and I also have to say that he has ADHD and because of that I think he might have difficulties to say a lot of things, emotionally talking of course, I'm a very chill girl so I just hope all this patience I've had with him is going to something good.

"First of all, I wanna thank everyone and their kind messages on my first post.  I've had amazing comments that really warmed my heart and made me able to see different sides of the story I didn't consider.  I didn't know so many people would mind, but thank you so so much.

I've had way too much messages about the topic I can't really keep up, but a lot of people asked about an update.  Sorry if I didn't answer you, going back to this is kinda hard mentally.  If you haven't read my initial post, go read it so I don't repeat myself.  It's a heavy subject and I don't necessarily find it fun to go back there you know.

Anyways, we spoke to my mom about the sexual abuse Anne did to my baby sister.  For those who wanted an update, I don't think it's the happy story you wanted.  My mom didn't have the best reaction ever.

You remember I told you I come from a dysfunctional background?  Well it hit again.  My mom blew a fuse, but didn't even contacted Anne.  She keeps the rage boiling inside of her and she's about to blow up.  To say she was angry is an understatement.  She started yelling, insulting Anne and Steph &amp; I just stood there.  It's like if she missed the whole point of the situation and decided to throw out the rage 3 people should've felt instead of just her.

She still invited Anne for the Christmas dinner (in 3 days, fuck) and to confront her in front of the whole family.  I'm mortified.  She's basically going to ridicule her in front of the whole family, at the family Christmas reunion.  I still can't wrap my head around it.

I didn't want to talk to Anne about it just yet.  I wanted Steph to give me the permission to do so, but she doesn't seem 100% against the idea of ridiculing Anne in front of everyone.  I also don't want to react and tell her, making my sister feel like I'm on her abuser's side.  It's not the case, but it doesn't feel right to just sit with that thought and not doing anything.

So now I'm stuck between 2 chairs:
● Either I say nothing and watch Anne being bashed by highly probably by my whole family on Christmas Eve ● I say something and I might ruin the trust my baby sister has finally gained for me while also making my mother turn super sayan.

"Medication doesn’t work. They’ve tried at least twenty different kinds of pills since I (19M) was six years old and every time the same thing happens: it briefly works and I show improvement, and then within a few months I’m back at square one. It’s been such a prominent pattern that even my former Psychiatrist noticed it and was utterly stumped as to why this is happening. 

  
I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me that I can’t function like a normal person. It’s like I’m in a constant state of being frozen; I can’t do work, I can’t make friends, I can’t even do things I enjoy. I am just perpetually trapped in my own fucking head, unable to break myself out of that paralysis that’s been progressively ruining my life. It’s always been like this, although it used to be minor enough that I could chalk it up to just being a procrastinator, but it’s only gotten worse as the years have gone by. It's gotten way past the point of just being procrastination.    
  
I’ve been on a massive downward spiral and honestly the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I’m afraid of the commitment.

"My (26F) boss (50F) is making me extremely uncomfortable at work. She discloses her sexual life to me often and shows me dating app screenshots of the men she’s sleeping around with. I try to engage as little as possible, usually just awkwardly laughing or making non-sexual anecdotes.

She rips me apart for escalating risks and issues to her (literally my job). She makes me repeat things over and over because she doesn’t understand IT terminology, but tells me I’m bad at articulating a thought. I was a teacher before I switched over to IT and was chosen to do company wide trainings because of my ability to explain complex ideas… I’ve become so passive with her to keep her calm, yet in front of a group she will still make weird remarks like “u/punctuationist loves to talk.” Or “u/punctuationist wants to show us up.” As if I’ve personally done something to upset her? 

Today, she said she wanted to take pictures of all of us (her team) to show her daughters. But she said this to only me and later in our meeting, she suddenly took out her phone and took a selfie with me. I awkwardly smiled because it happened so fast. She didn’t ask for consent, didn’t show me the message, just sent it. And throughout the rest of our one on one she kept picking up her phone and messaging her “daughters”. Another colleague had a one on one with her afterwards, I asked him if she did the same and he looked at me incredulously and said “no way, that’s so inappropriate.” 

I feel so violated. I’m the only woman on her team and the youngest by over 20 years. I feel like for weeks I’ve been broken down by her authoritarian leadership style with sporadic honey traps.

I have strong intuition that she does everything knowingly because I’m a young woman and peacekeeper. I know she’s on a power trip.

"I broke up with my ex a moth ago. I found conversations he was having with his exes and then logged into his instagram to find disgusting conversations with other women. One of these conversations had proof he cheated on me long ago. Throughout he relationship he was pretending he would not cheat and trying to make me look insecure for not trusting him. If you see my previous post, you’ll see what happened.

Well.. we have a project together. I feel I will be able to work with him in a little while and have been focusing on releasing the anger and resentment all his lies brought to my life. I’m ok with him in general, despite him not understanding why I don’t trust him (lol).

So today he came over to talk about the project. We had not spoken for 2 weeks. The conversation turned into a closure convo, where he told me that there are two truths: what he did was shit, but it is also “very common”. I was flabbergasted. Is this how someone justifies tricking another person into believing they are crazy and insecure for 1.5y? What sort of thought is that? How does that make anything better or acceptable?

"This post is harmless but I had to get it off my chest. They are bigger problems in the world but damn I never stop being amazed by how selfish and greedy my neighbors are. 

The apartment had a Christmas potluck and a white elephant exchange. The potluck was light finger food and desserts. I brought two party sized packs of cookies (chocolate chip and snickerdoodle).

I stayed to the end and help clean up, as well did other people. One of the guys saw that the cookies I had brought were hardly eaten and there were many still left. He said “let’s leave them by the coffee machine so people can enjoy them tomorrow morning with their coffee”. I was considering taking them back with me, but contributing to greater good did sound like a good thing to do during the holiday season. After he suggested leaving them I told him I had bought them and he said well I think leaving them would be a good for others to enjoy. I agreed with him and that was the end of it. 

We left the cookies by the coffee machine.

I will mention that our Christmas party and white elephant was interrupted by a couple who had claimed to have reserved the clubhouse. The officer manager who was running the party went to check on their reservation. When she came back she had found that no reservation had been made and that this claim the couple was making was bogus. The office manager said that she would be charging the party even though they didn’t have a reservation for interrupting the community Christmas party. 

After leaving the cookies by the coffee machine, I return to my apartment. 

About an hour later I think to myself, hmmm some of those cookies sound tasty let me go downstairs and grab some of the cookies we left out for tomorrow. It’s two large party sized packs of cookies I’m sure no one will notice a few missing. Besides that’s what they’re for!

I go to the club house an hour and 20 minutes after the party is over to get a cookie and they’re gone. All of them. They didn’t take one, or a few, they grabbed both entire containers and walked off. Sad face. I try to participate in my community and when I turn around they are the worst. Super lame.



Update: So, what I what I meant about the other party. The club house is big so the community Christmas party was one side and on the other side a couple was having their family party with lots of guests. The community Christmas party had all of the chairs so the couple came over to ask for them since they claimed to have a reservation. 

Also my community is rather affluent. Lots of seniors on fixed income, but everyone appears that do well considering the rent is more than ave for our area.

"So I’m a very unattractive person. I’ve been called ugly most of my life and I expect it at this point. So a few days ago a guy I’ve been talking to for almost a year I decided to share explicit pictures with him. This isn’t the norm for me it usually takes me a while to get comfortable to do these types of things because it’s not really for me has never really been my style. I don’t get any pleasure out of sending nudes plus like I said before I am unattractive to most people. I sent the picture on Monday and everything seemed to be going well. The man is a lawyer so he claims to be busy most of the week which I’m not sure is true or not. So we haven’t really spoken since I sent the picture. It is now Thursday evening and he sent a few messages stating “your p*ssy almost made me throw up and lose some f*cking weight then maybe just maybe someone will want you”. This was completely random and unprovoked….I was immediately blocked afterwards and never got the chance to respond. I just can’t really understand why he had to be mean at all? I hadn’t bothered after I sent it. I didn’t text or call so why couldn’t he just block me? I’m not hurt because I’m kind of used to this. I just hate I went against my better judgment. Why are men so mean to women? Especially if they find you unattractive. I don’t deserve basic human decency because I’m not your type?

 I am 39, Last year November we became homeless - my son was 3 months old. We sold absolutely everything, we had 5 small bags left of what was necessity. I slept in places holding my child so close - terrified, or some nights not sleeping at all. We never once approached anyone, begged anyone or bothered anyone.. We were able to make it most nights. We stood by each other, we never fought, we laughed, we talked, the stress was bad, but it was a different kind of stress.     
  
By July this year we were able to stay at a friend of mine and I started working, I earn a decent package for someone that has literally just come off the street.

"I (31F) recently found out I’m pregnant and wanted to be happy but immediately got anxious thinking about my mother’s reaction. 

For context, my mother has always been a bit controlling and manipulative but it has gotten worse in the last 4 years. 

Since I got married 6 years ago, she has constantly been asking me when I am going to have a baby. She has been pressuring me nonstop, regardless of whether my father or siblings tell her to leave me alone. (For reference, she already has 5 grandkids from my 3 brothers who all had sons). 

Initially, I told her the truth: we don’t want kids right now. It’s expensive and we live in a small condo and cannot afford to buy a house. We also want to spend our time travelling. She did not care. She refused to stop calling and asking when I was going to have a baby. Eventually I told her I’m not sure I want kids at all (kind of a lie but I wanted her off my back) and I am open to adopting (this is true). 

Well, she freaked out and said she needs me to have my own child because they wouldn’t be her real grandchildren. I have tried to be patient with my mother, but I couldn’t help but snapping back and calling her a hypocrite considering she is a devout Christian and said she would never see my kids, adopted or not, if she had that attitude.

At the same time, my mother has been sharing my information and photos on her social media, despite me telling her repeatedly (~ a year at that point)  not to post my private photos online. I am a very private person and like to keep things to myself, however, my mother refuses to listen to me and says I’m her daughter and she can do what she wants, “besides, look how many people are liking and viewing it!”

On my birthday, she posted photos of me that I asked her not to share, and I got so annoyed, I said “If I ever have kids and you act like this and choose not to respect my boundaries, then you’re just going to have limited access to them.” Predictably, my mother yelled over the phone “They’ll be my grandkids and I can do what I want. Who do you think you are???” 

I later called my father and mentioned this conversation and he said admitted she has a “strange fixation” on me having kids. 

In the last 3-4 months, I have avoided calling her because all she asks me is if something is wrong with me and if I have “issues”. If not that, she will pseudo-threaten me and tell me I will regret this when I’m old and alone and my decision will make my partner cheat on me. Once she’s done her pregnancy questions, she will then proceed to talk about how sick and depressed she is and how nobody cares about her and how my grandparents are doing terribly and this random person she doesn’t even know died and don’t I feel sorry for them?

Since I found out I’m pregnant, I am sick to my stomach thinking about what she will be like.  I know she will want to help, and in her head she thinks that is what she is doing, but her version of helping will be posting and sending all of my private information to all of her friends and on all of her social media. She already doesn’t respect any of my boundaries, so how I am supposed to protect myself and a child from her? If I do something she doesn’t agree with, she will ridicule me and insinuate there is something wrong with me. If I have a different opinion, everything is a big fight and debate about how she is my mother and she knows what’s best and I don’t know anything so I need to listen to her. 

My mother just has a habit of saying awful things to those around her. We all think she is going through some kind of mental health crisis but she refuses to go to therapy and claims nobody understands her. I just don’t want everything to be a big battle? And I don’t want her saying the things she has said to us to my own kid.

I know I will have to go low contact with her, but I just wish she could be an actual mother for once. 

I know it’s minor in the grand scheme of things, maybe she will get better and change and I’m being pessimistic but I’m honestly really nervous. Who even knows if I will have the kid but I just wanted to be able to be happy about it.

"My gf and I are in our early 20s. We've been dating for a few months and it's been incredible. Back when we were still getting to know each other for the first time, I was aware that she's asexual and I didn't have an issue with it because I believe there's more to relationships than just sex. Fast forward to a month into dating and I find out that she wants zero physical intimacy with the exceptions being hugging and hand holding. At first I was hurt by this but said I would make the sacrifice because I want to be with her. Later I realized how important this intimacy is. I realized it was something that differentiated us from being just friends vs a couple and it was a way of showing affection (didn't realize how important this was to me). When I brought this up she agreed that we needed something else to make this distinction. This was when she became opened to holding hands which made me really happy at the time but that's starting to fade because it doesn't happen that often. I eventually brought this issue to her and said how it made me sad knowing I wouldn't be able to do anything more with her because I had always dreamed of being able to kiss my gf. However I communicated it really poorly so it came off as me trying to push her boundaries instead of compromising and to her the compromise was holding hands and hugging. I asked her what she would be opened to and she had no idea but asked me for ideas but the stuff I thought of would be too touchy for her. She also said that I just had to figure out the issue on my own. Then this month we had a disagreement where I messed up and ended up unintentionally pushing her boundaries again but it really made me think about our relationship. I love her a lot and I know she loves me a lot but sometimes it feels like we're just really good friends instead of bf and gf. There are extremely few times where we've had our cute couple moments. I thought she would've come around to kissing by this point or literally anything outside of what we already do because I know she takes time to open up to things and she knows how much a kiss would mean to me but she refuses to change her stance and instead doubled down saying that it's never ever going to happen. I do my best to make her happy and treat her like a queen. I've gone out of my comfort zone numerous times for her but she refuses to try anything like this for me. And no her behaviors are not due to past trauma or at least that's what she said when I asked. I really don't want to break up with her because of how attached I am to her but I get really down when I think about not being able to kiss her or being able to get close to her. I can't even escape the desire to kiss her in my dreams because I love her so much. I want to bring it up to her again but if I get her mad with that she'll break up with me.

Nothing particularly challenging is happening and I often end them in a weary state, not just physically - because adult life is tiring by default - but mentally and emotionally drained, as if all the thinking and overthinking I did during the day left my brain raw, if that makes any sense.

I'll look back on some weeks and shiver at the idea of going through the same thing again, even if there's nothing ""bad"" going on. 

It make me feel so unfit for a grown person. It's been that way for a really long time and I just kinda feel I should have adjusted by now to how  life rolls, whatever this means. The idea of being  comfortable existing is such a foreign thing to me. I wonder if it will always be like this.

"I work at a grocery store which has a fairly high amount of theft, we usually catch 1 or 2 people every night, no particular demographic either it's like just everyone, stealing all sorts of things. though most of them dress somewhat similar, baggy clothing and a backpack.

someone came in, an oldish lady with a biiiig heavy coat and a backpack, I was cleaning up in a nearby aisle when I look over and what I *saw* was her grab an item, and take her backpack off and open it. I looked away a second, and she's putting her backpack back on. didn't see the item, so I assumed. you know what they say about assumptions though? I do now..

later, I confronted her, asking if she could show me her backpack for me. a coworker says ""ma'am we can do this the easy way or we can call the cops"" and that immediately sets her off, getting really upset and yelling in a language I don't know which made me feel extra bad cause she probably wasn't even properly understanding me until my coworker said ""police"".

anyways, I looked through her bag and whatever I saw her grab wasn't in there, and I checked the cameras later and I kid you not, the exact 30 seconds of that scenario where I saw her grab something from the shelf to putting her backpack on, the camera feed cut out. so I have no proof one way or the other.

while I'm still not 100% sure if she did or didn't take something, I just feel really bad. we get a lot of theft, and I'm on edge because of it I guess, but I very likely had a false positive and ruined this lady's night, made her feel like shit too. I think I'm gonna take a step back from watching people... I've caught a lot of thieves stealing like ribeye steaks and whatall, but I'm not *technically* loss prevention even though I am a manager.

"I'm not sure what to title this nor am I 100% sure this is the right subreddit.

I'm in highschool and I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. For the first few things bothering me is I've never really had a real relationship. The only time I ever went out with someone it was very off and on and they were just leading me on. All of my friends have been getting partners recently and I feel very isolated. It's not that I'm insufferable, I have friends and they like me (I think), but I just don't put myself out there. I'm too afraid. I was bullied pretty hard throughout my school career and it's left me with some trauma. My reclusivness is to the point I've trained myself to be as invisible as possible, and I never reach out to new people and keep my close friends circle pretty small. I understand that wanting a partner while also being afraid of people is counterintuitive, but it's my situation. I'm also the type to start liking people pretty fast and I tend to fall head over heels for the slightest sign of tolerance, since I'm not used to it (for reference I was bullied because I was too awkward and outgoing when I was younger and being the weird kid just kinda stuck, I also might be autistic so I hope that brings some clarity). It also doesn't help that people I like tend to be more fond of my older sister. This brings us to the next handful of issues I have. My older sister is very pretty and outgoing and very sweet. I feel like I am not a person but an extension of my sister who's only purpose is to exist in her shadow and occasionally have the ""You're *names* younger siblings right?"" interaction. I cannot explain how much hatred this has spawned. I love my sister, don't get me wrong, but I also wonder what it would be like if people liked me more than her. She's also very selfish and narcissistic and tends to overshadow my issues with her own, so it's not like she is an amazing sister. She's had boyfriends since 8th grade and I still struggle to follow people I find pretty on Instagram, when I rarely build up the courage to do more than look at their posts. I just can't do it anymore. I'm skipping over a lot of other problems I have but I just feel like I'm incapable of being loved. I have severe depression and i struggle with my will to live a lot (dont really wanna get into that). I'm not even sure why I'm on this subreddit posting this. I don't like to bother my friends with my issues but it's not like telling a bunch of strangers will help. Maybe some advice would help (I'm aware I am not socially adept and I'm slowly getting better).

"so i (31 M) woke up after 3 hours of sleep, and being sleep-deprived for over a week. had an EMDR-therapy session planned today, which takes me 2 hours to get to by bus. proceed to get triggered for an hour because trauma therapy is a bitch, and a 2 hour bus ride back home.

i needed to vent, so i call my mate, who is out partying at a local pop-up event hall and tells me to meet him at his place in the evening.

go to my mate's house later tonight, he isnt home. i call him and he's still partying, so i get over to meet him there.

i arrive, place is busy as all hell. spent 15 mins looking for him, i find him and he gives me a beer and €20 to go get more. fuck it, i'm overstimulated as is anyways. takes 20 minutes just to order 4 beers, only to find out they dont take cash. kind guy next to me tells me it's okay, and pays for my overpriced beers. i offer him the 20, and he refuses (honestly dude, if you ever read this; you're the best thing that happened to me all day. thank you!).

go back to look for my mate, aaand he's gone. fuck it, i have free beer.

few mins later this random dude walks up to me ""come, we're gonna hang out at the bar"". at this point i had no more fuck to give so i just took my beers and joined the guy at the bar. i introduce myself, and he's like ""just drink."" me: ""yeah, but i'd like to know who i'm drinking with"", and he just replied with the same ""just drink"".

me, still being in trauma recovery mode from earlier that day, starts to panic and feel generally paranoid. his mates (about 6 of them) seem quite merry, so i relax a little. they start this thing about them being from Brighton UK. i speak 4 different english dialects, theirs was totally fake. they proceeded to offer me shots, which i had to decline due to allergies. i start getting more and more predatory vibes from this dude, so i just chugged all but one of my beers and ninja'd off to look for my mate again.

an extra hour of me finding the guy, he ditching me again, rince, and repeat a few times, and finally they call last rounds.

this time i'm determined not to lose him out of sight again (spoilers, i do).

EVENTUALLY, we're outside and he starts up a conversation with one of the 'Brighton' guys. Brighton guy starts talking shit about our local soccer team out of nowhere, not knowing that my mate is actually one of the local football hooligan organizers (mind, he's also obviously shitfaced at this point).

suddenly tension is insane, and this fat dude starts to body slam me out of the area as if i'm the one that caused problems. first, i'm a pacifist, and second, no man can win a 6v1 unarmed and i'm not intending to disprove that statement.

luckily, i manage to run around the big guy, pull my mate out of the group and distract him long enough for the other guys to wonder off.

we finally arrive at his place around 1 am, and he didnt have his keys on him. turns out he gave them to his son and told him he'd be home at 10 anyways (just like he told me btw). he called his son, and luckily he was still awake to open the door.

i go back home alone on my bike from here. i'm completely done with today. 

finally, i put my key in my front door keyhole. refuses. to. rotate. AT 2 AM!

after 20 minutes of trying again, and thinking of alternatives to get into my home i decide to wake up my disabled neighbor to ask if she'll let me climb her balcony (mind, i live on the 4th floor, and am very drunk, pissed and panicked at this point.)

my neighbor's balcony is connected to mine by a small, 2 ft wide section. i used my last bit of luck for the day to climb over that thin edge and not fall 12m while drunk.

i'm done.

"My cousin first introduced me to Ace just after the pandemic restrictions were lifted. I didn't think of him as much and my cousin talked about him to me more than the amount of time Ive seen him. He was a complete gentleman, truly unfortunate with his past lovers, he was always taken advantage of because of how usually kind and generous he is. Although lacking in face value (he was not as handsome but hes aight), he's competent at everything else in life.

He's well-travelled, cultured, funny, witty, and great at playing this specific FPS game that I will not name just because.
Anyways, like I said I didn't mind him as much and when we first met, it was pretty awkward. We didn't talk all that much and my cousin to go butter us up to loosen our mouths and feel comfortable with each other.

We started talking in social media, exchanging memes, talking about our careers, him asking for advice and me giving it.
We appreciated each other's company and we have this little bubble of joy everytime we talk to each other. But alas, it all came to a halt when my cousin introduced an old friend into the fray and how quickly he became enamored with her. Cotts was an old College friend and I knew her since before Ace. I know that Cotts is a perfect fit for Ace because she's just as charming and kind. 

Cotts and Ace quickly fell in love with each other and dated immediately. My cousin was ecstatic that two of his friends dated each other and was going well. As for me, I distanced myself from Ace out of respect because that's what I usually do when I have a male friend who gets himself a girlfriend. I disappeared into the background.


A few months later, my cousin arranged a dinner party for me (cus I cant do shit for myself cus im busy), and Cotts and Ace were there. I didn't really wanna go there but I did and they sat in front of me, feeding each other food and being sweet.

I felt even more awful watching them just be a normal couple, my cousin being clueless, the other dinner guests being couples as well. I tried to act happy and talked to everyone. I made Cotts laugh uncontrollably, caught up with Ace on the latest gaming stuff, made a bet with other guests, and had my cousin drink an shitton of whiskey.

After that dinner party, Ace and I talked again in social media. For every message he sent, for every kind gesture, every witty comeback, I find myself falling in love with him and slightly resenting Cotts. Ace was never really attracted to me and I already accepted that fact. But I also cant help quickly falling in love with him to the point of seeing him in my dreams.

"So this is going to be complicated but my brother Mike basically was my guardian since I was 17 since our parents died when I was 5. I lived with other family Pryor to that.

Anyway recently in the past 8 months or so I had a dilemma in my life where I moved back in with my brother. I really didn’t want to but he insisted, he has a big house so I have pretty much a whole floor to myself. I pay him rent etc. 

Now sometimes when he comes around or we happen to pass each other he makes comments. When I was younger I never picked up on this shit , but now that I’m older I realize he does it to eat at me or something. He will say something like “man you look like shit” or “wow you really aged you don’t look young anymore you look about 45” (most people tell me I look younger than I look but I feel he knows that shit will get to me” One day he hears me telling my friend I feel like my hair is starting to thin and it’s stressing me out. After he heard that a few days later he looks at me and goes “ Looks like you are starting to go bald and smiling and laughing”. Also he loves sports and football, when he sees me watching a game at night “You are too old to be watching this stuff what are you even doing watching this shit on a weeknight” meanwhile he watched football every Sunday lol

Now this all would be fine if it was just one time comments. I have pretty thick skin. He has done shit like this my whole life even when I was younger. Things I would like he would tell me how stupid they are and try to exaggerate things when bringing  them up to friends to make me feel insecure. 

The thing is I never realized he was doing that shit until now that I’m around him and I’m older. Before this I haven’t seen him since I was about 26. Now being more mentally mature it’s just kinda crazy to see. 

Like I said earlier it wouldn’t bother me if it wasn’t constantly every chance he gets to say something. I even confronted him about it and and he says “I just joke around, what do you mean?? “ and since then if anything it has gotten worse. 

I guess it just hurts knowing that one of my only family members left does this and has always wanted to make himself feel better than me. When I was younger I never really thought about it and if he wouldn’t really go that far because I was a more more wild and more of a loose cannon back then lol. 

I guess now that he sees I just take it and don’t start anything since I feel bad enough being at his house this year that he just really likes it on now and he loves doing it.

Part of me thinks he is jealous that I’m younger than him and that he chose a life that he resents a little bit. He has a wife and 3 kids so he doesn’t really have any down time and when he sees me going out or watching a game, (those used to be his favorite things to do) it gets him wishing he could still do those things. One night he seen me pull in at midnight. “ You got home at midnight on a Tuesday? What do you think you’re a college kid. That’s pathetic”

"For context we are both in our mid twenties. Last year I moved to his country from mine after 3 years of long distance. I really wanted a cat and even though my husband was against it at first he eventually got me a kitten. Everything was good for a while but as kittens do they get into things and have accidents. The first time I was concerned when our kitten had peed on our bed, which is annoying but it happens. His reaction was not great and he ‘punished’ our kitten by putting her face in the pee. I got mad at him and this led to an argument. That was the first sign. It got worse. Our kitten decided to try and get into one of the cabinets with paper towels in it and he did not like that. Instead of just moving her, he picked her up by the tail then slammed her to the ground in front of me. It was so shocking that I started crying. I had never seen this behavior from him or anyone before. Our kitten hid under the bed growling. I eventually coaxed her out to make sure she was not injured. She wasn’t thankfully but stayed close to me and I refused to let him by her. It broke my heart. I couldn’t look at him the same after that. A few months later, we were both working from home and I hear our kitten yowl in pain. I rushed into the other room where my husband was to find that her leg was broken. He was freaking out, saying it was an accident and that she kept going under his desk while he was working and stepped on her. I am not sure what to think. I wonder if it was on purpose. I feel guilty wanting a cat and then having her be hurt like this. I feel like I have lost feelings for my husband. I am so lost. We did take my kitten to the vet and they put a rod in her leg.

"My now ex-boyfriend for a month broke up with me because ""he cared about me but he didn't care about my problems.""
We started arguing a bit more as I became upset that we would sometimes go days without seeing each other at all (although we go to the same school), when I would be trying to have a serious conversation of how I just felt our relationship was weird, he wouldn't respond for hours on end and sometimes he would just be playing video games or even respond to me on other platforms such as Snapchat before responding to me. I would beg him to just talk to me and communicate as I was just overall confused for how much things had changed and I just didn't feel reassured by him. I know he was busy and I was too but it just got a point where I knew he could respond and he just wasn't, and I was just confused because he didn't communicate that ""oh I just can't mentally talk right now"" and instead he would just ignore everything | said and go off topic.

We used to have tiny little periods where'd we go out of our classes and talk to one another just briefly for five minutes, and he would just flat out refuse but I would see him walking around with his friends during classes. Then the one time he agreed to see me he forgot about me. He eventually broke it off with me over text and said that I was emotionally and mentally unstable and that while he still loves me he was ""not willing to put the effort on top of the sport he's doing to fix the relationship."" After the breakup he claimed he still ""wanted to be friends"" and I was just at that moment angry that he hadn't broken up with me to my face, and eventually he agreed to talk to me to my face.
We set up a date and I made a promise in my head not to get to close but during the first one he immediately broke it and started at first grabbing strands of my hair then just full on leaned in and kissed me. I was avoiding touching him at first. I shouldn't have kissed back but I missed him and I thought this was a sign that he'd be willing to try again and communicate more. I shouldn't assumed that as just afterwards he texted me that ""we should give it more time before he decides"" and that ""he's not sure about committing (effort wise) to a relationship.""

I saw him a second time in person a bit later though and we were laughing like normal. He then said right afterwards that ""he's considering more about getting back with me because it's fun hanging out."" It's been a couple weeks since and he's just refused to see me. He told me flat out ""I don't want to commit the effort to a relationship anymore"" and I just feel so hurt. I keep remembering that just a couple weeks ago he was hugging me and kissing me and telling me that he'll think about working it out just to abandon me again.
He said ""you're really nice and kind but I just don't see this working out.""
When I asked him about why he refused to communicate in the relationship about the boundaries he had set (because at first when he was breaking up with me he blamed it on me and how ""I should've thought about doing it differently and how I was making him feel"" yet I expressed that I didn't know what he felt about what I was saying because he wouldn't talk to me or respond really to what I was saying. To my perspective (since he said that I made him feel bad for having boundaries) he didn't even set those boundaries in the first place and I was just not communicated with.

I just feel so mad right now. He admitted that he “feels happier” without my presence because “he has more time to himself” and just I’m so hurt and I’ve fallen into a complete depression from watching someone I really loved falling out of love with me just to see him happy that I’m gone. I keep seeing him just walking around laughing with his friends and I’ve cried every single night and I just don’t get why I don’t matter to him.

My partner of 10 plus years had an emotional affair with 2 different men. I found all the text messages back in May and confronted her about it. She apologized and we started working on our relationship. The thing that hurts about what I found  is that they had a certain song that was “their” song “Tangled up in you” by Staind. I have not been a perfect partner and I know that….so I listen to that song because I feel like I deserve to feel pain for all the bad things I have done.

"Exactly as the title says. I got back home after being out and my front door’s windows were smashed in. Someone had been in my flat. The entire floor was covered with glass and there’s still glass around now. I called the police immediately. No one was in my flat, nothing was stolen, everything was exactly the way I left it. 

I’m just confused on why someone would break in and not take anything. At first, I was assuming it was my ex partner, who had threatened this back in July but we’re (as in my auntie, mum and I) that he would’ve done something personal towards me, that he would’ve most likely taken my pet or destroyed the flat. 

We’re hoping it was a chancer, someone who saw my lights off. My neighbour had rang the police while I was out about someone banging my front door but then she assumed I’d let them in because the door opened.

Doesn't matter how busy I am, I'm the one getting called while my two brothers just sit there. I can list so many things, but I feel like this post will be long. So I wanted to highlight parts that made me realize this.

This sticks out to me, I was visiting my cousin's house and while I was in my cousin's room my mom told me to come out and wash the dishes. Yes, she made me wash dishes at my cousin's house. My aunt told her that it's fine and I can go back to what I was doing, but no my mom was insistent on it. 

I was always asked if I cooked anything for my dad or brothers...like excuse me. Do you think I'm going to cook because it's my job. It's always on me...I hate it. Hell, even when we do chores, of one my brothers does it poorly then I would get yelled at for not doing it right...yes...me hardly them. I just don't know what to do at times.

If I have to do this all the time, this is has become one of the prime reasons I don't want a life Ilike hers. Do I have to drop everything just to serve them. There's more but I can just type what are the main points and events. I'm tired of being a girls...hell I'm tired of being a daughter. This could be another reason why I'm fine with staying single andot having kids. Because I don't want to be put through what I've been through. It socks.

If I never become a lawyer I'll have to move back into their house and face their abuse again. I could never face any of my friends again they're all the academic types like me. Future politicians, doctors, lawyers, computer programers I would just feel so embarrassed around them. Everything I've worked for feels like it's falling apart I know this seems so childish and silly but getting into a good law school and escaping familial abuse forever has been the thing stopping me from suicide for a long time since I was a teenager and now it's slipped through my fingers.

"So let me preference this by saying this is going to be long winded and that the formatting may be off. I'm writing this on my phone because I don't have access to a PC at the moment. Also this will have an 18+ and potential TMI warning.


Lately I've been making the mistake of thinking. It's been not much over a year since my divorce. The woman I divorced was the only woman I've ever dated. We were together since, I believe, my junior year(year 3) in high school. We were together for 15 years married for 10. 


I tell myself and others that it was a mutual split. And I do kind of believe that it was. The main problem with our relationship was that I have little to no sex drive and have no interest in anything below the waist. To the point where it's pretty much a turn off for me. And she had a very high sex drive. She once told me that she would be happy having sex every night. And i did try, but i just couldn't do it. It killed me inside knowing that i couldn't give her what she wanted, but I did tell her that I was okay with her sleeping with other guys. I realized that I couldn't give her what she wanted but I still loved her. I told her that the only thing that mattered to me is that she was happy, and i meant it. She actually did sleep with another guy and I was perfectly okay with that. The guy being a guy she met through a minecraft server back when we first got married. Turns out it's the guy she moved away to be with after we split. When she said she wanted to get a divorce she said we would still be friends. 


Then when she left she blocked me on everything. I'd be lying if I said that didn't hurt. But I can truthfully say that I'm not, and wasn't, angry about it. I had other things to worry about at the time. At the same time she left her parents convinced her to change her mind about letting me and my autistic brother stay in the house her and I had lived in since we were married. It was given to us and put in her name as a wedding gift from her parents. And on top of that a co-worker at the place I was working at at the time finally got her way and got me fired. So in one week my wife left me to be with another man, my brother and I became homeless, and I lost my job. And as someone who is on depression medication you can imagine I wasn't in the best of head spaces.


But I do believe that bad things happen in 3s. I believed I was due for something good. Thankfully my brother, my bird Walter, our 2 cats Felix and Charlie, and myself had a place to go. My dad let us stay with him and his partner in their small 1 bedroom apartment. 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, and the living room and kitchen were attached. Not a lot of space, but at least we weren't on the streets. Thankfully after a couple of months a job managed to find me. I was looking and applied for a few on indeed, but then I get an email from one I never saw asking if I wanted to apply and it was right in the area of what I was looking for. It paid a little less than my previous job but had MUCH better benefits and even paid holidays. Then 5 or so months after that I got my very first apartment, right across the parking lot from my dad's place. $1450 a month then $25 per cat. Between my brothers disability and my pay we can easily afford it. And everything was included, even cable and internet(no physical connections and shitty quality but still included.)


Now that the background is out of the way the real thing I came her to get off my chest/confess. Lately I've been thinking back to when I was still with my ex. And it made me realize something that I miss more than anything about that time. Now this is going to sound either sexist, perverted, selfish or whatever. But the thing I miss the most is when we would just lay together in bed watching whatever on the TV while I fondled her breasts or rested my head in her cleavage. Like I said, I have little to no sex drive. So this never really felt sexual to me. It was more of a comfort thing. But looking back I realized that I'll never have this again. 


I'm always working and super antisocial on the best of days. I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed autism like my brother. So even though I was married for 10 years and am in my 30s I still can't talk to women without being SUPER awkward. Hell, I can barely talk to ANYBODY without being super awkward. And I have so little confidence that I could never try any sort of online dating. And, truth be told, it was my ex who originally asked me out. And all of this culminated in my depression spiking.


I'm writing and posting this in hopes that putting it in words and confessing it will help me to ""get over it"" as it were.

"I'm a 19 year old virgin with an abnormally thin penis and it's completely destroyed my confidence and self-esteem. The length is fairly average around 5.8"" but the girth on the other hand is probably like 3 inches, I have nothing to measure it with so I'm not entirely sure, it could be even less, it doesn't even seem normal, I have a picture of it in my feed if anyone wants to look at it. It makes my penis look like a stick. My confidence is gone, I'm scared to ever get into bed with women because I'm afraid they'll make fun of it and dump me on the spot. I'm trying to do nofap but I don't see the point anymore it's just made it look even smaller and thinner then ever before. I see so many guys say their dicks got bigger then normal after nofap but the opposite seems to be happening to me.

I've seen subreddits talking about exercises like clamping that can naturally increase the girth of your penis which I find a total load of bullshit and so do a lot of others, but there's also people everywhere saying it worked and they gained an inch of not more, it's insane. Not to mention it's all so confusing, I don't even know where to start.

I've never felt this depressed in my life and I'm either considering risky surgery or suicide because there's no way I can please any women with this, they simply won't feel it. No amount of therapy or coping will make this go away.

"For more context, look at my previous post. But here is the general rundown. 

- son was admitted into hospital hours away from home after him having a cluster of seizures for a week 
- I vent to friends ( I will call them Sally and Tate) about my mental health, financial instability, and his father not helping as much as he should
- they weren’t understanding and I kept explaining myself. Tate was getting mean as I kept trying to explaining and told me to “stay mad”, when I kept explaining I’m stressed about everything as a whole. They kept making all of my stressors about my son’s father
- I finally said “you aren’t understanding” and left the group chat after Tate told me to “stay mad”. Tate then messaged me privately to tell me he’s “pissed the F off at me” 

So a couple weeks passed and I asked Sally if we should talk. Sally and I talked that night and made our amends immediately. I explained I just needed a minute and she didn’t realize at first how mean Tate was being to me in the chat. She explained she confronted him and told him he was in the wrong for the way he handled it. Sally told me that he felt remorseful and that she thinks we are ready to talk. 

This turned into him lying to her and saying he didn’t get my messages. According to Sally, he made no indication that he was still upset. So she asked him why he doesn’t just message me since he “wasn’t receiving my message”. It turned out, he flat out deleted it to avoid talking to me. He told me I was acting entitled and made it out like I was just bugging Sally about him, which was untrue. He said that I am expecting him to kiss my butt. He also got mad at me for blocking him, even though he was the one that told me not to talk to him. 

I explained that I understood how me leaving the chat hurt him and I could have went about things a different way. However, I told him that he was the one that was being mean. Not me. I wouldn’t have said any of the unkind things he did, especially given the situation. I wouldn’t have name called or cussed him out like he did. I told him I know I’m not innocent and that the point of having a conversation was so we both could hold each other accountable. 

Now, not only did he not own up to any of his actions, but he lied to our friend. I’m willing to accept that maybe I could have stayed in the group chat. I also apologized, but I personally believe you should always apologize for your actions and communicate, even if the other person hurt you. I think that how we feel can explain our actions, but not excuse them.",Am I entitled for wanting to make amends with my friend after blocking him?,18o1cwh,1703203531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18o1cwh/am_i_entitled_for_wanting_to_make_amends_with_my/,
"He used to work out in the oilfield on a 2/1 schedule. I miss it and I know to an extent he does. I missed him but his 7 days off were days off. Not on call. Not catching up on sleep from working nights the days before. Just dedicated days off. 

He took a job at home and while it’s so nice that he’s home in some form or another every day, the shift work schedule is unsustainable. He works 4 days on, 3 days off, 3 nights on, day off, 3 days on, 3 days off, 4 nights on 7 off. He’s on call one of his days off every set of days off. The back and forth nights/days is slowly killing him and I feel like I’m just watching it happen. He’s perpetually exhausted. His first day off is always spent sleeping. He cannot make it through a day off without a decent nap. He’s sick at least twice a month. He was NEVER sick when he was working in the oilfield. 

Obviously, his previous job also had insane hours. He was putting in close to 200 hours every 2 weeks but somehow he was more rested and healthier. I feel so alone most of the time. I feel like I am a solo parent. I also work full time. He keeps her on his days off. There’s pros to the job like him being home and the money is great.

"Long as* post lol) Hi, this is my first post ever on reddit and I know that title sounds bad but I need advice and also sorry if I can’t be clear at times but  English is not my first language , so I (21 M) have a 2 year long relationship with my gf Amelie (19 F), 2 years ago started to develop feelings for my university professor (41 F) let’s call her Elena for the sake of the story, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, she looks so young but at the same time she has this mature haze in her eyes and the way she talks and walks, she is just different from anyone I’ve ever encountered in my life, the first time I saw her in Uni when I was in my 2nd semester of Anthropology I was 19 , she is best friends with my intro physical anthropology teacher at the time ( teacher Carla) , they were chit chatting while working and drinking coffee, I came in to the room to ask teacher Carla to help me out with a investigation and essay, mind to tell you me and teacher Carla became friends , she at that time, offered me to help her out with investigations done by her or some colleagues of hers and I was extremely grateful, she said I’d be and incredible anthropologist and saw me as a son since she lost hers when he was 17 years old due to a car crash. Back to that encounter teacher Carla greeted me and so did the most prefect face I’ve ever seen in my life Elena, oh god I immediately lost my breath when she shook my hand and went back to sip her coffee and typing on her laptop, I saw her beautiful brown eyes so deep and so glowy, her perfect cherry brown hair in a messy pony tail, it fits perfectly with her round glasses and her make up with cherry red lips, she has a small nostril piercing, a labret piercing on her lips it was like a ring around the center of her bottom lip that almost made me faint, she has some ear piercings but they just looked so good on her , I felt like I couldn’t speak properly, I baffled some words to teacher Carla while looking directly at her direction while she was working not realizing about my existence. When I came back to my apartment I got out of that  shock and started blushing like when I was 13 and gave my first kiss, I first thought she was a student of teacher Carla because she looks so so young.

I decided to get to know her or maybe ask her out? I just wanted to be able to talk to her, so days passed by and I couldn’t find her around campus at all, my friend Anthony (18 at that time) realized my lack of energy so he asked me “what is wrong with you?” I just said that nothing happened, he invited me to a party but I just wasn’t interested he definitely noticed something was off since I’ve always been a party animal, he pushed me to tell him what was wrong if I argued with Amelie, and to be honest I totalIy forgot about her existence and ghosted her for days but no it wasn’t the case so I told him about Elena and the huge crush i developed, he knows everyone in uni so he said he’d help me out to find her, 3 days passed and he came to my apartment with “bad and good news” I wanted him to tell me the good one first and he told me that he knows perfectly who Elena is, I almost died with excitement and then he dropped the bomb she was a physicist and his physics professor at uni, she teaches Linear Algebra, Optics and Waves, Quantum Mechanics and Solid State Physics, he also mentioned she was 39 at that time, I just looked at him dead in the eye and said “how can I solicit a undergraduate change from anthropology to physics” he just bursted out laughing and thought I wasn’t serious but looking at my face he figured I was completely serious, and yeah I hate maths and physics I almost failed my sophomore year in high school due to calculus but I couldn’t care less, literally the next day me and Anthony went to the uni secretary and asked for my undergraduate change, she and Anthony had a fling so she helped me out to get in physics the next semester which was in like 4 months, ofc teacher Carla was crushed and confused  cause I was one of her best students but she understood my “sudden change of heart”, so she wished me  luck. Amelie gave me her support and said she she’d be excited to be in the same uni as me in the next semester but honestly I couldn’t care less like we went out on dates and etc but I always thought about Elena EVERY TIME.

So the day of my first class with Elena came I was so excited to see her I got my best clothes out of my closet, got a haircut, got an expensive ass perfume and prepared everything to be perfect to introduce myself to her, oh god that Wednesday at 11 am i just remember everything I saw her coming in with knee length high heeled leather boots, black nylon tights, a black dress with sleeves and a turtle neck idk how to say it in English lol that hugged her body combined with a belt, a trench coat and a flawless makeup, she had her hair down and her glasses just looked perfect in place I wrote on a notebook every single detail about her face and clothes, she presented herlself as Dr. Elena Acosta (fake names lol) she introduced us to linear algebra  and offered to help us out in any doubt we had, she acted and looked like an angel, I did not understand shit about the class it was so confusing for me but I tried my best, I always ended up just staring at her, it’s been two long years and I’ve just have fallen in love with her, with her multiple tattoos, intelligence, gorgeousness, attitude, she is a jojos fan, she loves animals, she is a history nerd and so on  I’ve stalked the shit out of her likes and dislikes from online forums, because her username is always the same lol.

I suck at physics but Anthony has been helping me out and doing my homework for 15 bucks each but overall he’s been a good friend, Amelie is studying international business (I’m not sure lol) I’m not so close to her I think but she is regularly planning dates for us and l just show up with flowers sometimes so she doesn’t bother me asking for them, giving her presents or just saying yes on what she wants just so she doesn’t bother me, she is nice and pretty I guess.

My main concern is that I can’t establish a relationship farther from student - teacher with Elena I just can’t I guess, she is polite and kind to me when I ask her a question or when I ask her about a project but the moment I start any small talk she cuts me off or gives short answers, god I wish I could ask her out or get her number, I looked for her in social media but she has a private profile and I think she just accepts people she knows, I recently found out that she is from South America, Ecuador to be precise even tho she is an immigrant and I had an apprehension against ilegal immigrants I don’t care anymore if she is one I love that about her, I’m taking Spanish classes to be able to talk to her when we get in a relationship and googling about Ecuadorian culture, I’ve heard her speaking Spanish GOD SHE SOUNDS SO HOT, I just need her, I want her to be the mother of my children and to be my wife, to love me at least, I’m just so in love with her. I’ll take some time but I won’t give up.

"Really just need to vent. My soon to be ex wife has been dating someone for about 3 months, about 3 weeks after she moved out of the house. She cheated on me with a lot of random people prior and then found this person on fetlife shortly after moving out of our house. I was pretty upset when I confronted her about already being in a “serious relationship” as we had not even filed for divorce yet. 

Fast forward a few months and she is now on our yearly staycation to the mountains a few hours away from where we live. She claims that this is her “tradition” even though I was the one who introduced her to the town, discovered the restaurants we loved, activities and shops we liked, and a place where we shared a lot of memories. 

She’s there now with one of our dogs, eating at the same restaurants, staying at the same hotel, and doing all of the same activities with this new person as if nothing has changed.
