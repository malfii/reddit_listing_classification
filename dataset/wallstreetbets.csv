Is it weird that stock index is high but mega stock are not high or did not get the jump. When I look at top companies they did not move. A 3000 point index should have made big companies jump a way higher. So what is moving the index so high? And does it mean after some time small mid size companies

"We know the market runs on psychological levels. AMD retesting $100? You can bet that a bunch of highly regarded degens are slinging fat bids to get in at that $100 psych level. We love nice, round numbers, and it's pretty obvious that most stocks treat big psych levels (i.e. multiples of 50, 100, etc) as important support/resistance levels.

Now combine stocks trading at big psych levels with OTM options, and you're now looking at 10-100x+ potential returns. Examples to understand how:

# Example 1: ORCL vs $100: 15x 😎

ORCL had earnings last week (December 11th). Post earnings it sold off to - you guessed it - the $100 psych level! $100 has been key for ORCL since 2021.

[ORCL vs $100 over the past few trading days. After post ER dump, it found $100 to base off of. Quickly made a move from $100 -\&gt; $105](https://preview.redd.it/fb8qyovj9q7c1.png?width=3144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb7d804065c4e146fbcc89491e503aefa7425b3)

[ORCL 12\/22 $105c chart \(post ER\). Small change in underlying -\&gt; huge change in options.](https://preview.redd.it/u85hb89o9q7c1.png?width=3242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ad0f8e565ee8965d2bf9688b9bc83fc927f4946)

&amp;#x200B;

In that period of time, the ORCL 12/22 $105c moved from $0.14 at the lows last Friday, to $1.90 this Monday. This is nearly a **15x** over 2 trading days, from just a 5% move in the underlying! ORCL consolidated nicely at $100 and post-ER IV crush allowed these contracts to get super nice and cheap.

# Example 2: AVGO vs $900: 1400x 🤯

AVGO has been nothing short of magic. It treated $800, $900, and $1000 all as perfect support/resistance levels. AVGO also recently had ER on 12/7, during which it sold off to $900. Now with IV crush in place, and with a sprinkle of good news ([partnerships](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AVGO/caltech-and-broadcom-announce-quantum-research-and-development-jcv126kwus8b.html), PT upgrades), it launched off $900.

[AVGO vs $800, $900, $1000](https://preview.redd.it/35761b2r9q7c1.png?width=3306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3f04a0e3eeabf22fd64080109a365ef125a6528)

&amp;#x200B;

[AVGO 12\/15 $1050c](https://preview.redd.it/4fjde080aq7c1.png?width=3316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498c77ad91e881c03f3b8c8f959d8a21298727bf)

AVGO 12/15 $1050c made a move from $.05 -&gt; $70 in just days. 1400x 🤯 What really enabled this to amplify was that the IV crush post-ER turned these contracts into pennies. That coupled with the fact that AVGO is a very high dollar stock, which enables out of the money (OTM) contracts to quickly become many dollars in the money (ITM) with a small % move in the stock.

**Tiny % changes in underlying can result in HUGE changes in options for high dollar stocks.**

# Why high dollar stocks?

These kinds of gains are very hard to find in small dollar stocks. The reason is simple: with high dollar stocks, a small % move in underlying can turn penny contracts into deep ITM multi dollar contracts. For low dollar stocks, unless your underlying sees massive moves (think 50%+ move in underlying), these returns just aren't possible. On these low dollar stocks, a penny contract very rarely turns into multi-dollar because this requires the contract to go many bucks ITM. I.e. you'll need a very large % change in the underlying.

As mentioned above, for high dollar stocks, all you need is a small % move in underlying to get penny contracts into multi buck contracts.

# Takeaways

1. Big psychological levels tend to present significant trading opportunities
2. **Options on high dollar stocks trading at these big psych levels can result in HUGE returns.** Penny contracts can quickly become multi-dollar contracts as they go in the money. This is not something you find often with small dollar stocks.
3. Post ER, options contracts face an IV crush. This presents significant opportunities if the underlying consolidates at a psych level. **Cheap contracts =&gt; amplified returns**.

&amp;#x200B;

So fellow degens, in short, **options** on **high dollar** stocks at **big** **psych Levels** = **magic 🧙**",🧙Unlocking 100x Returns: The Power Big Psych Levels and Options on High Dollar Stocks,18nzu7t,1703199455.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nzu7t/unlocking_100x_returns_the_power_big_psych_levels/,

"Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is a technical analysis indicator that measures the amount of money flowing into and out of a stock over a specified period. It was developed by Marc Chaikin, a former stockbroker and analyst, in the 1980s. CMF is based on the concept of Money Flow Volume, which is the product of the Money Flow Multiplier and the volume for each period.

The Money Flow Multiplier is a value between -1 and +1 that indicates how close the closing price is to the high or low of the period. The closer the closing price is to the high, the more positive the multiplier. The closer the closing price is to the low, the more negative the multiplier. The multiplier is zero when the closing price is exactly in the middle of the high-low range.

The CMF is calculated by summing the Money Flow Volume for a given number of periods (usually 20 or 21) and dividing it by the sum of the volume for the same number of periods. The result is a value between -1 and +1 that oscillates around the zero line. A positive CMF indicates that more money is flowing into the stock than out of it, which implies buying pressure and bullish sentiment. A negative CMF indicates that more money is flowing out of the stock than into it, which implies selling pressure and bearish sentiment.   

## Why is CMF important for traders?

CMF is an important indicator for traders because it can help them identify trends, signals, and opportunities in the market. CMF can also confirm or contradict the price action of the stock, which can provide valuable insights into the strength and direction of the movement.

Here are some ways that traders can use CMF to enhance their trading performance:

* **Trend identification**: Traders can use CMF to identify the prevailing trend of the stock by looking at the direction and level of the indicator. A rising CMF above the zero line indicates an uptrend, while a falling CMF below the zero line indicates a downtrend. A CMF that stays above or below the zero line for a long time suggests a strong and persistent trend. A CMF that crosses the zero line frequently suggests a weak or choppy trend.
* **Signal generation**: Traders can use CMF to generate buy and sell signals by looking at the crossover and divergence of the indicator and the price. A bullish crossover occurs when the CMF crosses above the zero line, which indicates a shift from selling pressure to buying pressure. A bearish crossover occurs when the CMF crosses below the zero line, which indicates a shift from buying pressure to selling pressure. A bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower low, but the CMF makes a higher low, which indicates a weakening of the downtrend and a potential reversal. A bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the CMF makes a lower high, which indicates a weakening of the uptrend and a potential reversal.
* **Opportunity detection**: Traders can use CMF to detect opportunities for entry and exit by looking at the overbought and oversold conditions of the indicator and the price. An overbought condition occurs when the CMF reaches an extreme positive value, which indicates a high level of buying pressure and a possible exhaustion of the uptrend. An oversold condition occurs when the CMF reaches an extreme negative value, which indicates a high level of selling pressure and a possible exhaustion of the downtrend. Traders can use these conditions to anticipate a pullback or a reversal and adjust their positions accordingly.

**How does CMF reflect both technicals and fundamentals?**

CMF is a unique indicator that reflects both technicals and fundamentals of a stock. CMF reflects technicals by using the price and volume data of the stock to calculate the Money Flow Volume and the CMF. These values show how much money is flowing into and out of the stock, which indicates the level of interest and activity in the market. CMF also reflects technicals by generating signals and opportunities based on the trend, crossover, divergence, overbought, and oversold conditions of the indicator and the price.

CMF reflects fundamentals by incorporating the closing price of the stock into the Money Flow Multiplier. The closing price is the most important price of the period, as it represents the final consensus of the market participants. The closing price can also reflect the impact of any news, events, or announcements that affect the company or the industry. By using the closing price, CMF captures the effect of the fundamentals on the money flow of the stock. CMF also reflects fundamentals by confirming or contradicting the price action of the stock, which can reveal the underlying strength or weakness of the company.

CMF is a powerful and invaluable indicator that can help traders analyze the money flow of a stock over a specified period. CMF can help traders identify trends, signals, and opportunities in the market, as well as confirm or contradict the price action of the stock. CMF can also reflect both technicals and fundamentals of a stock, which can provide a comprehensive and holistic view of the stock’s behavior. Traders can use CMF to enhance their trading performance and achieve better results.",How to Use Chaikin Money Flow to Trade Like a Boss,18nytk4,1703196714.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nytk4/how_to_use_chaikin_money_flow_to_trade_like_a_boss/,

"People wanted shorter posts, so I'll keep this short. Nike's killing it with strong brand game and high demand. Their Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and solid digital/DTC game are paying off.

Their direct's retail traffic is up, converting browsers to buyers like crazy. Digital sales are hitting record highs thanks to loyal members. The North America, EMEA, and APLA regions are on fire with more traffic, higher conversion, and bigger average orders.

Their own stores and digital platforms are booming across regions. Expect about a 1.2% jump in NIKE Brand revenues to $12.87B, with Direct-to-Consumer growing 2.2% and Wholesale edging up 0.5%.

However, margins are under pressure. Costs are biting into profits, with gross and operating margins taking hits from higher expenses and currency issues. SG&amp;A expenses are up, especially with more spending on marketing and digital transformations.

They're saying gross margin might grow by 100 basis points to 43.9%, but SG&amp;A expenses are also up by 5.8%. Expect a slight dip in operating margin to 11.4% due to these costs.

So the bottom line is, nike is gonna be strong in sales and digital, but cost pressures are a pain point. That being said, I'm gonna grab NKE 12/22 125c for $2.56, but also sell calls at a higher strike price to make it a spread. I can sell the 130c for $1.17, making the cost of the total spread about $139 with a max profit of 260%.

"Disclosure: I own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6/21/2024. Stock is currently trading at 43.98 USD at the time of posting. 

For personal reasons I really wanted to see this company fail after having my Roblox account hacked and losing all my items (valued at $3k in PV) but unfortunately, they are growing and will continue to do so. Roblox isn't just a video game company, they are also a virtual economy, as well as a tech company.

Fundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable, creative, and deep in content than any video game in history. You can play COD, Dead By Daylight (just released by the studio behind FNAF), Roller Coaster Simulators, ELF (video game based on the movie, Tycoon Games, and more. Literally any game you can think of, you can play on this platform. 

The ingenious way they make profit is similar to how Steam does - by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games, clothing, and most importantly limited-release collectibles that appreciate over time. The main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency: Robux. Effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell Robux at their own discretion. This has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time. 

E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora) \- the Sparkle Time Fedora, released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1,730,000 Robux - the equivalent of 2150 CAD today ([https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav](https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav)). As a result many players are buying and holding items, some of which are sold in numbered amounts 1/1000, 1/350, etc, holding their value even in the face of inflation. E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant) released with 400 numbered units, retailing for 17,499 Robux or 220 CAD versus 148 CAD, 180 days ago.

If you take a look at the charts over time, their items tend to only go in one direction, up - which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials. Revenue hit $713.2 million, up 38% year-over-year; Average Daily Active Users (“DAUs”) were 70.2 million, up 20% year-over-year; and hours engaged were 16.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. 

Suffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the Chain Smokers, Lil Naz X, the Weeknd, Disney, Dead by Daylight, and more, they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product.

In terms of liquidity they have 2.1 Billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres, invest in more developers and partnerships, and continue on the path towards profitability.

In the short-term macroeconomic environment, we have the holidays coming up, and if you talk to a lot of parents, kids are going crazy for Roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game. I predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40% if we follow the same pattern last year (28 USD on Dec 30th to 37.75 by Jan 27th).

In the long-term Roblox's technology is insane. They have full software support for VR, a giant user base, and the ability for users/developers to come in and build anything. Not to mention it is lucrative for them as well, as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game. With VR technology becoming cheaper year over year, this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers, businesses, etc. Not a huge metaverse fan in general, but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn't a bad idea.

In short, I think Roblox has a lot of room to grow, with insane potential for growth over the next few years. I'm confident that even in the face of rising inflation (which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year) they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term. Not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive VR world.",Roblox DD - Bullish regrettably…,18nuia3,1703185455.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nuia3/roblox_dd_bullish_regrettably/,

"I know I know ex-SPACs have a bad rap, but BAER  I like the stock.  It's trading at a substantial discount from the ""ipo"".  Soo let's look under the hood for this unique operation.

**Basics:**

Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. provides aerial wildfire management, relief and suppression, and firefighting services to federal and state government agencies in the United States. It offers fire suppression services, such as direct fire suppression aerial firefighting support services for ground crew to drop large amounts of water quickly and directly on wildfires. The company also provides aerial surveillance services, including fire suppression aircraft over an incident and tactical coordination with the incident commander through its manned and unmanned aircraft. It operates an aircraft fleet of 21 planes.

**Numbers:**

Currently trading at $6.50 with TTM P/E of \~16 The average TTM P/E of the Russell 2000 is 27, so from a purely value perspective the company is trading relatively cheap compared to other small caps.   I am not aware of any direct competitors who are listed, so take with a grain of salt.

Assets/Libs:  82% They carry a high debt load, as is common with operations in aviation.  But ultimately have more assets than debt.

Revenue: most recent results net income jumped to 17.4m in Q3 from a -19m loss in Q2 to with a marginal 5%  SGA growth.  Speaks for itself, nice.  They are acquiring revenue and not allowing costs to balloon.

**Growth:**

Wildfires are a ""booming business"" approximately $3.5 billion dollars were spent fighting wildfires during 2022 by the federal government alone.  That's just the federal government... This does not include suppression cost bore by municipal, county, and state fire departments/forestry services. [https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics/suppression-costs](https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics/suppression-costs)

The Bureau of Land Management stated in a report that ""Suppression costs alone are too often incorrectly cited as the “cost of wildfire”. As a result, the vast majority of true costs are ignored from a planning and budgeting perspective. Costs associated with wildfire extend beyond both the acres burned and the days or weeks of the fire event. In many cases, suppression cost figures capture only the immediate costs for the WUI and the wildfire itself.""

They double down in the conclusion stating that the ""Synthesis of case studies in the report reveals a range of total wildfire costs anywhere from **2 to 30 times greater than the reported suppression costs.**""  Bullish, so even the dataset we reviewed earlier is likely a vast under estimation of the total spend on fire suppression by conservatively half. [](https://www.blm.gov/or/districts/roseburg/plans/collab_forestry/files/truecostofwilfire.pdf)

Frankly there are just more fires every year. Per the EPA the number of acreage burned in wildfires has increased by 174,273 acres/year since 1980.  They expect this trend to continue into the future, probably not great for us, but bullish for BAER.

"A few months ago Bill Ackman announced he was short US treasuries, this led to more hedge funds moving into the trade and to a record short position in US Treasuries. Billions of dollars were and still are short US government bonds. Hedge funds anticipated yields to rise past 5%, even Jamie Dimon expected this. Instead the Fed held steady and didn't raise so yields are falling, fast. Now hedge funds are sitting on big losses on their short trade. They're also heavily short stocks as well and we keep going higher, even making new all time highs. Basically they got it wrong in the bond and stock market. I suspect we will see a few hedge funds get margin called and forced to sell off their positions and we will see more days like 12/20, random afternoon sell off as volumes as lower than usual and the positions need to sold so the prices drop fast. 0dte options are also a problem and can accelerate sell offs but this is another story for another day.

"**Introduction:**

In the realm of global commerce, it's not uncommon for seemingly unrelated industries to influence one another. In the world supply chain, as it's implied in the name, geopolitical impacts can heavily shift demand in chain-like reactions. Now it all starts with one player which is the humble pomegranate. As demand for this antioxidant-rich fruit continues to soar, the aviation industry finds itself grappling with the unexpected consequences of pomegranate shipping, amplified by the complex events of geopolitics.

**The Pomegranate Boom:** 

Pomegranates have experienced a surge in popularity due to their health benefits and exotic appeal. According to multiple sources, the pomegranate export industry will see anywhere between 6-10%+ compounded annual growth ([Tracking top exporters](https://www.tridge.com/intelligences/pomegranate/export)). As suppliers seek to meet the global appetite for this ruby-red fruit, a ripple effect is felt in unexpected areas. Pomegranates, being a delicate cargo, require specialized handling and quick transportation to ensure they reach their destination in prime condition. Pomegranates require a storage temperature between 4 and 6°C (39.2-42.8°F for the freedom loving folks) for a maximum of 2-3 months. However, there are cases when longer storage is needed; it requires ten degrees to avoid cold damage. The optimum relative humidity of 90-95% is another crucial factor for pomegranate storage. This demand for swift transport becomes even more critical as geopolitical issues disrupt traditional shipping routes.

Now when it comes traditional shipping, you may think of trucks for ""last-mile"" deliveries to grocery stores, freight rail, and cargo ships. However trucking does not carry the vast majority of exports from countries, this comes from long distance rail and shipping. Now comes geopolitical tensions.

**Geopolitical Waves:** 

Now we have all heard of the ongoing multiyear war between Russia and Ukraine, this has halted freight rail going across this vast stretch of land and has closed of it's airspace. There is also the developing issue in the middle east, with an ongoing assault in Gaza. This has dragged in other players in the middle east. This means that for the maritime industry, a traditional player in the transportation of goods, it is now facing challenges due to geopolitical tensions.

[Operation Prosperity Guardian](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/18/us-to-expand-red-sea-defense-as-houthis-disrupt-trade.html)

The U.S. launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, an expansion of its maritime defense force in the Red Sea amid mounting attacks from the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group. These attacks have been directed at commercial vehicles headed through the Suez Canal. Several major companies like BP and Maersk have paused shipping in the Red Sea as danger from Houthi drone strikes escalates. Increased scrutiny and re-routing of shipping routes under Africa have led to delays and uncertainties in the delivery of goods. The US has also joined forces with other maritime powers, for a combined total of 39 countries. When we look at these countries you can also see that nearly half of the top 10 exporters are involved in this conflict. **Canada**, Poland, Chile, **United States**, Serbia, **Netherlands**, **Belgium**, Mexico, China, and Ukraine. In total half of the top ten exports are involved with conflicts, this also doesn't include China who is rumored to join this conflict.

This means one thing for pomegranate suppliers. By seeking reliability and speed, are turning their gaze skyward.

**Airlines to the Rescue:** 
As maritime routes face geopolitical turbulence, airlines emerge as agile alternatives for transporting time-sensitive and perishable cargo like pomegranates. The speed and flexibility of air transport provide a solution to the challenges posed by geopolitical uncertainties, ensuring that the supply chain remains resilient. The geopolitical landscape is reshaping global trade dynamics. Pomegranate suppliers are strategically opting for air transport to bypass the uncertainties associated with maritime routes. This shift not only underlines the adaptability of the aviation industry but also positions airlines as key players in ensuring the steady flow of perishable goods amidst geopolitical waves.

Now when we look at stocks for airlines, they have not recovered to their pre-pandemic highs. Now why is that? Passenger demand has shot up past pre-pandemic levels yet airlines have not seen that growth. Well it's because cargo shipping has declined in the past few years, with growth not expected for the foreseeable future.

['JETS' ETF](https://preview.redd.it/k3my8azs0n7c1.png?width=2424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c80701e48c74728965d39b4f87a0368c0230214)

**Growth is around the corner:** 
With the new geopolitical problems, this forces pomegranate exporters to ship their goods via the air. This will make up for the lack of growth seen in cargo shipments for airlines. The collaboration between pomegranate shipping and airlines is not merely a logistical adaptation but an economic resilience strategy. By embracing air transport in the face of geopolitical challenges, the industry ensures a consistent supply chain, safeguarding jobs and stimulating economic growth.

**Conclusion/TLDR: Explosions are up. Pomegranates are wanted. Now close the f-king door we have pomegranates taking off. 43C UAL 12/22/23.**

**Bullish Case: More pomegranates are being eaten. Interest rates down. Demand up. More flights needed. Oil is cheaper (being enforced by freedom lovers).**

"Hi all,

As I consider buying C3.ai stocks, I'd like to address concerns about the company and hear others' opinions.

Firstly, it's concerning that the company, founded in 2009, has changed its name multiple times from C3 to C3.Energy to C3.IoT and now C3.ai. This suggests a lack of focus on a specific technology, following trends rather a passion.

Another  issue is the inconsistency in the company's financial reporting. They've changed how they define customers, shifting from total companies to divisions within a company, and referring to parent companies as ""customer-entities,"" which could inflate the claimed number of customers.

"Let’s just start with the fact that I don’t know jack from shit … but here is my guess.

The markets were on a heavy and significant bull run, pricing in 3 future rate cuts in 2024 at minimum with a full stop on interest rate increases.

The thing is, we are December and in particular, the end of December, meaning there are a lot of financial advisors, hedge fund managers, MM’s etc. liquidating positions to solidify current gains to then rebalance their portfolios going into the new year.

I am going to assume that this shit is going to be bought right back up by next week or, if the sell off continues, going into the New Year the markets will rebound significantly.


Unless there is a WW3 being announced or some crazy unheard of situation that ensues causing this dump, I believe there is a blessing in disguise for us dégénérâtes (French to make it sound more sophisticated) as there will be a lot of good opportunities for us 0DTE aficionado’s going into the new year, whether that be calls, puts, or both.

As I said, I don’t know shit, but I wouldn’t be surprised SPY test $473 again within the next two or three weeks. Even though we are only December 20, there is technically only like 5 more trading days left in the year, this dump kind of makes sense.

Additionally, this selloff seems very algo/computer driven, meaning these large block selloffs were already pre-meditated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why I am long on Aegon Ltd:

&amp;#x200B;

The all time high for Aegon (AEG) is 62.56 per share in January of 1999. So what happened in the 90s causing this price increase and subsequent drop-off?

 

# [Dutch insurer acquires Transamerica in $9.7 billion deal](https://www.deseret.com/1999/2/18/19430613/dutch-insurer-acquires-transamerica-in-9-7-billion-deal)

&amp;#x200B;

The stock lost a significant amount of value over the next several years following this purchase and again lost even more value after shares were issued to the Dutch State in 2008 to help weather the economic storm.

There was a slight price increase after [AEGON completes repayment to Dutch State](https://br.advfn.com/bolsa-de-valores/lse/AGN/share-news/48068169/aegon-completes-repayment-to-dutch-state) but then the price topped out at 9.50 per share in 2013 before dropping to a low of 1.80 in March 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

In January this year, the company announced [plans to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans](https://www.aegon.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2023/aegon-to-repurchase-shares-for-share-based-compensation-plans) for senior management.

In August this year, CEO Lard Friese stated that [Transamerica performed well. New Life sales increased by 17% compared with the previous year, driven by another strong increase in the number of World Financial Group (WFG) agents, now at a record-high of 70,000. Written sales of mid-sized retirement plans increased almost 70%, driven largely by a pooled plan sale of USD 1.7 billion.](https://www.aegon.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2023/aegon-reports-first-half-2023-results)

&amp;#x200B;

According to [this article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/world-financial-group-already-breaking-records-in-2021-1030508785) from 2021, WFG only had 50,000 agents in 2021. That means they have seen a **40%** **INCREASE** in the number of independent licensed agents working with them since the shift to remote work.

This has resulted in [The company expecting operating capital generation from its units to be around 1.2 billion euros ($1.30 billion) this year, versus a prior target of more than 1 billion.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dutch-insurer-aegon-hikes-capital-generation-target-on-us-strength) The prior target of 1.2 billion was not projected until 2025, meaning they are growing much more than they had anticipated.

Also in November of 2022, Transamerica [Appointed Todd Buchanan President of World Financial Group and Head of Transamerica Financial Advisors](https://www.worldfinancialgroup.com/press-releases/transamerica-appoints-todd-buchanan-president-world-financial-group-and-head) who brings ""more than 25 years of expertise in insurance distribution, digital transformation, retirement, and wealth management leadership to his new roles.""

So all of these factors, along with their ability to now offer stock options to senior management of their rapidly expanding field force in the near future, I see Aegon's price rising A LOT over the next several years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AEG is up 14.76% as of this writing over the past year and 20.06% in just the last 6 months.** 

&amp;#x200B;

When I began looking into this a couple weeks ago, the furthest expiration options available were for July 19, 2024 and you could get a 7.5 call for $5 bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked up some of them and they've already tripled in value but from everything I'm seeing on this company I plan to keep buying more calls as they become available.

"I've made a few posts about the shipping crisis, I made some final buys today to have some diversified exposure. Here's my reasoning for each pick

STNG - they bought back 27% of their shares last year, they do refined products which apparently is basically at max utilization rn as far as shipping is concerned. Something like 10% of worlds refined product goes thru red sea

TNP - trading for less than half of book value and a 3 p/e, this one has half their fleet ""ice breaker rated"". Sailing thru the arctic is faster than around the cape. LNG tanker. They claim that every 1000 usd increase in spot shipping rates = 18 cents more profit. They cite rates of 30-60k a day depending on the ship.

TNK - crude tanker that bought back 10% of their shares last year

ZIM - they do containers, i keep seeing estimates of 20-30% of worlds container ships go thru red sea. Right now there is a glut of container supply so average rate is 1337/container, down from a high of 14000/container in Jan 2022. I think it is evident that demand destruction for containers doesn't occur until significantly higher shipping rates than todays. Out of all of these ZIM is the shittiest co and basically an outright scam but scams always pump the hardest in my experience

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to understand the supply chains more, but until I do I wanted to have diversified exposure to each of these product types - containers, refined product, LNG, crude. It could be that refiners feel the pinch first and so they bid up crude tankers, or that theres a glut of LNG in some ports, so some of these bags might be completely fucked that's why I went with calls coz the one bag that is not fucked could 10x my calls. STNG is by far my largest position because they were already buying back 27% of their float outstanding in last 12 months

Oh yes, reverse a slogan to see a company's true weakness they're trying to patch with a slogan... Apple, Think Different reversed? Well yeah, William Tong's probably coming for you too.

My bet is that most people are not thinking enough to be worried about these lawsuits.  But if they were concerned William Tong had bigger fangs than FAANG, some shares might cascade into lower values... But I don't think even shareholders are that smart to guess this, so the market won't be affected til a couple larger anti-trusts are won by Tong.  I pray William Tong takes down more Big Tech, since they're pushing anti freedom censorship agendas.

"I wrote [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/r9ETwvJrVk) at the end of November. And the stock went up more than 20%, but short interest actually went up from 34% of float to [39%.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOOS/short-interest/) Since then the CEO has done two interviews in December that included business updates. 

[First interview](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-resonates-with-people-canada-goose-ceo-1.2008716?taid=65722b4e9835ea0001dfdde5&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter) includes an update that demand is strong in China. [Second interview](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1737129473001017687?s=19) included a note from the CEO that traffic across all channels is up. To confirm, I went to their Chicago store and nearby stores for North Face, Moncler, etc to compare traffic.. Canada Goose store was the only one that was packed with a line outside. [Video of the line for proof](https://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1733638949707354297?s=19).

The company is about to report their biggest quarter of the year. Analysts expect sales to go up only 7.5% yoy. That's an easy beat given comments from the CEO and that their historical revenue CAGR is much higher than that.

"DocuSign's CEO Allan Thygesen just sold [\~42% of his shares](https://app.stockocean.com/company/docu) yesterday (Dec 19) for $5.7 million.

This is especially interesting given the [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/e-signature-company-docusign-explores-a-deal-1bbbc848) reported last Friday (Dec 15) that Docusign is exploring a sale...

The sale was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan (pre-planned sale) so may have triggered despite (not because of) the announcement.

But the size of the sale is still quite unusual. DOCU stock has risen \~38% over the last month given the recent bull run.

Pure speculation but some potential reasons on Allan's selling of shares:

\- General liquidity needs

\- Lack of confidence in deal going through, realizing profits on recent run up

\- Allan stepping down as CEO

"Hello everyone,

About two months ago I posted about AMR, a metallurgical coal company that I thought was a buy at 225 a share. That position has worked out well! With about a 60% runup in two months.

&amp;#x200B;

[AMR Post Report Stock Performance](https://preview.redd.it/ip36lki9ch7c1.jpg?width=721&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c66b037392ca991ea30c06c85395ca98cc625c)

As such, it may be worth updating the model and seeing what happens. The TLDR is this, the underlying thesis isn't all that different. If met coal prices remain high, then this thing is still ""cheap"" and if they don't, then it isn't.

The model is unchanged from last time, but with two adjustments. First, I assume that AMR makes about 277 million in post tax profits in Q4 2023 and it uses about 260 million of it to buy back shares. The float is now roughly 13million, down from 13.6 million.

When analyze companies using DCFs, I generally take the current price as given, and use that to imply a discount rate aka an expected return. Right now the stock implies about a 37% expected yearly return. My breakeven for a company with this amount of risk would be about 25% returns, or about a 460 per share price.

"Due to Boston's perfomance and recent good news I started wondering whether Boston is worth investing in now, so I did some (kinda) research and have a question for y'all.

Firstly, Boston Scientific recently resolved their scandal case with LOTUS, which was because they said several years ago that their LOTUS device was the best of the best, and so on. But it later turned out that there were serious problems that were not reported, and the device had to be recalled and stopped selling.

This later caused a big drop in the BSX, but they recently resolved it with a [$38M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/boston-scientific-shareholder-settlement), which is obviously good for them.

Boston is also growing steadily over the long term and generally has good dynamics as I see.

However, some say that Enovis will soon take the leading position (already pushing Boston into the top pick list).

"Hello WSB,

I am an expert on this community because I have had literally dozens of accounts on reddit and though I am often unceremoniously removed for BULLSHIT or just lose my access because of BULLSHIT or delete reddit because it's a bunch of BULLSHIT before coming back because I miss the BULLSHIT, I have been observing this community for the past 4 years.

The basic progression of wallstreetbetters are:

1. The young male who doesn't know anything about anything. He is usually in the trades or fresh out of college. He heard about gamestop mooning and thinks he's going to quickly learn how to find great stocks because, well because he's never been fucked over really really hard by the incomprehsible and capricious markets. Usually he'll have diligently saved up what for him is a substantial amount of money maybe $5k or $10k. He will go into the daily thread and ask for some help, ""hey I am going to yolo, what's a sure bet that can't lose money? I saved up $4k and I need it to pay tuition. Also whats a put option? Is that when I put my money on a brokerage and they help me choose what company? Also what's a stock delta? Is that just delta airlines?""

Naturally this guy is going to get absolutely ripped apart. Usually a bunch of you will give him bad advice, tell him to look at YouTube, or try and scam him through a crypto scheme directly in his DMs. Maybe one out of a thousand of you will give him a good pick, and then the rest of you will downvote the one person who actually is providing good info. This guy is on the fast track to becoming the second kind of poster here.

2. The perpetual loser. The rosy glasses get broken when the long dick of the market slaps him in his face. He's humiliated and lost money he couldn't afford. Being that he has more testosterone than neurons, he decides that he's going to get revenge. Most of you fall into this category. He will now ""study"" the markets. That means paying for TA videos and picks from gurus. He will begin sharing his crayon drawings and writing incredibly long DDs based on hunches, random and very old news articles, and a fervent desire to be vindicated. He will scrape together whatever cash he can, maybe from payday loans, maybe from sucking dick, maybe from sucking loans out of a dick. Now he's got the wheels turning. Surely his first big play was ruined by a cabal of pump and dumpers. Rather than fight the tide, he will attempt to pump his own dump. Thus the DD. If he can convince a greater enough volume of bigger idiots that his picks are good, he will singlehandedly create a trend and come out victorious. God help us if he catches lightning and his pick somehow DOES make some money. A single 10x play, even with just a $200 position, will go straight to his head and propel him to the next stage. 

Now normally he will just sort of linger in this category, losing more than he wins and his wins will be modest. If he does get a lucky play, he will turn into stage 3.

3. The expert/genius/guru. The taste of victory will go directly to his ego. He will have $20k in funds which basically means he's a millionaire. He will immediately get a WSB tattoo and lease a Tesla. His posts will lose all humor and perspective. He will gleefully lead newcomers into the briar patch, then mock them for losing their ass. His brain will be permanently modified. And so begins his downfall. At best, he will lose his entire account in one play and meekly fall back into stage 2. At worst, he will continue his inexplicable streak and amass a fortune that will enslave him into gambling addiction.

He will begin acting like he is an insider if he continues winning. He will believe he can move markets through his will alone. That he is clairvoyant. That he was destined for immense wealth and prestige. We will be seeing him put $200k into a 0dte call option with no hedge on an airline, tesla, PLTR, or Kodak. He will lose his ass.

" 

$AMD is set up to take a lot of market share from $NVDA for 2 reasons:

1.Much of of $NVDA ´s moat stems from CUDA, which enables developers to interact with $NVDA GPUs seamlessly when coding.

However, Pytorch has become the dominant framework for deep learning (AI) and now, $AMD GPUs work out of the box on Pytorch.

This opens the veil for $AMD to disrupt $NVDA ´s software moat and levels the playing field.

2. $NVDA ´s chips are monolithic, while $AMD ´s chips are chiplet based. Chiplets have enabled $AMD to disrupt $INTC by yielding high performing but cheap chips.

This is because when you make a chip out of chiplets, if one of the components goes wrong you don´t have to throw the entire thing away. Hence, yields are much higher than in monolithic architectures.

I believe the same is going to happen on the GPU side.

Chiplets have lower margins and so pivoting to this would hurt $NVDA ´s financials: a clear case of the Innovator´s Dilemma. $NVDA has a fantastic business and will hardly find the incentives to disrupt itself moving towards chiplets.

"The MOAC (mother of all catalysts) is upon us with the BTC ETF approval, and this is my XMas gift to you all.


In November, MARA produced 1,187 BTC with a hashrate of 23.1 and an average cost to mine at ~$10,000. As of this post, 1 BTC = $42,848.10. This equates to ~$38M in value per month, or $467M in value per year if we extrapolate the current values. 

Note, they currently have $325,266,000 in long-term debt at 1% interest (fuck yes) with a Dec 2026 maturity date. So let’s bring that into the mix. If we break that down:

$325,266,000 in convertible senior notes at 36 months @ 1% = $9,175,136/m. That revises our estimates to ~$29M/month and ~$357M/year. 

With 222.63M shares outstanding and a PE of 11 (average for oil), that gives us a current value of $17.66/share. MARA closed at $21.97, which suggests this simplified, conservative model is well within the ballpark. So you’re probably asking yourself, how is this a value play?

Well, the MOAC is upon us, and markets should be forward looking. So looking forward:

Conservative estimates for BTC price after the MOAC is $80,000. Further, MARA just today announced plans for an increased exahash capacity of 56% and decreased per coin mining cost of ~30%. If we plug those into our model, we get $74.71/share. 

This isn’t a conclusive model, it’s some glorified napkin math that, as it turns out, get’s us pretty close to today’s price. However, extrapolating given the MOAC and the operational improvements on the roadmap, it’s pretty clear that this stock will reach the $70s in 2024. If BTC explodes into the 6 digit club, we’re closer to $100/share.

"Here’s my take on the soft landing…

The runway has only just come into sight, our pilot is about to attempt his first ever landing (in fact, it’s his first time flying a plane!) and he’s never seen this airport, but it’s known to have an exceptionally short runway where there have been several rather spectacular crashes in the past. There are some storm clouds gathering on the horizon. He comes onto the loudspeaker and announces that he’s feeling great about the coming landing, after all, it’s looking sunny outside. The passengers erupt into applause and start celebrating their safe arrival. Meanwhile, a handful of passengers remain quiet, wondering if they are crazy to be wondering if there’s a chance that things might not go to plan…

Sound absolutely ridiculous? Powell is about to walk a tight rope.

"His Fund was buying right so what could go wrong? 😑 I have no one but myself to blame! 😭
The year was 2021, a time of hope and optimism in the air. I was a young, naive investor starting my journey in financial investing. I devoured every piece of information I could find and listened to anyone with strong opinions about the stock market. I knew to stay away from options trading and day trading. I wanted to do things the right way, the ""get rich slow"" way.

It wasn't long before I came across the legendary Jim Cramer, who had quite the reputation. I read his opinion about an undervalued stock that was trending downward from its all-time high of $308 in July 2021. The stock was currently trading around $191.41. With an open mind and hopeful heart, I started listening to Mr. Cramer himself as he made a case for PayPal to become the most undervalued stock with strong upside potential.

He even mentioned that the charity fund of CNBC had been buying and dollar-cost averaging into this valuable asset, starting at a price point above $191. So, I took a leap of faith and started dollar-cost averaging, buying a little bit at a time over a long period. I believed in the business model. I have used PayPal. I read about their $19 billion revenue in 2021, operating margin of under 18% at the time, and good long term debt.  I started buying in nov 2021. And then it happened. 

what started as weeks of buying turned into months, and months turned into years. The stock kept getting beaten down by tech stock withdrawals (even though it was later reclassified as a financial stock) and further impacted by the SVB bank debacle. The stop kept on crashing 

After years of holding this stock, PayPal finally showed some signs of recovery. However, it hasn't been a great journey. It was filled with missed opportunities and a lot of stress. It's embarrassing and regretful, but someone has to take the first step forward to say it. I am a victim of Jim Cramer's financial assault. I lhave no one to blame but myself and my own naïveté, fuel by strong OPTIMISM about PayPal

Ok so I know that they screwed us a bit with the G@me stuff, but at least they were upfront about it. I see chuckie SWAB and fast Eddie just taking people’s money right and left.

 At least Robinhood is honest about what they are and where their money comes from and how they are making it, so you don’t get surprised. 

Also you won’t get some jerk financial advisor that will sell you out of your stocks and then back into the same ones so that they can earn a commission. 

And they don’t charge you $100 a trade either. 

Robinhood will be the future, and I believe that they are run well, and that we will see them take off. 

Once these boomers age out of their 60/40 split portfolios that yield on average 2-3% after fees from other brokers, we will see the smart money move out of these traditional brokerage firms and into Robinhood in one of the greatest transfers of wealth in history.

"Why is everyone suddenly promoting doomsday theories of imminent collapse and despair?

There’s a few issues people need to understand.

1. The 2008 financial crisis happened due to financial deregulation under Clinton (glass stegal) with banks assuming too much risk. 

For example sub prime lending. Wallstreet institutions taking on risky mortgages that people can’t afford to pay.

The banks are now regulated under the bi partisan Dodd frank act

2. Inflation 

There are parts to inflation that are directly caused by the fed and some the fed can’t control

Fed can control asset prices like buying mortgage back securities 

Fed cannot control consumer prices, and inflation in consumer prices have more to do with supply of goods.

 This however can be controlled by policy makers 
Like adding china to the WTO to export inflation to 3rd world countries. (Slave factories making your iPhone)

The fed can influence the demand of goods by raising and lowering interest rates. But there no guarantee people will act the way the fed expects. 

3.  American exceptionalism 

America has an advantage that other countries don’t.  our technological innovation keeps us ahead of the curb. 

There is no competition with apple 
There is no competition with google 
There is no competition with Microsoft

4. Market cycles 

Markets move in cycles. Markets will usually hit a peak go down and rise up again. There is no need to panic, as knowing this you can profit both ways.

Conclusion.

There is no reason to cite doomsday scenarios as it’s unproductive. The United States is the most powerful country in the world. You don’t become that with idiots running your country. While nothing’s perfect. Be thankful you don’t have to walk 10 miles a day to get water 💧 as some people in the world do.

"Hello, I'm writing this as a follow up to u/nobjos wonderful writeup on the Lindy Effect and it's possibility to create alpha for a well diversified portfolio.

  
The Lindy effect as stated is to invest in companies that have existed for a long time, as it should signal that the future risk of bankruptcy is lowered.

  
For context on portfolio construction please refer to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18jifhs/lindy\_effect\_in\_investing\_i\_analyzed\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18jifhs/lindy_effect_in_investing_i_analyzed_the/)  


I wanted to extend his analysis by doing a Fama French Factor regression on the Lindy Portfolio.  I.e can we explain the returns of a portfolio of Lindy stocks using the returns of other well known equity factors.  Here's the list of equity factors I have chosen.  
Mkt-RF: This is the excess return of the market (over the risk free rate)  
SMB: Small Minus Big, think of this as the relative performance of small stocks vs big stocks  
HML: High minus Low, think of this as the relative performance of high book to price stocks vs low book to price stocks.  
Quality Minus Junk: An AQR Factor, the relative performance of stocks with high quality earnings (positive, high ROE, low earnings volatility etc)  
Betting Against Beta: Another AQR Factor, is the relative performance of high beta stocks vs low beta stocks.  
UMD: Up minus Down, basically a momentum portfolio.  
I ran the regression using daily returns from Jan 1 2010 - October 2023.  
Here are my results!  
Basically, the Lindy Portfolio is exactly what you would think would happen.  It's tilted toward small companies (because it doesn't include megacap tech), high value, high quality, low beta.  The negative tilt on momentum is because I rebalanced the return series daily.

I wouldn't take too much stock in the fact that the constant term is ""zero"" or use that to conclude that the Lindy effect is perfectly explained by the factors.  I didn't include dividends in my timeseries nor did I deal with survivorship bias.

""I'm the guy that's praying for a crash while everybody else is not. We need to get back down to normal, and we need to send a message to central banks,"" he continued. ""This should be a lesson I don't think we'll ever revisit. I don't think we'll ever see a bubble for any of our lifetimes again.""

Dent, who spent the majority of his career analyzing proprietary research, credited his against-the-grain prediction to overvalued markets and excessive stimulus spending. While recent rallies have overwhelmingly provided investors with mild recession expectations, Dent remained firm that an ""everything bubble"" will burst next year.

"Who remembers veve? The sad story of Disney's nft platform

I remember when this came out it was so hyped. No way Disney is dropping NFTs, this surely has to blow up! Featuring a platform full of over printed nfts that can't be transferred. Currency that can't be taken off the platform. And a dead community that is full of people with locked balances because they can't withdraw under the $500 minimum. Honestly surprised this platform didn't get more hate or media attention. 

I deposited 1000 back in October 2021 and after trading and holding mostly, I'm at 200. Which I can't even cash out. I have to get to 500 to cashout past their minimum where they take a 10% fee as well, with other transaction fees. Honestly it's a joke. 

I'm holding two collectibles currently trying to bounce up to 500, the dock ock ultimate animated, and the new Elsa secret rare. I bought these due to the same collection of items containing items valued at around 7000, for the Spiderman ultimate animated. Let's pray this pumps up and I'm able to recoup some of my losses.

But this has me curious, how many users here have money or collectibles locked in the veve platform? This was a pretty big community when it first launched. Is anyone on this sub in a similar situation? Can we legally pump the same collectibles to withdraw or what

This is normal. Market cap weighting naturally takes the mathematical average. Outliers have a high influence on averages. This happens basically every year. 38 stocks doing massively better than the index is very typical.

The Magnificent 7 narrative is a psyop. The financial media sliced up the index in such a way as to make it seem as though 493 stocks all went sideways. In reality there was a huge amount of variance from one stock to the next.

Just the fact that 105 stocks did 25% or better makes it a strong year. 1/5 of the stocks beat typical long run market average returns by more than double.","In 5 min using Schwab's stock screener, I prove that the Magnificent 7 narrative is a bullshit psyop.",18ly1k6,1702978551.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ly1k6/in_5_min_using_schwabs_stock_screener_i_prove/,

"These boneheads reported nearly 100 billion hours watched over a six month period and disclosed all the shows by views last week like a bunch of idiots.

99% of that related to 60 shows all released in 2023 except for a couple WSB favorites like Cocomelon Season 1.

Basically the rest of the 18,000 titles are worthless from a stock perspective. No offense to those that enjoyed Waterworld or The Mask of Zorro. Those are absolute bangers. 

Netflix drops about $17 billion a year on content to keep up this pace and since nobody watches the shit from last year they gotta keep spending for the next 60.

This gives them about $8B in FCF annually  which is about $2B short of what they owe in debt less cash last quarter of $10B.

So they need about 61M net new subs to close that gap. 

Now they claim 100M people were non paid subs they kicked off during the password crackdown and they would get most of those back. Only 9M came back last quarter which is problem number 1.

Problem number 2 is they need to continue to raise prices without losing subs.

Problem number 3 is the churn of the content itself every year at an enormous cost and hitting 60 home run titles a year.

Even with unlimited resources that model is going to crack soon at this ridiculous valuation.

"So first we we recognize that 7 stocks are driving all growth.
Nvidia
Tesla
Meta
Microsoft
Amazon
Apple
Google

And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.

Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money

Risks: 
Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit 

Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.

Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.

Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore.
Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China.
Low risk of either outcome.

Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.

Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.

"For Satori Fund founder Dan Niles, yet another interest rate hike means that “Don’t fight the Fed” has a whole new meaning.

With Fed Chair Jerome Powell declaring that his inflation fight is “unconditional,” Wall Street’s favorite mantra is now a warning to avoid stocks, or at least to take a more conservative approach to investing.

“Don’t fight the Fed, and don’t fight the fundamentals,” Niles told CNBC on Monday, warning investors that any stock market rallies that come amid Fed tightening are nothing but bear market traps for investors.

Niles, who holds a master’s in electrical engineering from Stanford and once worked for Lehman Brothers, has argued since December that investors should hold a large portion of their portfolio in cash, and he repeated that call this week.

“I think for the retail investor that can’t daily trade their portfolio, you’re better off losing, as we’ve said consistently this entire year, 5% to 7% to inflation, rather than potentially 30% to 50% to a market decline which I think will continue into next year,” he said.","Okay, so, is ""Don't fight the Fed"" dead?",18lokad,1702946481.0,https://i.redd.it/t2fdu9k7e57c1.png,

"Picture this: Novavax, the company that hit the jackpot with a $1.6 billion windfall from the government to whip up a COVID-19 vaccine, faced a rollercoaster of challenges in 2021. As they hustled to churn out vaccines, they stumbled into a quality quagmire.

Rumors are swirling that their vaccine quality took a nosedive, raising eyebrows at the FDA and putting a spoke in the wheel of the global mission to get COVID shots to countries on a budget. According to insiders dishing to Politico, the NVAX vaccine's purity levels clocked in at a meager 70%, falling way short of the FDA's 90% benchmark for COVID-19 vaccine batches.

But here's the kicker – when Novavax dished out updates to their investors, they downplayed these manufacturing hiccups like they were no big deal.

"MRNA without a doubt is the proverbial ""Covid Stock.""  Many prognosticators and pundits have gone bottom fishing and failed numerous times to catch the falling knife.  However, I'm going to go where many a portfolio has gone to die before, (except there's actually evidence the sellers are losing momentum).

Let's start with the technicals:  As we saw in my successful prediction on SQ, [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block\_inc\_sq\_high\_probability\_technical\_bullish/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block_inc_sq_high_probability_technical_bullish/), the technicals line up with bullish news and subsequent price reversal which substantially over performed a bull rally in the markets for November and December.  I will use the same technical indicators that predicted the SQ rally to make the case for MRNA on a monthly chart. I will also look at traditional regular candles and Heikin Ashi candles (which can better help us understand trends and avoid the noise).

In this case, the month of November, we saw a bullish MOM divergence which can be defined as a situation where the momentum indicator (MOM) shows a higher low while the price of an asset shows a lower low. This indicates that the downward trend is losing strength and that the price may reverse to the upside soon.  Looking at the monthly chart on MRNA sellers began losing significant momentum in November when viewing traditional candles.  This was confirmed by the Heikin Ashi candles in November which once again measure the overall strength of a trend.   Furthermore, we saw a substantial increase in the Chaikin Money Flow which in layman's terms measures inflows and outflows of capital in an equity.  In conjunction with bullish divergence, the corresponding technicals make a strong case that the bottom on MRNA is in.

Of course, some of you don't believe in technicals (even though they're simply a visual medium of supply and demand...), so we'll discuss how we are in the buy the rumor stage of Moderna. Recently Merck and Moderna announced progress and strong efficacy in Stage 2 trials for their skin cancer MRNA vaccine treatment.  Merck offered somewhat conservative guidelines, but Modenra expects the vaccine to be ready for approval in 2025.  As we saw in some of the recent patent approval for drugs, achieving the patent is not always bullish for a stock (I'm looking at you Bluebird). However, in this case the perception that a 49% reduction in Melanoma is not too far down the pipeline, this correlates with the price action we are seeing in the technicals.

Keep in mind, MRNA stock is mainly owned by large institutions, only a small amount of it is actually owned by retail...you can draw what conclusions on that from you want, but in my mind (and from reading some of the stupid things people say here) that is unquestionably bullish.  Declining COVID vaccination rates have hit other COVID beneficiaries like Pfizer hard, however also take into account Moderna's vaccine showed the greatest efficacy out of all of them, which is an empirically a good sign that the technology is viable and superior to competitors.

With all of that being said, I have and am building a position in MRNA.  The reasons are listed above and your chance to get a 2nd shot at a bio-tech that could potentially quadruple its multiple by 2025.  Don't listen to me, listen to where the money is going....

\*Chaikin Money Flow will be the green arrow at the bottom of the images. Traditional RSI is also shown.  I have provided weekly charts to show a different look and to indicate performance of the indicators mentioned.

"2024 is approaching and we're kicking things off with a bang! SPY and QQQ on fire, QQQ 420 not a meme anymore, maybe even your favorite shit stock meme's showing you some green. 

VIX (the fear index, for all you newbies) is currently plummeting to historic lows. January 2024 is setting up to be like a never-ending party, complete with confetti, champagne, and of course some lucky WSB winners with a suspicious amount of gain porn lately. 

So, a rally kicking off in the last quarter, ATHs, low VIX, green every day and WSB trying to short a steam roller - when did I see that before? Yeah, that sounds exactly like in 2017/2018. It went like this: Oct17: market up. Nov17: market up. Dec17: market up. Jan18 market only vertical up. Feb18: everything blew up:

[January 2018 meltup](https://preview.redd.it/plc3sjxm547c1.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17fb9cfc43f0e394d0c514be2df7667a691e328e)

2018 also gave us the volacalypse, with several short VIX funds being collateral damage (they went puff in one day, see r/tradeXIV). Something to watch out for if you go allin long with leverage, after all you don't want to be that idiot being up 10000% on your calls only for the market to do another one of these volacalypses and take it away in one day:

[VIX 2017 \/ 2018](https://preview.redd.it/3d2iun52647c1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06f059e98818f8e5f3658e4079213b604b444a71)

Maybe this might repeat, maybe it might not. But with non stop green and VIX this low, its like a double whammy for index calls. They are cheap because there is no volatility and markets just melt up in one direction, because again there's no volatility! Contrary to popular believe on WSB, calm waters are the best times to go long. Managing calls in calm waters is also just so much easier than trying to time crashes with puts. January 2024 could be that magic money printing machine. If you play you cards right you don't need to trade the rest of year and you'd just sail into the sunset with your new found wealth.

But you do you, WSB. Time to make some insane gains and lose them shortly after instead!",FOMO index meltup into January 2024 with parallels to 2017/2018.,18ljhxh,1702933400.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ljhxh/fomo_index_meltup_into_january_2024_with/,

"***I do not work for Procore but have been in the construction tech space for 8 years. If I wasn't so regarded I would be work for this company***

***I am balls deep in this stock***

***I have 150 shares with a cost basis of 58.70***

Okay Regards, Time to check out a diamond in the rough – Procore Technologies (PCOR). This company is like the construction worker of the stock market – underappreciated, but damn, it's doing some heavy lifting for your portfolio. Here's why you should throw PCOR on your radar:

***Revamping Construction with Tech Magic:***

Procore isn't just about hard hats and blueprints; it's revolutionizing construction with some serious tech mojo. Think cloud-based project management that makes everything smoother than a fresh batch of concrete. Construction is getting a facelift, and Procore is the one wielding the magic wand.

***Revenue Boom:***

PCOR's got that sweet, sweet revenue growth. It's like printing tendies, and who doesn't love that? The construction peeps are catching on, and as more projects jump on the Procore train, we're talking about money flowing like water at a frat party.

***Hobnobbing with the Big Shots:***

Procore isn't slumming it; it's rubbing elbows with the big boys in construction. If you want a stock that parties with the industry giants, PCOR is the VIP ticket you've been waiting for. Plus, it could mean long-term connections and a steady stream of cash.

***World Domination:***

Procore is spreading its wings internationally. We're not just talking about U.S. projects; we're talking global domination. As construction goes bananas worldwide, Procore is there, ready to rake in the gains.

***Tech Geek's Dream:***

In a world going nuts for tech, Procore is the geek's dream come true. It's bringing efficiency to an industry that's been stuck in the past. If you're into disruptive tech making waves, PCOR should be on your hit list.

***Short Squeeze Shenanigans:***

WSB loves a good short squeeze, right? Well, PCOR might just be the dark horse waiting to shake things up. It's not on everyone's radar yet, and that could mean some serious fireworks if the short-sellers start feeling the heat.

***Summary***

Procore Technologies (PCOR) is the construction worker turned rockstar of the stock market. With crazy revenue growth, A-list clientele, global expansion plans, and the potential for a short squeeze, PCOR might just be the rocket you've been looking for. But hey, don't forget to do your own DD – we're all in this together, but risks are part of the game.

Looking at this date shows a bearish sentiment going into the end of the first quarter. With 4 of the stocks actually having a 1.00 or higher put/call ratio indicating bears in control of options volume for those dates.

**Summary**

Important thing to keep in mind is that the market tends to react a bit earlier (1-2 weeks) to options activity then the actual exp date. Based off the options activity for the next 3-4 months the market is pricing in a top early to mid January with a selloff going into the end of the first quarter. This would also correlate nicely with IRA and 401K contributions on Jan 1st adding even more fuel to go up in the short term before Jan 19.

"This is from one novice trader to another and my own personal conclusions.

1.) Unless you’re super confident on stock movements; don’t YOLO most or all of your portfolio into a single option.

2.) If options don’t get bought at the opening bell, leave it be unless, again, you’re super-confident on the stock’s movement and are willing to pay a higher cost.

3.) Be sure to read up on the company and any recent activities it worked through.  Movements can simply be movements with no firm basis to justify them and don’t reflect potential forecasted projections.

4.) Don’t get hung up on the FOMO/missed options chances. There will be other opportunities, and being hung up on what was missed is bad for your mental health.

Conclusions: It seems that Match Group is about 25% undervalued at current levels. Revenue grew \~9% in the most recent quarter due mostly to growth in average spend per user, offset by a decline in payers by 5%. Recent strategic objectives have been to reinvigorate growth in revenues to double digit levels and optimize product development and S&amp;A expense so as to increase profitability and returns on capital. Optimizations of pricing on Tinder (introductions of weekly subscriptions for instance) have worked as RPP (revenue per payer) increased by double digits year over year in the latest quarter. Hinge, a relatively higher RPP business, saw encouraging download trends and pricing actions in a move to optimize user spend and double down on core markets. The market seems to be most concerned about the fall in paying users in the most recent quarter which has pushed down the company's valuation since the summer. If we assume that payers will grow to 30 million from 15.7 million in the latest quarterly report, due to growth at Hinge and new offerings such as Archer and Hyperconnect Azar and stability at Tinder, and that RPP per month will grow to $25 over time as more premium monetization efforts pay off, it's not out of the question for revenues to hit 9.1 billion in year 10. Overall, the company seems to be undervalued currently although sluggish payer trends have hit sentiment and it remains to be seen if declining payers can be sufficiently offset by rising RPP. To be valuable, Match Group will have to find ways to appeal to people currently disillusioned by the online dating scene. Digital exhaustion due to COVID shutdowns may also be exacerbating market weaknesses in online dating as people search out in-person experiences in lieu of online ones. Another interesting point is the cynical perspective that dating apps take advantage of lonely people to make more money: showing people less than stellar matches in order to spur them to spend in order to gain access to higher tier profiles. If Match Group is to succeed, it will have to pivot its brand image away from being superficial and pay to win and towards a platform that provides people a convenient way to connect authentically with others. It must succeed with its users, not in spite of them. Another interesting development may be with the metaverse: The fusing together of AR, VR, and AI algorithms may be able to rekindle interest in online experiences as they become more realistic, engaging, and interactive than ever before.

"This is my analysis and opinion on Grindr (NYSE:GRND). I have casually followed this stock for several months, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started researching the company intensely and made it the largest position in my portfolio. Because I have not seen this stock discussed much, I wanted both to share my opinions and invite feedback. I believe Grindr is a deeply undervalued business with substantial growth potential and in this post, I try to lay out my thoughts as to why. Please keep in mind that although I tried my best to carefully research the company, I do not guarantee this DD is 100% free of errors, and I encourage you to do your own research and point out flaws in mine. I have included a number of links at the end as a starting point and embedded several within.

# Brief Overview and History

Grindr was founded in 2009 as a dating and networking app to connect users based on GPS location. Initially targeting gay men, over time the app evolved to become the world's largest LGBTQ+ social network and Grindr currently stands as the premier brand associated with the LGBTQ community. The app was American-owned from its founding until 2016, when it was [majority acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/11/chinese-gaming-firm-buys-60-of-gay-dating-app-grindr-for-93m/) by Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun for $155 million in 2016. At the time, the app had around two million active users and generated \~30 million in revenue yearly. The app remained Chinese-owned until 2020, when the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment forced Beijing Kunlun to divest its ownership back to a U.S.-based company, citing national security reasons. The company was sold to San Vicente Acquisition for $609 million and remained private until November 2022, when the stock went public at a $2.1 billion valuation. Initially the share price surged, closing at $36.50 the first day of trading, before falling down to the $5-$7 range where the stock remained for much of 2023. Currently, G. Raymond Zage, is the largest single investor in Grindr, owning approximately 45% of all shares and on December 08, Zage increased his position by an additional $500,000 shares, which I take as a sign of his confidence in the company. Board chair James Fu Bin Lu, founder of Chegg, owns the second largest position in the stock, approximately 22% of the total shares. Grindr has not yet received any investment or coverage from Wall Street firms or analysts, and during earnings calls it has primarily fielded questions from retail investors.

# New Leadership

In October 2022, shortly before Grindr went public, [George Arison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arison), took over the role of CEO from Jeff Bonforte, who had been leading the company since June of 2020. George Arison is a serial entrepreneur, and an openly gay man, and prior to his position as Grindr CEO he led a number of companies and was a consultant at BCG.

In my opinion, in his one year tenure, Arison has proved an extremely capable businessman and a good leader of the company. From the beginning, in his communications to shareholders, he has clearly articulated a growth algorithm for Grindr and executed on it extremely well. Under Arison's stewardship Grindr has seen a 40% YoY growth in revenue and earnings as of Q3 2023. Within the 2022 Annual report, shareholder letters, and previous four quarterly earnings calls, Arison has consistently emphasized that Grindr is (still) in the very early innings stages of growth and monetization journey and laid out a roadmap for the growth story ahead. I will elaborate more on this in the next section, but needless to say, results so far have been excellent. Arison has demonstrated a committment to running a lean business as well, although for growth stock like Grindr I do not believe expenses are as important a factor as the top line. Notably, Grindr made headlines this September when Arison mandated a return to office for its employees and subsequently lost a substantial portion of its workforce. ([Reddit predictably excoriated Grindr's decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/16dreg6/dating_app_grindr_loses_nearly_half_its_staff/) but he laid out his reasons and work philosophy in [this blog from October 3](https://www.grindr.com/blog/our-philosophy-on-work-and-building-an-exceptional-community-going-forward)). Despite the controversy, I agree with Arison and believe the hybrid model of two days a week in office, three days at home will be beneficial to Grindr, its corporate culture, and ultimately shareholders.

One additional aspect about George Arison I wanted to highlight because I believe it's highly relevant is that he is a married gay man with two kids and an active member of the community that Grindr serves. To dive deeper into his background, you may read a bio of him and his partner in this [2019 NYTimes profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/fashion/weddings/george-arison-and-robert-luo-wanted-love-and-to-live-american-dream.html). I think a strong case can be made that as a member of the LGBT community, George Arison has a deeper understanding of the LGBTQ+ community, its needs, and Grindr's customer base. If you listen to his interviews and read his [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearison/recent-activity/all/), he comes across as very genuine about serving the community. He is certainly more in tune than the previous two CEOs of Grindr, Jeff Bonforte and Scott Chen from when it was owned by San Vicente and Kunlun. (In fact, Chen was so out of touch with the userbase he publicly stated in 2018 that ['Marriage is between one man and one women'](https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/11/30/grindr-scott-chen-marriage/)) All of this to say that, until recently, Grindr has likely been mismanaged because its leadership did not understand its LGBTQ+ userbase. Under its new CEO and Board of Directors [which is 60% LGBTQ+](https://fhoudart.medium.com/the-queerest-board-in-history-that-we-know-of-b817c44d6d71), the first in history, I believe Grindr will be able to make changes to build stronger relationships with the LGBTQ+ community, which will lead to increased brand loyalty and customer retention, and be beneficial to the business and shareholders long-term.

# Growth Story

Moving onto the growth story. Upon joining, Arison stated his intention to transform the business and guide it through a new era of growth. Before I dive into how exactly he plans to do that, I think now is probably the best time to take note of the secular social tailwinds that back Grindr this decade.

As of 2022, there were more than 500 million people worldwide who identify as LGBTQ+. Within the U.S., 7.1% of the adult population, or around 18.4 million adults identify as being LGBTQ+.

The generational gap in LGBT Identification is stark:

* 2.7% of Boomers (1946-1964)
* 3.3% of Gen X (1965-1980)
* 11.2% of Millenials (1980-1996)
* 19.7% of GenZ (1997-2004)

From Gen X to Gen Z, there is a 6x increase in the fraction of the population identifying. Although the data for Gen Alpha is not in yet, the trend is clear and I would expect no less than 20% of that cohort will also identify when they come of age, as LGBTQ acceptance continues to normalize.

The global population of LGBT individuals that Grindr targets is a formidable demographic. They are a group with a population of 540 million, a combined purchasing power of $10.9 trillion, and an annual growth rate of 6.7%. If the global LGBT population were a country, they would be a substantial economic powerhouse and a dominant player on the world stage. They would rank [third in population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), constitute the world's [third largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)), and would be the [fastest growing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate) in the world.

Furthermore, Grindr's userbase is highly lucrative and coveted by advertisers. LGBT individuals tend to be wealthier, more educated, travel more, and spend more money than their heterosexual counterparts. They are also more brand-conscious in general.

Taken together, it is very clear that there is massive value to unlock in this space, and Grindr is well poised to benefit from the rapid expansion of its core market in the coming decade.

I will now explain George Arison's vision for precisely how Grindr will do that.

# Phase 1 - Monetize Core Business

The first phase of Grindr's transformation, still in progress, has been to introduce new features and modernize the platform, with a focus on converting free users into paying ones. Throughout most of Grindr's existence, it operated primarily via an ad-supported revenue model, with only a small fraction of users paying for the app. Under the new ""freemium"" business model, the shift has been to grow revenue by enhancing the app's user experience and developing additional paid offerings that users subscribe to. Three such offerings that launched in 2023 have been have been Grindr Web, Super Boost, and Weeklies. So far, this strategy has been wildly successful and in the last year, management has had to raise revenue forecasts several times. Revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be around $255 million, an increase of 31% compared to FY 2022. Despite the growth thus far, paying user penetration remains at \~7%, around 1/3 that of Tinder's, meaning there is still ample room for 8-10 quarters of continued mid-double digit (\~30-50%) annual revenue growth if management can simply continue to execute on the growth plan. This initial phase of Grindr's growth should be complete by the end of fiscal year 2025, so for investors with a horizon of less than two years, Grindr is a strong shorter-term investment as it executes on its monetization strategy.

# Phase 2 - Make Grindr a Global Brand

Although Grindr is available to download in most countries worldwide, presently, it derives 86.9% of its revenue from North America. The company has substantial opportunities for growth by marketing and targeting its products and services for international users. Alongside Phase 1 of the growth plan to monetize Grindr's core business in the domestic market, the company plans to in the medium term increase its user base and revenues by tapping into international markets too.

The same playbook they are executing in the the U.S. can be applied elsewhere and will enable them to increase revenue, first in the European and South American markets and ultimately in underserved communities, [including the more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia where being gay is illegal](https://www.grindr.com/blog/grindr-applauds-sen-ben-cardins-push-to-improve-human-rights-in-egypt). The company has made it a priority to bolster the positive social trends that are favorable to the LGBTQ+ community in these markets through social activism, while strengthening the product they offer these markets through localization and targeted marketing to accelerate organic growth.

# Phase 3 - Expand into New Businesses

As was previously mentioned, Grindr is a platform that represents the #1 LGBT brand in the world. There is no close second. Grindr's platform provides a valuable source of data on the preferences and behaviors of the global LGBTQ+ community, which can be used to develop innovative products and services that address their evolving needs. The unique connection that Grindr has with the broader LGBT community also allows it to develop targeted distribution partnerships, products, and services that cater specifically to the demographic and generate new revenue streams. Especially in light of the pullback of major corporations marketing to LGBT due to conservative backlash, *this presents a major opportunity for an LGBT-friendly brand to step in and carve out its own niche.* Despite the fallout this year, the LGBTQ demographic remains highly sought after by advertisers, and Grindr is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. On a similar note, the company also expects to be able to enhance the health and profitability of its ad operations over time, making ads more relevant to users and more valuable for advertisers. One of Grindr's multiyear initiatives is to build partnerships and relationships with advertisers and agencies in order to replace its generic, third-party ads ads that have a low click-through rate with directly targeted ads.

Grindr currently operates as a hookup, dating, and social networking app, but George Arison envisions its ultimate destination as becoming the trusted lifestyle brand for the LGBTQ+ community. Already, Grindr has 85% brand awareness in the community, and early trends have already revealed many of its users rely on the location-based features of the app, for example, for safe navigation when traveling as gay individuals and seeking suggestions on where to go and what to do in new cities. There is a signifcant unmet market need for services built specifically for the global LGBTQ community, and once again, Grindr remains uniquely positioned to tap into this market. Although in the past, raising funding has been one of Grindr's challenges and it may continue to be in the future ([although the recent $350 Million Credit Facility announcement is a step in the right direction](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx)), the company has ample opportunity for capital-light partnerships with service providers in travel, media, health care, and finance tailored to the needs of the LGBTQ+ community across the globe. These types of initiatives will allow Grindr to tap into a broader customer base, thereby increasing its total addressable market size.

My belief is that Grindr, under new leadership, is transforming the company into a business with a large future growth story. The company is in a strong position to execute on many of its near term initiatives in the next 1-2 years as well as its multi-year strategy for the decade ahead.

# Comparison to Peers

I cannot emphasize enough how differentiated Grindr is, across several dimensions, from other dating apps. In terms of engagement, Grindr is unparalleled. More than 300 million messages are sent each day on the platform and the average user spends 61 minutes per day on the app.

If that second figure doesn't impress you, here are some other avg daily usage numbers for comparison:

* Tinder: 18 minutes
* Bumble: 14 minutes
* Instagram: 29 minutes
* Snapchat: 28 minutes
* YouTube: 40 minuets
* Tiktok: 56 minutes

As you can see, Grindr's numbers blow every other dating app out of the water. The only social media app that comes even remotely close is Tiktok, which has been called the “crack cocaine of social media”. If Tiktok is crack, then Grindr is heroin. Grindr's remarkable user engagement is the leading reason why I am mighty bullish on management's ability to monetize its userbase. Again, their largest priority this year and for the next 1-2 years (Phase 1 of the Growth Plan) is to build more features that generate value for their users (and for shareholders).

There are several additional advantages that Grindr has over other dating apps, because of its userbase of primarily gay men.

For starters, the intentions of many Grindr users differ from other dating apps. Although it also functions as a dating and social networking app, Grindr is first and foremost a hookup app. Other dating apps like Bumble and Tinder have the fatal flaw in their business model wherein if you are successful at finding a relationship, you stop using the app. In order words, the more successful the product is, the more users leave, and this means that the interests of users will always be at odds with the interests of these companies. By contrast, the better a product Grindr can build, the ""happier"" its users will be. Everyone wins when Grindr creates value.

Additionally, gay men tend to get married later in life. The median age of first marriage for same sex couples is 35 compared to 28 for opposite sex couples. This benefits Grindr in two ways: 1) It means Grindr's customer base has a substantially (\~70%) longer active period than other dating apps and 2) Its users will likely be more willing/capable to pay for services compared to dating apps like Tinder whose userbase tends to consist of broke college students (I'm overgeneralizing about Tinder slightly, but not by much).

Presently, around 7% of Grindr users pay for the app, which is less than half the rate of Tinder (\~18%). I believe that throughout 2024, Grindr's will approach Tinder's user penetration, then in subsequent years surpass it and continue rising. (Keep in mind, the large majority of Grindr's userbase is men, who are 22 times more likely to become paid users of a dating app than women are.) It's hard to predict where the terminal rate will end up, but I think a scenario where it settles at 40-50% or possibly even higher is very plausible. If those numbers seem lofty, note that 71% percent of Amazon users pay for Prime ($14.99 per month) and 40% of Spotify's users pay for Premium ($10.99 per month). With these comparisons, I'm not trying to suggest in any way that Grindr is a peer or competitor to Spotify/Amazon, just illustrating the fact that users are willing to pay for subscriptions when they are offered a valuable service in return. In fact, I believe Grindr's annual revenue per user has the potential to be larger than a service like Spotify's because music streaming services are largely undifferentiated and there is no competitive moat.

Currently, Grindr's lowest pricing tier costs $19.99/month and its highest is $39.99/month. These are ballpark numbers, but given its growth rate in both total users and paying user fraction, it's very plausible that Grindr could have 10 million paying customers just for its core app by 2030, each paying anywhere from $200-$400 a year. This is why I believe management when they say they are in the very very early stages of Grindr's monetization journey. The numbers I laid out are of course all dependent on how competent Grindr leadership is, but I believe they can execute. If the monetization strategy is successful, with Grindr's margins it will be a $30B stock by that time. !RemindMe 6 years.

The last point to bring up about Grindr in relation to its peers is that it has the potential to laterally expand its business in a way that other dating apps cannot. Nobody will ever use Tinder to get in touch with a family planner who specializes in the complex legal and financial challenges that same-sex couples face when adopting. Or finding a surrogate. Nobody's getting on Bumble to find a caregiver who's compassionate towards the unique health needs of members of the LGBTQ community. Nobody is ever going to use Hinge as a trusted LGBTQ-friendly travel hub. This ties back to Phase III of George Arison's growth strategy. As Grindr continues to grow, it can continue to expand beyond its core offering explore new features, products, and services that cater to different needs and preferences of its community. Because Grindr has significant ties to its community and because its userbase is so engaged, this provides an opportunity for the company to expand beyond just a dating app and provide adjacent products and services to the community that it serves.

George Arison has said he envisions Grindr as the ['gay super-app'](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/grindr-went-public-7-months-ago-heres-whats-happened-since.html). If he can pull that off, the sky's the limit.

All in all, Grindr truly is in a category of its own, for many reasons, most of which are not even close to being priced in. I believe $GRND's outperformance compared to other publicly traded peers like Tinder ($MTCH) and Bumble ($BMBL) is the market slowly coming to appreciate this fact.

# Financials and Valuation

As I just alluded to, I think Grindr (1.4B m cap) is ridiculously cheap compared to its peers: Bumble (2.9B m cap) and Tinder (9.5B m cap).

How does it look in isolation though?

Grindr's Q3 earnings were arguably their best yet, showing a 40% CAGR revenue growth rate and a 50% adjusted EBITDA CAGR since since 2016. They raised revenue guidance several times this year, and revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be $255M.

Income-wise, the stock had a net loss of 437k in Q3 so it basically broke even. However, in this quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by a large one-off severance payment as a result of Grindr's return to office layoffs and a large interest expense that will be lower in the future. Q2 Net Income was $22.3 Million and Q1 Net Income was ($32.9 Million).

Grindr presently has 347M in debt and 30M in cash on its balance sheet.

I believe one of the largest obstacles holding Grindr back before, and the reason it was trading at a discount, was its debt at a high interest rate. In Q4 of 2022, just the interest expense alone constituted was 37.7% ! of revenue. However, its debt situtation is rapidly improving and will continue to do so as its grows its top line and interest rates normalize. Additionally, on November 29th, [Grindr announced it had refinanced its debt](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx) with a new $350M Term Loan A and Revolver facility. This has the effect of reducing net interest expense by \~$17M next year.

I expect Grindr to post breakeven or post a small profit for FY 2023. The company has attained borderline profitability during the challenging fiscal conditions of the last year, and it is in a strong financial position moving foward.

Looking ahead, we already know Grindr has the potential to become extremely profitable in the future, and recent debt refinancing will help to accelerate the timeline. Already, when taking into account the company's reduction in headcount, the decrease in net interest expense with the new terms on the debt, and revenue growth, GRND is trading at a forward P/E of 14 which I believe is extremely cheap for a software company with a 40% revenue growth rate.

Its current revenue multiple of 6x is another indication the stock is undervalued. For comparison, Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Snowflake ($SNOW), two other tech stocks I follow, also have a 40% revenue growth rate year-over-year and they trade at a 21x revenue multiple. If a similar valuation metric were to be applied to GRND, the market cap would be 5 Billion or $30/share. GRND currently trades at $8.15, with the share price trending up 36% in the last month since earnings, so there's substantial for share price to appreciate in this year and into 2024.

Again, I believe there is a strong case that with just the current numbers alone, and not factoring in future growth, the stock is fairly valued at $30/share or 5B market cap which is my price target for 2024. Long term, with Arison at the helm, I believe GRND could be be one of the great stocks of the decade for the reasons I have outlined in previous sections above.

# Bear Case

No Grindr DD would be complete without the gay bear case. As a young, unproven, and undiversified business Grindr is inherently riskier to invest in than, say, a blue chip like Apple or Microsoft.

One risk is that although Grindr enjoys powerful network effects as the #1 LGBT platform, there are other apps in the space like Archer, Scruff, and Sniffies. It's possible a rival could emerge and outcompete Grindr, but over the last year Grindr's new managment have proven themselves to be highly capable, and they'd have to fumble pretty hard to let go of their economic moat. [George Arison has also made it clear that Grindr will be first to market with incorporating generative AI into the platform.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-14/grindr-lgbtq-dating-app-to-add-ai-wingman-chatbot) It's something to keep an eye out for, but at this time I am not too concerned that a competitor arises to usurp Grindr's position as the lead dating/hookup app for the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the industry is not a winner-take-all market, so several different platforms can coexist at the same time.

It could be argued, and it has been argued, that the online dating app market has been saturated. I don't believe this to be true, either. As I detailed above, there is substantial opporunity to grow total user count and revenue per user. Grindr is still in the very early phases of its monetization journey.

Grindr has a somewhat high debt relative to to its cash position. However, the company is liquid, not in any chance of bankruptcy, and moving forwarded its debt payments will be substantially lowered due to the debt refinancing.

# Conclusion

I have been diligently researching GRND for several weeks. Please also do your own DD as well. This post wound up being longer than what I had originally set out to write, but the more I researched and learned about this stock the more I felt compelled to include. If you made it here to the end, thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts. I've omitted a tl;dr because I don't want anyone who isn't serious enough to spend 15 minutes reading all of what I've written engaging in the comments anyway.

Let’s start at the beginning…They entered the market regretfully as a SPAC and skyrocketed to 100+. As with all the SPAC’s came down to earth and got molly whopped by a short report.  The usual “shits fake” From here the stock died and most have never gave it a second look. 

The way it played out makes it  ripe for a 10x+ bagger. The lack of attention is your gain. Here is what has happened since the drop.

TECH
The coveted SSB. 
- SSB Ceramic separator with only anode no cathode. Half of the Lithum needed.
- Million mile battery. QS puts their batteries though extremely crazy testing. They have achieved 800 cycles of fast charge and been at 80%+ of capacity retained. When tested by car company less rigorous standards they have retained 95% of capacity over 800 cycles.
-10-80% charge in 15 mins. Actively working on lowering this.
- Almost double the density of standard EV battery. That means you get 600 miles out the same size battery that gets 300 miles now
- Best of both worlds, has power and energy. All cells now are one of the other. Power is your fast charge but you lose distance. Energy is slow charge but more distance. There is no battery on the market right now that can do both of these.
- No exploding and minimal lose from cold weather. 

COMPANY AND MILESTONES
This is very subjective but I will try to highlight what I see makes this a moon gem. Most SSB companies are still in abstract or have yet to send prototypes

- Mass scale production prototype is achieved.
- No over promising and transparent. They have stuck to their timelines and have been open and honest about delays and why they happened. 
- Just hired western diagonals Siva Sivaram as President. Would he come on board with bad tech or a failing game plan?
- 6 of top 10 OEM’s on board and actively testing batteries. 
- A samples(singles cells) sent to OEMs a year ago. 
- Advancements in production. Have developed the tech to scale up manufacturing. Launching as I type
- B-Cells (Full EV batteries) are coming in the first quarter
- Already have a committed launch partner with low volume exclusive. Haven’t announced expected next year.

"Japan's Nippon Steel has made a significant announcement on Monday, revealing its intention to acquire U.S. Steel in a monumental deal with a total estimated value of $14.9 billion, encompassing debt. This move comes several months after U.S. Steel put itself on the market for potential buyers.

The proposed per-share offer stands at $55, representing a remarkable premium of approximately 40% compared to U.S. Steel's closing stock price on the preceding Friday and an astonishing 142% compared to the stock's closing price just before the company's announcement of its strategic review process on August 11th. As a result of this news, U.S. Steel's shares have already surged by about 27% in premarket trading.

Nippon Steel, ranked as the world's fourth-largest steel manufacturer, views the United States as a growth market capable of offsetting the declining demand in Japan, as reported by the Nikkei daily, which initially broke the story.

Nippon Steel has successfully secured the necessary financing commitments for the acquisition and anticipates that this strategic move will enable the company to advance towards achieving a global crude steel capacity of 100 million tonnes.

Crucially, Nippon has affirmed its commitment to honoring all of U.S. Steel's agreements with its employees, including existing collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions.

The journey towards this acquisition began in August when U.S. Steel initiated a formal review process, having previously rejected a $7.3 billion offer from rival Cleveland-Cliffs. Interestingly, throughout this period, Cliffs remained involved in the sale process, while industry giant ArcelorMittal was also considering making an offer, as reported by Reuters in August.

Based in Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel's stock had been struggling due to several consecutive quarters of declining revenue and profit. This made it an attractive prospect for competitors seeking to bolster their portfolio with a steel manufacturer catering to both the automotive and renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the prospect of benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides tax credits and other incentives for projects in the renewable energy industry, further piqued the interest of potential suitors.

It's worth noting that companies like U.S. Steel are poised for a strong start to 2024, thanks to soaring steel prices following the resolution of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union strike against the Detroit Three automakers.

"Steel Partners (SPLP) is probably a name most around here are are not familiar with. It's a diversified holding company operating in segments such as diversified materials, enegry and financial services. The majority of shares is held by insiders and it's thinly traded.

What's interesting about the company is an announcement they made on 12/14 which effectivley amounts forcing small shareholders to sell. Specifically, they announced a 1 for 12,500 reverse spilt, followed immediately by a 12,500 for 1 forward split. This is scheduled to take place on 1/8/2024.

According to their press release of the announcement *""No fractional units will be issued in connection with the Reverse/Forward Unit Split. Instead, the Company will pay cash (without interest) to any unitholder who would be entitled to receive a fractional unit as a result of the Reverse/Forward Unit Split. Unitholders who hold fewer than 12,500 units immediately prior to the Reverse Unit Split will be paid in cash (without interest) an amount equal to such number of Company Common Units held multiplied by volume-weighted average price for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse/Forward Unit Split.""*

In other words, if you own fewer than 12,500, you will be forced out of the stock, the publicly available float will decrease in aggregate by the total amount of shares held by shareholders owning under 12,500 shares, and well, good luck getting back in following the forward split as the pice will in all likelihood be higher due to the reduced share count and lack of available shares to buy.

Since the shares are very thinly traded, there's a possiblity of this stock moving higher leading up to the split. Shareholders just under the 12,500 mark will want to increase their holdings above the threshold to avoid being taken out. And since shareholders who have no intention of rising above the level will be taken out anyway, they'll likely just wait for the split to be paid out rather than selling before it. 

Aside from the interesting techinical setup, this is an extremely hostile corporate action directed at small shareholders. If the company wants to take them out, they should offer a fair price.

Conclusions: Carvana is overvalued as the market has swung from being too pessimistic due to bankruptcy concerns to too optimistic on its potential as a disruptor. While overhead expense may be reduced by not having retail locations and as many salespeople on payroll, Carvana's story hinges on its ability to take share from legacy players like Carmax and Autonation while also generating a much higher than average operating margin, which seems unlikely. The automotive retail space is mostly predicated on providing attractive prices, integrated financing options, and selection, factors that are not so easily defended from competitive intrusions. Growth in the near term also seems to be on the backburner as the focus has turned to unit economics as the macroeconomic backdrop became a headwind.

Carmax seems to be the most undervalued company of the group as investors have become more pessimistic on the company's future as recent troubles have clouded the near-term trajectory. However, it's clear that the company will be here to stay as its geographic footprint of stores and recognized brand give it an enviable advantage.

Autonation is holding up well in the midst of Carmax's struggles due to its ability to heavier reliance on new vehicle sales, as well as repair and bodyshop services, to drive growth vs. Carmax's specialty in used vehicles. New vehicles are clearly selling more efficiently than used vehicles, as demonstrated by Autonation's slight positive revenues growth this year.

Vroom is the most uncertain case out of the four I've listed here. It's the smallest of the group, selling only 39278 vehicles in 2022 vs. 1.4 million for Carmax, 229,971 for Autonation, and 412,296 for Carvana. Revenues tumbled a stunning 44.7% in 2022 due to a huge drop in units sold of over 35000 vehicles. Unit volume has not been better this year, as TTM revenues are 66% lower than the same period a year ago. However, if the company is able to complete its plan to improve unit economics (similar to Carvana) and return to growth, the stock may be attractive. Another interesting thing about vroom is that its cash and equivalents of around 200 million exceeds the market cap, but it also has debts of 300 million.

Recommendations: Hold Vroom, buy Carmax and Autonation, sell Carvana.

"[https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/)

Ok, I already know, so let's start with the fact that Hussman is often labeled a perma-bear and has been calling bubbles for years. Let's address the substance of the research. 

It is clear that valuations are relatively **high**, and earnings growth has been remarkable, supported by expanding **margins** the last twenty years or so. This is good business and evidence of the excellency of American corporations, and technology. It is ALSO the product of declining interest rates which fostered declining costs of capital, and stagnant wage growth which kept the cost of labor low. While it possible these remain low, it is unlikely and difficult to imagine them continuing lower. Growth will have to come from real revenue growth, margin expansion (somehow), or even higher valuations. 

To be clear, **the most common next step for an expensive market is to become even more expensive.** I am *not* arguing to go short. But it is hard to argue that the path forward looks great from here. Unless we're going to manufacture significant real GDP growth somehow for the first time in decades, record margins either have to grow yet higher, let alone remain at current heights, *while* valuations must do the same.

[This is price to revenue of the S&amp;P, which is at levels unseen before 2021, supported by record margins and high multiples.](https://preview.redd.it/l8izfkmuew6c1.png?width=1207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ecc3ada8ad248cfdbc5d01cac34ff56c16514c6)

[Above depicts the relationship between the expected 10 year annual performance of a 60\/40 portfolio based on valuations \(blue\), and the actual annual return experienced \(red\) going back to 1928. ](https://preview.redd.it/surv5c22fw6c1.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cb7e1b0e2fd972d21b77a52683c4ffe4121d70a)

So, this last one above is concerning to say the least. It hasn't really missed. Any gaps were temporary as the fundamentals driving the projections in blue eventually drove the actual returns of the market. At current levels, the recent performance of stocks has created a large gap. To fill, equities would have to suffer a significant loss sometime soon. To be constructive on equities, this indicator which has been accurate for **90 years** would need to rendered completely useless now. This time *would* have to be very different. 

[95 years of estimated declines to restore equity risk premiums \(blue\) vs actual market losses \(red\).](https://preview.redd.it/pnm8g9h3gw6c1.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9e1f9d004be8477c22aeef7323ddf5e7256db0c)

This last one shows the history of expected losses necessary to restore equity risk premiums and the actual losses eventually experienced. Again, there are temporary gaps, but it hasn't really missed. 

I am not here to predict any short-term action. In fact, I think the market continuing higher over the next 6-12 months is just as likely as any decline. 

But let's discuss the realities of the environment: This is certainly no cheap market. It can be argued (very well and supported by no shortage historical data) that it would be wise to wait for a good entry point. It is also likely that it would be quite the ***""golden swan""*** if the market *did not* suffer a serious draw down eventually. In fact, it would be the **first time** these indicators have missed.

The obvious difficulty in this approach is underperforming for months or years as the momentum continues, or at the risk of the aforementioned golden swan. This is very difficult to do in practice. Working in one's favor however, is the opportunity to lock in 5-8% returns in fixed income for several years, depending where you want to go on the quality scale. Let's discuss this approach.

As weird as it sounds, treasury bills have **repeatedly** outperform the S&amp;P over wide time horizons, particularly when valuations are elevated.

[S&amp;P \(blue\) charted with the index levels given a certain risk premium over treasuries. The chart also shows periods that treasuries outperformed the S&amp;P.](https://preview.redd.it/g47tk355hw6c1.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076729c0059aae2513b13a5dc33501a60fd942c6)

Treasuries outperforming the S&amp;P over any extended period sounds bonkers but its true. This is what happens when there are stretched valuations and large draw downs. Over the following periods, treasury bills outperformed the S&amp;P:  
Aug 1929 to July 1950  
Dec 1968 to Dec 1987  
Mar 1998 to Mar 2020  
Apr 2007 to Mar 2020

Again, it sounds crazy, and it obviously requires timing. Being in treasuries and missing the entry into stocks would result in *significant underperformance.* That being said, the seemingly more reliable entries into T-bills have been during times of elevated valuations such as today.

Given the historical reliability of these indicators, would it not be wise to consider reducing equity exposure and waiting a better entry?  It would certainly be uncomfortable, and may take time, but it appears rather likely this approach would pay off eventually.

"YOLO time!

I have already made over 8 figures on shorting this rubbish streaming service to death; but it ain't dead yet! ViaPlay! Some odd goofball sport TV streaming service in Europe! Never made a dime, has a f\*cktonne of debt, their competitor streaming peers are cheaper. ViaPlay is a Nordic Streaming provider who overpaid for streaming licenses and treated professional sports and replaced professional journalists explaining the sports; to nothing; and the consumer bitched;

They realize they sucked at everything they touched; and it happened to be there was a 1/3rd cheaper provider; F1 TV;  which has previous ex F1 winners, explaining the tremendous difficulties in Formula one versus the -nobodies ViaPlay had; because they explained nothing of the technicality of Formula 1. So people got extremely upset, and realized, wait a minute, we can get professional advice, for 1/3rd the price! Outstanding MOVE!

So to no surprise; this firm went down the drill; and is close to death; for logical meritocratic reasons;

Remember, when people don't want to hand over something; *it's because there is something to hide*. Not surprised, because the firm is as dead as could be be. 

And above all; on the 10th of January **they are having a vote on debt issuance (it's horrendous, investors could lose all their money!)**; legal that true (not under court of human rights); but they are trying to keep it unlawfully hidden from investors (per jurisdiction); which is and has already been overthrown by the ECB/SEC and FCA/PRA; Not surprised; because this firm can actually die on the 10th of January is this vote **isn't going through: they actually SAY SO THEMSELVES!**

Only **none of the job openings are related to saving the darn firm!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

This firm is a JOKE! I see no reason why anyone would want to **hold their debt,** which they will have to restructure (*have you looked at the ability to restructure debt nowadays given todays economic climate)*

In the **normal world**, if you as working human being lose a battle get in debt, **you're done for**.

ViaPlay made their streaming services way too expensive because they **overpaid massively** for streaming fees. 

*Well, why would there be different rules for firms in comparison to people? That doesn't seem fair.*

All I see is a big bat corporate bully who tries to get away with a meritocratic issue. Besides, we are talking about a 'streaming provider' - in other words; no one is going to miss this firm if it would go insolvent because they made a meritocratic mistake! And they have been selling shit constantly to keep liquidity flowing;

I already made a fuck tonne on this; but this firm is still alive! How on earth! I have various synthetic plays around ViaPlay. One of them is a simply volatility play option wise asset wise most correlated to ViaPlay.

There is a chance (risk wise) that ViaPlay gets so shattered in stock price (have you seen this 52wk high - low??) - ViaPlay has a deal with Canal +, which is Vivdendi;

Translate this article;

in English; 

That only means; **volatility**

Because if one thinks about it; the current price of ViaPlay for what it offers is far too high. Besides; what does ViaPlay have to offer after years of failure 'for a buy' out? This is either in my sensible educated guess a potential buy out (at the lowest cost price) - or a bankruptcy - and the likes of Vivendi taking in. 

Either way; feast my friends on a good Christmas!

**Full disclosure**; I can't 5 million % YOLO anymore as I had to wait to get the karma to post this; nevertheless; my vote of confidence goes to ViaPlay either (nearly) dead; another one m&amp;a picking it up; but ViaPlay is a service provider; that won't be a hostile one and they have nothing to offer; hence I have trades on Vivendi + the Formula One stocks + Liberty Media stocks and Skysports (UK F1 streaming) - which is part of Comcast. Which I also hold. I obviously might change my mind given 10th of January is very close around the corner - and monitoring this dead in the water firm. But im fist deep. 

Because I don't like it when average Joe get kicked out of his house when he can't pay his debt.

While corporate firms like these get a ridiculous second chance, for the basic economic mistake; overpaying on licensing rights!

"The only thing Jay Powell could have done to deliver a stronger impression of a festive giveaway to global markets this week would have been to conduct his press conference decked in an oversized red suit with fluffy white trimmings and a matching hat.
The public appearance by the chair of the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday was a big opportunity to use the central banker Jedi mind tricks we all know and love to hint to investors that they have read the situation all wrong.


He has, of course, done this before. Back in October, when real-world borrowing costs were sailing higher with benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields hovering close to a post-crisis peak of 5 per cent, he said markets were doing some of the Fed’s job for it. As any trained Fed nerd will tell you, that is central banker speak for “yields are too high, knock it off”.
Since then, swept along by continuing signs of weaker inflation and by dovish cooing by other Fed officials, those yields have pulled back hard. Investors had even been anticipating pretty forceful interest rate cuts in 2024 — quite the turnaround from the historic tightening cycle that has now been running for close to two years.


So after leaving rates on hold this time around, Powell was widely expected to give a subtle wink and a nod to markets that “you’re overdoing it, knock it off”. He did not do that at all. Instead, first he took a bit of a victory lap, observing that the recessionistas had got it all wrong. The Fed’s 5.25 percentage points of rate rises had not nuked the economy after all. Then he confirmed that inserting the word “any” into the Fed statement’s discussion of “the extent of any additional policy firming” was a deliberate acknowledgment that rate rises were likely to be over. It pays to watch the details here.
Then, perhaps most strikingly, he noted that some of the Fed’s rate-setters had trimmed their rate forecasts for the coming years in between Tuesday’s data showing that consumer prices had risen in November and Wednesday’s data showing that producer prices had held steady. Scribbling out forecasts and writing in new ones on the day of the rates decision and report is some pretty intense data dependency. The possibility of cuts was coming into view, he said, and was “also a discussion for us at our meeting today”.


Powell has “out-doved” the market. In response, US government bond prices flew higher, while stocks pushed ever closer to a record high. That ripping noise you can hear is not excited children opening their Christmas presents but the sound of thousand year-ahead market forecasts heading towards a bin. We are already within spitting distance of the market’s consensus forecast for where US yields will end next year.


Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pimco, the world’s largest active bond investment house, suggested that, sure, much could still go wrong, but now might be a time to pat central bankers on the back. “Certain people have been a bit harsh out there in the markets about central banks,” he told the FT before the Fed’s announcement.

“Yeah, they were late [to respond to inflation] but, wow . . . Central banks including the US Fed, in probably one of the environments with one of the highest degrees of difficulty ever . . . they have been able to get us to this point with this level of disinflation and the economy holding up,” he added. “They may go down as one of the most effective central banks when the history books are ultimately written.”


The Fed was not the only game in town this week, however. Outside emerging markets, Switzerland’s central bank also lowered its inflation forecasts, Norway proved to be a fun sponge with a further quarter-point rise, and the Bank of England opted to keep rates on hold but with a solid three of the nine rate-setters voting for a rise. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said she and her colleagues “did not discuss rate cuts at all”.

At this point, macro hedge fund managers and other investors who seek to harness broad global economic trends are rubbing their hands with joy. Generally speaking, the past two years or so have featured the big central banks all pulling in the same direction. With the exception of the Bank of Japan, each of them has been seeking to damp down inflation with hefty rises in interest rates.

Now they are very clearly at different stages in terms of dialling rates back down, and each is dependent on how economic data releases shape up. Electoral cycles are also not synchronised. With investors unusually closely focused on fiscal policy, that means different major bond markets and currencies are likely to swing around in relation to each other. 


“As a macro strategist, this is what I dream about,” said John Butler, head of macro at Wellington Management in London. “This is the best macro environment I’ve experienced in 30 years.”
It could still be the case that the Fed is forced to eat humble pie and jack up rates again next year. Similarly, no one truly knows whether an ugly recession will land.

"If the latest craze on Wall Street -- private credit -- sounds familiar, that's because it's largely a new label on an old wine. It’s the newest phase of the “junk” debt revolution that started in the bond market with Michael Milken in the 1980s, spread to syndicated loans in the 1990s and turned the market loose on the staid business of lending. The history of leveraged debt is the history of the modern financialized US company—one worth revisiting as private credit kicks into high gear.

Old school buffet types will jump on this after the strong holiday season. This fits there bill of a long running dividend stock that has fallen on some hard times. If they recover they could jump back to the ~30bn cap range they had been at for most of the 2010’s.

They have a ton of staff and they did some layoffs. More to come. They have a ton of room to improve their operational efficiency across brands, and the new kid from Logic-tech will probably get us there if he can find a better leader for vans.

"Nassim Taleb, in his 2012 book *Antifragile,* expanded on an interesting idea known as the Lindy Effect — If something has been around for a long time, then the probability that it will stick around for a longer is high.

This partially explains why people still read Shakespeare and Socrates but forget the bestsellers from the last decade.

&gt;*If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years.*

*""This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not “aging” like persons, but “aging” in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!*

*For the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy. For the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy. —* ***Nassim Taleb***

Half of all companies fail within five years, and 80% in the first 20 years. However, some companies become outliers and survive for hundreds of years. So, in theory, the Lindy Effect applies to companies.

Take Coca-Cola, for example — The company was founded in 1892 and survived the Great Depression, two World Wars, and the 1980s Cola wars, just to name a few. Not only did the company survive all this, it has thrived and increased its dividends for the **past 61 consecutive years**. Based on the Lindy Effect, Coca-Cola has a better chance of making it to the next century than Google.

If you are a value investor, **this is an important but often overlooked factor**. Ultimately, the company valuation is based on the [present value of future cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp). The problem with the current valuation technique is that we always project that the company will survive in perpetuity.

This is why it becomes so hard to value companies in their growth stage. A classic example is that during the dot-com bubble, economist Burton Malkiel pointed out that at Cisco’s implied growth rate *(Cisco was only 15 years old at that time)*, it would become larger than the entire U.S. economy within 20 years.

But, once a company has matured, it will have an established brand, a loyal customer base, and a strong market position, making it easier to assign a fair value to the company. Buffett understands this intuitively, and it’s one of the key reasons why he only invests in established companies — The average age of the top 10 holdings of Berkshire is 113 years, with seven companies older than 100 years!

&amp;#x200B;

[Berkshire Hathaway's top 10 holdings](https://preview.redd.it/bptw1q4iwk6c1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01019dfd2d53fe602797db03fde6a63eb829f74)

**Performance of Lindy stocks**

Survival is only half the story.

What I am really curious about is how legacy companies have performed over the long run. On one hand, older firms will have better structure, more efficient processes, better levels of productivity, and an easier time attracting new talent. But, on the downside, older firms will have a negative base effect *(they tend to be larger)*, lower sales growth, and tend to move slowly.

To test this, I am leveraging this [excellent dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByM9tCWE6-H2U2JSc2tZejBZZmc/view?resourcekey=0-v9AkAh0mCDGprL5_Q8M1tQ) created by Boris Marhanovic, where he consolidated all public companies in the U.S. that were more than 100 years old. There were 485 companies on the list, and after some data cleaning, we are left with 73 target companies that we can consider as Lindy stocks.

https://preview.redd.it/6s9zlofjwk6c1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6ca5a13963c5416838f867d02700c02c73d7c8

To give you a flavor of the type of companies that we are investing in, below are the top 10 companies from our list of Lindy stocks.

[Fun Fact: General Electric was the largest company in the world in 2001. Now it’s 60th in the S&amp;P 500.](https://preview.redd.it/htfl8iakwk6c1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5742ff7a93461c84ca7b0c9b6a339f46a18aec)

The results are surprisingly in favor of the Lindy stocks.

**$100 invested in Lindy stocks would have grown into $776** ***(676% return)*** **compared to only $486** ***(386% return)*** **if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500.**

The cherry on top was that this outperformance was achieved with comparable portfolio volatility (12.3%) and max drawdown (55%) to that of the S&amp;P 500.

https://preview.redd.it/4qopnahlwk6c1.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97973ccc1be40ad304cbe234664e355f3aba3fe1

**Winners, losers, and some caveats**

As with all portfolios, power laws are applicable here as well. A few of the winners contributed a major chunk of our portfolio gains. Even though we filtered for a minimum of $1 billion company valuation *(as of 2000)*, firms like Moody’s, Equifax, Hershey, etc. managed to give us a 1,000%+ return.

https://preview.redd.it/thmkujsnwk6c1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db76413c3c5e18e5a7a8e75d571ed51b62742c1

But being a 100-year-old legacy company did not prevent you from wipeouts. GE was the biggest company in the world in 1999, and it has fallen by 25% in the last 20 years! This is the same period during which the S&amp;P 500 was up \~400%! Other famous names include Citigroup, which never regained from the Global Financial Crisis, and Unis\*s Corporation, which never actually survived the dot-com bubble.

https://preview.redd.it/b6ebso7rwk6c1.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e1911fbf2381e7bafe11c21e13059a0d80130f9

The astute among you might have noticed that we equally split the investments across our Lindy portfolio. If we do a market-cap-weighted portfolio, the results are not so impressive, and the portfolio slightly underperformed the market. This was mainly due to the biggest companies in the list *(GE (12.5%), Corning (9%), and Exxon Mobil (7.5%))*, all underperforming the market during the past two decades.

https://preview.redd.it/rnqlmqgswk6c1.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6115b9b64da6a9b7505341cbce78a73ea4cd24

There are a few more limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate this *\[Portfolio raw data and holdings are shared at the end of the sheet\]*

* Our portfolio is not rebalanced annually, nor is it updated every year *(with the new companies that make it into the 100-year list)*
* The analysis is prone to survivorship bias — Given that we started with companies that were surviving as of 2017, there might be other 100-year-old companies that died off between 2000 and 2017.
* I believe a few, less objective quality checks like the industry tailwind, management competence, etc. could have improved our returns considerably more.

So in 1967 there was a war or something (I've done like 4 seconds of DD but time is sensitive here) and the Suez canal shut down for 7 years. During that time dry tonnage globally went up 20X. The shipping route around the cape is only like 60% longer than thru the canal, but I guess when shit hits the fan people freak out 

Anyways STNG is breaking out to new highs and I barely know shit about this so naturally I bought a bunch of the Jan 2025 90calls to be safe

Oh yeah also STNG bought back 27% of their shares in the last 12 months and is currently trading below book value. Really hard to know what the real value of these ships are since people aren't really building them anymore, but I think that means replacing them is even harder. Apparently shipping dry tonnage is gonna go down in 2026 as ships get deprecated. This is all I know good luck to all

"There seems to be a pervasive idea that something terrible has to happen to get stocks to go down. ""Bears are betting on a once in a lifetime depression"" or whatever. Here's my analogy explaining why I don't think this is necessarily the case.

Imagine you are betting with your friend on how many points Lebron James will score in tonight's game.

Your friend says if he scores 40 or more points, you owe them $10. If he scores less than 40 points, they owe you $10. 

Even though Lebron is one of the best ever, the ""bar"" of him having to score 40 points or more is an extremely high expectation. 40 points is physically possible but it's way beyond what would be considered a reasonable expectation for him in an average game (closer to 27 points).

This is how the market is priced right now. Yes, the companies pushing the market higher are of very high quality (they are the Lebrons of the business world). **But** many of them are priced as if they are definitely going to score 40 points at the next game so to speak. 

Even if they come out and score 36 points (which would be an very solid performance), that is still a loss relative to where the bar is.

Replace the 40 point line with analyst expectations and P/E ratios and that is the bear thesis in my view. You don't even necessarily need a recession to disappoint the 2024 expectations. You just need anything less than an exceptional year of economic boom. 

Now, I'm not saying I know exactly where the market is going to go or anything. All I'm really saying is that expectations are quite high and there can be disappointment even if the economy is growing and relatively healthy.",A different look at the bear thesis through the lens of a basketball bet with your friend,18j2gni,1702653624.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18j2gni/a_different_look_at_the_bear_thesis_through_the/,

"Costco had their Q1 2024 Earnings announcement today and dropped that they will be giving a $15 special dividend on Jan 12, 2024...

This will total $6.7 billion paid out to shareholders.

The snapshot is going to be taken on Dec 28, 2023 in case anyone wants to capture the dividend. Stock I imagine drops right after the snapshot date.

But the stock is over $600 and you'll likely be front run by bots. Oh well, let's see the run up that comes with this.

[Source here](https://www.stockocean.com/post/costco-announces-record-breaking-15-special-dividend)

**UPDATE**: Getting a lot of comments explaining special dividends. Yes, in theory, special dividends have 0 net value creation since you are taking cash from the balance sheet to pay out shareholders. If a stock is $100 and you pay a $15 per share dividend, you receive $15 in cash your stock is worth $85.

However, in practice stock prices can be driven up by special dividends due to perceived limited opportunity, potential positive investor sentiment, and dividend capture traders. Market psychology can be irrational! 

A stock will often trade up before the ex-dividend date (day stock trades without value of next dividend). Thus the real winners are existing shareholders. Someone owns the stock at $100, special dividend announced, stock trades up to say $110, dividend paid out of $15. Now shareholder left with $95 stock price and $15 in cash or a $10 net increase.

For Costco, the stock price was $630 at close yesterday before the announcement, and in pre-market trading the stock is already $642... There are also other factors like Costco Q1 2024 earnings beat. Investors have generally found the announcement positive but it's impossible to ignore other factors affecting the price.

Do what you want with the stock, but there is no free money.

- GDP has been holding steady and increased Q3 2023. 
- Inflation is down to 3.1%, which is a pretty good landing given the above and where inflation used to be at like 9% in 2022
- Loans and high interest rate, well yeah we've been hiking those up, a bank or two broke sure but that was contained, and now we're going to cut rates next year. Doesn't seem like people are defaulting on loans left and right either.

"Well, my gamble on human emotions today failed.  I lost my $1400 gain from yesterday as SPY and QQQ fell. The DTE on those options are tomorrow, but I’m not holding out much hope.

Though as a consolation, my joke F call of 11.5 rose exponentially. And all I had in there was $16 dollars. At least it’s now $450, but still…!

Though considering how the market will be next year with at least two rate cuts; I’ll take what little I have tomorrow and put it in an FSLR call.

Even though I got screwed out by the opening bell today; I feel it has potential to climb over the next 6 months.  Maybe a rate cut in between then and now, which would help stimulate the housing market and subsequent retrofits such as solar.

"It’s the “I Told You SO” guy and I hate to piss on your “inflation dead bro” parade. Fellow regards, inflation is already entrenched in the system. It has moved from goods to services (which is what 70% of US consumers spent on) and it’s nearly impossible to remove without a severe recession--which is nowhere in sight. While the inflation in goods has been caused by supply chain shocks, commodities spike, and money printing, those have pretty much gone away now. However, they have shifted toward services where labor costs are the main cause! Wages are very sticky and folks are not willing to take pay cuts just to save the economy from inflation. At the same time, people are still spending like no tomorrow so there are no reasons for businesses to stop hiring people or raising wages.

Where the f\*\*k are all you broke ass Mfers got money to buy all these stuff! Do you think Arthur Burns, oops I mean Jay Powell, will cut rates with this kind of stupid spending? He is raising rates to tame down on demands so you all stop spending! He is asking you regards to STOP buying/trading monkey jpegs and imaginary tokens, and do you really think he is succeeding??? Do you think he is done? With an unemployment rate at 3.7%? 

Do you think this time is different? Do you think the Phillips curve and the law of economics will be suspended in mid-air? For regards that don’t know, the Phillips Curve represents the relationship between unemployment and inflation. You cannot have low inflation with low unemployment. Unless the inflation number and/or unemployment number are rigged.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

Jay Powell has failed to get the US consumers to stop spending. Without a recession, prices for services will NOT go down voluntarily! Rate cuts in 2024 will only pour gasoline on the inflation fire. POWELL KNOWS THIS! He does not want to be known as Arthur Burns!!! He is using  one of the tools from the FED toolkit which is to jawbone you to think P1v0t is coming! It’s NOT. The US economy is almost 70% consumers spending and until you monkeys stop spending, there will be no recession. There’s no reason for him to risk inflation skyrocketing back up again! With the markets up (DOW at record high, SPY close to record high), the wealth efforts will pour more gasoline on the fire.

"Ok indulge me eventually small cap growth stock going to be too cheap, and large cap tech will become too expensive. Most fund will have to do a rebalance. Which is why when a large cap over extend itself you see a small pull back. Some come from individual investors cashing in but the major movers are from large 401k fund rebalancing.
Because say they want 80 percent large cap and 20 small for example.

"Lately, I'm becoming more convinced that biotech was just another bubble waiting to burst. As expected, only the best are surviving.

Firstly, a bunch of biotech companies is constantly dealing with the FDA, then lawsuits, then FDA again, and it goes on and on. In recent cases, for instance, Fibrogen is in the process of [settling its mess](https://11thestate.com/cases/fibrogen-shareholder-settlement) over an anemia drug, lots of companies accused of not disclosing FDA investigations properly, and it turns out, it's not just investigations but potential patent revocations. Many other companies, like Bloom Energy and Kiromic, had troublesome IPOs (and I won't even mention Kiromic's performance).

In my view, the fact that biotech companies are constantly facing lawsuits is a downward slide for all of them, which signals a decline in performance and overall dynamics (just my humble opinion tho).

"Okay guys, quick one here! Costco Wholesale (COST) is dropping its fiscal first-quarter results after today's market close. Despite a dip in splurge spending, Costco's knack for value deals and smoother supply chains should give their sales and earnings a nice boost this quarter. So calls? That's my guess, but let's actually look deeper into why. 

For those living under a rock, Costco is that giant retailer selling everything from avocados to TVs. In the past year, these guys have beaten Wall Street's earnings guesses two thirds of the time. This is pretty good. For this quarter, they're guessing it'll will hit $3.41 per share, up 11% from last year's $3.07. Sales? They're expected to climb 6.1% to a hefty $57.75 billion.

Last quarter showed some interesting stats: U.S. sales barely budged, up just 0.2%, while Canada saw a nicer 1.8% jump. The real party was in their ""Other International"" segment, which skyrocketed by 5.5%. Overall, Costco managed a 1.1% uptick in comparable sales.

Globally, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, with a 5% rise in the U.S. alone. But, the average spending per trip dipped by 3.9% worldwide and 4.5% in the States.

Turning to Q1, let's not forget the big picture: consumer spending trends, inflation, and Costco's smart plays. They're keeping members happy and cash registers ringing, thanks to their customer-first approach, strategic pricing, and kickass merch initiatives.

Costco's magic formula? Sell stuff cheap and keep the customers coming. This, combined with shrinking supply-chain costs and a stronger push for their own brands, is expected to spice up their results.

For the quarter we're eyeing, expect a solid 5.5% bump in net sales (as mentioned before) but also a 5.2% increase in membership fees. Costco's paid membership base is growing steadily, thanks to more customers and solid renewal rates. There are rumours of a price hike in membership cost. If this is the case, the stock WILL get a huge bump up. 

But hey, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. We've got inflation and high-interest rates lurking around, potentially messing things up. Also, keep an eye on those margins, especially with rising labor costs, store expenses, and potential SG&amp;A rate issues.

This is more akin to gambling, but I'm banking on that membership raise. It's been years since they've increased the price, and we got netflix over here increasing their membership multiple times a year. [But this is literally what I said in my last COST post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16svsgy/cost_to_the_moon_yolo_time_as_earnings_drop_today/). Last time I posted about Costco, the stock was in the 300s. Now it's at the 600s, based the stock climbing on the very same fundamentals mentioned there.

"Sweet baby JPow gave us an early Christmas!

I can see clearly now the rain is gone!

We had peak inflation a year ago, peak recession, peak fear of war, and it has all gone away. All the bear boogie monsters are gone. There is nothing ahead of us but salvation!

Oh lawwwd thank you Jesus! We bulls are gonna be rich!

Just kidding. 

When has the overuse of exclamation points not been the mark of a moron?

As I explained a few weeks ago, this is the rally bears needed. 

You don't crash down when everyone is already gloomy, and when the market is already low. The big crashes come from when the market is on a high. 

I also warned that bears were gonna get burned this holiday season, a month ago in another post, when I explained that the stage was set, the ducks were in a row for them to be burned one more time this year. We were about to enter a holiday rally.

I also warned that bulls would get their turn afterwards.

Consequences will bite this market sooner or later. There are too many consequences piled up.

You can't have high rates, inverted yield curve, failing banks, failing retirement funds, collapsing Chinese economy, high cost of living, attractive bond and savings yields, still inflated housing prices from Covid that haven't corrected yet, fewer people able to afford homes, higher mortgages, higher borrowing costs for companies that will weigh on their future quarterlies, without having consequences. 

Remember, we haven't actually seen the full effect from the Fed rates yet. These things take time to seep through and create their domino effect. 

Wait until people are done doing their holiday shopping, and will now have record debt, and consumerism starts getting replaced by defaulting on debt in 2024.

When the reaction to Fed rates pushes unemployment over the edge. 

When inflation cools off and stops giving the illusion that people are spending more, and we realize these companies aren't really making all that money. 

Even when the Fed finally start cutting rates, but the stock market doesn't get lifted much or might even go down, because that has already been priced into this rally, bulls will be left in disbelief. 

When big money is using this rally as their exit liquidity and new bulls who bought high are left as bagholders, the next big dip is gonna create a big panic of new people who weren't ready for this.

Too many bulls are depending on the narrative of ""this is an election year, surely they're not gonna let the stock market go down?"". 

I don't think that's  good enough of a reason to expect a bullrun in 2024. Don't expect a Presidency to look out for your stock picks. 

I only believe in consequences, and reaction for every action. These things can have a longer time fuse than people expect. Bears have been too quick to expect it in the past year.

Rate cuts doesn’t mean the printer is coming back for fun. It means the printer is coming back due to need.

The broad economy is in a very high risk position right now and the global economy is deteriorating by the day. The market and economy are not reflecting the reality of the other.

-M2 money supply is decreasing at it’s fastest pace since the Depression

-China is in deflation

-Canada is on the verge of recession

-Germany is on the verge of recession

-CEO’s are beginning to discuss deflation potential

-The consumer is being hammered with student loans and high interest borrowing

-Freight is in recession

-California is in recession

-Available jobs are decreasing much quicker than expected

Rate cuts are great if people have jobs and money. Rate cuts are a lot less fun when millions of people are losing their jobs, the consumer halts spending, corporate earnings tank, housing supply rises due to the need to sell due to job losses and outpaces buyer demand and starts decreasing everyone’s sweet Covid equity gains.

In the intricate dance of financial markets, Disney's stock performance during election cycle years in America has historically exhibited a positive rhythm. Investors often find comfort in the company's diversified portfolio, spanning entertainment, media, and theme parks. Amidst the uncertainties of election cycles, Disney's ability to weather economic fluctuations and adapt to changing consumer behaviors stands out. The company's strategic vision, marked by a continuous stream of creative content and technological innovations, resonates well with investors seeking stability. While activist investors loom in the background, their impact remains a nuanced factor, with Disney's robust fundamentals and global brand resonance often steering the narrative towards optimism. This historical trend underscores the company's resilience and strategic foresight, making Disney a notable fixture in portfolios during election years.

Morning lads. By now we’ve all experienced the early market Santa rally. This is seen no better then in the Dow Jones, which WSJ explained “the blue-chip index sets a new all time high record, boosted by hopes for a soft landing, rate stabilization and hype about artificial intelligence”. The traders and I who went long the Dow (aka the Dow Boys) are now the Dough Boys. Tis not just the season to be jolly, but also to be a bull. But, the seasons change.  

Although I’ve been kept comfortably warm by my hot pickings (up 270.15% YTD,  even been able to stock my fireplace with premium wood from Cathie’s) , the scorching pace of the Dow's record-breaking rally will eventually find a cooling breeze. 

Yet, fear not, for amidst this transition allow me to introduce a new opportunity—WEBS. Going long on WEBS, the Direxion Daily Dow Jones Internet Bear 3X Shares, might seem contrary to our bullish instincts, but it's precisely during these record setting rallies that the shrewd investor spots the ripest prospects and hedges. Currently sitting at its all-time low, this is the moment when the seeds of long-term potential are sown. Buying shares now, while WEBS languishes in the abyss, will yield a harvest of juicy gains whenever the market's bearish winds eventually blow, soft or hard. Come make money. 

I’m in this play for 2-6 weeks, tops. Buy at the lowest, and sell higher later (aiming for 11.5-22.69%). Rest assured, during this cherished holiday season, I’ll be enjoying the warmth of the fireplace, having s’mores, reaping this year profits and sowing my WEBS seeds during the winter.

"So, I’m a supervisor at Wendy’s and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It’s so bad I struggle to believe it’s human, it’s full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don’t know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that’s the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy’s is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.

Anyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it’s interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy’s outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, “oh shit you’re a 🌈🐻 too?!?”. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy’s and may or may not be down $128k. To say I’m f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it’s obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I’ve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They’re virtually free and will pay off millions. It’s only logical.

Anyway, now I’m freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I’ve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.

Problem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I’ve tried calling the police since it’s trespassing, but I can’t get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I’ve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy’s money?

In hindsight, I don’t actually think it’s smart enough to know what I’m doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.

Is anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don’t need any investing advice, I’ve got it all under control.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCE DISPUTES: UPDATE TO THE ISDA ARBITRATION GUIDE

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has published an updated guidance on the use of an arbitration clause with an ISDA Master Agreement. The 2018 ISDA Arbitration Guide, published in December 2018, includes an expanded range of model arbitration clauses adapted for use with ISDA’s Master Agreements for a larger number of arbitration institutions and seats around the globe. It updates ISDA’s first ISDA Arbitration Guide published in 2013.

Increasing use of arbitration in resolving financial disputes

Historically, finance parties have referred their disputes to litigation, preferring the known of domestic courts. In recent years, however, increasing focus has come on the use, and potential advantages, of international arbitration for cross-border finance transactions.

To that end, between 2011 and 2013, the ISDA conducted a wide-ranging consultation of its members regarding the use of arbitration for disputes arising out of its Master Agreements, leading to its publication of the 2013 ISDA Arbitration Guide. In 2016, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) published an influential report on financial institutions and arbitration, and data from international arbitral institutions and surveys of in-house counsel and practitioners have highlighted numerous reasons why international arbitration is gaining popularity with parties to cross-border financial transactions.

There are a number of important reasons for why arbitration is increasingly utilised by finance parties (reflecting why international commercial arbitration is best practice for cross-border commercial disputes generally), as outlined below",Protocol: ISDA 2023 Equity Swap – Protocol Adhering Organization:AllianceBernstein L.P.

# Argentina’s new government devalues peso by more than 50%

Argentina has devalued its currency, the peso, by more than 50% as part of a package of large-scale spending cuts intended to address the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.

The plans, introduced under the **newly inaugurated administration of Javier Milei**, include cutting energy subsidies and cancelling tenders for public works.

His economy minister, Luis Caputo, moved to weaken the official exchange rate to 800 pesos a dollar – it had been 366.5 – in a televised address after the local markets closed on Tuesday. He said the central bank would **target a monthly devaluation of 2%**.

Caputo said the moves, which were welcomed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would be painful in the short-term but were needed to cut the country’s fiscal deficit and bring down soaring triple digit inflation.

Argentina’s central bank is due to announce new monetary measures on Wednesday.

“The objective is simply to avoid catastrophe and get the economy back on track,” Caputo said, in a recorded speech. **“There is no more money.”**

He said the country needed to tackle a deep fiscal deficit he put at 5.5% of gross domestic product, arguing that Argentina had an “addiction” to fiscal deficits, 113 over the last 123 years.

“We’re here to solve this problem at the root,” he said. “For this we need to solve our addiction to a fiscal deficit.”

The South American country, a large grain producer, has an **inflation rate nearing 150%**, central bank reserves deep in the red and two-fifths of the population in poverty. Other measures announced include halving the number of government ministries.

Argentina also has a $44bn (£35bn) loan with the IMF.

“I welcome the decisive measures,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, calling it “an important step toward restoring stability and rebuilding the country’s economic potential”.

The IMF described the measures as “bold” and said they would “help stabilise the economy and set the basis for more sustainable and private sector-led growth” after “serious policy setbacks” in recent months.

Argentina’s foreign exchange and grains markets had been locked down on Tuesday as traders awaited the new government’s economic plan. Banks had already anticipated a sharp devaluation, with some weakening their foreign exchange rate to 700 pesos a dollar.

Since 2019, the Argentinian peso has been kept artificially strong by strict capital controls that create a wide gap between the official exchange rate of 366 a dollar and **parallel rates as high as 1,000 a dollar**. **\[**[**Unofficial Dollar rate**](https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/)**\]**

“We’re always worse off because our response has been to attack the consequences but not the problem,” Caputo said in his address. “What we’ve come to do is the opposite of what they always did, and that’s solve the root problem.”

YOUR PHONE ISN'T A TELEPHONE ANYMORE. IT'S DIRECT ACCESS TO YOUR POCKET. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CAPITALISM, ITS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR DEVICES, ITS ABOUT WHAT YOUR DEVICES CAN DO TO YOU.

That's why Elon Musk wanted to buy Twitter. It's not because he wanted to own Twitter. It's because he wanted to be inside of your pocket. **Let that sink in.**

So lets take another look at the beaten-down EV stock that is Fisker. Since my first post, the market cap has been reduced by over $100,000,000.00. It's right around 1/2 a billion now.

This despite the fact that you can literally order, pay for, and take delivery of an actual functioning automobile. Not in the future, but, like, right now.

[This automobile has already been manufactured. It is functional and for less than seventy grand you can make it yours, but only if you want to explain to people five years from now why you own a car that was build by a megalomaniac that cucked you into overpaying for an EV that doesn't work right.

Alright, lets talk about the penalty box. Why is Fisker in it and what does it have to do with my options that expire on Friday?

The 'Penalty Box' is a special place in the stock market reserved for naughty companies that do naughty shit. Things like fucking up their financials and then cycling through two CFO's in a month. This gives the street good reason to suspect that things are not well - at a financial level and (more importantly) at an organizational level. Critics of Fisker will say that putting a designer in the CEO seat is like putting a lunatic in charge of the asylum. And they're not wrong. Fisker is almost certainly a victim of the Peter Principle, which states that someone who is talented at their job will eventually get promoted up to the level where they are incompetent and then they will remain there for the duration of their career.

Okay. Lets do some chart analysis. Has Fisker really been going over a cliff, like Thelma and Louise?

&amp;#x200B;

[Is it really like this? Or is there another explanation?](https://preview.redd.it/ft9pf513d66c1.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48dec7f5f514f3b82e1acba9d38177977530e10d)

&amp;#x200B;

[Some advanced chart analysis shows that the downward trend since early October was intercepted by the fibonacci arc with a fulcrum located right around Jan 1 2024. Also notice that volume has increased since earnings. This is what institutional investors refer to as the 'accumulation' period. It's when you buy from fear in the hopes of selling to greed 5-10 years from now.](https://preview.redd.it/dyml40m7e66c1.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea1b8a89d22ea64c21b81f8704f1ae8f28db342)

I'm not sure what luck Fisker will have in locating a bottom soon. Since my last post, it looks like the smart money has been in shorting the stock into oblivion. Every share sold short is not only a bet that the stock goes to zero, but it lowers the share price just a little bit, making it harder for the company to float shares into the market and accumulate the capital it needs to survive.

Today, however, something changed. It looks like companies that rely on cheap capital to survive may  have been thrown a lifeline by none other than our favorite money printer... JPOW.

&amp;#x200B;

[Why did markets get a boner today? Because everyone likes cheap money. But ya know who REALLY likes cheap money? Companies that need to borrow in order to survive.](https://preview.redd.it/21zmx3sjf66c1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d3a39d16ed8522a033941de69a89b83e78199d)

My thesis on Fisker remains unchanged. The company is undervalued based on my own valuation system. They are undervalued based on basic forward-looking earnings. They are under-valued based on the existing stock of finished product that is awaiting delivery. They are undervalued based on my own subjective analysis of their design fundamentals - which I think are excellent and beyond that, THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES ARE TIME-TESTED. Henrik Fisker is not a new-comer. He's got a proven track record and more importantly, he's got a chip on his shoulder.

Disregard my advice at your own peril. Here's how I did in the markets today:

&amp;#x200B;

[If you made more money than me today, feel free to go about your business. But I only obey one rule: COFFEE IS FOR CLOSERS. If you made less than $8,742 in the stock market today than sit the fuck down. ](https://preview.redd.it/87gej92mg66c1.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732772c5cf2b59c358b584a68813970b2a3c2ae8)

Ah yes, and the obligatory 'ITS wAlL sTrEeT BeTs, lET'S maKE iT sHoRt sQUeEze!' data:

&amp;#x200B;

[38&amp;#37; of the float is sold short. That means that once the stock finds a bottom, 38&amp;#37; of the shares need to be bought back. This will not be a squeeze to the moon. This will just be a general upward pull over a long period of time.](https://preview.redd.it/yln2thxdi66c1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450726c2e47bdd5b09850b867d6b15ca2d5cb724)

&amp;#x200B;

My positions:

&amp;#x200B;

[I own 4000 shares at $2.16 average. This is less than 1&amp;#37; of my overall portfolio and I would recommend that you keep your own position small enough that it doesn't interrupt your kids college plans. But who am I kidding... your kids aren't that bright anyways.](https://preview.redd.it/ku4vywn4h66c1.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa6739060b02e578a0d3ac6bfd186e7ad192bfcc)

TLDR:

If you have two brain cells to rub together, you'll see that Fisker is undervalued. It is a functional car company that will possibly survive the 'GREAT EV SHAKEOUT'. Long-dated $2 calls or accumulate a position with an average less than $2.

" Hi all

I came across this article - why will the stock market go down?

&amp;#x200B;

""Equity markets in Europe and the US look stretched on every front: flows, momentum and technical levels — leaving little headroom if the message from Chair Jerome Powell disappoints. With the S&amp;P 500 just 3% short of a record and the Euro Stoxx 50 Index near its highest level since 2001, the stakes haven’t been this elevated before a Fed meeting since the rates pause in July.

A speedy switch from short-to-long equities by commodity trading advisers, who usually trade on market momentum, has been a major factor behind the $4.6 trillion rally in US stocks since Oct. 27. The shift has now left CTAs sitting on a $106 billion in long bets, which Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says leaves them more inclined to sell, rather than buy.

“We have this cohort modeled to sell S&amp;P 500 in every scenario over the next week,” Goldman’s derivatives and flow specialist Cullen Morgan wrote in a note to clients. It follows a warning from his colleagues last week that dangerously high optimism on stocks means there are “no longer any bears left.”

Trend and momentum indicators are still green for Europe and the US, while only Asian markets are showing some signs of weakening. What’s more, nine out of the 11 top performing benchmarks are now showing relative strength indicators in overbought territory, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

No matter which way markets go, Goldman says CTAs are modeled to sell S&amp;P 500 futures in the next week.

According to Morgan, if equities make an upward move, CTAs will have $20 billion worth of stocks to buy, but $1.3 billion in S&amp;P 500 futures to sell. In a downward-move scenario, they would need to sell $5 billion of stocks and $1.9 billion of S&amp;P 500 futures. Even in a flat market, while CTAs will need to buy $18 billion of global stocks, they would sell $436 million in S&amp;P 500 futures.

A potential drop in markets could be further accelerated by other technical traders as the S&amp;P 500 Index has just broken above its summer highs, with a failure by the gauge to move beyond that mark potentially seen as a signal for the first short-term corrective move since the rally started in late October. The asymmetry in these flows comes at a point where policy makers could feel they need to rein in markets as bets on monetary easing and rate cuts build ever-higher expectations.\*",Can somebody put this into layman's terms?

Hello everyone,

I'm  looking for some insights into the mathematics or the economic  reasoning behind the potential capital inflow into Bitcoin around the  time of a Bitcoin ETF approval. There's a lot of speculation and  predictions, but I'm curious about the concrete estimations or models  that might explain this event and its potential impact on Bitcoin's  price.

Specifically, there are  predictions suggesting Bitcoin could reach $100k by 2024 and $150k by  2025, partly attributed to the ETF approval. Can anyone shed light on  how these figures are estimated? What are the key factors or models that  can help understand this expected surge?

Any  detailed explanation or resources on the math behind these predictions  would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to get a better grasp of how  such significant price milestones are calculated in relation to major  market events like an ETF approval.

"Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal, though operating in distinct domains, share several commonalities as prominent tech companies. Both entities are recognized as tech giants with a significant global presence. Meta, known for its focus on social media, virtual reality, and augmented reality, connects people worldwide through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, PayPal stands as a leading digital payments platform, facilitating secure online transactions on a global scale.

These companies demonstrate a commitment to digital innovation, each in their respective fields. Meta's ventures into virtual reality with Oculus and augmented reality showcase its dedication to pushing technological boundaries. Similarly, PayPal has pioneered online payment solutions, emphasizing the importance of seamless and secure digital transactions.

A user-centric approach is a shared characteristic, with both Meta and PayPal prioritizing user experience. Meta's goal is to foster global connections and communication, while PayPal focuses on providing a convenient and secure environment for digital payments, connecting buyers and sellers internationally.

Strategic acquisitions have played a key role in the expansion of both Meta and PayPal. Meta's acquisitions include Instagram and WhatsApp, augmenting its social technology portfolio. On the other hand, PayPal has strategically acquired companies such as Braintree and Venmo to enhance its digital payment offerings.

While these companies exhibit similarities in their global reach, commitment to innovation, user-centric focus, and strategic acquisitions, it's essential to recognize that their core businesses and industries diverge, with Meta primarily operating in the realm of social technology and PayPal specializing in digital payments.

Historically, Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal have exhibited similar stock trading patterns, influenced by broader factors in the technology sector. Commonalities arise from shared exposure to tech industry trends, general market sentiment, and macro-economic conditions. Investor behavior, including demographics and institutional ownership, contributes to parallel movements, as does the impact of competitive landscape changes on both companies. Earnings reports and performance metrics, such as revenue growth and profit margins, can lead to comparable stock reactions. Additionally, the global expansion of both Meta and PayPal, coupled with their reliance on technology adoption trends, further aligns their stock trajectories. While these broad factors contribute to historical similarities, comprehensive analysis considering specific company dynamics and evolving market conditions remains essential to understanding their individual stock behaviors.

"Yo guys, check this out: Adobe (ADBE) is totally killing it thanks to the AI wave. We’re talking a massive 44% jump in the past half-year, ranking highly in the basket of software stocks that have enjoyed investor enthusiasm. The stock has risen 80% year to date, blowing the S&amp;P 500’s 19% rise out of the water. The real question on everyone’s mind: can Adobe keep this wild ride going?

Get ready for the big reveal as Adobe drops its Q4 fiscal 2023 earnings after today’s market close. The street's looking for earnings of $4.14 per share, up from last year’s $3.60. Sales are expected to hit around $5.03 billion, which is a solid 10.81% jump from last year.

But here’s where it gets spicy: Wall Street big shots, like JPMorgan’s Keith Weiss, are betting big on Adobe. Weiss is all in with an Overweight rating and a sky-high $660 price target. He’s vibing with Adobe’s AI game, especially with its Firefly project. Weiss is pretty much saying, “Chill, Adobe’s got this,” expecting them to crush FY24 estimates across the board. Weiss believes investors should feel ""very comfortable"" with the company's ability to monetize generative artificial intelligence. 

Mizuho’s Gregg Moskowitz is eyeing Adobe’s accelerated web traffic, hinting at a juicy boost in digital media revenue. I expect this to boost Adobe’s digital media segment annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. He’s also hyped about Firefly, Adobe’s latest AI brainchild, calling it a potential major growth engine. This aligns with Adobe’s master plan to play the long game for success.

As mentioned previously, for the quarter that ended November, we expect the company to earn $4.14 per share on revenue of $5.03 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $3.60 per share on revenue of $4.53 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to rise 18% year over year to $15.93 per share, while full-year revenue of $19.38 billion would climb 10 % year over year.

Adobe’s deep dive into generative AI is causing a serious buzz. They’re rolling out cool new tools like Firefly and Generative Fill, and teaming up with Google's Bard AI. Firefly is set to jazz up Bard’s text-to-image game, letting users whip up images with just words like Dalle-3. Thus far, Adobe's execution has been nothing short of stellar as evident from its third quarter results, during which it beat on both the top and bottom lines.

Get this: Adobe just flexed hard in Q3, raking in a monster $464 million in new Digital Media recurring dough. But wait, there’s more - their operational cash flow? A whopping $1.87 billion. And get this: they’re sitting on a treasure trove of $15.72 billion in Performance Obligations ready to roll. But hold up, because Adobe ain’t done yet. They’re cranking up their full-year revenue goals, now eyeing a beefy range of $19.25 to $19.35 billion, up from the previous $19.1 to $19.3 billion prediction. Talk about moving the goalposts – in the right direction! 🚀

Adobe’s subscription revenue and new user growth are on fire. Come tonight, we’ll see if they can keep up the momentum and if their AI bets pay off big time. See, I'm gonna go ahead and grab a call spread. Not direct calls because, well, they're just VERY expensive. A call spread is when you buy one call and sell a different call at a higher strike price and same expiry date. This lowers your cost basis. So here, it would be a good idea to grab a ADBE 12/15 625c @ 15.10 and sell the 12/15 650c @ 6.90. THis way you get the whole spread for $820, with a potential max profit of 3x. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.

"How do you decide what to invest in? 

In 2020 when the market crashed I decided to try my hand in investing. I put in $500 and Googled what should I invest in today and just picked a few I thought would be good. I've turned that $500 in to $1,600+. All the stocks I Googled ""what stocks should I buy today?"" I have made money on. Most of my money that I made came from the AVGO stock. Man, I wish I bought more then one share of that one. I got it when it was $200 it's now $1,000+.

All the stocks I've decided to buy on my own because I thought it was a good ""Idea"" like AAL and GTBIF I've lost money. 

Right now, I'm thinking about selling most of my stocks and waiting for the market to crash again and buying a share of the S&amp;P 500 when I think the market has hit it's low point. I'm just a amateur in the stock market but I have a feeling the market to going to crash this spring.

"Picking stock direction is hard. HARD AF. You buy calls and the stock plummets. You puts and then Stonks only go up.

So why not just buy a straddle? Well Theta is gonna get ya. But what if, hear my out, you set a GTC order for 1% over what you purchased your straddle?

Let's say you buy a Long spy straddle expiring on Dec 26, you can get that straddle for a price of 6.65 after fees. How do I know? This highly regarded trader bought one. And then I set a GTC order for 6.72. 

But you might be thinking ""You can lose one hundred percent of your investment!' However, think about what it would take for that to happen. SPY would have to expire AT 465 exactly on Dec 26 to lose everything. At any other point, one of those options has at least some intrinsic value.

The break even is about 1.5% away from the strike, and I have until Dec 26 to make a profit. If I do this and do 1% in 2 weeks, that's like 26% annualized. And every single one of these trades I've done has closed in under 2 weeks. ALL OF THEM. Some even the same day I put them on. I've done like 20. Some of these trades have annualized returns of like 3000%

"In October, the SEC issued the rules aimed at boosting transparency of short selling and securities lending, two connected activities.

The groups say the SEC took conflicting stances with the rules, in one case allowing for transaction reports to be aggregated in order to protect investors' positions, yet at the same time requiring other transaction reports to disclosed individually

In their suit, the groups argue the SEC did not take into account the interconnected nature of the two rules and adopted contradictory approaches, adding as such the rules will harm investors. They also added the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires agencies to justify their rules and consider feedback.

The SEC's October short-selling rule requires hedge funds to report short positions to the regulator, which publishes them with a delay on an aggregate basis in which individual traders remain anonymous. The second rule requires financial firms to make daily reports on individual securities loans, which facilitate their short positions. That data will also be disclosed on a delayed basis.",Hedge fund groups sue US SEC in bid to vacate short-selling rules,18hhqp3,1702476985.0,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/hedge-fund-groups-sue-us-sec-bid-vacate-short-selling-rules-2023-12-12/,
"In a late November filing, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager that looks around around $10 trillion on behalf of clients, updated its bitcoin spot ETF filing to allow Wall Street banks to act as authorized participants, allowing them to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding bitcoin and crypto on their own balance sheets.

"I know many in here are just gamblers who don't think about such things. I'm pretty much the opposite, I buy (and sell) stocks rather than buying options. Occasionally I'll sell an option, but buying is a rare thing, in parts to the very unfavourable tax legislation regarding long option positions in Germany. I backtest my strategies before deploying them. I do risk management instead of YOLOing my life savings.

But I still read in here. Why? To get inspired. I claim to have gotten a lot of my inspiration from a satirical finance YouTuber who doesn't even pretend to give any good advice, instead he makes fun of himself and the finance world. Yet, I got my best ideas from hearing and reading about the worst ones.

Now I read posts like ""I turned 10k into half a million"" here. It's always long options, and it's impossible to do consistently, I know that. But it got me thinking: what if I could predict a stock going up like, say, 5% in the next two weeks? What if I could say so for a stock with absolute certainty, that it will be up 5% from its current price in the next 14 days? Could I, with that knowledge, also 50x my money?

And it's surprisingly hard. There was a thread about AVGO like that recently (on Dec 29 calls, I believe, maybe it was Dec 22). I opened the option chain, and had a look. It closed at 1072.40 yesterday, so let's assume we know it will reach 1126 in the next 14 days. Earliest contract for the 14 day window is Dec 29, so what option could I buy to make the most money here?

Here are some calls, and we compare the current price (midpoint at close) to their intrinsic value when it reaches 1126:

* 1080C costs 26, that would be intrinsic 46 at expiration, or a plus of around 77%
* 1090C costs 17.65, that would be intrinsic 36 at expiration, or a plus of around 104%
* 1100C costs 14.7, that would be intrinsic 26 at expiration, or a plus of around 77%
* 1110C costs 11.9, that would be intrinsic 16 at expiration, or a plus of around 34%
* 1120C costs 9.95, that would be intrinsic 6 at expiration, that's a loss

I ignored spreads and commissions, on the other hand if it happens a bit before expiration there would be some extrinsic value left. But the best we can do is about doubling the investment, which is leverage of a factor 20. Still, it's far away from the 10x or 20x you see here. And using a longer expiration doesn't make things better.

Now if you gambled the 5% jump would happen a week earlier already, things do get better. On the Dec 22 calls, I can get around +170%. But that's still below 3x, on a prediction of a 5% move. And that stock has a quite moderate IV of around 30%. On high-IV stocks this gets way worse. 

Sure, OP in the AVGO thread probably captured a larger move (I guess around 15%, but I don't think he traded through earnings, I believe it was a post-earnings trade), which does help (yes, I could find 10x or more on a 15% change). But still, my impression is some in here are pretty good at finding these 10x or better chances. How is your approach in selecting which options to gamble on?

Again, this is out of curiosity, I hope to gain some insight into the thought process behind it (at least of those of you who have a thought process). ",How do you maximize leverage?,18hdvj9,1702463258.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18hdvj9/how_do_you_maximize_leverage/,
"Just a question about how trading / markets work. Every sale of an asset also includes a buyer. So if someone sells a huge amount of a stock, that means another person or persons bought a huge amount of the same stock. But some are seen as bad for the market (sell-offs, dumping) and some are seen as good (FOMO-ing in, etc). So how is it determined which is which?

Does it depend who put in the order to sell/buy and had to wait? As in someone requested to sell and waited for buyers or vice versa? Or does it depend on who is selling, like a long-term holder? Or maybe the price in question is slightly above or below the market value and that determines it?

"According to Bill Ackman on his twitter, he donated $10mm worth of Coupang (CPNG) shares to Harvard around 2018 because he didn't have cash liquidity (going through divorce, fund underperforming).  

Not only this, Ackman said if the $10mm in shares dipped below $10mm in value, he would personally make up for it in the future. And if the value rose above $15mm, he would have control of where to allocate those donation funds at Harvard.

Three years go by, Coupang is going to IPO at $50 billion. Those shares he gave Harvard are now worth $85 million! 

His enthusiasm quickly turned to anger when he discovered Harvard sold the $10mm in shares back to Coupang on March 2020, at par value for $10mm...

"TL;DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4. Microsoft also provides an ecosystem into which OpenAI's GPTs fit seamlessly. Where does that leave Alphabet if Gemini Ultra doesn't deliver on all its promises? - Google Search, and here again, Microsoft's Bing is catching up, using the power of OpenAI.

This is not financial advice.

The full text can be found [here](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge-b3d78efe3a9c) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/gotterdammerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge/).

""\[...\]Last week Alphabet announced its new AI Gemini, which will be released in 3 different versions: Nano, Pro and Ultra. According to Google Deepmind’s recent report, Gemini Ultra outperforms OpenAI’s GPT 4 in almost all benchmarks. This claim was supported by a video that turned out to be staged (I wouldn’t call it a fake, as the [real prompts were also published](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html)). But if Gemini Ultra is finally superior to GPT 4 and this can be proven by many benchmarks, why does Alphabet continue to hide its prodigy? Why does Alphabet take the risk that OpenAI will release GPT 4.5 in the near future and thus sweep away all the doubts about its superiority?

Hasn’t Alphabet’s innovation lead always been a big part of the investment thesis for Alphabet shareholders? Now Alphabet is trying hard to show that its secret AI, Gemini Ultra, can keep up with the already publicly available GPT 4 — marketing aside, the published report on Gemini Ultra doesn’t say much more than that. An AI is not a gasoline engine. You cannot simply quantify its performance on a scale and then claim that a single-digit percentage difference is evidence of one’s superiority over the other. I am not an expert in quantitative evaluation of AI, but ultimately AI is statistical learning, and in my experience the new generative language models do not always produce reproducible results (especially when generating images). Accordingly, shouldn’t the significance level of the measured performance differences be specified? Couldn’t these rather small differences just be statistical noise in favor of Gemini? Also, the results given are not reproducible because we cannot test Gemini Ultra. And again, if Gemini Ultra is so superior, why can’t we just try it? So has Alphabet lost its edge? I don’t know, but with every statement without a tangible product, my doubts about the company’s superiority grow.

And let’s not forget the giant behind [OpenAI with a 49% stake: Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/30/microsoft-join-openai-board-altman), which has a product ecosystem that literally screams for AI implementations. And I’m not just talking about Word, which will soon be writing for us, PowerPoint, which will magically put together our next presentation, or Excel, which will soon be giving no one a headache: Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are widely used integrated development environments (IDEs) and industry standards. Microsoft’s code-generating bot, Github Copilot, has been available as a plug-in since 2021. So if AI is going to have a real impact on business productivity and therefore our economies, it could be through the infrastructure that Microsoft provides. So even if Gemini Ultra beats GPT4 in many ways and OpenAI cannot deliver a better AI in the near future, Microsoft is providing the services where AI could become a real productivity driver.

And what will Alphabet have left if it loses this AI battle? People use its cash cow, Google Search, today largely because they’ve been used to it for two decades — that’s worth a lot, but maybe Bing can slay even that metaphorical dragon with the magic of OpenAI, unaware of its often-called unbeatable dominance\[...\]""",Has Alphabet Lost Its Edge?,18gwlrv,1702415716.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18gwlrv/has_alphabet_lost_its_edge/,

"The idea I have is to utilize prior day option data, especially IV, volume, and prior price change to project next days price change. The concept is that the high option liquidity influences the price more than the NAV on a day change and idiosyncratic risk is diversified away. I could go further back, and start tuning hyperparamters as I progress. I incorporate rolling 75th and 25th percentiles for the data to give a sense of where the IV, Price, Volume, etc. is relative to trailing periods. 

I did Markov chains with data by putting data into bins, such as price up, price down, and flat, and it was garbage accuracy on back test. I then did a regression and it worked better. Back testing the accuracy is hard with lots of bias areas, but I don't have the resources to back test the trades 100% other than closing prices, as the data is somewhat difficult to obtain closing option prices historically for years for free.

I mainly only care if it's up or down, because I figure I can capitalize on that. I'm still trying to figure out if 0DTE ATM in the direction that my model is pointing me too, or do a 40-60 day option ATM with the same characteristics to not let Theta influence the trades. Alternatively, I just buy or short the stock. Since I switched to regression, I may leverage on higher percent price change predictions. I'd close out at end of the market close and open the next day.


Anyone else have any thoughts or is doing something similar? The medallion fund gives me hope there's a way to obtain returns somehow on data modeling, but I'm just a guy who likes to code and trade.

The previously announced (and now abandoned) sub-IPO of the company's IoT business does not actually eliminate the congolermerate discount applied to BlackBerry as a whole. On top of this, it paints a picture that any IoT growth will be offset by the lackluster performance of the Cybersecurity parent business. If the Cybersecurity business no longer needs capital and can profitably grow on its own, then it's a no brainer to fully separate the two businesses and individually showcase them to the market to maximize shareholder value.

"Hello Readers, 

MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.

To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.

During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. 

Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. 

Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. 

First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.  

Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. 

Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. 

My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. 

Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. 

As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. 

Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. 

Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. 

By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.

Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. 

For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. 

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.

"Greetings, esteemed regards. Allow me to present a thorough examination of Boeing’s current landscape, incorporating both its technological advancements and a prospective breakthrough in the Chinese market.

Commencing with the technological front, check out Boeing’s foray into unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) the [MQ-28](https://www.boeing.com/defense/MQ-28/) demonstrates a pivotal stride in drone fighters. Think drone swarms but for dogfights. Additionally, the [MQ-25](https://www.boeing.com/defense/mq25/) Stingray serves as more versatile extension of the KC-46. The collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, spearheaded by the U.S. Air Force’s interest in procuring 1,000 such units starting in 2024, underscores Boeing’s ascendancy in this evolving field. On the celestial stage, Boeing’s X-37B spaceplane, poised for its seventh mission on [Monday](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/spacex-delays-launch-secret-space-force-mission.amp) via a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, showcases the company’s prowess in cutting-edge aerospace initiatives. This technological prowess aligns with the strategic goals of the United States Space Force (USSF), further solidifying Boeing’s position in this high-stakes arena.

Recently the [Dubai Airshow](https://apnews.com/article/dubai-air-show-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-d2ca068f0c88592c60eb9f11737baa46) emerged as a pivotal juncture. Despite poor performance in recent years, Boeing experienced a resurgence in success, notably outperforming Airbus in new orders. This triumph underscores Boeing’s resilience and market presence. Notwithstanding Boeing’s delivery challenges post-Covid, the sustained influx of buy signals and pressure reinforces market confidence.

Now, onto the most elusive catalyst, this involves [China](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-shares-take-off-report-that-china-may-lift-737-freeze-bumper-dubai-orders-2023-11-13/). Historically strained relations and a freeze on Boeing activities since a 2017 [incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735) set a challenging backdrop. However, recent geopolitical shifts, particularly surrounding the APEC summit where Joe and Xi kissed, may hint at a potential thaw in relations. Notably, speculation arose from a Reuters story suggesting a correlation between APEC and Boeing. This speculation gained credence as institutional players bolstered buy ratings. Delving deeper into this narrative, I found [Boeing Zhoushan](http://www.boeingzhoushan.com/en/aboutUs/), and a [link](https://m.liepin.com/company/9640689/) to Chinese job listings for manufacturing engineers. Finally after a month of edging this gets dropped. Could it be? Lettuce hope.

Before you go busting my balls just ask yourself: Why chad firms (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays GFY) maintain [buy](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ba/analystestimates) ratings from $235 - $270? Why suddenly 46 aircraft deliveries in [November](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-delivers-46-narrowbody-737s-november-sources-2023-12-05/) after such a slump of a year?

"I stumbled upon an intriguing development with MBIA (ticker symbol MBI), where they declared a substantial dividend distribution of $8 per share. At the time of the announcement, the stock was trading slightly above $7. This news triggered a significant surge, pushing the stock to close at over $13 on Friday.  
Let's first understand MBIA's current situation. The company has ceased generating new business and is essentially waiting for existing insurance policies to expire. Consequently, MBIA is currently devoid of income and profit.   
However, the crux of the matter lies in the substantial cash reserves the company holds, currently held by a subsidiary called National. While its balance sheet may show a significant amount of debt, it's crucial to recognize that a significant portion of this debt belongs to MBIA CORP, a subsidiary. There is a legal structure in place ensuring that the parent company, MBIA INC, does not bear any financial responsibility for MBIA Corp. If you remove the debt held by MBIA CORP, the true book value per share is estimated to be in the range of $24-27.  
It's common for investors to anticipate a post-dividend dip in stock value equal to the distributed amount. However, at its current price, it does not seem rational that the stock would trade lower than the price previous to the announcement. If anything, the management's capability to unlock substantial cash reserves, particularly from National, serves as a catalyst for future financial opportunities.  
In essence, the announcement of a significant cash dividend of $8 by MBIA presents a compelling opportunity in this unique situation.",MBI - MBIA $8 Dividend Special Situation,18fixju,1702258162.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18fixju/mbi_mbia_8_dividend_special_situation/,

"TLDR: It has better specs than competitors, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast. 

Ford has had the lightning, Rivian the RT1, and GM technically sells the Hummer but we won’t be including that for obvious reasons. And then there’s CT, the truck everyone on Reddit hates. Although CT is actually the better vehicle in most cases or at the very least comparable. 

**Specs**

Range: RT1 wins by ~15 miles, while Ford is far behind. 

Towing cap: RT1 and CT tie

Rivian and Tesla are pretty neck and neck for most “truck specs” like towing, torque, HP. But Tesla has a larger bed capacity at 2,500lbs vs Rivians 1,760lbs. 

Price: There are no outliers, all have comparable price options. Ford has the lowest priced option, but it has far lower specs than what we’re comparing. 

Cargo: CT wins by 20% given it comes stock with a lockable bed. But it has comparable storage without the bed. It also has the longest bed by almost 6 inches but it’s also the skinniest by 2in. 

Ground clearance: CT wins, Ford is a low rider with almost 10in less than CT. 

CT has better battery efficiency, but the RT1 is extremely aerodynamic. The RT1 is top of the list for aero and overall efficiency. 

Top speed, HP, Bidirectional, are all comparable. Ford being the worst in most cases. 

**CT has many other features that the other two don’t** and they’re cooler than the RT1 gear tunnel. Steer by wire, is not new tech but it’s new to trucks and iirc is only in a handful of vehicles. Reviews are glowing and the industry has been wanting to switch for a while. 

Rear wheel steering, makes the turning radius of CT smaller than the model S. it also helps with merging on highways. 

*800 volt* architecture. This isn’t a new thing but it’s not common and is very important. It means lower current, less wires, more efficient and lighter vehicle. It also means faster charging. The industry has wanted to do this for a while too but hasn’t. Many will follow. This is part of the reason why CT is lighter than both competitors while being covered in steel. 

Also a 48v system vs 12v like most vehicles. This shares similar benefits as above. 

Although it’s kind of a meme, CT also has an extended battery option that sits in the front of the bed similar to a tool box. It’s actually a great deal in terms of onboard battery storage and adds over 100miles of range iirc. Great if you would normally use the truck for its onboard power. 

It’s hardened, scratch proof, and lack of paint will make it great for working conditions. Plus now tesla can’t fuck up your paint on delivery. No more rock chips and you probably won’t ever have to replace any windows, no more smash-n-grabs. 

Infotainment screen in the back seat for passengers. And the largest screen on the market in the front. 

This is somewhat subjective but Fords software and general UI/UX is arguably well below Tesla and Rivian standards. 

Rivian and Tesla both come equipped with advanced cruise control systems. I don’t know much about Rivians capabilities. 

**DD**

I’m sure I’m missing things. But based on specs, the Cybertruck is the better truck. **The issue is the way it looks.** As we’ve seen on Reddit, everyone thinks it looks terrible. Personally I love the way it looks. 

I’m not going to speculate and try and guess how many people might be turned off enough by its looks to not buy it. But we can assume that Tesla will be able to produce a lot of them. Castings are not new to Tesla, these are much larger but even if they’re able to ramp at a fraction of the speed of model Y ramp in Shanghai they’ll be making far more than 100k/year soon. Tesla has said it is possible to hit 250k in two years. 

GM isint in this conversation because they can’t make anything with a battery, Ford only made 15k last year and rivian made 25k. Both companies are losing a massive amount of money on every sale. 

Tesla did say they’d sell CT at a loss if needed, which would imply Tesla isn’t in a loss yet. But given all the new tech I find it a little hard to believe they’re making much on the $80k trim. They’d most likely lose money selling their low trim currently, which would explain why they aren’t selling it. 

With all that said, I strongly believe the CT will be the best selling EV truck rather soon. And will remain there until another more traditional company matches Teslas production.

There’s also a good chance opinions change around its look once more are on roads and other manufacturers make more “radical” looking cars. If this happens there’s little reason to think the CT won’t be a top seller within EV trucks longterm. 

Overall I always thought CT would be great for the company and stock, and after seeing its spec I still feel the same way.

Sure you have models with billions of parameters. But how are companies going to monetize it? Who will be the end user for these AI models?

Example being iphone vs Android - maybe android has lots of new shiny features which the iphone doesn't but who cares. Majority of ppl are not ready to adopt android as the daily phones. Another example being Google vs chatgpt - yes chatgpt might be the new shiny thing which can answer your questions but since the popularity of internet google has been the go to tool for ppl. I think apple is playing this smartly by not heavily investing in something which isn't proven to significantly increase their revenue.

**News and Strategy**

* 10-Year Partnership with ESPN/Disney for ESPN Bets platform (Just launched last month; app has been #1-2 in Sports category since) 
   * Sold Barstool back to Dave Portnoy for a loss in order to pursue ESPN/Disney deal. 
   * Daddy Disney has said many times recently that they see sports as the third pillar of their business. 
* Completed acquisition of theScore in 2021-2022 for market share in Canada (is this a real place?); has reportedly been doing well since and was likely the blueprint for the ESPN deal 
* Official Sports Betting partner of the NHL announced last week 
* NC and VT legalized online sports gambling this year (28 states now) 
* Operates 43 casinos in 20 states; Sports betting in 17 states 

PENN has been building out a casino, online betting, and media flywheel for cross promotion and low marketing costs. They continue to open new regional casinos and have that as a strong foundation to build on. During their announcements with ESPN they mentioned that they will be able to integrate betting crossovers directly into ESPN's media and Fantasy Football apps allowing users to start bets from those apps, carry the slip to ESPN Bet, and finalize there. Their goal is friction-less betting originating from ESPN's massive media audiences.

**Financials**

* Interactive Segment (sportsbook) Revenues climbed 216%, 257%, and 53% from 2019-2022 respectively. 
   * It currently makes up for 10.36% of their total revenue ($663M of $6.401B) in 2022 **prior to launching ESPN Bet.** 
   * Barstool seemed like a failure, but was still able to assist in this growth. I anticipate pairing with a trusted, more professional (sorry Dave) name like ESPN will speed this growth even more. 
* Interactive EBITDAR grew at 221%, -195%, -111.58% (over the same period) respectively. 
   * Due to losses on the Barstool deal, lack of marketing during transition to ESPN, ramping of hiring, and promotional bets. 
   * CEO Jay Snowden in Q3 Earnings call said ""we anticipate accumulated EBITDA losses of Interactive of approximately $300 million... you should expect those to occur mostly in year 1 and year 2, with year 3 inflecting to breakeven or modestly positive EBITDA."" Luckily they have their casino business to back these losses unlike Draftkings and FanDuel. 
* Jay continued to say, ""So there's a lot of that ramping, that has gone into the third quarter result... but we don't have any of the benefits yet of ESPN BET launch. So that's why you see the loss there"" 
   * Sounds like short term pain for long term gain. Market seems to be pricing only short term pain. 
   * Based on ESPN's reach alone compared to, frankly, any other sports company in the country (they are the #1 sports media brand in the nation) their revenue with these cross promotions should no doubt grow quickly over the next few quarters, with EBITDA benefits coming later. 
* They are continuing to purchase more of their own shares in large buybacks ($750M at the call), which gives me even more confidence. 

**Valuation and Comps**

* See below for a matrix of similar competition to PENN including online competitors like DraftKings and FanDuel, and more traditional operators like MGM and Caesars. (Confidence row is an internal adjustment, yes I have reckless optimism...) 
   * Side note, but how tf is Draftkings such a high market cap considering the massive losses they continue to post with marketing spend??
* **They are currently the 2nd smallest market cap** of the 9 even though they have the 3rd largest Net Income, 3rd largest EBITDA, and 4th largest Revenues. 
* Based on 2022 annual Revenues, EBITDA and Net Income and the current Market Cap of these companies, they are trading at an average of 2.7x, 10.41x, and 23.89x respectively. PENN is trading at 0.56x, 2.38x. and 16.08x respectively. 
   * That is 4.84x, 4.4x, and 1.49x higher than PENN respectively. Apply those multiples to the share price and you would get PENN at $115.86, $105.29, $35.56. Even with a huge safety margin PENN is seemingly massively undervalued. 
   * Even excluding some of the outliers PENN is trading so much lower than its competition. 
* **Short Interest in PENN is 12.47%** of Shares Outstanding, 2.83x the average of its competition and 2.11x the next highest in the field (DraftKings). 
* **None of these numbers include added revenue from the ESPN deal yet** since they have not had a quarterly or yearly report since its launch. I think now is a time to buy the stock before that all gets priced in. 

In conclusion, they have created this flywheel of their 3 businesses: casinos, online betting, media. I feel as though even just their deal with ESPN Bet alone would make for a large growth opportunity over the next 10 years, but to add it on top of an existing foundation of their casino business is the icing on the cake. They showed strong revenue growth in their Interactive segment even as the Barstool experiment failed, and have strong margins compared to DKNG and FLTR for online sports betting considering the reach they get from the ESPN integration and in-house tech stack with theScore acquisition.

Someone who's qualified, go look at this stock and tell me if I am crazy.

"As with most IPOs, ARM is overvalued as fuck. Share lockup expires on 3.12.24, and a lot of regards here are waiting until then to buy puts. They will miss out on **HUGE** gains. The play is: ~~FDs~~ **OTM puts expiring 12/15**. I will explain why in this post:

(Skip to end for TL;DR if you can't read -- this is long)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Fundamentals**

ARM has not mooned **40%** from its lows because of its fundamentals.

PE Ratio: 172.4

Forward PE: 66.3 - Over 2.5x NVDAs FW PE.

Forward PS: 21.6 -- This one is especially regarded.

Price/Book - 14.4

A rudimentary look into their numbers shows that the company is probably overvalued by 60-70%. High margin tech companies (which ARM is not) have a trailing Price/Sales of around 6-7. I'd expect that it will probably dump under $25/share by the end of 2024, at MINIMUM. Because things get even worse from here.

Most IPOs have prospects of incredible growth, which shrouds their suspect fundamentals. ARM doesn't have that luxury, as it is oversaturated in many of its markets -- and unable to significantly expand in others.

""We have maintained market share in the mobile applications processor market of greater than 99% for many years"". They can't grow in the smartphone market, and the industry itself is not projected to grow much in the near future. 

""Our market share in the IoT and embedded chip market has grown from 58.4% as of December 31, 2020 to 64.5% as of December 31, 2022"". Growth, but not the type of growth you look for at a P/B over 14.

""Our market share in the cloud compute market has grown from 7.2% as of December 31, 2020 to 10.1% as of December 31, 2022"". They have potential to expand more in this market, but they aren't projecting that they'll be able to do so. 

\^ All from their F-1. 

Because ARMs chips are traditionally more efficient and thus have less power than Intel's x86 architecture, they don't have the current ability to expand in these more lucrative markets that require beefier processors. They already completely control the market in smartphones -- which would be good for them, **if they actually made money off it:**

[Apple makes up less than 5% of Arm's revenue, and Arm can't do anything about it - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/29/apple-arm-licensing-revenue/) 

Some highlights:

""Despite Apple’s reliance on Arm as the instruction set for iPhone chips, **Arm earns less than 5% of its annual revenue from Apple**.""

""Apple pays Arm “**less than 30 cents per device** for the right to use Arm-based chips in the hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches it sells each year""

""At one point, Son called Apple CEO Tim Cook to tell him Arm would be raising prices for all its major smartphone and chip customers. **Cook’s team reassured him that Arm couldn’t raise fees, because the companies’ contract at the time lasted through 2028**. Son backed off. Since then, Apple and Arm have been through several rounds of negotiations that have kept the financial terms of Apple’s deal largely in place, people familiar with the matter said."" 

Yep, that's Masayoshi Son, trying to fuck up yet another company. 

ARM's business model is DOGSHIT. They make miniscule amounts off of incredibly lucrative technology, AND THEY CAN'T CHANGE THAT. They have no leverage, because all of their deals are already in place. *And here's the kicker:*

**""In the meantime, Apple has explored the long-term possibility of using a competing technology in the chips for its devices, according to one former Apple employee.""**

They are talking about **RISC-V** \-- the OPEN-SOURCE architecture BASED OFF ARM (Advanced **RISC** Machines) architecture. ""RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses"" (Wikipedia). 

In simple terms: ARM is a monopoly, but in the future (think 8-15 years) they will be **DISPLACED BY ROYALTY FREE OPEN-SOURCE LICENSING.** Why the fuck would you want to own this company long term, when they will become irrelevant in a decade? This is a ticking time bomb.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Gy-na**

I'll keep this part more succinct. ARM DOESN'T OWN ARM China, from which they get **25%** **of their revenue**:  [Arm's China relationship complicates IPO | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/arms-china-relationship-complicates-ipo-2023-08-22/) 

Highlights:

**""Arm itself holds an effective interest of only 4.8% in Arm China.""**

""Arm said in its filings that ""in the past, **we have received late payments** from Arm China and have **had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China**.""""

""24% of revenue came from Arm China in the fiscal year ended March 31, but **40% of accounts receivable were attributed to China**, meaning **Arm has still not been paid** for all products sold in China.""

So, ARM China is a separate entity despite the name, and they only pay ARM when they feel like it. ARM literally has to pay debt collectors to fly over and get ARM China to fork over money. **What happens when ARM China decides that they don't want to pay at all?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Timing**

I hope I've established that ARM is a complete dumpster fire. But this could go higher short-term, right? Why am I saying that the stock will dump this specific week?

The Oompa Loompas on stocktwits are disgustingly bullish on this stock. They had been waiting for yesterday -- a breakout above the closing price on IPO day -- as an entry point (despite the fact that there has already been a substantial move up). Well, how did they enter? 

[Huge call volume coincided with 8&amp;#37; pump on 12\/8](https://preview.redd.it/8fx24f6uhc5c1.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fbd787ba00b9cdb505e4bce030e9e05a9533e5)

I'll tell you how: they all bought calls **expiring this week**. In fact, that alone is likely what caused the breakout, as options sellers had to hedge against these morons piling in. 

As we all know, options are a zero-sum game. You regards especially know full well that options sellers usually come out on top -- why not take their side for once? Now that dumb money has all jumped into the same boat, they'll sink it. 

There are a couple technical lines of interest. The support at $61 (closing price on 9/15) is support. That will break. There's another at $60, and that may hold for this week. But if it fails, this is drilling to $55 -- a long term resistance before the initial breakout, which is conveniently also max pain.

(Additionally, I expect the broader market to fall this week due to FOMC / dot plot not showing as many cuts as the market wants / Hawkish Powell. This is a nice way to combine two theses.)

[Fun with Crayons: First exit under $61, but $55 is possible.](https://preview.redd.it/xm3zqcs6lc5c1.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5329aa8bd85735f628a314d34957268f62bf1a64)

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Strategy**

I have 12.15 64Ps, as well as 4.19.24 65Ps in anticipation for the longer-term dump. 

The way to play this is to target any strike (or combination) from 65 to 60, doesn't really matter which. I honestly think that the 50s are possible, but this stock has a really fucking high beta and it could have a dead cat bounce -- so you should sell some when it breaks $61. 

Buying at open is the best strategy, as this thing has been making its daily move in the first hour(s) of the day recently. However, I also wouldn't be surprised if it goes sideways/up on Monday/Tuesday, so there's potential to just wait until Tuesday close to buy. CPI fuckery is what I'm specifically worried about. Wednesday through Friday should be blood red, so getting in before then is crucial for maximizing returns.

"TL;DR: The high valuations of AI-related companies have a positive impact on their fundamentals. A feedback loop emerges in which higher stock values further improve company fundamentals, which in turn justify higher valuations. George Soros called this reflexivity. In addition, AI is spreading across all industries. This will eventually make it difficult to identify a sector-specific bubble.

The full text can be found [here (Medium)](https://chaotropy.medium.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed-c652441fbd9f) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed/).

""As George Soros explained in his 1987 book “The Alchemy of Finance”, stock prices are not just a passive reflection of fundamentals: The current AI buzz is likely to strengthen the fundamentals of the companies involved.So anyone who expects AI stock prices to become bluntly disconnected from fundamentals in the coming months or years, until valuations become so stretched that the bubble has to burst, is likely to be wrong, in my view. The current hype around the wonders of AI will have an impact on the fundamentals of the companies involved. In almost every industry, AI is being touted as the solution to many, if not all, problems. Significant investments are being made that are driving the revenues and ultimately earnings of the companies that provide AI services, operate servers, build servers, and produce computer chips. This growth will continue to drive the valuations of these AI-related companies (i.e. investors will be willing to buy the stocks at higher price-earnings ratios). Obviously higher stock market valuations allow companies to raise more money for fewer shares in seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Much more subtle, however, a positive feedback loop is emerging between higher stock market valuations and the fundamentals of these companies; George Soros called this phenomenon reflexivity. Higher stock market valuations allow companies to offer attractive stock-based compensation to employees, reducing labor costs and boosting profits, which in turn translates into lower price-earnings ratios that justifies higher stock market valuations. The companies at the forefront of a technological revolution will also become more attractive as employers and will be able to recruit the brightest minds, possibly at lower salaries. Although it should play a minor role, loans may also become cheaper for the fast-growing participants in the AI market. Lower interest rates ultimately lead to higher profits. Because all of these effects affect fundamentals, a bubble may not be visible to investors at some point.

At the same time the AI sector will expand horizontally and proliferate into all other industries, making it difficult to isolate a single sector bubble. New technology will create new problems, which in turn will be solved by new technology: Server operators, for example, are already groaning at the enormous power costs of running the new language models. One solution may be to use analog chips that can perform the matrix computations that underlie AI in a [much more power-efficient way](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5). As you can see, the focus may shift to sub-developments within the larger trend.

I started trading while in college during COVID, turning what was just originally a few thousand into about $300K over two years by going on margin long and short on COVID-affected industries like airlines, cruise ships, shopping malls, pharmaceuticals, and some tech stocks like Zoom, and then of course riding meme stocks up and down until my brokers restricted trading meme stocks and I turned to options, blowing my then-$300K account in about a week. Undeterred and having developed a firm passion (or addiction), I’ve been reading dozens of books and experimenting with a variety of strategies, from making careful entries and exits to idiotic YOLO impulse moves, from gut feelings to careful analyses. I do a little of them all now, though the regarded and emotional (revenge) YOLO moves keep doing me in, usually at times when I’m convinced I’m right and the market is (temporarily) wrong about something and I just start impulsively buying instead of exiting with moderate losses. This mistake wiped me out two months ago on an oversized bet on BABA calls after I first gained recognition here for making $5K a day (and then $10K and later $20K a day; maybe should’ve stuck with $5K). The very same sort of mistake happened again Thursday when I saw Uber, after entering the S&amp;P, showing overbought signals on the RSI and Stochastic lines and a bearish MACD crossover, and triggering my experimental tools for double top, rising wedge, and head and shoulders patterns on several time frames, all while the price impulsively raged higher as if to test my hubris. Who knows, the signals may have been right and it may drop next week as if to spite me, but as John Maynard Keynes once said, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” Truth.

Friday was rough, no doubt. I was awake at 4:30 AM watching premarket activity, and things were looking good for my expiring UBER puts after the jobs report triggered bearish initial reactions, but everything reversed upward as soon as the market opened, and I didn’t have time to get out. There were about 10 seconds right at 9:30 when my puts were up, but I doubt there was enough liquidity to sell everything, and I froze as the prices rose with renewed ([baby boomers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/N5TUUBAEzh)) buying. I have a few big takeaways that came with the pain, including the advice people here gave me to move to Robin Hood to avoid fees on large volume options trades, even as I’ll be probably staying away from such trades for a little while. The good news (good at least for everyone’s ongoing entertainment and for r/thetagang’s loyal business) is that I do still enjoy trading immensely (or am pleasantly addicted to it); moreover, I’m lucky to have a Wendy’s job that pays me well enough to continue funding my education and (gambling) habit. My upcoming year-end Wendy’s bonus is also usually quite large, and I think everyone can guess what I’m going to be doing with it, though I promised myself to break it up into several trades and space out my moves. Furthermore, since there seems to be a bit of interest in following my struggles and triumphs, I may go make a new Reddit account completely devoted to trading. Feel free to DM me for the details or to help me pick a username that’s not randomly generated by Reddit like this one is. Also looking into Discord, if anyone has suggestions of channels to join or ideas for creating a new one.

Going forward, my strategy will be evolving over time and hopefully will eventually become less YOLO and more stable and analytical. But in the meantime, I’m still going to be continuing many high risk / high reward moves while developing and refining my techniques. You’re welcome to bet against me that I won’t change and will keep blowing up my account; time will tell. Assuming I do improve my ways, the goal would be to become consistently profitable through hedging and risk management and continue to refine the quantitative techniques. Some may ask me at this point why I don’t just try to go work at a hedge fund. And actually, some Wall Street firms, including Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, and Citadel, do actively recruit students and alumni from research programs I’ve been to; those programs were how I had a chance to [meet Jerome Powell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z65h5e/9_days_ago_i_quoted_milton_friedman_to_j_powell/) and ask him [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ylinlf/what_should_i_try_to_ask_jerome_powell_if_i_have/) you all suggested (see the last photo I attached from when I was sitting in that meeting). However, I’m not so sure I’d like the culture working at one of those places (they’re covered a bit in the new book Going Infinite about SBF, as well as some of Michael Lewis’s other books I’ve been reading), and a lot of people consider them evil, so I’d rather do my own self-directed trading for now with paychecks from the Wendy’s I know, as opposed to the one I don’t. I just hope this won’t become my villain origin story.

Besides working on decisiveness to take gains and cut losses and more self-control with the impulse revenge buying, I’m planning to start automating the entering and exiting of trades more in order to remove the human error element (alongside some automated risk management), as well as potentially incorporating some machine learning techniques while I learn them in my part-time masters degrees in math and computer science. There are a lot of interesting differential equations and probability theory ideas that come into play with derivatives trading and hedging, and I’ve been reading about the origins of statistical arbitrage strategies in mathematician and hedge fund manager Edward Thorp’s autobiography, A Man for all Markets. While the inefficiencies his fund was exploiting at the time are no longer as viable since everyone started to understand them, I’m certain there are other opportunities in today’s markets that can be found with enough research and experimentation. I had taken a break from reading his books a few weeks ago when my trades started making lots of money again, but I think I should get back to them now. I also realize WSB is just a bunch of regards hanging out behind a Wendy’s and not an official exchange for rigorous academic discourse, but I see enough insights here to stick around for the interesting discussions alongside the insults, memes, and regrets. So once again, feel free to comment or DM if you’re interested with suggestions for Discord or ideas for a new username, or whatever compliments or insults you want to throw at me. Always the best compliments and insults, of course, are when the market tells us we’re right or rubs it in when we’re wrong; “the market is always right.” Happy trading!","$10K to $100K and then blew it all on a single trade twice in two months.

I want to talk about why we should consider selling and shorting Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) stock. The stonk has been on a wild ride, but it's time to face the facts. The company's financials are looking like a weakend shitpost, with an EPS (TTM) of -$3.90 and a net margin (TTM) of -68.05%. It's like holding a bag of flaming tendies.

I know some of you might be thinking about holding on to the stock with diamond hands, but let's not forget that we only live once (YOLO). It's time to make some smart moves and bet against BYND. The short interest in BYND stock is at 27.87M as of November 15, 2023, with 45.81% of the float shorted. The bears are circling, and it's not looking good for the stonk

So, let's not be the bagholders in this game. It's all about making those sweet, sweet tendies, and BYND might not be the way to get them. We need to focus on the fundamentals and make informed decisions based on the company's financials. Don't be a weakend shitpost, and sell and short BYND.

With Augmedix and Google Cloud entering a partnership with healthcare giant HCA to bring ambient clinical documentation to acute care settings are we seeing the beginning of larger growth and ultimately a great opportunity for share holders? HCA is known to run lean and strengthen their financial resiliency plans year over year. 

HCA was one of the few healthcare corporations to turn COVID into a financial success and it seems they have learned how to execute on efficiency while having a focus on mitigating challenges for time management within their workforce.

Beyond the evident financial success from Augmedix itself, it appears that HCA is utilizing this specifically in the ER and if successful there is opportunity to roll it out in other clinical spaces throughout their hospital systems.

"The first is all about the number 4607. That’s the S&amp;P 500’s intraday high for the year, hit in late July. At just under 4600, the index is currently up about 19% for the year, but every time it nears the intraday high, sellers come in to knock it lower. If sellers keep coming in near this level, it could eventually cause a wave of additional selling.

Here’s how that works: The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has dropped to 13 from a multi-month peak of about 22 in late October. A high VIX indicates that investor uncertainty about future earnings and how to value stocks is cresting. A low VIX means the market is becoming more confident, and often coincides with an increasingly expensive stock market. Any measure of risk to the economy and profits could cause the market to drop. When the VIX enters a year under 14, as it could in the new year, the average return for the S&amp;P 500 by the six months ended in June is down 6.9%, according to Wells Fargo. 

What could drive such a drop? Not getting the one thing the market currently expects: rate cuts. The fed-funds futures market is currently reflecting a 47% chance of a rate cut in March as the rate of inflation has aggressively declined from its peak last year. But inflation is still above the Fed’s 2% target, and the Fed may not be able to cut so soon. If it does, rates across the board might drop, fueling more economic demand, and keeping inflation above the target, a potential outcome like that only provides more reason for another rate hike or two. ",4 Things That Could Cause Stocks to Plunge,18e3lhy,1702089843.0,https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-rate-cut-stocks-plunge-f7acc23b,
"Nonfarm payroll employment increased at a 1.6% annualized pace in the past three months, with about 199,000 jobs added in November 2023. While the second and third quarters saw a slower growth rate than the first quarter’s 2.2% rate, this was in line with the 1.7% average annual growth from 2015 through 2019.

Given that the unemployment rate has fully recovered to about 3.5%-4.0% since peaking at 14.7% in April 2020, the remaining shortfall in employment is due purely to lower labor force participation—that is, more people choosing to remove themselves from the workforce.

We expect that widespread job availability and healthy wage growth will draw marginal participants back into the workforce (that is, people who are available to work but aren’t actively job-hunting).

"Xponential Fitness (XPOF) owns many workout studios including Club Pilates, Pure Barre, Rumble, Stretch Lab, and more. 

Bloomberg wrote how Xponential and it's CEO Anthony Geisler misled franchisees about the upfront capital investment and return on cash. 

They mention short seller ""Fuzzy Panda"" released a report in June that said more than 50% of Xponential's studios were unprofitable.

Stock is down \~20% on the news.

I’ve done this before, making large gains without much capital, but never with such a little amount to start and getting such a large profit in such a short span of time.

I used futures options, and ran both sides of calls and puts. I called it quits as this is enough to pay off high interest debt and all the dental work required due to medication I take for a rare autoimmune disease.

I was feeling pretty down before today, I was slowly working my way out of debt (I’d bailed myself out with trading before, but was too scared as if I lost too much I’d be in a situation where my income wasn’t enough to save me). I’d caught COVID which put me out of a job I just started and my other part-time job I had prior. Plus, some asshole stole my dog’s special fucking vet food and medication. I’m debating buying another box from Chewy and filling it with stink spray in a hope the jackass steals the box again.

Anyways, good luck and hope everyone has a good trading day.

### The Bull Run: A Retrospective

The current bull market has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our community has witnessed and participated in events that will likely be discussed in financial textbooks for years to come. However, it's essential to recognize that markets move in cycles, and prolonged periods of bullish sentiment are often followed by corrections.

### Signs of a Shifting Tide

Several indicators suggest that we might be approaching a turning point:

1. **Inflation Concerns:** Persistent concerns about inflation have led to increased scrutiny from both investors and the Federal Reserve. If inflation continues to rise, it could prompt central banks to adopt more hawkish stances, potentially impacting market dynamics.
2. **Economic Data:** Keep an eye on economic indicators such as employment numbers, GDP growth, and consumer spending. Signs of a slowing economy could contribute to a shift in market sentiment.
3. **Valuation Metrics:** Elevated valuations across various sectors have raised questions about the sustainability of current stock prices. Investors may become more risk-averse as valuations reach historically high levels.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

As responsible investors, it's crucial to have a plan in place for navigating potential bear markets:

1. **Diversification:** Consider diversifying your portfolio to reduce risk. A well-balanced mix of assets can help cushion the impact of a downturn in any particular sector.
2. **Risk Management:** Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Implement stop-loss orders and set realistic profit-taking goals to protect your gains.
3. **Research and Due Diligence:** Stay informed about market conditions and the performance of your investments. Thorough research can help you make informed decisions and identify potential warning signs.

### Conclusion

While the prospect of a bear market may seem daunting, it's essential to approach it with a strategic mindset. By staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, and implementing risk management strategies, you can position yourself to weather market fluctuations successfully.

Remember, this is not financial advice but rather a call for thoughtful consideration and preparation. As a community, let's continue to support and share insights that empower us all to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market.",Navigating the Shadows: Anticipating the Onset of a Bear Market,18dkkar,1702033786.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18dkkar/navigating_the_shadows_anticipating_the_onset_of/,

**Why NIO is undervalued.**

A lot of people take a look at the daily or weekly chart and go back to the beginning of NIO’s IPO and see that the stock rose to about 60 bucks and then dropped all the way down to the price today which is about 8 bucks.

I’d like to point out a few things that maybe haven’t been considered or given the right amount of weight when evaluating NIO and its potential growth.

Here’s my case as to why I believe NIO is undervalued. I will keep it simple and only focus on the biggest pieces that I believe make NIO a unique business with a long successful lifespan ahead of it.

**\*\*I spared you all the pain of reading hundreds of details about each point. I simply think a mention of the feature would be easier to digest on a quick read.\*\***

1. NIO has a clear and achievable vision.
   1. NIO’s vision focuses around sustainability. They place a lot of focus on this and it shows in their business model and actions. For example, NIO doesn’t have a dealership network. They sell their cars via an app. The interior of their cars include recycled water bottles and they are also involved with green initiatives in the Sanjiangyuan area. Furthermore, they are a member of the UNGC - The United Nations Global Compact.
2. NIO’s research and development has already paid off and will continue to do so.
   1. NIO developed the ability to swap out a depleted car battery in under 3 minutes. This is something that Tesla has not either considered doing or been able to do.
   2. The cars NIO has developed are not only stylish, but technologically advanced. They feature AI assistance integrated in the dashboard along with state of the art exterior sensors that enable AI driving.
   3. NIO’s cars offer not only one or two drive modes, but nine.
3. Ultimately, NIO has a diverse pool of talent spanning all over the world.
   1. NIO has R&amp;D departments in Silicon Valley, Beijing, Copenhagen, and many more places. NIO’s talent spans across the globe and because of this, the company benefits greatly from differing perspectives and cultures.
   2. This is NIO’s biggest strength. Any problem that may arise will have an opportunity to be solved as there are multiple kinds of people from very different backgrounds tackling the issue.

**So what is NIO considering doing now to improve their business model and ultimately their profits?**

NIO is thinking about a spin-off. They are playing with the idea of separating their money-losing battery business into its own entity to better their financial situation. This would be amazing. Other companies have done this too. McDonalds created Chipotle. Ebay spun off PayPal after they bought it. Other big companies have done the same.

NIO’s cars are priced to sell. The average price for their cars is from 25k to 45k which is amazing when you look at the features and the specs of these cars. They are absolutely beautiful cars and are priced very reasonably. In my opinion, Teslas are outdated in comparison.

I know that NIO hasn’t been profitable BUT, NIO is a new company that literally just started nine years ago. It is a very young, innovative, and refreshing company that has so much potential I can’t wait to see where it goes.

As for me, I can’t wait to see NIO in the U.S where I am convinced it will be received with very positive reviews. Lucid Motors is extremely expensive, Rivian is also expensive and poorly designed, and Tesla has yet to demonstrate any innovation or production ability.

So let me finish this off by summarizing and stating why NIO is undervalued.

NIO is a great company with a clear vision that is focused on providing modern, beautiful, technologically advanced AI intelligent cars to everyone, not just the wealthy.

NIO’s stock price has hit the floor and is now showing signs of a bull run. It has grown +10% in the last week! How is nobody seeing this??? At its current price of $7.85 NIO is a steal.

I’m bullish on NIO. I’ll be betting on NIO for the next few years. Wish me luck!

"Degens.......Where are my bears at?! I am watching this bum on CNBC talking about SPY @ 520 in early to mid '24. I think he has too many dollar signs in his eyes and is literally blinded by the green in his account. I think the FED is going to be forced to cut rates early-mid '24. Below is my pro con for a TLT play and I want your thoughts.  


PROs for TLT

\-FED rate is likely to decrease in '24 due to slowing of economy

\-'24 is an election year. Markets are always touchy

\-Business loans are more expensive to refi vs the last 2 years. More coming to maturity.

\-Spy seems extended based on the last 2-3 years of a bull run since covid

\-Inverted yield curve has always predicted a recession. FED will lower rates to stimulate economy.

\-Volume on TLT is interesting. Seems to be showing smart money interest/inflows

\-Pending housing sales are very low. Cost of money is too high for many borrowers. Housing prices are declining.

\-Credit card debt is at ATH. Delinquency rates are rising. Along with other personal loans. Especially car loans.

\-TLT appears to be bouncing and heading towards EMA. My play below should still be profitable even if TLT doesnt move much to the upside.

\-Not a PRO for TLT but a PRO for long term options play. VIX is low. Long term options are relatively cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

CONs for TLT

\-FED keeps rates high and the economy keeps flying. Debt keeps rising and people could give two shits about their personal/business financials.

\-No one wants to buy treasuries anymore because the US has too much debt. No one wants to be a bag holder.

&amp;#x200B;

  
THE PLAY

So the theta gang doesn't eat my ass out I am going far out.

&amp;#x200B;

BUY TO OPEN TLT 16 JAN 26 CALLS @ 100 STRIKE  


If VIX normalizes I am still green with a lateral move

Plan to close around July '24 maybe early September prior to election unless FED raises rates more than a .5% in early '24

"Appreciate everyone here who was rooting for me. It’s certainly been a wild ride. For those new here, I YOLOd my life savings of 38k into META calls on Tuesday that expire this Friday. I ended up selling my META calls yesterday for a 10k loss, then like a true regard YOLOd the rest into 🕹️🛑 options that became near worthless overnight.  I currently have only 5k left from the original 38k. To make things worse, I woke up from my sleepless night to see that META rocketed this morning and if I had just held one more day I would’ve been up to 140k at today’s peak.

After that crazy YOLO went as bad as it possibly could, I want to reiterate that I’ll be alright financially - yes I lost like 90% of my life savings but I have no debt and some money in my checking account to live on while I’m working part-time and even a bit to cover any emergencies. I am only 20 years old and I still got time to set myself up financially (because of my ACT score I got a full ride to a private University so I don’t have any student loans. And yes, just because I’m academically smart doesn’t mean I’m financially smart as you all can see 😆).

I’ve always considered myself a workaholic and I almost never spend any money on things that I don’t need, so I amassed that money doing various jobs like fast food, food delivery, and internships whenever I had free time throughout my teenage years (saying this because some people were assuming this was my parents’ money). It’s time to save up again and move on past this loss. I’m obviously not doing the greatest mentally but a few people have reached out which I really appreciate and I know it’ll get better. Also, I think it’s important to note that I YOLOd the money with the mentally to take full responsibility and accept the loss no matter how severe. I’ve always wanted to do something crazy and illogical and decided to just go for it. We only get one shot at life, why not do something insane? When I’m 80 I know I’ll look back at this thinking of how much of an idiot I was but at the same time kind of glad that I wanted to do something so insane and had the balls to just go for it. You only live once, right? I hope this makes people feel better about their losses, and serves as a warning to those considering doing something as stupid as I did. Long live feta, and FUCK META ✌️

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.

The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732786907971539235) (formerly Twitter) that he should be ""fired immediately"" and that Walt Disney himself is ""turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.""

Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta](https://www.nmag.gov/attorney-general-raul-torrez-files-lawsuit-against-meta-platforms-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-and-human-trafficking/) and its CEO — and longtime Musk rival — Mark Zuckerberg.

The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were ""not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,"" according to AG Raúl Torrez.

One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-companies-drop-ads-x-twitter-antisemitism-elon-musk-2023-11) after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11).

Musk [chimed in](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732773421610606801) (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): ""Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy.""

When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: ""He should be fired immediately.""

He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: ""truth.""

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: [""Go fuck yourself.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-advertises-get-lost-twitter-dealbook-summit2023-11)

At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.

""Is that clear?"" Musk asked. ""I hope it is. Hey, Bob.""

Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.

""We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) or SpaceX or now X,"" Iger said.

Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.

""By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,"" Iger said.

Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11) over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the ""absolute truth."" Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it ""foolish.""

Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years. The billionaire has publicly dissed several major figures and companies, including [Apple ](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-war-with-apple-history-of-criticism-2022-11)and [President Joe Biden.](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-elon-musk-feud-tesla-union-republican-06-2022)","Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately'",18d1ifi,1701972401.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18d1ifi/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_says_he/,

,Is CAVA “dumping” this month?!?,18d0h3f,1701969538.0,https://i.redd.it/bdf4j3a9pw4c1.jpeg,
"Below is my personal thesis based on my own research. And I do research… all the time… perhaps too much.

**1.** **OVERVIEW &amp; CATALYST**

CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA) owns and operates a chain of around 280 Mediterranean restaurants. The company offers salads, dips, spreads, toppings, and dressings. It sells its products through whole food markets and grocery stores. The company also provides online food ordering services. Cava Group, Inc. was founded in 2006 and is based in Washington, DC.

The company had a successful IPO in mid-June of 2023. Shares opened at $42 apiece on the NYSE, nearly double the IPO price of $22. Cava sold about 14.4 million shares in the offering, raising around $318 million.

However, the IPO Lockup Period Expiration is happening next week (12/12/2023), where a huge amount of insider shares will become available to trade on a thinly (recently averaging 1-1.3M shares/day) traded stock. Year-end tax benefits or not, no one wants to hold the bag as many early investors are likely to realize a relatively quick profit (initial pre-IPO shares were sold for $19-$20/share or cheaper).

Every time I was involved in situations where the individual/institutional investors would have to “HODL” their shares/coins, it never worked, not even once. Everything gets dumped the second it becomes possible.

As more investors try to realize their profits and there are minimal number of buyers, the stock might enter a free fall for a while. Also, other institutions would want to come in at a much lower level, so they will not interfere for a while. Eventually the stock will find its floor, but I expect it to be at much lower price point, possibly at $8-$12 range. I specifically chosen the Jan 19th puts to give this play some “breathing” room.

**2.** **VALUATION**

IMO, by every measure the company is currently is overvalued. With the last quarter revenue of $175.55 million and negative net income, the company’s current free float valuation stands at over $4B with a P/E ratio of over 460! CAVA is expected to have about $850M of revenue in 2024 with about 9% EBITDA margins, but only 1.5% net income margins, which at best would make it a $1B company and that is everything goes perfect by the end of next year, which again would equate to about $9/share (in the future).

As initial IPO hype has dies down, the stock (peaking at around $58/share) seems to continuously trend down (similar to Sweetgreen Inc., which started IPO at around $53/share a couple of years ago and got all the way down to $6.50/share, before recovering to a current $10.50/share). Ironically, Sweetgreen ($SG) was founded in 2007 also in Washington, DC.

The trajectory repeating Chipotle’s success stock-wise, even long-term is unlikely for multiple reasons (including Product &amp; Competition section below).

Portfolio managers at Artal Group, T. Rowe Price, Swan Hospitality, Revolution Growth, Capital International Investors or all other major $CAVA shareholders (as well as company principals) that control tens of millions of shares in total should trip over each other to offload at least a portion of their holdings (as I am sure, like me they see the stock dwindling down to sub-$10 price range). This can create a temporary death spiral and bring the price down very quickly.

**3.** **PRODUCT &amp; COMPETITION**

I have personally been a Carnivore now for several months. I am down 48lbs (and counting) and feeling much better than before. I have studied the Carnivore diet in great detail every day for the past 7 months, listened to hundreds of lectures and read thousands of testimonials. It is blatantly clear to me that I have been eating completely wrong my whole life and there’s an overwhelming amount of data to show that Carnivore (or at least Ketovore) is the way to eat. I am continuously sharing my research with my family and closest friends, but I do “meat” (couldn’t help myself) lots of resistance – it’s a process.

As the Carnivore movement gains more and more popularity, I expect a major shift from plant- based “healthy” choices to animal product outlets, restaurants and chains. Please check out thousands of video lectures and interviews on YT of Drs. Anthony Chaffee, Shawn Baker, Ken Berry and many others and see for yourself. This could be one of the most important decisions for you and your family.

That said, I source, grind, grill and season all of my meat and fish myself to ensure the hyper-optimal quality of my nutrition. However, when travelling I occasionally buy meat-based dishes at Chipotle, QDOBA, Shake Shack, McDonalds, Burger King, Chick-fil-A and other food chains and restaurants. I would strip out all the carbs and vegetables and consume just the meat/fish. While that’s not ideal, it suffices once in a while and most Carnivores would agree with me. And by once in a while, I mean once or twice per month out of 60 (or so) meals.

I’ve looked into CAVA’s menu and found nothing that any Carnivore would find appropriate for human consumption, let alone anything being “healthy”. While some dishes do contain chicken, typically birds are considered barely above eating cardboard in the Carnivore world, as they are typically kept in horrible conditions, fed absolute (often GMO) garbage (including cuts of other birds), and don’t have multiple stomachs (e.g. cows) to process their own (modified) food properly. So, technically it’s still considered meat, but it carries very marginal nutritional value. All other items include carbs (converts to sugar), sugar (feeds cancers) and vegetables (thousands of various low-grade toxins), none of which our ancestors ate in any significant quantities.

So, while other chains and restaurants are not particularly great by any stretch of imagination either, at least you can find meats and fish there (if you must eat out), while CAVA would be my least favorite choice. I’ve read many reviews and people’s reactions are mixed between the price and quality of CAVA’s food (seemingly more negative than positive). Like many other places they are fighting an uphill battle. Rebranding to a radically opposite diet would not work well either.

Furthermore, there are other chains out there with somewhat similar offerings on top of hundreds of thousands of general restaurants on every corner. Their prices are not particularly great and margins are quite thin, like with most restaurants.

**4.** **CONCLUSION**

I expect a bloodbath in the next few weeks. The stock already started to crack. “Don't sugar coat it, Taj” (Van Wilder, 2002) seems an appropriate quote here.

Questions and comments are welcomed.

"AstraZeneca has introduced Evinova, a new health-tech business focused on speeding up innovation in the life sciences sector and enhancing clinical trials to provide better health outcomes and a more positive patient experience.

Also, as far as I know, AstraZeneca made a deal with Pfizer, led by Alexion, and they're also working on improving platforms and technologies with wide applications in therapy (they say that this opens up new opportunities for Pfizer in the gene direction btw).

Moreover, according to stats, things were going pretty well for Alexion — it made it to the list of the top five companies with the best returns.

Also, Alexion resolved its longstanding lawsuit over its illegal sales strategy and is now [paying a $125M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/alexion-shareholder-settlement) to its old investors.

[Buffet Recently spent a lot of money on homebuilder shares.](https://preview.redd.it/eyvo7xjs3w4c1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52ee410bb0a5e7cf6a9e5d886bc55a22419f6a6)

[Housing Market Crash 2024: Did Warren Buffett Read the Signals Wrong?](https://investorplace.com/2023/10/housing-market-crash-2024-did-warren-buffett-read-the-signals-wrong/)

&amp;#x200B;

[In what looks like a momentum move, Berkshire picked up quite a few shares in homebuilder DHI, Dr. Horton Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/q8w2xgqm4w4c1.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6440a89d529ecea4138068929d2dd0619c7b883a)

Was this a rare short-term play for Buffett? He tends to hold his positions for an average of 7 years. He could actually make some money on this play in the short-term, due to the recent EOY rally. BUT, DHI has rallied before.

&amp;#x200B;

[DHI didn't fare to well last time the housing market cooled off.](https://preview.redd.it/wy21jrtu5w4c1.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3d7a4a54526d9175da5058939a64b5fb6554e24)

The housing market is showing quite a few signs of cooling off since Berkshire Hathaway finished purchasing their DHI shares in Q2. Shortly after they opened their position, mortgage interest rates spiked nearly 150 basis points, and new home sales began to falter. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Home sales trend downward since average mortgage rate peaks at nearly 8&amp;#37;. Analysts expected 725,000 home sales in October, but their estimates missed by 7&amp;#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/sm16ksmm7w4c1.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b316f50a50cc4f6e0e555c92f77840a4e6782559)

&amp;#x200B;

[Prices have simply gotten too high.](https://preview.redd.it/6vfowa8x9w4c1.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f318e932ddc1a99f8d2788f94b62d52163283411)

The dip in existing home sales is one of the most blatant warnings of a housing market crash. New home sales have enjoyed a small bump, but as the market cools, it will trend downward. People are simply no longer willing to pay the current asking prices.

&amp;#x200B;

[Perhaps Buffet saw the relatively low valuation metrics as a buy signal.](https://preview.redd.it/4t2rrgyicw4c1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db2482a72f0281fa2f2332882b719133a670066)

Compared to many stocks these days, DHI shows conservatives metrics as far as PE and PB ratio. But then again, it always has. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Perhaps investors are overestimating the buying power of Millennials.](https://preview.redd.it/6wxtbakjdw4c1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b5ac48e202762a22e6bfd437daf4376690e4472)

The average age of homebuyers continues to rise, as younger folks are continually priced out of homes. The average age of homebuyers in 2021 was 33, jumping to 36 in 2022. Millennials are struggling with mountains of insurmountable debt due to student loans and credit cards. They also have the lowest credit score and history of any age group, which will make it difficult to accrue additional debt.

**Closing remarks**

With high interest rates here to stay, incredibly high prices, and eroding Millennial creditworthiness, the housing market is going to crash... HORRIBLY. Be prepared for homebuilder stocks to drop over 80% as younger folks ditch mortgages and look to rent or live with parents.

"**GOOGLE**I have been very bullish on Google given MSFT stock performance but for some reason the market has been lagging. MSFT has been driven up, up and up based on Sam Altman, Open AI, GPT, and AI, AI, AI. The Bing supposedly takeover of Google Search was a FIASCO, won't happen.

Google's Deep Mind is another level. Not a generative text bullshitting your prompts. Google is the only actor that has been serious on AI since 2015. Now they are proving to you - have you seen the Gemini AI release? [Google launches its largest and ‘most capable’ AI model, Gemini](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/google-launches-its-largest-and-most-capable-ai-model-gemini.html)

Google should be trading in the 160$ range by now - But it's ok, market is lagging.

Ignore AI, google without AI is the best tech business you can buy.

**AMD**

Just anounced: [Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMD’s new AI chip as an alternative to Nvidia’s](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/meta-and-microsoft-to-buy-amds-new-ai-chip-as-alternative-to-nvidia.html)

It is a matter of time that NVIDIA loses its momentum. It was nice to see a 1200% YoY revenue growth - that's really impresive. But... AMD and other actors want a piece of that cake, NVIDIA won't be able to eat it alone for longer. Chip buyers are already feeling the supply shortage or overprice in their pockets so they are looking for alternatives. AMD is the next best player known, right?

AMD hasn't rallied like NVIDIA. It is still trading as pre-AI thing.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the 2 most clear companies that you can buy at a fair to cheap valuation. I am not touching MSFT, nor NVIDIA, nor APPLE at this valuation. Either AMZN, AMD or GOOGL run a 2x from current level or the other 3 mentioned have a correction of 30% to 40%.

WTF do I know.  I get my market insights from the FinViz sidebar comments.  Did some hard screen switching back and forth from my Schwab app and an investopedia article about cup and handles and have come to my own conclusions.     

I do know that [William J. O’Neil](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp) defined the cup and handle (C&amp;H) pattern in his 1988 classic, *How to Make Money in Stocks*    

Anyway, I know Ishbia’s personal money machine has had mixed returns for bag handlers and holders alike.  Sitting at the $7 bounce line right now.  Just throttle purring ready to get jacked to the tits.  More tension in this puppy than a new OP after posting to pinnacle4. 

With rates going down and stupid people with money and people hungry for houses, house-heavy hedgies going through customary recession-proofing, I’m going bullish on this cup and handle.      

Bullish on the RSI.  Super bullish knocking 80 rsi in the last few dividend cycles, and the forming handle on the last pic in 15m candles shows it trending on the 40.  Purple rsi chart has period based on the dividend cycle, about as purple as my nips from all the absent-minded twisting I’ve been giving them while waiting on the screens to load.

"Not sure what the politics policy is on wsb but I promise this is important to stonks.

With the war in Gaza going on, the Houthi’s have been launching missiles in the Red Sea to stop ships from going through the Mediterranean. This has caused ships to have to go all the way around Africa to get to their destinations.

With that, freight costs are expected to hit $10,000 when they’re usually around $2000. That’s a 5x difference. One of the biggest reasons for inflation was the supply chain issue. If you compare shipping rates and CPI, you’ll see they follow closely. If shipping costs go up, so does inflation.

Now, it’s not quite up to the $20,000 that it cost during COVID, but if the Houthis continue to launch missiles at ships and prolong this conflict, it could continue to keep inflation high. Ultimately the federal reserve might be forced to keep rates higher or even raise them again if inflation starts to creep upwards due to shipping costs. The federal funds futures market still seems too optimistic and hasn’t priced this in.

On the other hand, it’s possible the supply chain disruption won’t last long if the military can intercept Houthis missiles. What do you regards think?

"As we approach the end of the year, I was wondering what word or phrase stands out from the year?

Here are some from me:

• **Soft landing** \- was almost a joke in the sense that it seemed an impossibiltiy. According to many metrics though it seems like this may be the best way of describing the current economic situation. History may show otherwise though, depending on how 2024 pans out.

• **Recession indicator** \- seen numerous posts on this subject (some serious, some not...). For me, the gold standard is the inverted yield curve - and as the recession typically follows after 12-18 months I guess we will find out if it continues to be a successful predictor during 2024. Even the 2019 inversion resulted in a recession - albeit due to Covid - we will never know if a recession would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic though!

• **A.I.** \- throughout the year and especially late spring and early summer. CEOs mentioning it given any opportunity and the resultant boost to the share price. Nvidia becoming a hot topic in conjunction with this.

• **Zero days to expiration** \- continued rise in popularity and news stories about the size of the 0DTE options market.

• **Pivot.** When will it happen and why will it happen... this year (no), next year (maybe)? A cut in interest rates because a soft landing enables a boost to growth without worrying too much about inflation; or a cut in interest rates due to a recession - to get the economy going again.

Finally, I would like to wish everyone on WSB happy holidays and best wishes for 2024.",Your word or phrase of the year?,18omp2m,1703272835.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18omp2m/your_word_or_phrase_of_the_year/,
"So, I had some drinks a few nights ago and decided to do some Due Diligence Under the Influence and ended up going down the rabbit hole of looking over BABA. I’ve made money from them years ago, but have never felt comfortable taking a strong position in them even though their financials always seem decent. Anyways, I left myself a note in my phone with some rough figures focusing mainly on comparing their financials and site traffic to their competitors. 

Has anyone else taken this approach before? I don’t remember what all sites Crown &amp; Coke me sourced this data from, so I’m not sure how accurate it is. I do believe it was all mostly from the same source though so should possibly be comparable. I’ve tried this before quite a while ago and came to basically the same conclusion. 

BABA seems to outperform other ecommerce sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy in revenue per visit in spite of having higher bounce rates along with the majority of their consumer base being from countries with much lower median annual incomes than their competitors. 

Maybe there’s a flaw in my reasoning or figures, but the last time I did this it convinced me that maybe I should put my money elsewhere and considering how the stock has performed since then I’m glad I did. The PE is tempting, but my instinct says leave this alone completely and don’t bother with taking either side of the trade.

"Tried making this post in January when MARA was at $6. Downvoted to oblivion, laughed and ridiculed with no actual discussion. Then deleted by automod because the market cap was too low. Now the stock is up 300%+ so I’ll give it another shot.

If you are bullish on Bitcoin, or even if you aren’t but acknowledge that a Bitcoin ETF will significantly increase crypto traffic, then Bitcoin mining companies have been, and are going to continue to go exponential. Even now, looking at how much they’ve run this year it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed out, but let me put it in perspective:

During the last run in November 2021, Bitcoin topped out at ~$60,000. $MARA peaked at a market cap of $7.5B, held 7,600 Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and 3.2 Exahash of compute power. Note that I use market cap for most of the Bitcoin miner comparisons as these companies prefer to hold their mined BTC on their balance sheets and fund purchases with dilution. If you believe Bitcoin price will go up over time, this is a great strategy, but it also means comparing historical stock prices isn’t accurate, and I’m not here to trick people by ignoring it. I digress.

During the current run, Bitcoin is sitting at ~$44,000. $MARA has a $6B market cap, holds 14,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, and has 23.2 Exahash. 

Read the numbers again: They have SIGNIFICANTLY more mining power (23.2 Exahash/s Nov 2023 vs 3.2 Exahash/s Nov 2021), SIGNIFICANTLY more assets, and Bitcoin is looking like it will reach a new peak sometime in the coming months. 

I’ll be making a proper comparison of the 4 of 5 biggest miners this weekend for anyone who’s interested, as there’s even more bullish data with their mining efficiencies, growth plans, and transaction fee revenues; but I’m personally  convinced these are generational wealth building companies that I’d like others to be made aware of if crypto is something they’re interested in. I’ll say it again: only if crypto is something you’re interested in. If you don’t believe Bitcoin is going up in the future, theres no point buying these companies. It’s easy to see the screenshots of gains that have flooded this sub lately and blindly FOMO in, but it’s a volatile industry and you’ll end up losing a lot of money if you’re not actually familiar with what these companies are, how they operate or how they’re growing.

"Many asked me why I wanted to become a professional trader.

The answer, during interviews, was ranging from being in a more quantitative rather than qualitative role, having skin in the game, working in the balance of money making and personal consciousness, improving the self-ability to deal with risks.

But the answer is that my whole life has been a giant acting drama, where I’ve been interpreting a variety of roles with the purpose of letting others believe what they wanted to. I think I have reached a mostly decent ability in acting and it’s probably the single only skill I’ve ever mastered and possessed since I was a child. 

Hence, back to trading. You can’t fake it in there. The accountability of your results is such that a number can’t be prone to much debate and being right or wrong is not a matter of opinions. 

And I do could tell you that it’s an ever-changing type of role, where your convictions are daily stressed with uncertainty, your ethics are challenged by personal risks, your self-belief is crucial and merged with needed obsession, that you need to get back up and keep going, and ultimately that inaction is equally punished as bad actions, alongside the realization that results are meaningless without efforts, but the reality is just that trading is about outcomes. And the outcome is the only thing that eventually counts.",Trading,18ol03j,1703268281.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ol03j/trading/,

The uranium price is jumping higher based on fundamentals.

There isn't enough uranium available for short term delivery (0 to 12 months), that isn't allocated to an utility yet (uranium consumer), to satisfy all uranium demand for short term delivery.

This imbalance can't be solved in 1 year time.

Add to that the nearing start of uranium restocking by utilities after years of uranium destocking.

"Let's jump into ARKK's dumpster fire and scoop up those stocks left in the dust. We're building a dodgeball team of stock market asthmatic underdogs, scaling them like ARKK, and DCA'ing our way in. Time to ride these underperformers to Valhalla!

\----------

**Constructing an ARKK Underperformer Portfolio:**  
*(Note: ARKK's portfolio originally had 10 underperformers. However, I removed 3 tickers that didn't meet WSB's unofficial market cap threshold of $500MM. If you're interested in a more comprehensive approach, you can include these tickers in your own portfolio. Their weights in the full list of 10 underperformers start from 0.45%, 0.70%, 1.49%, etc., ascending in allocation.)*

**Investment Thesis:** We're betting on the underdogs here, those currently facing headwinds but with the potential for a serious comeback. Think mean reversion - these stocks have been beaten down, but history's shown us what falls hard can bounce back harder.

**Portfolio Allocation:** We align with ARKK's autists, scaling stocks based on their ARKK weights. This isn't just copying homework; it's leveraging their deep-dive research. For instance, ZM and TDOC are big pieces of this puzzle, representing major plays in future communication and health tech.

(*Relative Weight of stock = Total Weight of Underperformers in ARKK / Weight of stock in ARKK*)

**Weighted Allocation (Example with $10k, scale to your wallet's size):**  


|Ticker|Company|Portfolio Allocation ($)|Portfolio Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ZM|Zoom Video Communications|$3,478.04|34.78%|
|TDOC|Teladoc Health Inc|$1,470.89|14.71%|
|NTLA|Intellia Therapeutics Inc|$1,348.31|13.48%|
|DNA|Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings Inc|$1,235.96|12.36%|
|PD|PagerDuty Inc|$1,210.42|12.10%|
|BEAM|Beam Therapeutics Inc|$1,001.02|10.01%|
|VERV|Verve Therapeutics Inc|$255.36|2.55%|

  
**Risk Analysis:** Let's not sugarcoat - these stocks can swing wild. But for the YOLO-hearted, this volatility is where the thrill (and potential tendies) are at.

*(Disclaimer: This is high-stakes speculation, not financial advice. Be smart, DYOR!)*

**TLDR;** We're betting on ARKK's underdogs. High risk, potentially high reward. Is it time for these stocks to shine?

**\*\*So what do you think, apes? Can these underdogs have their day?\*\***

Data Reference: ARKK holdings and YTD returns as of 12/21, with underperformers highlighted. Orange redactions are those 3 tickers under $500MM MC.

Its integration with Apple CarPlay could provide Apple with an efficient and comprehensive way to access a wide range of vehicle data without the need for separate agreements and development with each car manufacturer and OEM.  This integration could mean that CarPlay would not only display content across multiple screens within the vehicle but also tap into the deeper functionalities and diagnostics of the car. Access to data such as engine performance, fuel efficiency, temperature controls, and more, could significantly enhance the user experience, making CarPlay a central hub for both infotainment and vehicle monitoring.

"In the latest denial by the SEC to write new rules which Coinbase requested, the SEC made it clear that their is already an exchange who is coming into compliance with their rules. They did not name it but that exchange is prometheum (https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/21/prometheum-earns-final-regulatory-nod-to-try-hand-at-fully-compliant-crypto/).  They are also creating a new rule in April which will only allow registered entities to act as custodians. 

The SEC will almost certainly not allow an entity which is currently involved in litigation and charged with securites violations to act as the custodian for the new Bitcoin spot ETFs. It is far more likely that in their recent meetings they have advised Blackrock to modify their application to designate Prometheum as their custodian. It also does not make sense to allow $COIN to be the custodian and then pass a new rule 4 months later saying only registered entities can be custodians.

In summary, the SEC has beef with $COIN and is already hinting that Prometheum will be their golden child in the Crypto asset space because they are playing by the SEC's rules.
