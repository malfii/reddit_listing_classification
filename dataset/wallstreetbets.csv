Is it weird that stock index is high but mega stock are not high or did not get the jump. When I look at top companies they did not move. A 3000 point index should have made big companies jump a way higher. So what is moving the index so high? And does it mean after some time small mid size companies

"We know the market runs on psychological levels. AMD retesting $100? You can bet that a bunch of highly regarded degens are slinging fat bids to get in at that $100 psych level. We love nice, round numbers, and it's pretty obvious that most stocks treat big psych levels (i.e. multiples of 50, 100, etc) as important support/resistance levels.

Now combine stocks trading at big psych levels with OTM options, and you're now looking at 10-100x+ potential returns. Examples to understand how:

# Example 1: ORCL vs $100: 15x 😎

ORCL had earnings last week (December 11th). Post earnings it sold off to - you guessed it - the $100 psych level! $100 has been key for ORCL since 2021.

[ORCL vs $100 over the past few trading days. After post ER dump, it found $100 to base off of. Quickly made a move from $100 -\&gt; $105](https://preview.redd.it/fb8qyovj9q7c1.png?width=3144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb7d804065c4e146fbcc89491e503aefa7425b3)

[ORCL 12\/22 $105c chart \(post ER\). Small change in underlying -\&gt; huge change in options.](https://preview.redd.it/u85hb89o9q7c1.png?width=3242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ad0f8e565ee8965d2bf9688b9bc83fc927f4946)

&amp;#x200B;

In that period of time, the ORCL 12/22 $105c moved from $0.14 at the lows last Friday, to $1.90 this Monday. This is nearly a **15x** over 2 trading days, from just a 5% move in the underlying! ORCL consolidated nicely at $100 and post-ER IV crush allowed these contracts to get super nice and cheap.

# Example 2: AVGO vs $900: 1400x 🤯

AVGO has been nothing short of magic. It treated $800, $900, and $1000 all as perfect support/resistance levels. AVGO also recently had ER on 12/7, during which it sold off to $900. Now with IV crush in place, and with a sprinkle of good news ([partnerships](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AVGO/caltech-and-broadcom-announce-quantum-research-and-development-jcv126kwus8b.html), PT upgrades), it launched off $900.

[AVGO vs $800, $900, $1000](https://preview.redd.it/35761b2r9q7c1.png?width=3306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3f04a0e3eeabf22fd64080109a365ef125a6528)

&amp;#x200B;

[AVGO 12\/15 $1050c](https://preview.redd.it/4fjde080aq7c1.png?width=3316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498c77ad91e881c03f3b8c8f959d8a21298727bf)

AVGO 12/15 $1050c made a move from $.05 -&gt; $70 in just days. 1400x 🤯 What really enabled this to amplify was that the IV crush post-ER turned these contracts into pennies. That coupled with the fact that AVGO is a very high dollar stock, which enables out of the money (OTM) contracts to quickly become many dollars in the money (ITM) with a small % move in the stock.

**Tiny % changes in underlying can result in HUGE changes in options for high dollar stocks.**

# Why high dollar stocks?

These kinds of gains are very hard to find in small dollar stocks. The reason is simple: with high dollar stocks, a small % move in underlying can turn penny contracts into deep ITM multi dollar contracts. For low dollar stocks, unless your underlying sees massive moves (think 50%+ move in underlying), these returns just aren't possible. On these low dollar stocks, a penny contract very rarely turns into multi-dollar because this requires the contract to go many bucks ITM. I.e. you'll need a very large % change in the underlying.

As mentioned above, for high dollar stocks, all you need is a small % move in underlying to get penny contracts into multi buck contracts.

# Takeaways

1. Big psychological levels tend to present significant trading opportunities
2. **Options on high dollar stocks trading at these big psych levels can result in HUGE returns.** Penny contracts can quickly become multi-dollar contracts as they go in the money. This is not something you find often with small dollar stocks.
3. Post ER, options contracts face an IV crush. This presents significant opportunities if the underlying consolidates at a psych level. **Cheap contracts =&gt; amplified returns**.

&amp;#x200B;

So fellow degens, in short, **options** on **high dollar** stocks at **big** **psych Levels** = **magic 🧙**",🧙Unlocking 100x Returns: The Power Big Psych Levels and Options on High Dollar Stocks,18nzu7t,1703199455.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nzu7t/unlocking_100x_returns_the_power_big_psych_levels/,

"Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is a technical analysis indicator that measures the amount of money flowing into and out of a stock over a specified period. It was developed by Marc Chaikin, a former stockbroker and analyst, in the 1980s. CMF is based on the concept of Money Flow Volume, which is the product of the Money Flow Multiplier and the volume for each period.

The Money Flow Multiplier is a value between -1 and +1 that indicates how close the closing price is to the high or low of the period. The closer the closing price is to the high, the more positive the multiplier. The closer the closing price is to the low, the more negative the multiplier. The multiplier is zero when the closing price is exactly in the middle of the high-low range.

The CMF is calculated by summing the Money Flow Volume for a given number of periods (usually 20 or 21) and dividing it by the sum of the volume for the same number of periods. The result is a value between -1 and +1 that oscillates around the zero line. A positive CMF indicates that more money is flowing into the stock than out of it, which implies buying pressure and bullish sentiment. A negative CMF indicates that more money is flowing out of the stock than into it, which implies selling pressure and bearish sentiment.   

## Why is CMF important for traders?

CMF is an important indicator for traders because it can help them identify trends, signals, and opportunities in the market. CMF can also confirm or contradict the price action of the stock, which can provide valuable insights into the strength and direction of the movement.

Here are some ways that traders can use CMF to enhance their trading performance:

* **Trend identification**: Traders can use CMF to identify the prevailing trend of the stock by looking at the direction and level of the indicator. A rising CMF above the zero line indicates an uptrend, while a falling CMF below the zero line indicates a downtrend. A CMF that stays above or below the zero line for a long time suggests a strong and persistent trend. A CMF that crosses the zero line frequently suggests a weak or choppy trend.
* **Signal generation**: Traders can use CMF to generate buy and sell signals by looking at the crossover and divergence of the indicator and the price. A bullish crossover occurs when the CMF crosses above the zero line, which indicates a shift from selling pressure to buying pressure. A bearish crossover occurs when the CMF crosses below the zero line, which indicates a shift from buying pressure to selling pressure. A bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower low, but the CMF makes a higher low, which indicates a weakening of the downtrend and a potential reversal. A bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the CMF makes a lower high, which indicates a weakening of the uptrend and a potential reversal.
* **Opportunity detection**: Traders can use CMF to detect opportunities for entry and exit by looking at the overbought and oversold conditions of the indicator and the price. An overbought condition occurs when the CMF reaches an extreme positive value, which indicates a high level of buying pressure and a possible exhaustion of the uptrend. An oversold condition occurs when the CMF reaches an extreme negative value, which indicates a high level of selling pressure and a possible exhaustion of the downtrend. Traders can use these conditions to anticipate a pullback or a reversal and adjust their positions accordingly.

**How does CMF reflect both technicals and fundamentals?**

CMF is a unique indicator that reflects both technicals and fundamentals of a stock. CMF reflects technicals by using the price and volume data of the stock to calculate the Money Flow Volume and the CMF. These values show how much money is flowing into and out of the stock, which indicates the level of interest and activity in the market. CMF also reflects technicals by generating signals and opportunities based on the trend, crossover, divergence, overbought, and oversold conditions of the indicator and the price.

CMF reflects fundamentals by incorporating the closing price of the stock into the Money Flow Multiplier. The closing price is the most important price of the period, as it represents the final consensus of the market participants. The closing price can also reflect the impact of any news, events, or announcements that affect the company or the industry. By using the closing price, CMF captures the effect of the fundamentals on the money flow of the stock. CMF also reflects fundamentals by confirming or contradicting the price action of the stock, which can reveal the underlying strength or weakness of the company.

CMF is a powerful and invaluable indicator that can help traders analyze the money flow of a stock over a specified period. CMF can help traders identify trends, signals, and opportunities in the market, as well as confirm or contradict the price action of the stock. CMF can also reflect both technicals and fundamentals of a stock, which can provide a comprehensive and holistic view of the stock’s behavior. Traders can use CMF to enhance their trading performance and achieve better results.",How to Use Chaikin Money Flow to Trade Like a Boss,18nytk4,1703196714.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nytk4/how_to_use_chaikin_money_flow_to_trade_like_a_boss/,

"People wanted shorter posts, so I'll keep this short. Nike's killing it with strong brand game and high demand. Their Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and solid digital/DTC game are paying off.

Their direct's retail traffic is up, converting browsers to buyers like crazy. Digital sales are hitting record highs thanks to loyal members. The North America, EMEA, and APLA regions are on fire with more traffic, higher conversion, and bigger average orders.

Their own stores and digital platforms are booming across regions. Expect about a 1.2% jump in NIKE Brand revenues to $12.87B, with Direct-to-Consumer growing 2.2% and Wholesale edging up 0.5%.

However, margins are under pressure. Costs are biting into profits, with gross and operating margins taking hits from higher expenses and currency issues. SG&amp;A expenses are up, especially with more spending on marketing and digital transformations.

They're saying gross margin might grow by 100 basis points to 43.9%, but SG&amp;A expenses are also up by 5.8%. Expect a slight dip in operating margin to 11.4% due to these costs.

So the bottom line is, nike is gonna be strong in sales and digital, but cost pressures are a pain point. That being said, I'm gonna grab NKE 12/22 125c for $2.56, but also sell calls at a higher strike price to make it a spread. I can sell the 130c for $1.17, making the cost of the total spread about $139 with a max profit of 260%.

"Disclosure: I own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6/21/2024. Stock is currently trading at 43.98 USD at the time of posting. 

For personal reasons I really wanted to see this company fail after having my Roblox account hacked and losing all my items (valued at $3k in PV) but unfortunately, they are growing and will continue to do so. Roblox isn't just a video game company, they are also a virtual economy, as well as a tech company.

Fundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable, creative, and deep in content than any video game in history. You can play COD, Dead By Daylight (just released by the studio behind FNAF), Roller Coaster Simulators, ELF (video game based on the movie, Tycoon Games, and more. Literally any game you can think of, you can play on this platform. 

The ingenious way they make profit is similar to how Steam does - by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games, clothing, and most importantly limited-release collectibles that appreciate over time. The main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency: Robux. Effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell Robux at their own discretion. This has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time. 

E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora) \- the Sparkle Time Fedora, released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1,730,000 Robux - the equivalent of 2150 CAD today ([https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav](https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav)). As a result many players are buying and holding items, some of which are sold in numbered amounts 1/1000, 1/350, etc, holding their value even in the face of inflation. E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant) released with 400 numbered units, retailing for 17,499 Robux or 220 CAD versus 148 CAD, 180 days ago.

If you take a look at the charts over time, their items tend to only go in one direction, up - which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials. Revenue hit $713.2 million, up 38% year-over-year; Average Daily Active Users (“DAUs”) were 70.2 million, up 20% year-over-year; and hours engaged were 16.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. 

Suffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the Chain Smokers, Lil Naz X, the Weeknd, Disney, Dead by Daylight, and more, they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product.

In terms of liquidity they have 2.1 Billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres, invest in more developers and partnerships, and continue on the path towards profitability.

In the short-term macroeconomic environment, we have the holidays coming up, and if you talk to a lot of parents, kids are going crazy for Roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game. I predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40% if we follow the same pattern last year (28 USD on Dec 30th to 37.75 by Jan 27th).

In the long-term Roblox's technology is insane. They have full software support for VR, a giant user base, and the ability for users/developers to come in and build anything. Not to mention it is lucrative for them as well, as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game. With VR technology becoming cheaper year over year, this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers, businesses, etc. Not a huge metaverse fan in general, but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn't a bad idea.

In short, I think Roblox has a lot of room to grow, with insane potential for growth over the next few years. I'm confident that even in the face of rising inflation (which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year) they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term. Not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive VR world.",Roblox DD - Bullish regrettably…,18nuia3,1703185455.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nuia3/roblox_dd_bullish_regrettably/,

"I know I know ex-SPACs have a bad rap, but BAER  I like the stock.  It's trading at a substantial discount from the ""ipo"".  Soo let's look under the hood for this unique operation.

**Basics:**

Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. provides aerial wildfire management, relief and suppression, and firefighting services to federal and state government agencies in the United States. It offers fire suppression services, such as direct fire suppression aerial firefighting support services for ground crew to drop large amounts of water quickly and directly on wildfires. The company also provides aerial surveillance services, including fire suppression aircraft over an incident and tactical coordination with the incident commander through its manned and unmanned aircraft. It operates an aircraft fleet of 21 planes.

**Numbers:**

Currently trading at $6.50 with TTM P/E of \~16 The average TTM P/E of the Russell 2000 is 27, so from a purely value perspective the company is trading relatively cheap compared to other small caps.   I am not aware of any direct competitors who are listed, so take with a grain of salt.

Assets/Libs:  82% They carry a high debt load, as is common with operations in aviation.  But ultimately have more assets than debt.

Revenue: most recent results net income jumped to 17.4m in Q3 from a -19m loss in Q2 to with a marginal 5%  SGA growth.  Speaks for itself, nice.  They are acquiring revenue and not allowing costs to balloon.

**Growth:**

Wildfires are a ""booming business"" approximately $3.5 billion dollars were spent fighting wildfires during 2022 by the federal government alone.  That's just the federal government... This does not include suppression cost bore by municipal, county, and state fire departments/forestry services. [https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics/suppression-costs](https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics/suppression-costs)

The Bureau of Land Management stated in a report that ""Suppression costs alone are too often incorrectly cited as the “cost of wildfire”. As a result, the vast majority of true costs are ignored from a planning and budgeting perspective. Costs associated with wildfire extend beyond both the acres burned and the days or weeks of the fire event. In many cases, suppression cost figures capture only the immediate costs for the WUI and the wildfire itself.""

They double down in the conclusion stating that the ""Synthesis of case studies in the report reveals a range of total wildfire costs anywhere from **2 to 30 times greater than the reported suppression costs.**""  Bullish, so even the dataset we reviewed earlier is likely a vast under estimation of the total spend on fire suppression by conservatively half. [](https://www.blm.gov/or/districts/roseburg/plans/collab_forestry/files/truecostofwilfire.pdf)

Frankly there are just more fires every year. Per the EPA the number of acreage burned in wildfires has increased by 174,273 acres/year since 1980.  They expect this trend to continue into the future, probably not great for us, but bullish for BAER.

"A few months ago Bill Ackman announced he was short US treasuries, this led to more hedge funds moving into the trade and to a record short position in US Treasuries. Billions of dollars were and still are short US government bonds. Hedge funds anticipated yields to rise past 5%, even Jamie Dimon expected this. Instead the Fed held steady and didn't raise so yields are falling, fast. Now hedge funds are sitting on big losses on their short trade. They're also heavily short stocks as well and we keep going higher, even making new all time highs. Basically they got it wrong in the bond and stock market. I suspect we will see a few hedge funds get margin called and forced to sell off their positions and we will see more days like 12/20, random afternoon sell off as volumes as lower than usual and the positions need to sold so the prices drop fast. 0dte options are also a problem and can accelerate sell offs but this is another story for another day.

"**Introduction:**

In the realm of global commerce, it's not uncommon for seemingly unrelated industries to influence one another. In the world supply chain, as it's implied in the name, geopolitical impacts can heavily shift demand in chain-like reactions. Now it all starts with one player which is the humble pomegranate. As demand for this antioxidant-rich fruit continues to soar, the aviation industry finds itself grappling with the unexpected consequences of pomegranate shipping, amplified by the complex events of geopolitics.

**The Pomegranate Boom:** 

Pomegranates have experienced a surge in popularity due to their health benefits and exotic appeal. According to multiple sources, the pomegranate export industry will see anywhere between 6-10%+ compounded annual growth ([Tracking top exporters](https://www.tridge.com/intelligences/pomegranate/export)). As suppliers seek to meet the global appetite for this ruby-red fruit, a ripple effect is felt in unexpected areas. Pomegranates, being a delicate cargo, require specialized handling and quick transportation to ensure they reach their destination in prime condition. Pomegranates require a storage temperature between 4 and 6°C (39.2-42.8°F for the freedom loving folks) for a maximum of 2-3 months. However, there are cases when longer storage is needed; it requires ten degrees to avoid cold damage. The optimum relative humidity of 90-95% is another crucial factor for pomegranate storage. This demand for swift transport becomes even more critical as geopolitical issues disrupt traditional shipping routes.

Now when it comes traditional shipping, you may think of trucks for ""last-mile"" deliveries to grocery stores, freight rail, and cargo ships. However trucking does not carry the vast majority of exports from countries, this comes from long distance rail and shipping. Now comes geopolitical tensions.

**Geopolitical Waves:** 

Now we have all heard of the ongoing multiyear war between Russia and Ukraine, this has halted freight rail going across this vast stretch of land and has closed of it's airspace. There is also the developing issue in the middle east, with an ongoing assault in Gaza. This has dragged in other players in the middle east. This means that for the maritime industry, a traditional player in the transportation of goods, it is now facing challenges due to geopolitical tensions.

[Operation Prosperity Guardian](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/18/us-to-expand-red-sea-defense-as-houthis-disrupt-trade.html)

The U.S. launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, an expansion of its maritime defense force in the Red Sea amid mounting attacks from the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group. These attacks have been directed at commercial vehicles headed through the Suez Canal. Several major companies like BP and Maersk have paused shipping in the Red Sea as danger from Houthi drone strikes escalates. Increased scrutiny and re-routing of shipping routes under Africa have led to delays and uncertainties in the delivery of goods. The US has also joined forces with other maritime powers, for a combined total of 39 countries. When we look at these countries you can also see that nearly half of the top 10 exporters are involved in this conflict. **Canada**, Poland, Chile, **United States**, Serbia, **Netherlands**, **Belgium**, Mexico, China, and Ukraine. In total half of the top ten exports are involved with conflicts, this also doesn't include China who is rumored to join this conflict.

This means one thing for pomegranate suppliers. By seeking reliability and speed, are turning their gaze skyward.

**Airlines to the Rescue:** 
As maritime routes face geopolitical turbulence, airlines emerge as agile alternatives for transporting time-sensitive and perishable cargo like pomegranates. The speed and flexibility of air transport provide a solution to the challenges posed by geopolitical uncertainties, ensuring that the supply chain remains resilient. The geopolitical landscape is reshaping global trade dynamics. Pomegranate suppliers are strategically opting for air transport to bypass the uncertainties associated with maritime routes. This shift not only underlines the adaptability of the aviation industry but also positions airlines as key players in ensuring the steady flow of perishable goods amidst geopolitical waves.

Now when we look at stocks for airlines, they have not recovered to their pre-pandemic highs. Now why is that? Passenger demand has shot up past pre-pandemic levels yet airlines have not seen that growth. Well it's because cargo shipping has declined in the past few years, with growth not expected for the foreseeable future.

['JETS' ETF](https://preview.redd.it/k3my8azs0n7c1.png?width=2424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c80701e48c74728965d39b4f87a0368c0230214)

**Growth is around the corner:** 
With the new geopolitical problems, this forces pomegranate exporters to ship their goods via the air. This will make up for the lack of growth seen in cargo shipments for airlines. The collaboration between pomegranate shipping and airlines is not merely a logistical adaptation but an economic resilience strategy. By embracing air transport in the face of geopolitical challenges, the industry ensures a consistent supply chain, safeguarding jobs and stimulating economic growth.

**Conclusion/TLDR: Explosions are up. Pomegranates are wanted. Now close the f-king door we have pomegranates taking off. 43C UAL 12/22/23.**

**Bullish Case: More pomegranates are being eaten. Interest rates down. Demand up. More flights needed. Oil is cheaper (being enforced by freedom lovers).**

"Hi all,

As I consider buying C3.ai stocks, I'd like to address concerns about the company and hear others' opinions.

Firstly, it's concerning that the company, founded in 2009, has changed its name multiple times from C3 to C3.Energy to C3.IoT and now C3.ai. This suggests a lack of focus on a specific technology, following trends rather a passion.

Another  issue is the inconsistency in the company's financial reporting. They've changed how they define customers, shifting from total companies to divisions within a company, and referring to parent companies as ""customer-entities,"" which could inflate the claimed number of customers.

"Let’s just start with the fact that I don’t know jack from shit … but here is my guess.

The markets were on a heavy and significant bull run, pricing in 3 future rate cuts in 2024 at minimum with a full stop on interest rate increases.

The thing is, we are December and in particular, the end of December, meaning there are a lot of financial advisors, hedge fund managers, MM’s etc. liquidating positions to solidify current gains to then rebalance their portfolios going into the new year.

I am going to assume that this shit is going to be bought right back up by next week or, if the sell off continues, going into the New Year the markets will rebound significantly.


Unless there is a WW3 being announced or some crazy unheard of situation that ensues causing this dump, I believe there is a blessing in disguise for us dégénérâtes (French to make it sound more sophisticated) as there will be a lot of good opportunities for us 0DTE aficionado’s going into the new year, whether that be calls, puts, or both.

As I said, I don’t know shit, but I wouldn’t be surprised SPY test $473 again within the next two or three weeks. Even though we are only December 20, there is technically only like 5 more trading days left in the year, this dump kind of makes sense.

Additionally, this selloff seems very algo/computer driven, meaning these large block selloffs were already pre-meditated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why I am long on Aegon Ltd:

&amp;#x200B;

The all time high for Aegon (AEG) is 62.56 per share in January of 1999. So what happened in the 90s causing this price increase and subsequent drop-off?

 

# [Dutch insurer acquires Transamerica in $9.7 billion deal](https://www.deseret.com/1999/2/18/19430613/dutch-insurer-acquires-transamerica-in-9-7-billion-deal)

&amp;#x200B;

The stock lost a significant amount of value over the next several years following this purchase and again lost even more value after shares were issued to the Dutch State in 2008 to help weather the economic storm.

There was a slight price increase after [AEGON completes repayment to Dutch State](https://br.advfn.com/bolsa-de-valores/lse/AGN/share-news/48068169/aegon-completes-repayment-to-dutch-state) but then the price topped out at 9.50 per share in 2013 before dropping to a low of 1.80 in March 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

In January this year, the company announced [plans to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans](https://www.aegon.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2023/aegon-to-repurchase-shares-for-share-based-compensation-plans) for senior management.

In August this year, CEO Lard Friese stated that [Transamerica performed well. New Life sales increased by 17% compared with the previous year, driven by another strong increase in the number of World Financial Group (WFG) agents, now at a record-high of 70,000. Written sales of mid-sized retirement plans increased almost 70%, driven largely by a pooled plan sale of USD 1.7 billion.](https://www.aegon.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2023/aegon-reports-first-half-2023-results)

&amp;#x200B;

According to [this article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/world-financial-group-already-breaking-records-in-2021-1030508785) from 2021, WFG only had 50,000 agents in 2021. That means they have seen a **40%** **INCREASE** in the number of independent licensed agents working with them since the shift to remote work.

This has resulted in [The company expecting operating capital generation from its units to be around 1.2 billion euros ($1.30 billion) this year, versus a prior target of more than 1 billion.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dutch-insurer-aegon-hikes-capital-generation-target-on-us-strength) The prior target of 1.2 billion was not projected until 2025, meaning they are growing much more than they had anticipated.

Also in November of 2022, Transamerica [Appointed Todd Buchanan President of World Financial Group and Head of Transamerica Financial Advisors](https://www.worldfinancialgroup.com/press-releases/transamerica-appoints-todd-buchanan-president-world-financial-group-and-head) who brings ""more than 25 years of expertise in insurance distribution, digital transformation, retirement, and wealth management leadership to his new roles.""

So all of these factors, along with their ability to now offer stock options to senior management of their rapidly expanding field force in the near future, I see Aegon's price rising A LOT over the next several years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AEG is up 14.76% as of this writing over the past year and 20.06% in just the last 6 months.** 

&amp;#x200B;

When I began looking into this a couple weeks ago, the furthest expiration options available were for July 19, 2024 and you could get a 7.5 call for $5 bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked up some of them and they've already tripled in value but from everything I'm seeing on this company I plan to keep buying more calls as they become available.

"I've made a few posts about the shipping crisis, I made some final buys today to have some diversified exposure. Here's my reasoning for each pick

STNG - they bought back 27% of their shares last year, they do refined products which apparently is basically at max utilization rn as far as shipping is concerned. Something like 10% of worlds refined product goes thru red sea

TNP - trading for less than half of book value and a 3 p/e, this one has half their fleet ""ice breaker rated"". Sailing thru the arctic is faster than around the cape. LNG tanker. They claim that every 1000 usd increase in spot shipping rates = 18 cents more profit. They cite rates of 30-60k a day depending on the ship.

TNK - crude tanker that bought back 10% of their shares last year

ZIM - they do containers, i keep seeing estimates of 20-30% of worlds container ships go thru red sea. Right now there is a glut of container supply so average rate is 1337/container, down from a high of 14000/container in Jan 2022. I think it is evident that demand destruction for containers doesn't occur until significantly higher shipping rates than todays. Out of all of these ZIM is the shittiest co and basically an outright scam but scams always pump the hardest in my experience

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to understand the supply chains more, but until I do I wanted to have diversified exposure to each of these product types - containers, refined product, LNG, crude. It could be that refiners feel the pinch first and so they bid up crude tankers, or that theres a glut of LNG in some ports, so some of these bags might be completely fucked that's why I went with calls coz the one bag that is not fucked could 10x my calls. STNG is by far my largest position because they were already buying back 27% of their float outstanding in last 12 months

Oh yes, reverse a slogan to see a company's true weakness they're trying to patch with a slogan... Apple, Think Different reversed? Well yeah, William Tong's probably coming for you too.

My bet is that most people are not thinking enough to be worried about these lawsuits.  But if they were concerned William Tong had bigger fangs than FAANG, some shares might cascade into lower values... But I don't think even shareholders are that smart to guess this, so the market won't be affected til a couple larger anti-trusts are won by Tong.  I pray William Tong takes down more Big Tech, since they're pushing anti freedom censorship agendas.

"I wrote [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/r9ETwvJrVk) at the end of November. And the stock went up more than 20%, but short interest actually went up from 34% of float to [39%.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOOS/short-interest/) Since then the CEO has done two interviews in December that included business updates. 

[First interview](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-resonates-with-people-canada-goose-ceo-1.2008716?taid=65722b4e9835ea0001dfdde5&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter) includes an update that demand is strong in China. [Second interview](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1737129473001017687?s=19) included a note from the CEO that traffic across all channels is up. To confirm, I went to their Chicago store and nearby stores for North Face, Moncler, etc to compare traffic.. Canada Goose store was the only one that was packed with a line outside. [Video of the line for proof](https://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1733638949707354297?s=19).

The company is about to report their biggest quarter of the year. Analysts expect sales to go up only 7.5% yoy. That's an easy beat given comments from the CEO and that their historical revenue CAGR is much higher than that.

"DocuSign's CEO Allan Thygesen just sold [\~42% of his shares](https://app.stockocean.com/company/docu) yesterday (Dec 19) for $5.7 million.

This is especially interesting given the [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/e-signature-company-docusign-explores-a-deal-1bbbc848) reported last Friday (Dec 15) that Docusign is exploring a sale...

The sale was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan (pre-planned sale) so may have triggered despite (not because of) the announcement.

But the size of the sale is still quite unusual. DOCU stock has risen \~38% over the last month given the recent bull run.

Pure speculation but some potential reasons on Allan's selling of shares:

\- General liquidity needs

\- Lack of confidence in deal going through, realizing profits on recent run up

\- Allan stepping down as CEO

"Hello everyone,

About two months ago I posted about AMR, a metallurgical coal company that I thought was a buy at 225 a share. That position has worked out well! With about a 60% runup in two months.

&amp;#x200B;

[AMR Post Report Stock Performance](https://preview.redd.it/ip36lki9ch7c1.jpg?width=721&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c66b037392ca991ea30c06c85395ca98cc625c)

As such, it may be worth updating the model and seeing what happens. The TLDR is this, the underlying thesis isn't all that different. If met coal prices remain high, then this thing is still ""cheap"" and if they don't, then it isn't.

The model is unchanged from last time, but with two adjustments. First, I assume that AMR makes about 277 million in post tax profits in Q4 2023 and it uses about 260 million of it to buy back shares. The float is now roughly 13million, down from 13.6 million.

When analyze companies using DCFs, I generally take the current price as given, and use that to imply a discount rate aka an expected return. Right now the stock implies about a 37% expected yearly return. My breakeven for a company with this amount of risk would be about 25% returns, or about a 460 per share price.

"Due to Boston's perfomance and recent good news I started wondering whether Boston is worth investing in now, so I did some (kinda) research and have a question for y'all.

Firstly, Boston Scientific recently resolved their scandal case with LOTUS, which was because they said several years ago that their LOTUS device was the best of the best, and so on. But it later turned out that there were serious problems that were not reported, and the device had to be recalled and stopped selling.

This later caused a big drop in the BSX, but they recently resolved it with a [$38M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/boston-scientific-shareholder-settlement), which is obviously good for them.

Boston is also growing steadily over the long term and generally has good dynamics as I see.

However, some say that Enovis will soon take the leading position (already pushing Boston into the top pick list).

"Hello WSB,

I am an expert on this community because I have had literally dozens of accounts on reddit and though I am often unceremoniously removed for BULLSHIT or just lose my access because of BULLSHIT or delete reddit because it's a bunch of BULLSHIT before coming back because I miss the BULLSHIT, I have been observing this community for the past 4 years.

The basic progression of wallstreetbetters are:

1. The young male who doesn't know anything about anything. He is usually in the trades or fresh out of college. He heard about gamestop mooning and thinks he's going to quickly learn how to find great stocks because, well because he's never been fucked over really really hard by the incomprehsible and capricious markets. Usually he'll have diligently saved up what for him is a substantial amount of money maybe $5k or $10k. He will go into the daily thread and ask for some help, ""hey I am going to yolo, what's a sure bet that can't lose money? I saved up $4k and I need it to pay tuition. Also whats a put option? Is that when I put my money on a brokerage and they help me choose what company? Also what's a stock delta? Is that just delta airlines?""

Naturally this guy is going to get absolutely ripped apart. Usually a bunch of you will give him bad advice, tell him to look at YouTube, or try and scam him through a crypto scheme directly in his DMs. Maybe one out of a thousand of you will give him a good pick, and then the rest of you will downvote the one person who actually is providing good info. This guy is on the fast track to becoming the second kind of poster here.

2. The perpetual loser. The rosy glasses get broken when the long dick of the market slaps him in his face. He's humiliated and lost money he couldn't afford. Being that he has more testosterone than neurons, he decides that he's going to get revenge. Most of you fall into this category. He will now ""study"" the markets. That means paying for TA videos and picks from gurus. He will begin sharing his crayon drawings and writing incredibly long DDs based on hunches, random and very old news articles, and a fervent desire to be vindicated. He will scrape together whatever cash he can, maybe from payday loans, maybe from sucking dick, maybe from sucking loans out of a dick. Now he's got the wheels turning. Surely his first big play was ruined by a cabal of pump and dumpers. Rather than fight the tide, he will attempt to pump his own dump. Thus the DD. If he can convince a greater enough volume of bigger idiots that his picks are good, he will singlehandedly create a trend and come out victorious. God help us if he catches lightning and his pick somehow DOES make some money. A single 10x play, even with just a $200 position, will go straight to his head and propel him to the next stage. 

Now normally he will just sort of linger in this category, losing more than he wins and his wins will be modest. If he does get a lucky play, he will turn into stage 3.

3. The expert/genius/guru. The taste of victory will go directly to his ego. He will have $20k in funds which basically means he's a millionaire. He will immediately get a WSB tattoo and lease a Tesla. His posts will lose all humor and perspective. He will gleefully lead newcomers into the briar patch, then mock them for losing their ass. His brain will be permanently modified. And so begins his downfall. At best, he will lose his entire account in one play and meekly fall back into stage 2. At worst, he will continue his inexplicable streak and amass a fortune that will enslave him into gambling addiction.

He will begin acting like he is an insider if he continues winning. He will believe he can move markets through his will alone. That he is clairvoyant. That he was destined for immense wealth and prestige. We will be seeing him put $200k into a 0dte call option with no hedge on an airline, tesla, PLTR, or Kodak. He will lose his ass.

" 

$AMD is set up to take a lot of market share from $NVDA for 2 reasons:

1.Much of of $NVDA ´s moat stems from CUDA, which enables developers to interact with $NVDA GPUs seamlessly when coding.

However, Pytorch has become the dominant framework for deep learning (AI) and now, $AMD GPUs work out of the box on Pytorch.

This opens the veil for $AMD to disrupt $NVDA ´s software moat and levels the playing field.

2. $NVDA ´s chips are monolithic, while $AMD ´s chips are chiplet based. Chiplets have enabled $AMD to disrupt $INTC by yielding high performing but cheap chips.

This is because when you make a chip out of chiplets, if one of the components goes wrong you don´t have to throw the entire thing away. Hence, yields are much higher than in monolithic architectures.

I believe the same is going to happen on the GPU side.

Chiplets have lower margins and so pivoting to this would hurt $NVDA ´s financials: a clear case of the Innovator´s Dilemma. $NVDA has a fantastic business and will hardly find the incentives to disrupt itself moving towards chiplets.

"The MOAC (mother of all catalysts) is upon us with the BTC ETF approval, and this is my XMas gift to you all.


In November, MARA produced 1,187 BTC with a hashrate of 23.1 and an average cost to mine at ~$10,000. As of this post, 1 BTC = $42,848.10. This equates to ~$38M in value per month, or $467M in value per year if we extrapolate the current values. 

Note, they currently have $325,266,000 in long-term debt at 1% interest (fuck yes) with a Dec 2026 maturity date. So let’s bring that into the mix. If we break that down:

$325,266,000 in convertible senior notes at 36 months @ 1% = $9,175,136/m. That revises our estimates to ~$29M/month and ~$357M/year. 

With 222.63M shares outstanding and a PE of 11 (average for oil), that gives us a current value of $17.66/share. MARA closed at $21.97, which suggests this simplified, conservative model is well within the ballpark. So you’re probably asking yourself, how is this a value play?

Well, the MOAC is upon us, and markets should be forward looking. So looking forward:

Conservative estimates for BTC price after the MOAC is $80,000. Further, MARA just today announced plans for an increased exahash capacity of 56% and decreased per coin mining cost of ~30%. If we plug those into our model, we get $74.71/share. 

This isn’t a conclusive model, it’s some glorified napkin math that, as it turns out, get’s us pretty close to today’s price. However, extrapolating given the MOAC and the operational improvements on the roadmap, it’s pretty clear that this stock will reach the $70s in 2024. If BTC explodes into the 6 digit club, we’re closer to $100/share.

"Here’s my take on the soft landing…

The runway has only just come into sight, our pilot is about to attempt his first ever landing (in fact, it’s his first time flying a plane!) and he’s never seen this airport, but it’s known to have an exceptionally short runway where there have been several rather spectacular crashes in the past. There are some storm clouds gathering on the horizon. He comes onto the loudspeaker and announces that he’s feeling great about the coming landing, after all, it’s looking sunny outside. The passengers erupt into applause and start celebrating their safe arrival. Meanwhile, a handful of passengers remain quiet, wondering if they are crazy to be wondering if there’s a chance that things might not go to plan…

Sound absolutely ridiculous? Powell is about to walk a tight rope.

"His Fund was buying right so what could go wrong? 😑 I have no one but myself to blame! 😭
The year was 2021, a time of hope and optimism in the air. I was a young, naive investor starting my journey in financial investing. I devoured every piece of information I could find and listened to anyone with strong opinions about the stock market. I knew to stay away from options trading and day trading. I wanted to do things the right way, the ""get rich slow"" way.

It wasn't long before I came across the legendary Jim Cramer, who had quite the reputation. I read his opinion about an undervalued stock that was trending downward from its all-time high of $308 in July 2021. The stock was currently trading around $191.41. With an open mind and hopeful heart, I started listening to Mr. Cramer himself as he made a case for PayPal to become the most undervalued stock with strong upside potential.

He even mentioned that the charity fund of CNBC had been buying and dollar-cost averaging into this valuable asset, starting at a price point above $191. So, I took a leap of faith and started dollar-cost averaging, buying a little bit at a time over a long period. I believed in the business model. I have used PayPal. I read about their $19 billion revenue in 2021, operating margin of under 18% at the time, and good long term debt.  I started buying in nov 2021. And then it happened. 

what started as weeks of buying turned into months, and months turned into years. The stock kept getting beaten down by tech stock withdrawals (even though it was later reclassified as a financial stock) and further impacted by the SVB bank debacle. The stop kept on crashing 

After years of holding this stock, PayPal finally showed some signs of recovery. However, it hasn't been a great journey. It was filled with missed opportunities and a lot of stress. It's embarrassing and regretful, but someone has to take the first step forward to say it. I am a victim of Jim Cramer's financial assault. I lhave no one to blame but myself and my own naïveté, fuel by strong OPTIMISM about PayPal

Ok so I know that they screwed us a bit with the G@me stuff, but at least they were upfront about it. I see chuckie SWAB and fast Eddie just taking people’s money right and left.

 At least Robinhood is honest about what they are and where their money comes from and how they are making it, so you don’t get surprised. 

Also you won’t get some jerk financial advisor that will sell you out of your stocks and then back into the same ones so that they can earn a commission. 

And they don’t charge you $100 a trade either. 

Robinhood will be the future, and I believe that they are run well, and that we will see them take off. 

Once these boomers age out of their 60/40 split portfolios that yield on average 2-3% after fees from other brokers, we will see the smart money move out of these traditional brokerage firms and into Robinhood in one of the greatest transfers of wealth in history.

"Why is everyone suddenly promoting doomsday theories of imminent collapse and despair?

There’s a few issues people need to understand.

1. The 2008 financial crisis happened due to financial deregulation under Clinton (glass stegal) with banks assuming too much risk. 

For example sub prime lending. Wallstreet institutions taking on risky mortgages that people can’t afford to pay.

The banks are now regulated under the bi partisan Dodd frank act

2. Inflation 

There are parts to inflation that are directly caused by the fed and some the fed can’t control

Fed can control asset prices like buying mortgage back securities 

Fed cannot control consumer prices, and inflation in consumer prices have more to do with supply of goods.

 This however can be controlled by policy makers 
Like adding china to the WTO to export inflation to 3rd world countries. (Slave factories making your iPhone)

The fed can influence the demand of goods by raising and lowering interest rates. But there no guarantee people will act the way the fed expects. 

3.  American exceptionalism 

America has an advantage that other countries don’t.  our technological innovation keeps us ahead of the curb. 

There is no competition with apple 
There is no competition with google 
There is no competition with Microsoft

4. Market cycles 

Markets move in cycles. Markets will usually hit a peak go down and rise up again. There is no need to panic, as knowing this you can profit both ways.

Conclusion.

There is no reason to cite doomsday scenarios as it’s unproductive. The United States is the most powerful country in the world. You don’t become that with idiots running your country. While nothing’s perfect. Be thankful you don’t have to walk 10 miles a day to get water 💧 as some people in the world do.

"Hello, I'm writing this as a follow up to u/nobjos wonderful writeup on the Lindy Effect and it's possibility to create alpha for a well diversified portfolio.

  
The Lindy effect as stated is to invest in companies that have existed for a long time, as it should signal that the future risk of bankruptcy is lowered.

  
For context on portfolio construction please refer to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18jifhs/lindy\_effect\_in\_investing\_i\_analyzed\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18jifhs/lindy_effect_in_investing_i_analyzed_the/)  


I wanted to extend his analysis by doing a Fama French Factor regression on the Lindy Portfolio.  I.e can we explain the returns of a portfolio of Lindy stocks using the returns of other well known equity factors.  Here's the list of equity factors I have chosen.  
Mkt-RF: This is the excess return of the market (over the risk free rate)  
SMB: Small Minus Big, think of this as the relative performance of small stocks vs big stocks  
HML: High minus Low, think of this as the relative performance of high book to price stocks vs low book to price stocks.  
Quality Minus Junk: An AQR Factor, the relative performance of stocks with high quality earnings (positive, high ROE, low earnings volatility etc)  
Betting Against Beta: Another AQR Factor, is the relative performance of high beta stocks vs low beta stocks.  
UMD: Up minus Down, basically a momentum portfolio.  
I ran the regression using daily returns from Jan 1 2010 - October 2023.  
Here are my results!  
Basically, the Lindy Portfolio is exactly what you would think would happen.  It's tilted toward small companies (because it doesn't include megacap tech), high value, high quality, low beta.  The negative tilt on momentum is because I rebalanced the return series daily.

I wouldn't take too much stock in the fact that the constant term is ""zero"" or use that to conclude that the Lindy effect is perfectly explained by the factors.  I didn't include dividends in my timeseries nor did I deal with survivorship bias.

""I'm the guy that's praying for a crash while everybody else is not. We need to get back down to normal, and we need to send a message to central banks,"" he continued. ""This should be a lesson I don't think we'll ever revisit. I don't think we'll ever see a bubble for any of our lifetimes again.""

Dent, who spent the majority of his career analyzing proprietary research, credited his against-the-grain prediction to overvalued markets and excessive stimulus spending. While recent rallies have overwhelmingly provided investors with mild recession expectations, Dent remained firm that an ""everything bubble"" will burst next year.

"Who remembers veve? The sad story of Disney's nft platform

I remember when this came out it was so hyped. No way Disney is dropping NFTs, this surely has to blow up! Featuring a platform full of over printed nfts that can't be transferred. Currency that can't be taken off the platform. And a dead community that is full of people with locked balances because they can't withdraw under the $500 minimum. Honestly surprised this platform didn't get more hate or media attention. 

I deposited 1000 back in October 2021 and after trading and holding mostly, I'm at 200. Which I can't even cash out. I have to get to 500 to cashout past their minimum where they take a 10% fee as well, with other transaction fees. Honestly it's a joke. 

I'm holding two collectibles currently trying to bounce up to 500, the dock ock ultimate animated, and the new Elsa secret rare. I bought these due to the same collection of items containing items valued at around 7000, for the Spiderman ultimate animated. Let's pray this pumps up and I'm able to recoup some of my losses.

But this has me curious, how many users here have money or collectibles locked in the veve platform? This was a pretty big community when it first launched. Is anyone on this sub in a similar situation? Can we legally pump the same collectibles to withdraw or what

This is normal. Market cap weighting naturally takes the mathematical average. Outliers have a high influence on averages. This happens basically every year. 38 stocks doing massively better than the index is very typical.

The Magnificent 7 narrative is a psyop. The financial media sliced up the index in such a way as to make it seem as though 493 stocks all went sideways. In reality there was a huge amount of variance from one stock to the next.

Just the fact that 105 stocks did 25% or better makes it a strong year. 1/5 of the stocks beat typical long run market average returns by more than double.","In 5 min using Schwab's stock screener, I prove that the Magnificent 7 narrative is a bullshit psyop.",18ly1k6,1702978551.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ly1k6/in_5_min_using_schwabs_stock_screener_i_prove/,

"These boneheads reported nearly 100 billion hours watched over a six month period and disclosed all the shows by views last week like a bunch of idiots.

99% of that related to 60 shows all released in 2023 except for a couple WSB favorites like Cocomelon Season 1.

Basically the rest of the 18,000 titles are worthless from a stock perspective. No offense to those that enjoyed Waterworld or The Mask of Zorro. Those are absolute bangers. 

Netflix drops about $17 billion a year on content to keep up this pace and since nobody watches the shit from last year they gotta keep spending for the next 60.

This gives them about $8B in FCF annually  which is about $2B short of what they owe in debt less cash last quarter of $10B.

So they need about 61M net new subs to close that gap. 

Now they claim 100M people were non paid subs they kicked off during the password crackdown and they would get most of those back. Only 9M came back last quarter which is problem number 1.

Problem number 2 is they need to continue to raise prices without losing subs.

Problem number 3 is the churn of the content itself every year at an enormous cost and hitting 60 home run titles a year.

Even with unlimited resources that model is going to crack soon at this ridiculous valuation.

"So first we we recognize that 7 stocks are driving all growth.
Nvidia
Tesla
Meta
Microsoft
Amazon
Apple
Google

And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.

Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money

Risks: 
Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit 

Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.

Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.

Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore.
Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China.
Low risk of either outcome.

Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.

Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.

"For Satori Fund founder Dan Niles, yet another interest rate hike means that “Don’t fight the Fed” has a whole new meaning.

With Fed Chair Jerome Powell declaring that his inflation fight is “unconditional,” Wall Street’s favorite mantra is now a warning to avoid stocks, or at least to take a more conservative approach to investing.

“Don’t fight the Fed, and don’t fight the fundamentals,” Niles told CNBC on Monday, warning investors that any stock market rallies that come amid Fed tightening are nothing but bear market traps for investors.

Niles, who holds a master’s in electrical engineering from Stanford and once worked for Lehman Brothers, has argued since December that investors should hold a large portion of their portfolio in cash, and he repeated that call this week.

“I think for the retail investor that can’t daily trade their portfolio, you’re better off losing, as we’ve said consistently this entire year, 5% to 7% to inflation, rather than potentially 30% to 50% to a market decline which I think will continue into next year,” he said.","Okay, so, is ""Don't fight the Fed"" dead?",18lokad,1702946481.0,https://i.redd.it/t2fdu9k7e57c1.png,

"Picture this: Novavax, the company that hit the jackpot with a $1.6 billion windfall from the government to whip up a COVID-19 vaccine, faced a rollercoaster of challenges in 2021. As they hustled to churn out vaccines, they stumbled into a quality quagmire.

Rumors are swirling that their vaccine quality took a nosedive, raising eyebrows at the FDA and putting a spoke in the wheel of the global mission to get COVID shots to countries on a budget. According to insiders dishing to Politico, the NVAX vaccine's purity levels clocked in at a meager 70%, falling way short of the FDA's 90% benchmark for COVID-19 vaccine batches.

But here's the kicker – when Novavax dished out updates to their investors, they downplayed these manufacturing hiccups like they were no big deal.

"MRNA without a doubt is the proverbial ""Covid Stock.""  Many prognosticators and pundits have gone bottom fishing and failed numerous times to catch the falling knife.  However, I'm going to go where many a portfolio has gone to die before, (except there's actually evidence the sellers are losing momentum).

Let's start with the technicals:  As we saw in my successful prediction on SQ, [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block\_inc\_sq\_high\_probability\_technical\_bullish/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block_inc_sq_high_probability_technical_bullish/), the technicals line up with bullish news and subsequent price reversal which substantially over performed a bull rally in the markets for November and December.  I will use the same technical indicators that predicted the SQ rally to make the case for MRNA on a monthly chart. I will also look at traditional regular candles and Heikin Ashi candles (which can better help us understand trends and avoid the noise).

In this case, the month of November, we saw a bullish MOM divergence which can be defined as a situation where the momentum indicator (MOM) shows a higher low while the price of an asset shows a lower low. This indicates that the downward trend is losing strength and that the price may reverse to the upside soon.  Looking at the monthly chart on MRNA sellers began losing significant momentum in November when viewing traditional candles.  This was confirmed by the Heikin Ashi candles in November which once again measure the overall strength of a trend.   Furthermore, we saw a substantial increase in the Chaikin Money Flow which in layman's terms measures inflows and outflows of capital in an equity.  In conjunction with bullish divergence, the corresponding technicals make a strong case that the bottom on MRNA is in.

Of course, some of you don't believe in technicals (even though they're simply a visual medium of supply and demand...), so we'll discuss how we are in the buy the rumor stage of Moderna. Recently Merck and Moderna announced progress and strong efficacy in Stage 2 trials for their skin cancer MRNA vaccine treatment.  Merck offered somewhat conservative guidelines, but Modenra expects the vaccine to be ready for approval in 2025.  As we saw in some of the recent patent approval for drugs, achieving the patent is not always bullish for a stock (I'm looking at you Bluebird). However, in this case the perception that a 49% reduction in Melanoma is not too far down the pipeline, this correlates with the price action we are seeing in the technicals.

Keep in mind, MRNA stock is mainly owned by large institutions, only a small amount of it is actually owned by retail...you can draw what conclusions on that from you want, but in my mind (and from reading some of the stupid things people say here) that is unquestionably bullish.  Declining COVID vaccination rates have hit other COVID beneficiaries like Pfizer hard, however also take into account Moderna's vaccine showed the greatest efficacy out of all of them, which is an empirically a good sign that the technology is viable and superior to competitors.

With all of that being said, I have and am building a position in MRNA.  The reasons are listed above and your chance to get a 2nd shot at a bio-tech that could potentially quadruple its multiple by 2025.  Don't listen to me, listen to where the money is going....

\*Chaikin Money Flow will be the green arrow at the bottom of the images. Traditional RSI is also shown.  I have provided weekly charts to show a different look and to indicate performance of the indicators mentioned.

"2024 is approaching and we're kicking things off with a bang! SPY and QQQ on fire, QQQ 420 not a meme anymore, maybe even your favorite shit stock meme's showing you some green. 

VIX (the fear index, for all you newbies) is currently plummeting to historic lows. January 2024 is setting up to be like a never-ending party, complete with confetti, champagne, and of course some lucky WSB winners with a suspicious amount of gain porn lately. 

So, a rally kicking off in the last quarter, ATHs, low VIX, green every day and WSB trying to short a steam roller - when did I see that before? Yeah, that sounds exactly like in 2017/2018. It went like this: Oct17: market up. Nov17: market up. Dec17: market up. Jan18 market only vertical up. Feb18: everything blew up:

[January 2018 meltup](https://preview.redd.it/plc3sjxm547c1.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17fb9cfc43f0e394d0c514be2df7667a691e328e)

2018 also gave us the volacalypse, with several short VIX funds being collateral damage (they went puff in one day, see r/tradeXIV). Something to watch out for if you go allin long with leverage, after all you don't want to be that idiot being up 10000% on your calls only for the market to do another one of these volacalypses and take it away in one day:

[VIX 2017 \/ 2018](https://preview.redd.it/3d2iun52647c1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06f059e98818f8e5f3658e4079213b604b444a71)

Maybe this might repeat, maybe it might not. But with non stop green and VIX this low, its like a double whammy for index calls. They are cheap because there is no volatility and markets just melt up in one direction, because again there's no volatility! Contrary to popular believe on WSB, calm waters are the best times to go long. Managing calls in calm waters is also just so much easier than trying to time crashes with puts. January 2024 could be that magic money printing machine. If you play you cards right you don't need to trade the rest of year and you'd just sail into the sunset with your new found wealth.

But you do you, WSB. Time to make some insane gains and lose them shortly after instead!",FOMO index meltup into January 2024 with parallels to 2017/2018.,18ljhxh,1702933400.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ljhxh/fomo_index_meltup_into_january_2024_with/,

"***I do not work for Procore but have been in the construction tech space for 8 years. If I wasn't so regarded I would be work for this company***

***I am balls deep in this stock***

***I have 150 shares with a cost basis of 58.70***

Okay Regards, Time to check out a diamond in the rough – Procore Technologies (PCOR). This company is like the construction worker of the stock market – underappreciated, but damn, it's doing some heavy lifting for your portfolio. Here's why you should throw PCOR on your radar:

***Revamping Construction with Tech Magic:***

Procore isn't just about hard hats and blueprints; it's revolutionizing construction with some serious tech mojo. Think cloud-based project management that makes everything smoother than a fresh batch of concrete. Construction is getting a facelift, and Procore is the one wielding the magic wand.

***Revenue Boom:***

PCOR's got that sweet, sweet revenue growth. It's like printing tendies, and who doesn't love that? The construction peeps are catching on, and as more projects jump on the Procore train, we're talking about money flowing like water at a frat party.

***Hobnobbing with the Big Shots:***

Procore isn't slumming it; it's rubbing elbows with the big boys in construction. If you want a stock that parties with the industry giants, PCOR is the VIP ticket you've been waiting for. Plus, it could mean long-term connections and a steady stream of cash.

***World Domination:***

Procore is spreading its wings internationally. We're not just talking about U.S. projects; we're talking global domination. As construction goes bananas worldwide, Procore is there, ready to rake in the gains.

***Tech Geek's Dream:***

In a world going nuts for tech, Procore is the geek's dream come true. It's bringing efficiency to an industry that's been stuck in the past. If you're into disruptive tech making waves, PCOR should be on your hit list.

***Short Squeeze Shenanigans:***

WSB loves a good short squeeze, right? Well, PCOR might just be the dark horse waiting to shake things up. It's not on everyone's radar yet, and that could mean some serious fireworks if the short-sellers start feeling the heat.

***Summary***

Procore Technologies (PCOR) is the construction worker turned rockstar of the stock market. With crazy revenue growth, A-list clientele, global expansion plans, and the potential for a short squeeze, PCOR might just be the rocket you've been looking for. But hey, don't forget to do your own DD – we're all in this together, but risks are part of the game.

Looking at this date shows a bearish sentiment going into the end of the first quarter. With 4 of the stocks actually having a 1.00 or higher put/call ratio indicating bears in control of options volume for those dates.

**Summary**

Important thing to keep in mind is that the market tends to react a bit earlier (1-2 weeks) to options activity then the actual exp date. Based off the options activity for the next 3-4 months the market is pricing in a top early to mid January with a selloff going into the end of the first quarter. This would also correlate nicely with IRA and 401K contributions on Jan 1st adding even more fuel to go up in the short term before Jan 19.

"This is from one novice trader to another and my own personal conclusions.

1.) Unless you’re super confident on stock movements; don’t YOLO most or all of your portfolio into a single option.

2.) If options don’t get bought at the opening bell, leave it be unless, again, you’re super-confident on the stock’s movement and are willing to pay a higher cost.

3.) Be sure to read up on the company and any recent activities it worked through.  Movements can simply be movements with no firm basis to justify them and don’t reflect potential forecasted projections.

4.) Don’t get hung up on the FOMO/missed options chances. There will be other opportunities, and being hung up on what was missed is bad for your mental health.

Conclusions: It seems that Match Group is about 25% undervalued at current levels. Revenue grew \~9% in the most recent quarter due mostly to growth in average spend per user, offset by a decline in payers by 5%. Recent strategic objectives have been to reinvigorate growth in revenues to double digit levels and optimize product development and S&amp;A expense so as to increase profitability and returns on capital. Optimizations of pricing on Tinder (introductions of weekly subscriptions for instance) have worked as RPP (revenue per payer) increased by double digits year over year in the latest quarter. Hinge, a relatively higher RPP business, saw encouraging download trends and pricing actions in a move to optimize user spend and double down on core markets. The market seems to be most concerned about the fall in paying users in the most recent quarter which has pushed down the company's valuation since the summer. If we assume that payers will grow to 30 million from 15.7 million in the latest quarterly report, due to growth at Hinge and new offerings such as Archer and Hyperconnect Azar and stability at Tinder, and that RPP per month will grow to $25 over time as more premium monetization efforts pay off, it's not out of the question for revenues to hit 9.1 billion in year 10. Overall, the company seems to be undervalued currently although sluggish payer trends have hit sentiment and it remains to be seen if declining payers can be sufficiently offset by rising RPP. To be valuable, Match Group will have to find ways to appeal to people currently disillusioned by the online dating scene. Digital exhaustion due to COVID shutdowns may also be exacerbating market weaknesses in online dating as people search out in-person experiences in lieu of online ones. Another interesting point is the cynical perspective that dating apps take advantage of lonely people to make more money: showing people less than stellar matches in order to spur them to spend in order to gain access to higher tier profiles. If Match Group is to succeed, it will have to pivot its brand image away from being superficial and pay to win and towards a platform that provides people a convenient way to connect authentically with others. It must succeed with its users, not in spite of them. Another interesting development may be with the metaverse: The fusing together of AR, VR, and AI algorithms may be able to rekindle interest in online experiences as they become more realistic, engaging, and interactive than ever before.

"This is my analysis and opinion on Grindr (NYSE:GRND). I have casually followed this stock for several months, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started researching the company intensely and made it the largest position in my portfolio. Because I have not seen this stock discussed much, I wanted both to share my opinions and invite feedback. I believe Grindr is a deeply undervalued business with substantial growth potential and in this post, I try to lay out my thoughts as to why. Please keep in mind that although I tried my best to carefully research the company, I do not guarantee this DD is 100% free of errors, and I encourage you to do your own research and point out flaws in mine. I have included a number of links at the end as a starting point and embedded several within.

# Brief Overview and History

Grindr was founded in 2009 as a dating and networking app to connect users based on GPS location. Initially targeting gay men, over time the app evolved to become the world's largest LGBTQ+ social network and Grindr currently stands as the premier brand associated with the LGBTQ community. The app was American-owned from its founding until 2016, when it was [majority acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/11/chinese-gaming-firm-buys-60-of-gay-dating-app-grindr-for-93m/) by Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun for $155 million in 2016. At the time, the app had around two million active users and generated \~30 million in revenue yearly. The app remained Chinese-owned until 2020, when the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment forced Beijing Kunlun to divest its ownership back to a U.S.-based company, citing national security reasons. The company was sold to San Vicente Acquisition for $609 million and remained private until November 2022, when the stock went public at a $2.1 billion valuation. Initially the share price surged, closing at $36.50 the first day of trading, before falling down to the $5-$7 range where the stock remained for much of 2023. Currently, G. Raymond Zage, is the largest single investor in Grindr, owning approximately 45% of all shares and on December 08, Zage increased his position by an additional $500,000 shares, which I take as a sign of his confidence in the company. Board chair James Fu Bin Lu, founder of Chegg, owns the second largest position in the stock, approximately 22% of the total shares. Grindr has not yet received any investment or coverage from Wall Street firms or analysts, and during earnings calls it has primarily fielded questions from retail investors.

# New Leadership

In October 2022, shortly before Grindr went public, [George Arison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arison), took over the role of CEO from Jeff Bonforte, who had been leading the company since June of 2020. George Arison is a serial entrepreneur, and an openly gay man, and prior to his position as Grindr CEO he led a number of companies and was a consultant at BCG.

In my opinion, in his one year tenure, Arison has proved an extremely capable businessman and a good leader of the company. From the beginning, in his communications to shareholders, he has clearly articulated a growth algorithm for Grindr and executed on it extremely well. Under Arison's stewardship Grindr has seen a 40% YoY growth in revenue and earnings as of Q3 2023. Within the 2022 Annual report, shareholder letters, and previous four quarterly earnings calls, Arison has consistently emphasized that Grindr is (still) in the very early innings stages of growth and monetization journey and laid out a roadmap for the growth story ahead. I will elaborate more on this in the next section, but needless to say, results so far have been excellent. Arison has demonstrated a committment to running a lean business as well, although for growth stock like Grindr I do not believe expenses are as important a factor as the top line. Notably, Grindr made headlines this September when Arison mandated a return to office for its employees and subsequently lost a substantial portion of its workforce. ([Reddit predictably excoriated Grindr's decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/16dreg6/dating_app_grindr_loses_nearly_half_its_staff/) but he laid out his reasons and work philosophy in [this blog from October 3](https://www.grindr.com/blog/our-philosophy-on-work-and-building-an-exceptional-community-going-forward)). Despite the controversy, I agree with Arison and believe the hybrid model of two days a week in office, three days at home will be beneficial to Grindr, its corporate culture, and ultimately shareholders.

One additional aspect about George Arison I wanted to highlight because I believe it's highly relevant is that he is a married gay man with two kids and an active member of the community that Grindr serves. To dive deeper into his background, you may read a bio of him and his partner in this [2019 NYTimes profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/fashion/weddings/george-arison-and-robert-luo-wanted-love-and-to-live-american-dream.html). I think a strong case can be made that as a member of the LGBT community, George Arison has a deeper understanding of the LGBTQ+ community, its needs, and Grindr's customer base. If you listen to his interviews and read his [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearison/recent-activity/all/), he comes across as very genuine about serving the community. He is certainly more in tune than the previous two CEOs of Grindr, Jeff Bonforte and Scott Chen from when it was owned by San Vicente and Kunlun. (In fact, Chen was so out of touch with the userbase he publicly stated in 2018 that ['Marriage is between one man and one women'](https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/11/30/grindr-scott-chen-marriage/)) All of this to say that, until recently, Grindr has likely been mismanaged because its leadership did not understand its LGBTQ+ userbase. Under its new CEO and Board of Directors [which is 60% LGBTQ+](https://fhoudart.medium.com/the-queerest-board-in-history-that-we-know-of-b817c44d6d71), the first in history, I believe Grindr will be able to make changes to build stronger relationships with the LGBTQ+ community, which will lead to increased brand loyalty and customer retention, and be beneficial to the business and shareholders long-term.

# Growth Story

Moving onto the growth story. Upon joining, Arison stated his intention to transform the business and guide it through a new era of growth. Before I dive into how exactly he plans to do that, I think now is probably the best time to take note of the secular social tailwinds that back Grindr this decade.

As of 2022, there were more than 500 million people worldwide who identify as LGBTQ+. Within the U.S., 7.1% of the adult population, or around 18.4 million adults identify as being LGBTQ+.

The generational gap in LGBT Identification is stark:

* 2.7% of Boomers (1946-1964)
* 3.3% of Gen X (1965-1980)
* 11.2% of Millenials (1980-1996)
* 19.7% of GenZ (1997-2004)

From Gen X to Gen Z, there is a 6x increase in the fraction of the population identifying. Although the data for Gen Alpha is not in yet, the trend is clear and I would expect no less than 20% of that cohort will also identify when they come of age, as LGBTQ acceptance continues to normalize.

The global population of LGBT individuals that Grindr targets is a formidable demographic. They are a group with a population of 540 million, a combined purchasing power of $10.9 trillion, and an annual growth rate of 6.7%. If the global LGBT population were a country, they would be a substantial economic powerhouse and a dominant player on the world stage. They would rank [third in population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), constitute the world's [third largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)), and would be the [fastest growing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate) in the world.

Furthermore, Grindr's userbase is highly lucrative and coveted by advertisers. LGBT individuals tend to be wealthier, more educated, travel more, and spend more money than their heterosexual counterparts. They are also more brand-conscious in general.

Taken together, it is very clear that there is massive value to unlock in this space, and Grindr is well poised to benefit from the rapid expansion of its core market in the coming decade.

I will now explain George Arison's vision for precisely how Grindr will do that.

# Phase 1 - Monetize Core Business

The first phase of Grindr's transformation, still in progress, has been to introduce new features and modernize the platform, with a focus on converting free users into paying ones. Throughout most of Grindr's existence, it operated primarily via an ad-supported revenue model, with only a small fraction of users paying for the app. Under the new ""freemium"" business model, the shift has been to grow revenue by enhancing the app's user experience and developing additional paid offerings that users subscribe to. Three such offerings that launched in 2023 have been have been Grindr Web, Super Boost, and Weeklies. So far, this strategy has been wildly successful and in the last year, management has had to raise revenue forecasts several times. Revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be around $255 million, an increase of 31% compared to FY 2022. Despite the growth thus far, paying user penetration remains at \~7%, around 1/3 that of Tinder's, meaning there is still ample room for 8-10 quarters of continued mid-double digit (\~30-50%) annual revenue growth if management can simply continue to execute on the growth plan. This initial phase of Grindr's growth should be complete by the end of fiscal year 2025, so for investors with a horizon of less than two years, Grindr is a strong shorter-term investment as it executes on its monetization strategy.

# Phase 2 - Make Grindr a Global Brand

Although Grindr is available to download in most countries worldwide, presently, it derives 86.9% of its revenue from North America. The company has substantial opportunities for growth by marketing and targeting its products and services for international users. Alongside Phase 1 of the growth plan to monetize Grindr's core business in the domestic market, the company plans to in the medium term increase its user base and revenues by tapping into international markets too.

The same playbook they are executing in the the U.S. can be applied elsewhere and will enable them to increase revenue, first in the European and South American markets and ultimately in underserved communities, [including the more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia where being gay is illegal](https://www.grindr.com/blog/grindr-applauds-sen-ben-cardins-push-to-improve-human-rights-in-egypt). The company has made it a priority to bolster the positive social trends that are favorable to the LGBTQ+ community in these markets through social activism, while strengthening the product they offer these markets through localization and targeted marketing to accelerate organic growth.

# Phase 3 - Expand into New Businesses

As was previously mentioned, Grindr is a platform that represents the #1 LGBT brand in the world. There is no close second. Grindr's platform provides a valuable source of data on the preferences and behaviors of the global LGBTQ+ community, which can be used to develop innovative products and services that address their evolving needs. The unique connection that Grindr has with the broader LGBT community also allows it to develop targeted distribution partnerships, products, and services that cater specifically to the demographic and generate new revenue streams. Especially in light of the pullback of major corporations marketing to LGBT due to conservative backlash, *this presents a major opportunity for an LGBT-friendly brand to step in and carve out its own niche.* Despite the fallout this year, the LGBTQ demographic remains highly sought after by advertisers, and Grindr is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. On a similar note, the company also expects to be able to enhance the health and profitability of its ad operations over time, making ads more relevant to users and more valuable for advertisers. One of Grindr's multiyear initiatives is to build partnerships and relationships with advertisers and agencies in order to replace its generic, third-party ads ads that have a low click-through rate with directly targeted ads.

Grindr currently operates as a hookup, dating, and social networking app, but George Arison envisions its ultimate destination as becoming the trusted lifestyle brand for the LGBTQ+ community. Already, Grindr has 85% brand awareness in the community, and early trends have already revealed many of its users rely on the location-based features of the app, for example, for safe navigation when traveling as gay individuals and seeking suggestions on where to go and what to do in new cities. There is a signifcant unmet market need for services built specifically for the global LGBTQ community, and once again, Grindr remains uniquely positioned to tap into this market. Although in the past, raising funding has been one of Grindr's challenges and it may continue to be in the future ([although the recent $350 Million Credit Facility announcement is a step in the right direction](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx)), the company has ample opportunity for capital-light partnerships with service providers in travel, media, health care, and finance tailored to the needs of the LGBTQ+ community across the globe. These types of initiatives will allow Grindr to tap into a broader customer base, thereby increasing its total addressable market size.

My belief is that Grindr, under new leadership, is transforming the company into a business with a large future growth story. The company is in a strong position to execute on many of its near term initiatives in the next 1-2 years as well as its multi-year strategy for the decade ahead.

# Comparison to Peers

I cannot emphasize enough how differentiated Grindr is, across several dimensions, from other dating apps. In terms of engagement, Grindr is unparalleled. More than 300 million messages are sent each day on the platform and the average user spends 61 minutes per day on the app.

If that second figure doesn't impress you, here are some other avg daily usage numbers for comparison:

* Tinder: 18 minutes
* Bumble: 14 minutes
* Instagram: 29 minutes
* Snapchat: 28 minutes
* YouTube: 40 minuets
* Tiktok: 56 minutes

As you can see, Grindr's numbers blow every other dating app out of the water. The only social media app that comes even remotely close is Tiktok, which has been called the “crack cocaine of social media”. If Tiktok is crack, then Grindr is heroin. Grindr's remarkable user engagement is the leading reason why I am mighty bullish on management's ability to monetize its userbase. Again, their largest priority this year and for the next 1-2 years (Phase 1 of the Growth Plan) is to build more features that generate value for their users (and for shareholders).

There are several additional advantages that Grindr has over other dating apps, because of its userbase of primarily gay men.

For starters, the intentions of many Grindr users differ from other dating apps. Although it also functions as a dating and social networking app, Grindr is first and foremost a hookup app. Other dating apps like Bumble and Tinder have the fatal flaw in their business model wherein if you are successful at finding a relationship, you stop using the app. In order words, the more successful the product is, the more users leave, and this means that the interests of users will always be at odds with the interests of these companies. By contrast, the better a product Grindr can build, the ""happier"" its users will be. Everyone wins when Grindr creates value.

Additionally, gay men tend to get married later in life. The median age of first marriage for same sex couples is 35 compared to 28 for opposite sex couples. This benefits Grindr in two ways: 1) It means Grindr's customer base has a substantially (\~70%) longer active period than other dating apps and 2) Its users will likely be more willing/capable to pay for services compared to dating apps like Tinder whose userbase tends to consist of broke college students (I'm overgeneralizing about Tinder slightly, but not by much).

Presently, around 7% of Grindr users pay for the app, which is less than half the rate of Tinder (\~18%). I believe that throughout 2024, Grindr's will approach Tinder's user penetration, then in subsequent years surpass it and continue rising. (Keep in mind, the large majority of Grindr's userbase is men, who are 22 times more likely to become paid users of a dating app than women are.) It's hard to predict where the terminal rate will end up, but I think a scenario where it settles at 40-50% or possibly even higher is very plausible. If those numbers seem lofty, note that 71% percent of Amazon users pay for Prime ($14.99 per month) and 40% of Spotify's users pay for Premium ($10.99 per month). With these comparisons, I'm not trying to suggest in any way that Grindr is a peer or competitor to Spotify/Amazon, just illustrating the fact that users are willing to pay for subscriptions when they are offered a valuable service in return. In fact, I believe Grindr's annual revenue per user has the potential to be larger than a service like Spotify's because music streaming services are largely undifferentiated and there is no competitive moat.

Currently, Grindr's lowest pricing tier costs $19.99/month and its highest is $39.99/month. These are ballpark numbers, but given its growth rate in both total users and paying user fraction, it's very plausible that Grindr could have 10 million paying customers just for its core app by 2030, each paying anywhere from $200-$400 a year. This is why I believe management when they say they are in the very very early stages of Grindr's monetization journey. The numbers I laid out are of course all dependent on how competent Grindr leadership is, but I believe they can execute. If the monetization strategy is successful, with Grindr's margins it will be a $30B stock by that time. !RemindMe 6 years.

The last point to bring up about Grindr in relation to its peers is that it has the potential to laterally expand its business in a way that other dating apps cannot. Nobody will ever use Tinder to get in touch with a family planner who specializes in the complex legal and financial challenges that same-sex couples face when adopting. Or finding a surrogate. Nobody's getting on Bumble to find a caregiver who's compassionate towards the unique health needs of members of the LGBTQ community. Nobody is ever going to use Hinge as a trusted LGBTQ-friendly travel hub. This ties back to Phase III of George Arison's growth strategy. As Grindr continues to grow, it can continue to expand beyond its core offering explore new features, products, and services that cater to different needs and preferences of its community. Because Grindr has significant ties to its community and because its userbase is so engaged, this provides an opportunity for the company to expand beyond just a dating app and provide adjacent products and services to the community that it serves.

George Arison has said he envisions Grindr as the ['gay super-app'](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/grindr-went-public-7-months-ago-heres-whats-happened-since.html). If he can pull that off, the sky's the limit.

All in all, Grindr truly is in a category of its own, for many reasons, most of which are not even close to being priced in. I believe $GRND's outperformance compared to other publicly traded peers like Tinder ($MTCH) and Bumble ($BMBL) is the market slowly coming to appreciate this fact.

# Financials and Valuation

As I just alluded to, I think Grindr (1.4B m cap) is ridiculously cheap compared to its peers: Bumble (2.9B m cap) and Tinder (9.5B m cap).

How does it look in isolation though?

Grindr's Q3 earnings were arguably their best yet, showing a 40% CAGR revenue growth rate and a 50% adjusted EBITDA CAGR since since 2016. They raised revenue guidance several times this year, and revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be $255M.

Income-wise, the stock had a net loss of 437k in Q3 so it basically broke even. However, in this quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by a large one-off severance payment as a result of Grindr's return to office layoffs and a large interest expense that will be lower in the future. Q2 Net Income was $22.3 Million and Q1 Net Income was ($32.9 Million).

Grindr presently has 347M in debt and 30M in cash on its balance sheet.

I believe one of the largest obstacles holding Grindr back before, and the reason it was trading at a discount, was its debt at a high interest rate. In Q4 of 2022, just the interest expense alone constituted was 37.7% ! of revenue. However, its debt situtation is rapidly improving and will continue to do so as its grows its top line and interest rates normalize. Additionally, on November 29th, [Grindr announced it had refinanced its debt](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx) with a new $350M Term Loan A and Revolver facility. This has the effect of reducing net interest expense by \~$17M next year.

I expect Grindr to post breakeven or post a small profit for FY 2023. The company has attained borderline profitability during the challenging fiscal conditions of the last year, and it is in a strong financial position moving foward.

Looking ahead, we already know Grindr has the potential to become extremely profitable in the future, and recent debt refinancing will help to accelerate the timeline. Already, when taking into account the company's reduction in headcount, the decrease in net interest expense with the new terms on the debt, and revenue growth, GRND is trading at a forward P/E of 14 which I believe is extremely cheap for a software company with a 40% revenue growth rate.

Its current revenue multiple of 6x is another indication the stock is undervalued. For comparison, Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Snowflake ($SNOW), two other tech stocks I follow, also have a 40% revenue growth rate year-over-year and they trade at a 21x revenue multiple. If a similar valuation metric were to be applied to GRND, the market cap would be 5 Billion or $30/share. GRND currently trades at $8.15, with the share price trending up 36% in the last month since earnings, so there's substantial for share price to appreciate in this year and into 2024.

Again, I believe there is a strong case that with just the current numbers alone, and not factoring in future growth, the stock is fairly valued at $30/share or 5B market cap which is my price target for 2024. Long term, with Arison at the helm, I believe GRND could be be one of the great stocks of the decade for the reasons I have outlined in previous sections above.

# Bear Case

No Grindr DD would be complete without the gay bear case. As a young, unproven, and undiversified business Grindr is inherently riskier to invest in than, say, a blue chip like Apple or Microsoft.

One risk is that although Grindr enjoys powerful network effects as the #1 LGBT platform, there are other apps in the space like Archer, Scruff, and Sniffies. It's possible a rival could emerge and outcompete Grindr, but over the last year Grindr's new managment have proven themselves to be highly capable, and they'd have to fumble pretty hard to let go of their economic moat. [George Arison has also made it clear that Grindr will be first to market with incorporating generative AI into the platform.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-14/grindr-lgbtq-dating-app-to-add-ai-wingman-chatbot) It's something to keep an eye out for, but at this time I am not too concerned that a competitor arises to usurp Grindr's position as the lead dating/hookup app for the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the industry is not a winner-take-all market, so several different platforms can coexist at the same time.

It could be argued, and it has been argued, that the online dating app market has been saturated. I don't believe this to be true, either. As I detailed above, there is substantial opporunity to grow total user count and revenue per user. Grindr is still in the very early phases of its monetization journey.

Grindr has a somewhat high debt relative to to its cash position. However, the company is liquid, not in any chance of bankruptcy, and moving forwarded its debt payments will be substantially lowered due to the debt refinancing.

# Conclusion

I have been diligently researching GRND for several weeks. Please also do your own DD as well. This post wound up being longer than what I had originally set out to write, but the more I researched and learned about this stock the more I felt compelled to include. If you made it here to the end, thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts. I've omitted a tl;dr because I don't want anyone who isn't serious enough to spend 15 minutes reading all of what I've written engaging in the comments anyway.

Let’s start at the beginning…They entered the market regretfully as a SPAC and skyrocketed to 100+. As with all the SPAC’s came down to earth and got molly whopped by a short report.  The usual “shits fake” From here the stock died and most have never gave it a second look. 

The way it played out makes it  ripe for a 10x+ bagger. The lack of attention is your gain. Here is what has happened since the drop.

TECH
The coveted SSB. 
- SSB Ceramic separator with only anode no cathode. Half of the Lithum needed.
- Million mile battery. QS puts their batteries though extremely crazy testing. They have achieved 800 cycles of fast charge and been at 80%+ of capacity retained. When tested by car company less rigorous standards they have retained 95% of capacity over 800 cycles.
-10-80% charge in 15 mins. Actively working on lowering this.
- Almost double the density of standard EV battery. That means you get 600 miles out the same size battery that gets 300 miles now
- Best of both worlds, has power and energy. All cells now are one of the other. Power is your fast charge but you lose distance. Energy is slow charge but more distance. There is no battery on the market right now that can do both of these.
- No exploding and minimal lose from cold weather. 

COMPANY AND MILESTONES
This is very subjective but I will try to highlight what I see makes this a moon gem. Most SSB companies are still in abstract or have yet to send prototypes

- Mass scale production prototype is achieved.
- No over promising and transparent. They have stuck to their timelines and have been open and honest about delays and why they happened. 
- Just hired western diagonals Siva Sivaram as President. Would he come on board with bad tech or a failing game plan?
- 6 of top 10 OEM’s on board and actively testing batteries. 
- A samples(singles cells) sent to OEMs a year ago. 
- Advancements in production. Have developed the tech to scale up manufacturing. Launching as I type
- B-Cells (Full EV batteries) are coming in the first quarter
- Already have a committed launch partner with low volume exclusive. Haven’t announced expected next year.

"Japan's Nippon Steel has made a significant announcement on Monday, revealing its intention to acquire U.S. Steel in a monumental deal with a total estimated value of $14.9 billion, encompassing debt. This move comes several months after U.S. Steel put itself on the market for potential buyers.

The proposed per-share offer stands at $55, representing a remarkable premium of approximately 40% compared to U.S. Steel's closing stock price on the preceding Friday and an astonishing 142% compared to the stock's closing price just before the company's announcement of its strategic review process on August 11th. As a result of this news, U.S. Steel's shares have already surged by about 27% in premarket trading.

Nippon Steel, ranked as the world's fourth-largest steel manufacturer, views the United States as a growth market capable of offsetting the declining demand in Japan, as reported by the Nikkei daily, which initially broke the story.

Nippon Steel has successfully secured the necessary financing commitments for the acquisition and anticipates that this strategic move will enable the company to advance towards achieving a global crude steel capacity of 100 million tonnes.

Crucially, Nippon has affirmed its commitment to honoring all of U.S. Steel's agreements with its employees, including existing collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions.

The journey towards this acquisition began in August when U.S. Steel initiated a formal review process, having previously rejected a $7.3 billion offer from rival Cleveland-Cliffs. Interestingly, throughout this period, Cliffs remained involved in the sale process, while industry giant ArcelorMittal was also considering making an offer, as reported by Reuters in August.

Based in Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel's stock had been struggling due to several consecutive quarters of declining revenue and profit. This made it an attractive prospect for competitors seeking to bolster their portfolio with a steel manufacturer catering to both the automotive and renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the prospect of benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides tax credits and other incentives for projects in the renewable energy industry, further piqued the interest of potential suitors.

It's worth noting that companies like U.S. Steel are poised for a strong start to 2024, thanks to soaring steel prices following the resolution of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union strike against the Detroit Three automakers.

"Steel Partners (SPLP) is probably a name most around here are are not familiar with. It's a diversified holding company operating in segments such as diversified materials, enegry and financial services. The majority of shares is held by insiders and it's thinly traded.

What's interesting about the company is an announcement they made on 12/14 which effectivley amounts forcing small shareholders to sell. Specifically, they announced a 1 for 12,500 reverse spilt, followed immediately by a 12,500 for 1 forward split. This is scheduled to take place on 1/8/2024.

According to their press release of the announcement *""No fractional units will be issued in connection with the Reverse/Forward Unit Split. Instead, the Company will pay cash (without interest) to any unitholder who would be entitled to receive a fractional unit as a result of the Reverse/Forward Unit Split. Unitholders who hold fewer than 12,500 units immediately prior to the Reverse Unit Split will be paid in cash (without interest) an amount equal to such number of Company Common Units held multiplied by volume-weighted average price for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Reverse/Forward Unit Split.""*

In other words, if you own fewer than 12,500, you will be forced out of the stock, the publicly available float will decrease in aggregate by the total amount of shares held by shareholders owning under 12,500 shares, and well, good luck getting back in following the forward split as the pice will in all likelihood be higher due to the reduced share count and lack of available shares to buy.

Since the shares are very thinly traded, there's a possiblity of this stock moving higher leading up to the split. Shareholders just under the 12,500 mark will want to increase their holdings above the threshold to avoid being taken out. And since shareholders who have no intention of rising above the level will be taken out anyway, they'll likely just wait for the split to be paid out rather than selling before it. 

Aside from the interesting techinical setup, this is an extremely hostile corporate action directed at small shareholders. If the company wants to take them out, they should offer a fair price.

Conclusions: Carvana is overvalued as the market has swung from being too pessimistic due to bankruptcy concerns to too optimistic on its potential as a disruptor. While overhead expense may be reduced by not having retail locations and as many salespeople on payroll, Carvana's story hinges on its ability to take share from legacy players like Carmax and Autonation while also generating a much higher than average operating margin, which seems unlikely. The automotive retail space is mostly predicated on providing attractive prices, integrated financing options, and selection, factors that are not so easily defended from competitive intrusions. Growth in the near term also seems to be on the backburner as the focus has turned to unit economics as the macroeconomic backdrop became a headwind.

Carmax seems to be the most undervalued company of the group as investors have become more pessimistic on the company's future as recent troubles have clouded the near-term trajectory. However, it's clear that the company will be here to stay as its geographic footprint of stores and recognized brand give it an enviable advantage.

Autonation is holding up well in the midst of Carmax's struggles due to its ability to heavier reliance on new vehicle sales, as well as repair and bodyshop services, to drive growth vs. Carmax's specialty in used vehicles. New vehicles are clearly selling more efficiently than used vehicles, as demonstrated by Autonation's slight positive revenues growth this year.

Vroom is the most uncertain case out of the four I've listed here. It's the smallest of the group, selling only 39278 vehicles in 2022 vs. 1.4 million for Carmax, 229,971 for Autonation, and 412,296 for Carvana. Revenues tumbled a stunning 44.7% in 2022 due to a huge drop in units sold of over 35000 vehicles. Unit volume has not been better this year, as TTM revenues are 66% lower than the same period a year ago. However, if the company is able to complete its plan to improve unit economics (similar to Carvana) and return to growth, the stock may be attractive. Another interesting thing about vroom is that its cash and equivalents of around 200 million exceeds the market cap, but it also has debts of 300 million.

Recommendations: Hold Vroom, buy Carmax and Autonation, sell Carvana.

"[https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/)

Ok, I already know, so let's start with the fact that Hussman is often labeled a perma-bear and has been calling bubbles for years. Let's address the substance of the research. 

It is clear that valuations are relatively **high**, and earnings growth has been remarkable, supported by expanding **margins** the last twenty years or so. This is good business and evidence of the excellency of American corporations, and technology. It is ALSO the product of declining interest rates which fostered declining costs of capital, and stagnant wage growth which kept the cost of labor low. While it possible these remain low, it is unlikely and difficult to imagine them continuing lower. Growth will have to come from real revenue growth, margin expansion (somehow), or even higher valuations. 

To be clear, **the most common next step for an expensive market is to become even more expensive.** I am *not* arguing to go short. But it is hard to argue that the path forward looks great from here. Unless we're going to manufacture significant real GDP growth somehow for the first time in decades, record margins either have to grow yet higher, let alone remain at current heights, *while* valuations must do the same.

[This is price to revenue of the S&amp;P, which is at levels unseen before 2021, supported by record margins and high multiples.](https://preview.redd.it/l8izfkmuew6c1.png?width=1207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ecc3ada8ad248cfdbc5d01cac34ff56c16514c6)

[Above depicts the relationship between the expected 10 year annual performance of a 60\/40 portfolio based on valuations \(blue\), and the actual annual return experienced \(red\) going back to 1928. ](https://preview.redd.it/surv5c22fw6c1.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cb7e1b0e2fd972d21b77a52683c4ffe4121d70a)

So, this last one above is concerning to say the least. It hasn't really missed. Any gaps were temporary as the fundamentals driving the projections in blue eventually drove the actual returns of the market. At current levels, the recent performance of stocks has created a large gap. To fill, equities would have to suffer a significant loss sometime soon. To be constructive on equities, this indicator which has been accurate for **90 years** would need to rendered completely useless now. This time *would* have to be very different. 

[95 years of estimated declines to restore equity risk premiums \(blue\) vs actual market losses \(red\).](https://preview.redd.it/pnm8g9h3gw6c1.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9e1f9d004be8477c22aeef7323ddf5e7256db0c)

This last one shows the history of expected losses necessary to restore equity risk premiums and the actual losses eventually experienced. Again, there are temporary gaps, but it hasn't really missed. 

I am not here to predict any short-term action. In fact, I think the market continuing higher over the next 6-12 months is just as likely as any decline. 

But let's discuss the realities of the environment: This is certainly no cheap market. It can be argued (very well and supported by no shortage historical data) that it would be wise to wait for a good entry point. It is also likely that it would be quite the ***""golden swan""*** if the market *did not* suffer a serious draw down eventually. In fact, it would be the **first time** these indicators have missed.

The obvious difficulty in this approach is underperforming for months or years as the momentum continues, or at the risk of the aforementioned golden swan. This is very difficult to do in practice. Working in one's favor however, is the opportunity to lock in 5-8% returns in fixed income for several years, depending where you want to go on the quality scale. Let's discuss this approach.

As weird as it sounds, treasury bills have **repeatedly** outperform the S&amp;P over wide time horizons, particularly when valuations are elevated.

[S&amp;P \(blue\) charted with the index levels given a certain risk premium over treasuries. The chart also shows periods that treasuries outperformed the S&amp;P.](https://preview.redd.it/g47tk355hw6c1.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076729c0059aae2513b13a5dc33501a60fd942c6)

Treasuries outperforming the S&amp;P over any extended period sounds bonkers but its true. This is what happens when there are stretched valuations and large draw downs. Over the following periods, treasury bills outperformed the S&amp;P:  
Aug 1929 to July 1950  
Dec 1968 to Dec 1987  
Mar 1998 to Mar 2020  
Apr 2007 to Mar 2020

Again, it sounds crazy, and it obviously requires timing. Being in treasuries and missing the entry into stocks would result in *significant underperformance.* That being said, the seemingly more reliable entries into T-bills have been during times of elevated valuations such as today.

Given the historical reliability of these indicators, would it not be wise to consider reducing equity exposure and waiting a better entry?  It would certainly be uncomfortable, and may take time, but it appears rather likely this approach would pay off eventually.

"YOLO time!

I have already made over 8 figures on shorting this rubbish streaming service to death; but it ain't dead yet! ViaPlay! Some odd goofball sport TV streaming service in Europe! Never made a dime, has a f\*cktonne of debt, their competitor streaming peers are cheaper. ViaPlay is a Nordic Streaming provider who overpaid for streaming licenses and treated professional sports and replaced professional journalists explaining the sports; to nothing; and the consumer bitched;

They realize they sucked at everything they touched; and it happened to be there was a 1/3rd cheaper provider; F1 TV;  which has previous ex F1 winners, explaining the tremendous difficulties in Formula one versus the -nobodies ViaPlay had; because they explained nothing of the technicality of Formula 1. So people got extremely upset, and realized, wait a minute, we can get professional advice, for 1/3rd the price! Outstanding MOVE!

So to no surprise; this firm went down the drill; and is close to death; for logical meritocratic reasons;

Remember, when people don't want to hand over something; *it's because there is something to hide*. Not surprised, because the firm is as dead as could be be. 

And above all; on the 10th of January **they are having a vote on debt issuance (it's horrendous, investors could lose all their money!)**; legal that true (not under court of human rights); but they are trying to keep it unlawfully hidden from investors (per jurisdiction); which is and has already been overthrown by the ECB/SEC and FCA/PRA; Not surprised; because this firm can actually die on the 10th of January is this vote **isn't going through: they actually SAY SO THEMSELVES!**

Only **none of the job openings are related to saving the darn firm!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

This firm is a JOKE! I see no reason why anyone would want to **hold their debt,** which they will have to restructure (*have you looked at the ability to restructure debt nowadays given todays economic climate)*

In the **normal world**, if you as working human being lose a battle get in debt, **you're done for**.

ViaPlay made their streaming services way too expensive because they **overpaid massively** for streaming fees. 

*Well, why would there be different rules for firms in comparison to people? That doesn't seem fair.*

All I see is a big bat corporate bully who tries to get away with a meritocratic issue. Besides, we are talking about a 'streaming provider' - in other words; no one is going to miss this firm if it would go insolvent because they made a meritocratic mistake! And they have been selling shit constantly to keep liquidity flowing;

I already made a fuck tonne on this; but this firm is still alive! How on earth! I have various synthetic plays around ViaPlay. One of them is a simply volatility play option wise asset wise most correlated to ViaPlay.

There is a chance (risk wise) that ViaPlay gets so shattered in stock price (have you seen this 52wk high - low??) - ViaPlay has a deal with Canal +, which is Vivdendi;

Translate this article;

in English; 

That only means; **volatility**

Because if one thinks about it; the current price of ViaPlay for what it offers is far too high. Besides; what does ViaPlay have to offer after years of failure 'for a buy' out? This is either in my sensible educated guess a potential buy out (at the lowest cost price) - or a bankruptcy - and the likes of Vivendi taking in. 

Either way; feast my friends on a good Christmas!

**Full disclosure**; I can't 5 million % YOLO anymore as I had to wait to get the karma to post this; nevertheless; my vote of confidence goes to ViaPlay either (nearly) dead; another one m&amp;a picking it up; but ViaPlay is a service provider; that won't be a hostile one and they have nothing to offer; hence I have trades on Vivendi + the Formula One stocks + Liberty Media stocks and Skysports (UK F1 streaming) - which is part of Comcast. Which I also hold. I obviously might change my mind given 10th of January is very close around the corner - and monitoring this dead in the water firm. But im fist deep. 

Because I don't like it when average Joe get kicked out of his house when he can't pay his debt.

While corporate firms like these get a ridiculous second chance, for the basic economic mistake; overpaying on licensing rights!

"The only thing Jay Powell could have done to deliver a stronger impression of a festive giveaway to global markets this week would have been to conduct his press conference decked in an oversized red suit with fluffy white trimmings and a matching hat.
The public appearance by the chair of the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday was a big opportunity to use the central banker Jedi mind tricks we all know and love to hint to investors that they have read the situation all wrong.


He has, of course, done this before. Back in October, when real-world borrowing costs were sailing higher with benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields hovering close to a post-crisis peak of 5 per cent, he said markets were doing some of the Fed’s job for it. As any trained Fed nerd will tell you, that is central banker speak for “yields are too high, knock it off”.
Since then, swept along by continuing signs of weaker inflation and by dovish cooing by other Fed officials, those yields have pulled back hard. Investors had even been anticipating pretty forceful interest rate cuts in 2024 — quite the turnaround from the historic tightening cycle that has now been running for close to two years.


So after leaving rates on hold this time around, Powell was widely expected to give a subtle wink and a nod to markets that “you’re overdoing it, knock it off”. He did not do that at all. Instead, first he took a bit of a victory lap, observing that the recessionistas had got it all wrong. The Fed’s 5.25 percentage points of rate rises had not nuked the economy after all. Then he confirmed that inserting the word “any” into the Fed statement’s discussion of “the extent of any additional policy firming” was a deliberate acknowledgment that rate rises were likely to be over. It pays to watch the details here.
Then, perhaps most strikingly, he noted that some of the Fed’s rate-setters had trimmed their rate forecasts for the coming years in between Tuesday’s data showing that consumer prices had risen in November and Wednesday’s data showing that producer prices had held steady. Scribbling out forecasts and writing in new ones on the day of the rates decision and report is some pretty intense data dependency. The possibility of cuts was coming into view, he said, and was “also a discussion for us at our meeting today”.


Powell has “out-doved” the market. In response, US government bond prices flew higher, while stocks pushed ever closer to a record high. That ripping noise you can hear is not excited children opening their Christmas presents but the sound of thousand year-ahead market forecasts heading towards a bin. We are already within spitting distance of the market’s consensus forecast for where US yields will end next year.


Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pimco, the world’s largest active bond investment house, suggested that, sure, much could still go wrong, but now might be a time to pat central bankers on the back. “Certain people have been a bit harsh out there in the markets about central banks,” he told the FT before the Fed’s announcement.

“Yeah, they were late [to respond to inflation] but, wow . . . Central banks including the US Fed, in probably one of the environments with one of the highest degrees of difficulty ever . . . they have been able to get us to this point with this level of disinflation and the economy holding up,” he added. “They may go down as one of the most effective central banks when the history books are ultimately written.”


The Fed was not the only game in town this week, however. Outside emerging markets, Switzerland’s central bank also lowered its inflation forecasts, Norway proved to be a fun sponge with a further quarter-point rise, and the Bank of England opted to keep rates on hold but with a solid three of the nine rate-setters voting for a rise. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said she and her colleagues “did not discuss rate cuts at all”.

At this point, macro hedge fund managers and other investors who seek to harness broad global economic trends are rubbing their hands with joy. Generally speaking, the past two years or so have featured the big central banks all pulling in the same direction. With the exception of the Bank of Japan, each of them has been seeking to damp down inflation with hefty rises in interest rates.

Now they are very clearly at different stages in terms of dialling rates back down, and each is dependent on how economic data releases shape up. Electoral cycles are also not synchronised. With investors unusually closely focused on fiscal policy, that means different major bond markets and currencies are likely to swing around in relation to each other. 


“As a macro strategist, this is what I dream about,” said John Butler, head of macro at Wellington Management in London. “This is the best macro environment I’ve experienced in 30 years.”
It could still be the case that the Fed is forced to eat humble pie and jack up rates again next year. Similarly, no one truly knows whether an ugly recession will land.

"If the latest craze on Wall Street -- private credit -- sounds familiar, that's because it's largely a new label on an old wine. It’s the newest phase of the “junk” debt revolution that started in the bond market with Michael Milken in the 1980s, spread to syndicated loans in the 1990s and turned the market loose on the staid business of lending. The history of leveraged debt is the history of the modern financialized US company—one worth revisiting as private credit kicks into high gear.

Old school buffet types will jump on this after the strong holiday season. This fits there bill of a long running dividend stock that has fallen on some hard times. If they recover they could jump back to the ~30bn cap range they had been at for most of the 2010’s.

They have a ton of staff and they did some layoffs. More to come. They have a ton of room to improve their operational efficiency across brands, and the new kid from Logic-tech will probably get us there if he can find a better leader for vans.

"Nassim Taleb, in his 2012 book *Antifragile,* expanded on an interesting idea known as the Lindy Effect — If something has been around for a long time, then the probability that it will stick around for a longer is high.

This partially explains why people still read Shakespeare and Socrates but forget the bestsellers from the last decade.

&gt;*If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years.*

*""This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not “aging” like persons, but “aging” in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!*

*For the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy. For the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy. —* ***Nassim Taleb***

Half of all companies fail within five years, and 80% in the first 20 years. However, some companies become outliers and survive for hundreds of years. So, in theory, the Lindy Effect applies to companies.

Take Coca-Cola, for example — The company was founded in 1892 and survived the Great Depression, two World Wars, and the 1980s Cola wars, just to name a few. Not only did the company survive all this, it has thrived and increased its dividends for the **past 61 consecutive years**. Based on the Lindy Effect, Coca-Cola has a better chance of making it to the next century than Google.

If you are a value investor, **this is an important but often overlooked factor**. Ultimately, the company valuation is based on the [present value of future cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp). The problem with the current valuation technique is that we always project that the company will survive in perpetuity.

This is why it becomes so hard to value companies in their growth stage. A classic example is that during the dot-com bubble, economist Burton Malkiel pointed out that at Cisco’s implied growth rate *(Cisco was only 15 years old at that time)*, it would become larger than the entire U.S. economy within 20 years.

But, once a company has matured, it will have an established brand, a loyal customer base, and a strong market position, making it easier to assign a fair value to the company. Buffett understands this intuitively, and it’s one of the key reasons why he only invests in established companies — The average age of the top 10 holdings of Berkshire is 113 years, with seven companies older than 100 years!

&amp;#x200B;

[Berkshire Hathaway's top 10 holdings](https://preview.redd.it/bptw1q4iwk6c1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01019dfd2d53fe602797db03fde6a63eb829f74)

**Performance of Lindy stocks**

Survival is only half the story.

What I am really curious about is how legacy companies have performed over the long run. On one hand, older firms will have better structure, more efficient processes, better levels of productivity, and an easier time attracting new talent. But, on the downside, older firms will have a negative base effect *(they tend to be larger)*, lower sales growth, and tend to move slowly.

To test this, I am leveraging this [excellent dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByM9tCWE6-H2U2JSc2tZejBZZmc/view?resourcekey=0-v9AkAh0mCDGprL5_Q8M1tQ) created by Boris Marhanovic, where he consolidated all public companies in the U.S. that were more than 100 years old. There were 485 companies on the list, and after some data cleaning, we are left with 73 target companies that we can consider as Lindy stocks.

https://preview.redd.it/6s9zlofjwk6c1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6ca5a13963c5416838f867d02700c02c73d7c8

To give you a flavor of the type of companies that we are investing in, below are the top 10 companies from our list of Lindy stocks.

[Fun Fact: General Electric was the largest company in the world in 2001. Now it’s 60th in the S&amp;P 500.](https://preview.redd.it/htfl8iakwk6c1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5742ff7a93461c84ca7b0c9b6a339f46a18aec)

The results are surprisingly in favor of the Lindy stocks.

**$100 invested in Lindy stocks would have grown into $776** ***(676% return)*** **compared to only $486** ***(386% return)*** **if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500.**

The cherry on top was that this outperformance was achieved with comparable portfolio volatility (12.3%) and max drawdown (55%) to that of the S&amp;P 500.

https://preview.redd.it/4qopnahlwk6c1.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97973ccc1be40ad304cbe234664e355f3aba3fe1

**Winners, losers, and some caveats**

As with all portfolios, power laws are applicable here as well. A few of the winners contributed a major chunk of our portfolio gains. Even though we filtered for a minimum of $1 billion company valuation *(as of 2000)*, firms like Moody’s, Equifax, Hershey, etc. managed to give us a 1,000%+ return.

https://preview.redd.it/thmkujsnwk6c1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db76413c3c5e18e5a7a8e75d571ed51b62742c1

But being a 100-year-old legacy company did not prevent you from wipeouts. GE was the biggest company in the world in 1999, and it has fallen by 25% in the last 20 years! This is the same period during which the S&amp;P 500 was up \~400%! Other famous names include Citigroup, which never regained from the Global Financial Crisis, and Unis\*s Corporation, which never actually survived the dot-com bubble.

https://preview.redd.it/b6ebso7rwk6c1.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e1911fbf2381e7bafe11c21e13059a0d80130f9

The astute among you might have noticed that we equally split the investments across our Lindy portfolio. If we do a market-cap-weighted portfolio, the results are not so impressive, and the portfolio slightly underperformed the market. This was mainly due to the biggest companies in the list *(GE (12.5%), Corning (9%), and Exxon Mobil (7.5%))*, all underperforming the market during the past two decades.

https://preview.redd.it/rnqlmqgswk6c1.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6115b9b64da6a9b7505341cbce78a73ea4cd24

There are a few more limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate this *\[Portfolio raw data and holdings are shared at the end of the sheet\]*

* Our portfolio is not rebalanced annually, nor is it updated every year *(with the new companies that make it into the 100-year list)*
* The analysis is prone to survivorship bias — Given that we started with companies that were surviving as of 2017, there might be other 100-year-old companies that died off between 2000 and 2017.
* I believe a few, less objective quality checks like the industry tailwind, management competence, etc. could have improved our returns considerably more.

So in 1967 there was a war or something (I've done like 4 seconds of DD but time is sensitive here) and the Suez canal shut down for 7 years. During that time dry tonnage globally went up 20X. The shipping route around the cape is only like 60% longer than thru the canal, but I guess when shit hits the fan people freak out 

Anyways STNG is breaking out to new highs and I barely know shit about this so naturally I bought a bunch of the Jan 2025 90calls to be safe

Oh yeah also STNG bought back 27% of their shares in the last 12 months and is currently trading below book value. Really hard to know what the real value of these ships are since people aren't really building them anymore, but I think that means replacing them is even harder. Apparently shipping dry tonnage is gonna go down in 2026 as ships get deprecated. This is all I know good luck to all

"There seems to be a pervasive idea that something terrible has to happen to get stocks to go down. ""Bears are betting on a once in a lifetime depression"" or whatever. Here's my analogy explaining why I don't think this is necessarily the case.

Imagine you are betting with your friend on how many points Lebron James will score in tonight's game.

Your friend says if he scores 40 or more points, you owe them $10. If he scores less than 40 points, they owe you $10. 

Even though Lebron is one of the best ever, the ""bar"" of him having to score 40 points or more is an extremely high expectation. 40 points is physically possible but it's way beyond what would be considered a reasonable expectation for him in an average game (closer to 27 points).

This is how the market is priced right now. Yes, the companies pushing the market higher are of very high quality (they are the Lebrons of the business world). **But** many of them are priced as if they are definitely going to score 40 points at the next game so to speak. 

Even if they come out and score 36 points (which would be an very solid performance), that is still a loss relative to where the bar is.

Replace the 40 point line with analyst expectations and P/E ratios and that is the bear thesis in my view. You don't even necessarily need a recession to disappoint the 2024 expectations. You just need anything less than an exceptional year of economic boom. 

Now, I'm not saying I know exactly where the market is going to go or anything. All I'm really saying is that expectations are quite high and there can be disappointment even if the economy is growing and relatively healthy.",A different look at the bear thesis through the lens of a basketball bet with your friend,18j2gni,1702653624.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18j2gni/a_different_look_at_the_bear_thesis_through_the/,

"Costco had their Q1 2024 Earnings announcement today and dropped that they will be giving a $15 special dividend on Jan 12, 2024...

This will total $6.7 billion paid out to shareholders.

The snapshot is going to be taken on Dec 28, 2023 in case anyone wants to capture the dividend. Stock I imagine drops right after the snapshot date.

But the stock is over $600 and you'll likely be front run by bots. Oh well, let's see the run up that comes with this.

[Source here](https://www.stockocean.com/post/costco-announces-record-breaking-15-special-dividend)

**UPDATE**: Getting a lot of comments explaining special dividends. Yes, in theory, special dividends have 0 net value creation since you are taking cash from the balance sheet to pay out shareholders. If a stock is $100 and you pay a $15 per share dividend, you receive $15 in cash your stock is worth $85.

However, in practice stock prices can be driven up by special dividends due to perceived limited opportunity, potential positive investor sentiment, and dividend capture traders. Market psychology can be irrational! 

A stock will often trade up before the ex-dividend date (day stock trades without value of next dividend). Thus the real winners are existing shareholders. Someone owns the stock at $100, special dividend announced, stock trades up to say $110, dividend paid out of $15. Now shareholder left with $95 stock price and $15 in cash or a $10 net increase.

For Costco, the stock price was $630 at close yesterday before the announcement, and in pre-market trading the stock is already $642... There are also other factors like Costco Q1 2024 earnings beat. Investors have generally found the announcement positive but it's impossible to ignore other factors affecting the price.

Do what you want with the stock, but there is no free money.

- GDP has been holding steady and increased Q3 2023. 
- Inflation is down to 3.1%, which is a pretty good landing given the above and where inflation used to be at like 9% in 2022
- Loans and high interest rate, well yeah we've been hiking those up, a bank or two broke sure but that was contained, and now we're going to cut rates next year. Doesn't seem like people are defaulting on loans left and right either.

"Well, my gamble on human emotions today failed.  I lost my $1400 gain from yesterday as SPY and QQQ fell. The DTE on those options are tomorrow, but I’m not holding out much hope.

Though as a consolation, my joke F call of 11.5 rose exponentially. And all I had in there was $16 dollars. At least it’s now $450, but still…!

Though considering how the market will be next year with at least two rate cuts; I’ll take what little I have tomorrow and put it in an FSLR call.

Even though I got screwed out by the opening bell today; I feel it has potential to climb over the next 6 months.  Maybe a rate cut in between then and now, which would help stimulate the housing market and subsequent retrofits such as solar.

"It’s the “I Told You SO” guy and I hate to piss on your “inflation dead bro” parade. Fellow regards, inflation is already entrenched in the system. It has moved from goods to services (which is what 70% of US consumers spent on) and it’s nearly impossible to remove without a severe recession--which is nowhere in sight. While the inflation in goods has been caused by supply chain shocks, commodities spike, and money printing, those have pretty much gone away now. However, they have shifted toward services where labor costs are the main cause! Wages are very sticky and folks are not willing to take pay cuts just to save the economy from inflation. At the same time, people are still spending like no tomorrow so there are no reasons for businesses to stop hiring people or raising wages.

Where the f\*\*k are all you broke ass Mfers got money to buy all these stuff! Do you think Arthur Burns, oops I mean Jay Powell, will cut rates with this kind of stupid spending? He is raising rates to tame down on demands so you all stop spending! He is asking you regards to STOP buying/trading monkey jpegs and imaginary tokens, and do you really think he is succeeding??? Do you think he is done? With an unemployment rate at 3.7%? 

Do you think this time is different? Do you think the Phillips curve and the law of economics will be suspended in mid-air? For regards that don’t know, the Phillips Curve represents the relationship between unemployment and inflation. You cannot have low inflation with low unemployment. Unless the inflation number and/or unemployment number are rigged.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

Jay Powell has failed to get the US consumers to stop spending. Without a recession, prices for services will NOT go down voluntarily! Rate cuts in 2024 will only pour gasoline on the inflation fire. POWELL KNOWS THIS! He does not want to be known as Arthur Burns!!! He is using  one of the tools from the FED toolkit which is to jawbone you to think P1v0t is coming! It’s NOT. The US economy is almost 70% consumers spending and until you monkeys stop spending, there will be no recession. There’s no reason for him to risk inflation skyrocketing back up again! With the markets up (DOW at record high, SPY close to record high), the wealth efforts will pour more gasoline on the fire.

"Ok indulge me eventually small cap growth stock going to be too cheap, and large cap tech will become too expensive. Most fund will have to do a rebalance. Which is why when a large cap over extend itself you see a small pull back. Some come from individual investors cashing in but the major movers are from large 401k fund rebalancing.
Because say they want 80 percent large cap and 20 small for example.

"Lately, I'm becoming more convinced that biotech was just another bubble waiting to burst. As expected, only the best are surviving.

Firstly, a bunch of biotech companies is constantly dealing with the FDA, then lawsuits, then FDA again, and it goes on and on. In recent cases, for instance, Fibrogen is in the process of [settling its mess](https://11thestate.com/cases/fibrogen-shareholder-settlement) over an anemia drug, lots of companies accused of not disclosing FDA investigations properly, and it turns out, it's not just investigations but potential patent revocations. Many other companies, like Bloom Energy and Kiromic, had troublesome IPOs (and I won't even mention Kiromic's performance).

In my view, the fact that biotech companies are constantly facing lawsuits is a downward slide for all of them, which signals a decline in performance and overall dynamics (just my humble opinion tho).

"Okay guys, quick one here! Costco Wholesale (COST) is dropping its fiscal first-quarter results after today's market close. Despite a dip in splurge spending, Costco's knack for value deals and smoother supply chains should give their sales and earnings a nice boost this quarter. So calls? That's my guess, but let's actually look deeper into why. 

For those living under a rock, Costco is that giant retailer selling everything from avocados to TVs. In the past year, these guys have beaten Wall Street's earnings guesses two thirds of the time. This is pretty good. For this quarter, they're guessing it'll will hit $3.41 per share, up 11% from last year's $3.07. Sales? They're expected to climb 6.1% to a hefty $57.75 billion.

Last quarter showed some interesting stats: U.S. sales barely budged, up just 0.2%, while Canada saw a nicer 1.8% jump. The real party was in their ""Other International"" segment, which skyrocketed by 5.5%. Overall, Costco managed a 1.1% uptick in comparable sales.

Globally, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, with a 5% rise in the U.S. alone. But, the average spending per trip dipped by 3.9% worldwide and 4.5% in the States.

Turning to Q1, let's not forget the big picture: consumer spending trends, inflation, and Costco's smart plays. They're keeping members happy and cash registers ringing, thanks to their customer-first approach, strategic pricing, and kickass merch initiatives.

Costco's magic formula? Sell stuff cheap and keep the customers coming. This, combined with shrinking supply-chain costs and a stronger push for their own brands, is expected to spice up their results.

For the quarter we're eyeing, expect a solid 5.5% bump in net sales (as mentioned before) but also a 5.2% increase in membership fees. Costco's paid membership base is growing steadily, thanks to more customers and solid renewal rates. There are rumours of a price hike in membership cost. If this is the case, the stock WILL get a huge bump up. 

But hey, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. We've got inflation and high-interest rates lurking around, potentially messing things up. Also, keep an eye on those margins, especially with rising labor costs, store expenses, and potential SG&amp;A rate issues.

This is more akin to gambling, but I'm banking on that membership raise. It's been years since they've increased the price, and we got netflix over here increasing their membership multiple times a year. [But this is literally what I said in my last COST post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16svsgy/cost_to_the_moon_yolo_time_as_earnings_drop_today/). Last time I posted about Costco, the stock was in the 300s. Now it's at the 600s, based the stock climbing on the very same fundamentals mentioned there.

"Sweet baby JPow gave us an early Christmas!

I can see clearly now the rain is gone!

We had peak inflation a year ago, peak recession, peak fear of war, and it has all gone away. All the bear boogie monsters are gone. There is nothing ahead of us but salvation!

Oh lawwwd thank you Jesus! We bulls are gonna be rich!

Just kidding. 

When has the overuse of exclamation points not been the mark of a moron?

As I explained a few weeks ago, this is the rally bears needed. 

You don't crash down when everyone is already gloomy, and when the market is already low. The big crashes come from when the market is on a high. 

I also warned that bears were gonna get burned this holiday season, a month ago in another post, when I explained that the stage was set, the ducks were in a row for them to be burned one more time this year. We were about to enter a holiday rally.

I also warned that bulls would get their turn afterwards.

Consequences will bite this market sooner or later. There are too many consequences piled up.

You can't have high rates, inverted yield curve, failing banks, failing retirement funds, collapsing Chinese economy, high cost of living, attractive bond and savings yields, still inflated housing prices from Covid that haven't corrected yet, fewer people able to afford homes, higher mortgages, higher borrowing costs for companies that will weigh on their future quarterlies, without having consequences. 

Remember, we haven't actually seen the full effect from the Fed rates yet. These things take time to seep through and create their domino effect. 

Wait until people are done doing their holiday shopping, and will now have record debt, and consumerism starts getting replaced by defaulting on debt in 2024.

When the reaction to Fed rates pushes unemployment over the edge. 

When inflation cools off and stops giving the illusion that people are spending more, and we realize these companies aren't really making all that money. 

Even when the Fed finally start cutting rates, but the stock market doesn't get lifted much or might even go down, because that has already been priced into this rally, bulls will be left in disbelief. 

When big money is using this rally as their exit liquidity and new bulls who bought high are left as bagholders, the next big dip is gonna create a big panic of new people who weren't ready for this.

Too many bulls are depending on the narrative of ""this is an election year, surely they're not gonna let the stock market go down?"". 

I don't think that's  good enough of a reason to expect a bullrun in 2024. Don't expect a Presidency to look out for your stock picks. 

I only believe in consequences, and reaction for every action. These things can have a longer time fuse than people expect. Bears have been too quick to expect it in the past year.

Rate cuts doesn’t mean the printer is coming back for fun. It means the printer is coming back due to need.

The broad economy is in a very high risk position right now and the global economy is deteriorating by the day. The market and economy are not reflecting the reality of the other.

-M2 money supply is decreasing at it’s fastest pace since the Depression

-China is in deflation

-Canada is on the verge of recession

-Germany is on the verge of recession

-CEO’s are beginning to discuss deflation potential

-The consumer is being hammered with student loans and high interest borrowing

-Freight is in recession

-California is in recession

-Available jobs are decreasing much quicker than expected

Rate cuts are great if people have jobs and money. Rate cuts are a lot less fun when millions of people are losing their jobs, the consumer halts spending, corporate earnings tank, housing supply rises due to the need to sell due to job losses and outpaces buyer demand and starts decreasing everyone’s sweet Covid equity gains.

In the intricate dance of financial markets, Disney's stock performance during election cycle years in America has historically exhibited a positive rhythm. Investors often find comfort in the company's diversified portfolio, spanning entertainment, media, and theme parks. Amidst the uncertainties of election cycles, Disney's ability to weather economic fluctuations and adapt to changing consumer behaviors stands out. The company's strategic vision, marked by a continuous stream of creative content and technological innovations, resonates well with investors seeking stability. While activist investors loom in the background, their impact remains a nuanced factor, with Disney's robust fundamentals and global brand resonance often steering the narrative towards optimism. This historical trend underscores the company's resilience and strategic foresight, making Disney a notable fixture in portfolios during election years.

Morning lads. By now we’ve all experienced the early market Santa rally. This is seen no better then in the Dow Jones, which WSJ explained “the blue-chip index sets a new all time high record, boosted by hopes for a soft landing, rate stabilization and hype about artificial intelligence”. The traders and I who went long the Dow (aka the Dow Boys) are now the Dough Boys. Tis not just the season to be jolly, but also to be a bull. But, the seasons change.  

Although I’ve been kept comfortably warm by my hot pickings (up 270.15% YTD,  even been able to stock my fireplace with premium wood from Cathie’s) , the scorching pace of the Dow's record-breaking rally will eventually find a cooling breeze. 

Yet, fear not, for amidst this transition allow me to introduce a new opportunity—WEBS. Going long on WEBS, the Direxion Daily Dow Jones Internet Bear 3X Shares, might seem contrary to our bullish instincts, but it's precisely during these record setting rallies that the shrewd investor spots the ripest prospects and hedges. Currently sitting at its all-time low, this is the moment when the seeds of long-term potential are sown. Buying shares now, while WEBS languishes in the abyss, will yield a harvest of juicy gains whenever the market's bearish winds eventually blow, soft or hard. Come make money. 

I’m in this play for 2-6 weeks, tops. Buy at the lowest, and sell higher later (aiming for 11.5-22.69%). Rest assured, during this cherished holiday season, I’ll be enjoying the warmth of the fireplace, having s’mores, reaping this year profits and sowing my WEBS seeds during the winter.

"So, I’m a supervisor at Wendy’s and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It’s so bad I struggle to believe it’s human, it’s full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don’t know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that’s the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy’s is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.

Anyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it’s interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy’s outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, “oh shit you’re a 🌈🐻 too?!?”. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy’s and may or may not be down $128k. To say I’m f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it’s obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I’ve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They’re virtually free and will pay off millions. It’s only logical.

Anyway, now I’m freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I’ve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.

Problem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I’ve tried calling the police since it’s trespassing, but I can’t get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I’ve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy’s money?

In hindsight, I don’t actually think it’s smart enough to know what I’m doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.

Is anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don’t need any investing advice, I’ve got it all under control.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCE DISPUTES: UPDATE TO THE ISDA ARBITRATION GUIDE

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has published an updated guidance on the use of an arbitration clause with an ISDA Master Agreement. The 2018 ISDA Arbitration Guide, published in December 2018, includes an expanded range of model arbitration clauses adapted for use with ISDA’s Master Agreements for a larger number of arbitration institutions and seats around the globe. It updates ISDA’s first ISDA Arbitration Guide published in 2013.

Increasing use of arbitration in resolving financial disputes

Historically, finance parties have referred their disputes to litigation, preferring the known of domestic courts. In recent years, however, increasing focus has come on the use, and potential advantages, of international arbitration for cross-border finance transactions.

To that end, between 2011 and 2013, the ISDA conducted a wide-ranging consultation of its members regarding the use of arbitration for disputes arising out of its Master Agreements, leading to its publication of the 2013 ISDA Arbitration Guide. In 2016, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) published an influential report on financial institutions and arbitration, and data from international arbitral institutions and surveys of in-house counsel and practitioners have highlighted numerous reasons why international arbitration is gaining popularity with parties to cross-border financial transactions.

There are a number of important reasons for why arbitration is increasingly utilised by finance parties (reflecting why international commercial arbitration is best practice for cross-border commercial disputes generally), as outlined below",Protocol: ISDA 2023 Equity Swap – Protocol Adhering Organization:AllianceBernstein L.P.

# Argentina’s new government devalues peso by more than 50%

Argentina has devalued its currency, the peso, by more than 50% as part of a package of large-scale spending cuts intended to address the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.

The plans, introduced under the **newly inaugurated administration of Javier Milei**, include cutting energy subsidies and cancelling tenders for public works.

His economy minister, Luis Caputo, moved to weaken the official exchange rate to 800 pesos a dollar – it had been 366.5 – in a televised address after the local markets closed on Tuesday. He said the central bank would **target a monthly devaluation of 2%**.

Caputo said the moves, which were welcomed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would be painful in the short-term but were needed to cut the country’s fiscal deficit and bring down soaring triple digit inflation.

Argentina’s central bank is due to announce new monetary measures on Wednesday.

“The objective is simply to avoid catastrophe and get the economy back on track,” Caputo said, in a recorded speech. **“There is no more money.”**

He said the country needed to tackle a deep fiscal deficit he put at 5.5% of gross domestic product, arguing that Argentina had an “addiction” to fiscal deficits, 113 over the last 123 years.

“We’re here to solve this problem at the root,” he said. “For this we need to solve our addiction to a fiscal deficit.”

The South American country, a large grain producer, has an **inflation rate nearing 150%**, central bank reserves deep in the red and two-fifths of the population in poverty. Other measures announced include halving the number of government ministries.

Argentina also has a $44bn (£35bn) loan with the IMF.

“I welcome the decisive measures,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, calling it “an important step toward restoring stability and rebuilding the country’s economic potential”.

The IMF described the measures as “bold” and said they would “help stabilise the economy and set the basis for more sustainable and private sector-led growth” after “serious policy setbacks” in recent months.

Argentina’s foreign exchange and grains markets had been locked down on Tuesday as traders awaited the new government’s economic plan. Banks had already anticipated a sharp devaluation, with some weakening their foreign exchange rate to 700 pesos a dollar.

Since 2019, the Argentinian peso has been kept artificially strong by strict capital controls that create a wide gap between the official exchange rate of 366 a dollar and **parallel rates as high as 1,000 a dollar**. **\[**[**Unofficial Dollar rate**](https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/)**\]**

“We’re always worse off because our response has been to attack the consequences but not the problem,” Caputo said in his address. “What we’ve come to do is the opposite of what they always did, and that’s solve the root problem.”

YOUR PHONE ISN'T A TELEPHONE ANYMORE. IT'S DIRECT ACCESS TO YOUR POCKET. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CAPITALISM, ITS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR DEVICES, ITS ABOUT WHAT YOUR DEVICES CAN DO TO YOU.

That's why Elon Musk wanted to buy Twitter. It's not because he wanted to own Twitter. It's because he wanted to be inside of your pocket. **Let that sink in.**

So lets take another look at the beaten-down EV stock that is Fisker. Since my first post, the market cap has been reduced by over $100,000,000.00. It's right around 1/2 a billion now.

This despite the fact that you can literally order, pay for, and take delivery of an actual functioning automobile. Not in the future, but, like, right now.

[This automobile has already been manufactured. It is functional and for less than seventy grand you can make it yours, but only if you want to explain to people five years from now why you own a car that was build by a megalomaniac that cucked you into overpaying for an EV that doesn't work right.

Alright, lets talk about the penalty box. Why is Fisker in it and what does it have to do with my options that expire on Friday?

The 'Penalty Box' is a special place in the stock market reserved for naughty companies that do naughty shit. Things like fucking up their financials and then cycling through two CFO's in a month. This gives the street good reason to suspect that things are not well - at a financial level and (more importantly) at an organizational level. Critics of Fisker will say that putting a designer in the CEO seat is like putting a lunatic in charge of the asylum. And they're not wrong. Fisker is almost certainly a victim of the Peter Principle, which states that someone who is talented at their job will eventually get promoted up to the level where they are incompetent and then they will remain there for the duration of their career.

Okay. Lets do some chart analysis. Has Fisker really been going over a cliff, like Thelma and Louise?

&amp;#x200B;

[Is it really like this? Or is there another explanation?](https://preview.redd.it/ft9pf513d66c1.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48dec7f5f514f3b82e1acba9d38177977530e10d)

&amp;#x200B;

[Some advanced chart analysis shows that the downward trend since early October was intercepted by the fibonacci arc with a fulcrum located right around Jan 1 2024. Also notice that volume has increased since earnings. This is what institutional investors refer to as the 'accumulation' period. It's when you buy from fear in the hopes of selling to greed 5-10 years from now.](https://preview.redd.it/dyml40m7e66c1.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea1b8a89d22ea64c21b81f8704f1ae8f28db342)

I'm not sure what luck Fisker will have in locating a bottom soon. Since my last post, it looks like the smart money has been in shorting the stock into oblivion. Every share sold short is not only a bet that the stock goes to zero, but it lowers the share price just a little bit, making it harder for the company to float shares into the market and accumulate the capital it needs to survive.

Today, however, something changed. It looks like companies that rely on cheap capital to survive may  have been thrown a lifeline by none other than our favorite money printer... JPOW.

&amp;#x200B;

[Why did markets get a boner today? Because everyone likes cheap money. But ya know who REALLY likes cheap money? Companies that need to borrow in order to survive.](https://preview.redd.it/21zmx3sjf66c1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d3a39d16ed8522a033941de69a89b83e78199d)

My thesis on Fisker remains unchanged. The company is undervalued based on my own valuation system. They are undervalued based on basic forward-looking earnings. They are under-valued based on the existing stock of finished product that is awaiting delivery. They are undervalued based on my own subjective analysis of their design fundamentals - which I think are excellent and beyond that, THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES ARE TIME-TESTED. Henrik Fisker is not a new-comer. He's got a proven track record and more importantly, he's got a chip on his shoulder.

Disregard my advice at your own peril. Here's how I did in the markets today:

&amp;#x200B;

[If you made more money than me today, feel free to go about your business. But I only obey one rule: COFFEE IS FOR CLOSERS. If you made less than $8,742 in the stock market today than sit the fuck down. ](https://preview.redd.it/87gej92mg66c1.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732772c5cf2b59c358b584a68813970b2a3c2ae8)

Ah yes, and the obligatory 'ITS wAlL sTrEeT BeTs, lET'S maKE iT sHoRt sQUeEze!' data:

&amp;#x200B;

[38&amp;#37; of the float is sold short. That means that once the stock finds a bottom, 38&amp;#37; of the shares need to be bought back. This will not be a squeeze to the moon. This will just be a general upward pull over a long period of time.](https://preview.redd.it/yln2thxdi66c1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450726c2e47bdd5b09850b867d6b15ca2d5cb724)

&amp;#x200B;

My positions:

&amp;#x200B;

[I own 4000 shares at $2.16 average. This is less than 1&amp;#37; of my overall portfolio and I would recommend that you keep your own position small enough that it doesn't interrupt your kids college plans. But who am I kidding... your kids aren't that bright anyways.](https://preview.redd.it/ku4vywn4h66c1.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa6739060b02e578a0d3ac6bfd186e7ad192bfcc)

TLDR:

If you have two brain cells to rub together, you'll see that Fisker is undervalued. It is a functional car company that will possibly survive the 'GREAT EV SHAKEOUT'. Long-dated $2 calls or accumulate a position with an average less than $2.

" Hi all

I came across this article - why will the stock market go down?

&amp;#x200B;

""Equity markets in Europe and the US look stretched on every front: flows, momentum and technical levels — leaving little headroom if the message from Chair Jerome Powell disappoints. With the S&amp;P 500 just 3% short of a record and the Euro Stoxx 50 Index near its highest level since 2001, the stakes haven’t been this elevated before a Fed meeting since the rates pause in July.

A speedy switch from short-to-long equities by commodity trading advisers, who usually trade on market momentum, has been a major factor behind the $4.6 trillion rally in US stocks since Oct. 27. The shift has now left CTAs sitting on a $106 billion in long bets, which Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says leaves them more inclined to sell, rather than buy.

“We have this cohort modeled to sell S&amp;P 500 in every scenario over the next week,” Goldman’s derivatives and flow specialist Cullen Morgan wrote in a note to clients. It follows a warning from his colleagues last week that dangerously high optimism on stocks means there are “no longer any bears left.”

Trend and momentum indicators are still green for Europe and the US, while only Asian markets are showing some signs of weakening. What’s more, nine out of the 11 top performing benchmarks are now showing relative strength indicators in overbought territory, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

No matter which way markets go, Goldman says CTAs are modeled to sell S&amp;P 500 futures in the next week.

According to Morgan, if equities make an upward move, CTAs will have $20 billion worth of stocks to buy, but $1.3 billion in S&amp;P 500 futures to sell. In a downward-move scenario, they would need to sell $5 billion of stocks and $1.9 billion of S&amp;P 500 futures. Even in a flat market, while CTAs will need to buy $18 billion of global stocks, they would sell $436 million in S&amp;P 500 futures.

A potential drop in markets could be further accelerated by other technical traders as the S&amp;P 500 Index has just broken above its summer highs, with a failure by the gauge to move beyond that mark potentially seen as a signal for the first short-term corrective move since the rally started in late October. The asymmetry in these flows comes at a point where policy makers could feel they need to rein in markets as bets on monetary easing and rate cuts build ever-higher expectations.\*",Can somebody put this into layman's terms?

Hello everyone,

I'm  looking for some insights into the mathematics or the economic  reasoning behind the potential capital inflow into Bitcoin around the  time of a Bitcoin ETF approval. There's a lot of speculation and  predictions, but I'm curious about the concrete estimations or models  that might explain this event and its potential impact on Bitcoin's  price.

Specifically, there are  predictions suggesting Bitcoin could reach $100k by 2024 and $150k by  2025, partly attributed to the ETF approval. Can anyone shed light on  how these figures are estimated? What are the key factors or models that  can help understand this expected surge?

Any  detailed explanation or resources on the math behind these predictions  would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to get a better grasp of how  such significant price milestones are calculated in relation to major  market events like an ETF approval.

"Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal, though operating in distinct domains, share several commonalities as prominent tech companies. Both entities are recognized as tech giants with a significant global presence. Meta, known for its focus on social media, virtual reality, and augmented reality, connects people worldwide through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, PayPal stands as a leading digital payments platform, facilitating secure online transactions on a global scale.

These companies demonstrate a commitment to digital innovation, each in their respective fields. Meta's ventures into virtual reality with Oculus and augmented reality showcase its dedication to pushing technological boundaries. Similarly, PayPal has pioneered online payment solutions, emphasizing the importance of seamless and secure digital transactions.

A user-centric approach is a shared characteristic, with both Meta and PayPal prioritizing user experience. Meta's goal is to foster global connections and communication, while PayPal focuses on providing a convenient and secure environment for digital payments, connecting buyers and sellers internationally.

Strategic acquisitions have played a key role in the expansion of both Meta and PayPal. Meta's acquisitions include Instagram and WhatsApp, augmenting its social technology portfolio. On the other hand, PayPal has strategically acquired companies such as Braintree and Venmo to enhance its digital payment offerings.

While these companies exhibit similarities in their global reach, commitment to innovation, user-centric focus, and strategic acquisitions, it's essential to recognize that their core businesses and industries diverge, with Meta primarily operating in the realm of social technology and PayPal specializing in digital payments.

Historically, Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal have exhibited similar stock trading patterns, influenced by broader factors in the technology sector. Commonalities arise from shared exposure to tech industry trends, general market sentiment, and macro-economic conditions. Investor behavior, including demographics and institutional ownership, contributes to parallel movements, as does the impact of competitive landscape changes on both companies. Earnings reports and performance metrics, such as revenue growth and profit margins, can lead to comparable stock reactions. Additionally, the global expansion of both Meta and PayPal, coupled with their reliance on technology adoption trends, further aligns their stock trajectories. While these broad factors contribute to historical similarities, comprehensive analysis considering specific company dynamics and evolving market conditions remains essential to understanding their individual stock behaviors.

"Yo guys, check this out: Adobe (ADBE) is totally killing it thanks to the AI wave. We’re talking a massive 44% jump in the past half-year, ranking highly in the basket of software stocks that have enjoyed investor enthusiasm. The stock has risen 80% year to date, blowing the S&amp;P 500’s 19% rise out of the water. The real question on everyone’s mind: can Adobe keep this wild ride going?

Get ready for the big reveal as Adobe drops its Q4 fiscal 2023 earnings after today’s market close. The street's looking for earnings of $4.14 per share, up from last year’s $3.60. Sales are expected to hit around $5.03 billion, which is a solid 10.81% jump from last year.

But here’s where it gets spicy: Wall Street big shots, like JPMorgan’s Keith Weiss, are betting big on Adobe. Weiss is all in with an Overweight rating and a sky-high $660 price target. He’s vibing with Adobe’s AI game, especially with its Firefly project. Weiss is pretty much saying, “Chill, Adobe’s got this,” expecting them to crush FY24 estimates across the board. Weiss believes investors should feel ""very comfortable"" with the company's ability to monetize generative artificial intelligence. 

Mizuho’s Gregg Moskowitz is eyeing Adobe’s accelerated web traffic, hinting at a juicy boost in digital media revenue. I expect this to boost Adobe’s digital media segment annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. He’s also hyped about Firefly, Adobe’s latest AI brainchild, calling it a potential major growth engine. This aligns with Adobe’s master plan to play the long game for success.

As mentioned previously, for the quarter that ended November, we expect the company to earn $4.14 per share on revenue of $5.03 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $3.60 per share on revenue of $4.53 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to rise 18% year over year to $15.93 per share, while full-year revenue of $19.38 billion would climb 10 % year over year.

Adobe’s deep dive into generative AI is causing a serious buzz. They’re rolling out cool new tools like Firefly and Generative Fill, and teaming up with Google's Bard AI. Firefly is set to jazz up Bard’s text-to-image game, letting users whip up images with just words like Dalle-3. Thus far, Adobe's execution has been nothing short of stellar as evident from its third quarter results, during which it beat on both the top and bottom lines.

Get this: Adobe just flexed hard in Q3, raking in a monster $464 million in new Digital Media recurring dough. But wait, there’s more - their operational cash flow? A whopping $1.87 billion. And get this: they’re sitting on a treasure trove of $15.72 billion in Performance Obligations ready to roll. But hold up, because Adobe ain’t done yet. They’re cranking up their full-year revenue goals, now eyeing a beefy range of $19.25 to $19.35 billion, up from the previous $19.1 to $19.3 billion prediction. Talk about moving the goalposts – in the right direction! 🚀

Adobe’s subscription revenue and new user growth are on fire. Come tonight, we’ll see if they can keep up the momentum and if their AI bets pay off big time. See, I'm gonna go ahead and grab a call spread. Not direct calls because, well, they're just VERY expensive. A call spread is when you buy one call and sell a different call at a higher strike price and same expiry date. This lowers your cost basis. So here, it would be a good idea to grab a ADBE 12/15 625c @ 15.10 and sell the 12/15 650c @ 6.90. THis way you get the whole spread for $820, with a potential max profit of 3x. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.

"How do you decide what to invest in? 

In 2020 when the market crashed I decided to try my hand in investing. I put in $500 and Googled what should I invest in today and just picked a few I thought would be good. I've turned that $500 in to $1,600+. All the stocks I Googled ""what stocks should I buy today?"" I have made money on. Most of my money that I made came from the AVGO stock. Man, I wish I bought more then one share of that one. I got it when it was $200 it's now $1,000+.

All the stocks I've decided to buy on my own because I thought it was a good ""Idea"" like AAL and GTBIF I've lost money. 

Right now, I'm thinking about selling most of my stocks and waiting for the market to crash again and buying a share of the S&amp;P 500 when I think the market has hit it's low point. I'm just a amateur in the stock market but I have a feeling the market to going to crash this spring.

"Picking stock direction is hard. HARD AF. You buy calls and the stock plummets. You puts and then Stonks only go up.

So why not just buy a straddle? Well Theta is gonna get ya. But what if, hear my out, you set a GTC order for 1% over what you purchased your straddle?

Let's say you buy a Long spy straddle expiring on Dec 26, you can get that straddle for a price of 6.65 after fees. How do I know? This highly regarded trader bought one. And then I set a GTC order for 6.72. 

But you might be thinking ""You can lose one hundred percent of your investment!' However, think about what it would take for that to happen. SPY would have to expire AT 465 exactly on Dec 26 to lose everything. At any other point, one of those options has at least some intrinsic value.

The break even is about 1.5% away from the strike, and I have until Dec 26 to make a profit. If I do this and do 1% in 2 weeks, that's like 26% annualized. And every single one of these trades I've done has closed in under 2 weeks. ALL OF THEM. Some even the same day I put them on. I've done like 20. Some of these trades have annualized returns of like 3000%

"In October, the SEC issued the rules aimed at boosting transparency of short selling and securities lending, two connected activities.

The groups say the SEC took conflicting stances with the rules, in one case allowing for transaction reports to be aggregated in order to protect investors' positions, yet at the same time requiring other transaction reports to disclosed individually

In their suit, the groups argue the SEC did not take into account the interconnected nature of the two rules and adopted contradictory approaches, adding as such the rules will harm investors. They also added the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires agencies to justify their rules and consider feedback.

The SEC's October short-selling rule requires hedge funds to report short positions to the regulator, which publishes them with a delay on an aggregate basis in which individual traders remain anonymous. The second rule requires financial firms to make daily reports on individual securities loans, which facilitate their short positions. That data will also be disclosed on a delayed basis.",Hedge fund groups sue US SEC in bid to vacate short-selling rules,18hhqp3,1702476985.0,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/hedge-fund-groups-sue-us-sec-bid-vacate-short-selling-rules-2023-12-12/,
"In a late November filing, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager that looks around around $10 trillion on behalf of clients, updated its bitcoin spot ETF filing to allow Wall Street banks to act as authorized participants, allowing them to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding bitcoin and crypto on their own balance sheets.

"I know many in here are just gamblers who don't think about such things. I'm pretty much the opposite, I buy (and sell) stocks rather than buying options. Occasionally I'll sell an option, but buying is a rare thing, in parts to the very unfavourable tax legislation regarding long option positions in Germany. I backtest my strategies before deploying them. I do risk management instead of YOLOing my life savings.

But I still read in here. Why? To get inspired. I claim to have gotten a lot of my inspiration from a satirical finance YouTuber who doesn't even pretend to give any good advice, instead he makes fun of himself and the finance world. Yet, I got my best ideas from hearing and reading about the worst ones.

Now I read posts like ""I turned 10k into half a million"" here. It's always long options, and it's impossible to do consistently, I know that. But it got me thinking: what if I could predict a stock going up like, say, 5% in the next two weeks? What if I could say so for a stock with absolute certainty, that it will be up 5% from its current price in the next 14 days? Could I, with that knowledge, also 50x my money?

And it's surprisingly hard. There was a thread about AVGO like that recently (on Dec 29 calls, I believe, maybe it was Dec 22). I opened the option chain, and had a look. It closed at 1072.40 yesterday, so let's assume we know it will reach 1126 in the next 14 days. Earliest contract for the 14 day window is Dec 29, so what option could I buy to make the most money here?

Here are some calls, and we compare the current price (midpoint at close) to their intrinsic value when it reaches 1126:

* 1080C costs 26, that would be intrinsic 46 at expiration, or a plus of around 77%
* 1090C costs 17.65, that would be intrinsic 36 at expiration, or a plus of around 104%
* 1100C costs 14.7, that would be intrinsic 26 at expiration, or a plus of around 77%
* 1110C costs 11.9, that would be intrinsic 16 at expiration, or a plus of around 34%
* 1120C costs 9.95, that would be intrinsic 6 at expiration, that's a loss

I ignored spreads and commissions, on the other hand if it happens a bit before expiration there would be some extrinsic value left. But the best we can do is about doubling the investment, which is leverage of a factor 20. Still, it's far away from the 10x or 20x you see here. And using a longer expiration doesn't make things better.

Now if you gambled the 5% jump would happen a week earlier already, things do get better. On the Dec 22 calls, I can get around +170%. But that's still below 3x, on a prediction of a 5% move. And that stock has a quite moderate IV of around 30%. On high-IV stocks this gets way worse. 

Sure, OP in the AVGO thread probably captured a larger move (I guess around 15%, but I don't think he traded through earnings, I believe it was a post-earnings trade), which does help (yes, I could find 10x or more on a 15% change). But still, my impression is some in here are pretty good at finding these 10x or better chances. How is your approach in selecting which options to gamble on?

Again, this is out of curiosity, I hope to gain some insight into the thought process behind it (at least of those of you who have a thought process). ",How do you maximize leverage?,18hdvj9,1702463258.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18hdvj9/how_do_you_maximize_leverage/,
"Just a question about how trading / markets work. Every sale of an asset also includes a buyer. So if someone sells a huge amount of a stock, that means another person or persons bought a huge amount of the same stock. But some are seen as bad for the market (sell-offs, dumping) and some are seen as good (FOMO-ing in, etc). So how is it determined which is which?

Does it depend who put in the order to sell/buy and had to wait? As in someone requested to sell and waited for buyers or vice versa? Or does it depend on who is selling, like a long-term holder? Or maybe the price in question is slightly above or below the market value and that determines it?

"According to Bill Ackman on his twitter, he donated $10mm worth of Coupang (CPNG) shares to Harvard around 2018 because he didn't have cash liquidity (going through divorce, fund underperforming).  

Not only this, Ackman said if the $10mm in shares dipped below $10mm in value, he would personally make up for it in the future. And if the value rose above $15mm, he would have control of where to allocate those donation funds at Harvard.

Three years go by, Coupang is going to IPO at $50 billion. Those shares he gave Harvard are now worth $85 million! 

His enthusiasm quickly turned to anger when he discovered Harvard sold the $10mm in shares back to Coupang on March 2020, at par value for $10mm...

"TL;DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4. Microsoft also provides an ecosystem into which OpenAI's GPTs fit seamlessly. Where does that leave Alphabet if Gemini Ultra doesn't deliver on all its promises? - Google Search, and here again, Microsoft's Bing is catching up, using the power of OpenAI.

This is not financial advice.

The full text can be found [here](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge-b3d78efe3a9c) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/gotterdammerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge/).

""\[...\]Last week Alphabet announced its new AI Gemini, which will be released in 3 different versions: Nano, Pro and Ultra. According to Google Deepmind’s recent report, Gemini Ultra outperforms OpenAI’s GPT 4 in almost all benchmarks. This claim was supported by a video that turned out to be staged (I wouldn’t call it a fake, as the [real prompts were also published](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html)). But if Gemini Ultra is finally superior to GPT 4 and this can be proven by many benchmarks, why does Alphabet continue to hide its prodigy? Why does Alphabet take the risk that OpenAI will release GPT 4.5 in the near future and thus sweep away all the doubts about its superiority?

Hasn’t Alphabet’s innovation lead always been a big part of the investment thesis for Alphabet shareholders? Now Alphabet is trying hard to show that its secret AI, Gemini Ultra, can keep up with the already publicly available GPT 4 — marketing aside, the published report on Gemini Ultra doesn’t say much more than that. An AI is not a gasoline engine. You cannot simply quantify its performance on a scale and then claim that a single-digit percentage difference is evidence of one’s superiority over the other. I am not an expert in quantitative evaluation of AI, but ultimately AI is statistical learning, and in my experience the new generative language models do not always produce reproducible results (especially when generating images). Accordingly, shouldn’t the significance level of the measured performance differences be specified? Couldn’t these rather small differences just be statistical noise in favor of Gemini? Also, the results given are not reproducible because we cannot test Gemini Ultra. And again, if Gemini Ultra is so superior, why can’t we just try it? So has Alphabet lost its edge? I don’t know, but with every statement without a tangible product, my doubts about the company’s superiority grow.

And let’s not forget the giant behind [OpenAI with a 49% stake: Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/30/microsoft-join-openai-board-altman), which has a product ecosystem that literally screams for AI implementations. And I’m not just talking about Word, which will soon be writing for us, PowerPoint, which will magically put together our next presentation, or Excel, which will soon be giving no one a headache: Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are widely used integrated development environments (IDEs) and industry standards. Microsoft’s code-generating bot, Github Copilot, has been available as a plug-in since 2021. So if AI is going to have a real impact on business productivity and therefore our economies, it could be through the infrastructure that Microsoft provides. So even if Gemini Ultra beats GPT4 in many ways and OpenAI cannot deliver a better AI in the near future, Microsoft is providing the services where AI could become a real productivity driver.

And what will Alphabet have left if it loses this AI battle? People use its cash cow, Google Search, today largely because they’ve been used to it for two decades — that’s worth a lot, but maybe Bing can slay even that metaphorical dragon with the magic of OpenAI, unaware of its often-called unbeatable dominance\[...\]""",Has Alphabet Lost Its Edge?,18gwlrv,1702415716.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18gwlrv/has_alphabet_lost_its_edge/,

"The idea I have is to utilize prior day option data, especially IV, volume, and prior price change to project next days price change. The concept is that the high option liquidity influences the price more than the NAV on a day change and idiosyncratic risk is diversified away. I could go further back, and start tuning hyperparamters as I progress. I incorporate rolling 75th and 25th percentiles for the data to give a sense of where the IV, Price, Volume, etc. is relative to trailing periods. 

I did Markov chains with data by putting data into bins, such as price up, price down, and flat, and it was garbage accuracy on back test. I then did a regression and it worked better. Back testing the accuracy is hard with lots of bias areas, but I don't have the resources to back test the trades 100% other than closing prices, as the data is somewhat difficult to obtain closing option prices historically for years for free.

I mainly only care if it's up or down, because I figure I can capitalize on that. I'm still trying to figure out if 0DTE ATM in the direction that my model is pointing me too, or do a 40-60 day option ATM with the same characteristics to not let Theta influence the trades. Alternatively, I just buy or short the stock. Since I switched to regression, I may leverage on higher percent price change predictions. I'd close out at end of the market close and open the next day.


Anyone else have any thoughts or is doing something similar? The medallion fund gives me hope there's a way to obtain returns somehow on data modeling, but I'm just a guy who likes to code and trade.

The previously announced (and now abandoned) sub-IPO of the company's IoT business does not actually eliminate the congolermerate discount applied to BlackBerry as a whole. On top of this, it paints a picture that any IoT growth will be offset by the lackluster performance of the Cybersecurity parent business. If the Cybersecurity business no longer needs capital and can profitably grow on its own, then it's a no brainer to fully separate the two businesses and individually showcase them to the market to maximize shareholder value.

"Hello Readers, 

MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.

To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.

During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. 

Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. 

Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. 

First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.  

Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. 

Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. 

My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. 

Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. 

As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. 

Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. 

Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. 

By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.

Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. 

For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. 

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.

"Greetings, esteemed regards. Allow me to present a thorough examination of Boeing’s current landscape, incorporating both its technological advancements and a prospective breakthrough in the Chinese market.

Commencing with the technological front, check out Boeing’s foray into unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) the [MQ-28](https://www.boeing.com/defense/MQ-28/) demonstrates a pivotal stride in drone fighters. Think drone swarms but for dogfights. Additionally, the [MQ-25](https://www.boeing.com/defense/mq25/) Stingray serves as more versatile extension of the KC-46. The collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, spearheaded by the U.S. Air Force’s interest in procuring 1,000 such units starting in 2024, underscores Boeing’s ascendancy in this evolving field. On the celestial stage, Boeing’s X-37B spaceplane, poised for its seventh mission on [Monday](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/spacex-delays-launch-secret-space-force-mission.amp) via a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, showcases the company’s prowess in cutting-edge aerospace initiatives. This technological prowess aligns with the strategic goals of the United States Space Force (USSF), further solidifying Boeing’s position in this high-stakes arena.

Recently the [Dubai Airshow](https://apnews.com/article/dubai-air-show-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-d2ca068f0c88592c60eb9f11737baa46) emerged as a pivotal juncture. Despite poor performance in recent years, Boeing experienced a resurgence in success, notably outperforming Airbus in new orders. This triumph underscores Boeing’s resilience and market presence. Notwithstanding Boeing’s delivery challenges post-Covid, the sustained influx of buy signals and pressure reinforces market confidence.

Now, onto the most elusive catalyst, this involves [China](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-shares-take-off-report-that-china-may-lift-737-freeze-bumper-dubai-orders-2023-11-13/). Historically strained relations and a freeze on Boeing activities since a 2017 [incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Eastern_Airlines_Flight_5735) set a challenging backdrop. However, recent geopolitical shifts, particularly surrounding the APEC summit where Joe and Xi kissed, may hint at a potential thaw in relations. Notably, speculation arose from a Reuters story suggesting a correlation between APEC and Boeing. This speculation gained credence as institutional players bolstered buy ratings. Delving deeper into this narrative, I found [Boeing Zhoushan](http://www.boeingzhoushan.com/en/aboutUs/), and a [link](https://m.liepin.com/company/9640689/) to Chinese job listings for manufacturing engineers. Finally after a month of edging this gets dropped. Could it be? Lettuce hope.

Before you go busting my balls just ask yourself: Why chad firms (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays GFY) maintain [buy](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ba/analystestimates) ratings from $235 - $270? Why suddenly 46 aircraft deliveries in [November](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-delivers-46-narrowbody-737s-november-sources-2023-12-05/) after such a slump of a year?

"I stumbled upon an intriguing development with MBIA (ticker symbol MBI), where they declared a substantial dividend distribution of $8 per share. At the time of the announcement, the stock was trading slightly above $7. This news triggered a significant surge, pushing the stock to close at over $13 on Friday.  
Let's first understand MBIA's current situation. The company has ceased generating new business and is essentially waiting for existing insurance policies to expire. Consequently, MBIA is currently devoid of income and profit.   
However, the crux of the matter lies in the substantial cash reserves the company holds, currently held by a subsidiary called National. While its balance sheet may show a significant amount of debt, it's crucial to recognize that a significant portion of this debt belongs to MBIA CORP, a subsidiary. There is a legal structure in place ensuring that the parent company, MBIA INC, does not bear any financial responsibility for MBIA Corp. If you remove the debt held by MBIA CORP, the true book value per share is estimated to be in the range of $24-27.  
It's common for investors to anticipate a post-dividend dip in stock value equal to the distributed amount. However, at its current price, it does not seem rational that the stock would trade lower than the price previous to the announcement. If anything, the management's capability to unlock substantial cash reserves, particularly from National, serves as a catalyst for future financial opportunities.  
In essence, the announcement of a significant cash dividend of $8 by MBIA presents a compelling opportunity in this unique situation.",MBI - MBIA $8 Dividend Special Situation,18fixju,1702258162.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18fixju/mbi_mbia_8_dividend_special_situation/,

"TLDR: It has better specs than competitors, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast. 

Ford has had the lightning, Rivian the RT1, and GM technically sells the Hummer but we won’t be including that for obvious reasons. And then there’s CT, the truck everyone on Reddit hates. Although CT is actually the better vehicle in most cases or at the very least comparable. 

**Specs**

Range: RT1 wins by ~15 miles, while Ford is far behind. 

Towing cap: RT1 and CT tie

Rivian and Tesla are pretty neck and neck for most “truck specs” like towing, torque, HP. But Tesla has a larger bed capacity at 2,500lbs vs Rivians 1,760lbs. 

Price: There are no outliers, all have comparable price options. Ford has the lowest priced option, but it has far lower specs than what we’re comparing. 

Cargo: CT wins by 20% given it comes stock with a lockable bed. But it has comparable storage without the bed. It also has the longest bed by almost 6 inches but it’s also the skinniest by 2in. 

Ground clearance: CT wins, Ford is a low rider with almost 10in less than CT. 

CT has better battery efficiency, but the RT1 is extremely aerodynamic. The RT1 is top of the list for aero and overall efficiency. 

Top speed, HP, Bidirectional, are all comparable. Ford being the worst in most cases. 

**CT has many other features that the other two don’t** and they’re cooler than the RT1 gear tunnel. Steer by wire, is not new tech but it’s new to trucks and iirc is only in a handful of vehicles. Reviews are glowing and the industry has been wanting to switch for a while. 

Rear wheel steering, makes the turning radius of CT smaller than the model S. it also helps with merging on highways. 

*800 volt* architecture. This isn’t a new thing but it’s not common and is very important. It means lower current, less wires, more efficient and lighter vehicle. It also means faster charging. The industry has wanted to do this for a while too but hasn’t. Many will follow. This is part of the reason why CT is lighter than both competitors while being covered in steel. 

Also a 48v system vs 12v like most vehicles. This shares similar benefits as above. 

Although it’s kind of a meme, CT also has an extended battery option that sits in the front of the bed similar to a tool box. It’s actually a great deal in terms of onboard battery storage and adds over 100miles of range iirc. Great if you would normally use the truck for its onboard power. 

It’s hardened, scratch proof, and lack of paint will make it great for working conditions. Plus now tesla can’t fuck up your paint on delivery. No more rock chips and you probably won’t ever have to replace any windows, no more smash-n-grabs. 

Infotainment screen in the back seat for passengers. And the largest screen on the market in the front. 

This is somewhat subjective but Fords software and general UI/UX is arguably well below Tesla and Rivian standards. 

Rivian and Tesla both come equipped with advanced cruise control systems. I don’t know much about Rivians capabilities. 

**DD**

I’m sure I’m missing things. But based on specs, the Cybertruck is the better truck. **The issue is the way it looks.** As we’ve seen on Reddit, everyone thinks it looks terrible. Personally I love the way it looks. 

I’m not going to speculate and try and guess how many people might be turned off enough by its looks to not buy it. But we can assume that Tesla will be able to produce a lot of them. Castings are not new to Tesla, these are much larger but even if they’re able to ramp at a fraction of the speed of model Y ramp in Shanghai they’ll be making far more than 100k/year soon. Tesla has said it is possible to hit 250k in two years. 

GM isint in this conversation because they can’t make anything with a battery, Ford only made 15k last year and rivian made 25k. Both companies are losing a massive amount of money on every sale. 

Tesla did say they’d sell CT at a loss if needed, which would imply Tesla isn’t in a loss yet. But given all the new tech I find it a little hard to believe they’re making much on the $80k trim. They’d most likely lose money selling their low trim currently, which would explain why they aren’t selling it. 

With all that said, I strongly believe the CT will be the best selling EV truck rather soon. And will remain there until another more traditional company matches Teslas production.

There’s also a good chance opinions change around its look once more are on roads and other manufacturers make more “radical” looking cars. If this happens there’s little reason to think the CT won’t be a top seller within EV trucks longterm. 

Overall I always thought CT would be great for the company and stock, and after seeing its spec I still feel the same way.

Sure you have models with billions of parameters. But how are companies going to monetize it? Who will be the end user for these AI models?

Example being iphone vs Android - maybe android has lots of new shiny features which the iphone doesn't but who cares. Majority of ppl are not ready to adopt android as the daily phones. Another example being Google vs chatgpt - yes chatgpt might be the new shiny thing which can answer your questions but since the popularity of internet google has been the go to tool for ppl. I think apple is playing this smartly by not heavily investing in something which isn't proven to significantly increase their revenue.

**News and Strategy**

* 10-Year Partnership with ESPN/Disney for ESPN Bets platform (Just launched last month; app has been #1-2 in Sports category since) 
   * Sold Barstool back to Dave Portnoy for a loss in order to pursue ESPN/Disney deal. 
   * Daddy Disney has said many times recently that they see sports as the third pillar of their business. 
* Completed acquisition of theScore in 2021-2022 for market share in Canada (is this a real place?); has reportedly been doing well since and was likely the blueprint for the ESPN deal 
* Official Sports Betting partner of the NHL announced last week 
* NC and VT legalized online sports gambling this year (28 states now) 
* Operates 43 casinos in 20 states; Sports betting in 17 states 

PENN has been building out a casino, online betting, and media flywheel for cross promotion and low marketing costs. They continue to open new regional casinos and have that as a strong foundation to build on. During their announcements with ESPN they mentioned that they will be able to integrate betting crossovers directly into ESPN's media and Fantasy Football apps allowing users to start bets from those apps, carry the slip to ESPN Bet, and finalize there. Their goal is friction-less betting originating from ESPN's massive media audiences.

**Financials**

* Interactive Segment (sportsbook) Revenues climbed 216%, 257%, and 53% from 2019-2022 respectively. 
   * It currently makes up for 10.36% of their total revenue ($663M of $6.401B) in 2022 **prior to launching ESPN Bet.** 
   * Barstool seemed like a failure, but was still able to assist in this growth. I anticipate pairing with a trusted, more professional (sorry Dave) name like ESPN will speed this growth even more. 
* Interactive EBITDAR grew at 221%, -195%, -111.58% (over the same period) respectively. 
   * Due to losses on the Barstool deal, lack of marketing during transition to ESPN, ramping of hiring, and promotional bets. 
   * CEO Jay Snowden in Q3 Earnings call said ""we anticipate accumulated EBITDA losses of Interactive of approximately $300 million... you should expect those to occur mostly in year 1 and year 2, with year 3 inflecting to breakeven or modestly positive EBITDA."" Luckily they have their casino business to back these losses unlike Draftkings and FanDuel. 
* Jay continued to say, ""So there's a lot of that ramping, that has gone into the third quarter result... but we don't have any of the benefits yet of ESPN BET launch. So that's why you see the loss there"" 
   * Sounds like short term pain for long term gain. Market seems to be pricing only short term pain. 
   * Based on ESPN's reach alone compared to, frankly, any other sports company in the country (they are the #1 sports media brand in the nation) their revenue with these cross promotions should no doubt grow quickly over the next few quarters, with EBITDA benefits coming later. 
* They are continuing to purchase more of their own shares in large buybacks ($750M at the call), which gives me even more confidence. 

**Valuation and Comps**

* See below for a matrix of similar competition to PENN including online competitors like DraftKings and FanDuel, and more traditional operators like MGM and Caesars. (Confidence row is an internal adjustment, yes I have reckless optimism...) 
   * Side note, but how tf is Draftkings such a high market cap considering the massive losses they continue to post with marketing spend??
* **They are currently the 2nd smallest market cap** of the 9 even though they have the 3rd largest Net Income, 3rd largest EBITDA, and 4th largest Revenues. 
* Based on 2022 annual Revenues, EBITDA and Net Income and the current Market Cap of these companies, they are trading at an average of 2.7x, 10.41x, and 23.89x respectively. PENN is trading at 0.56x, 2.38x. and 16.08x respectively. 
   * That is 4.84x, 4.4x, and 1.49x higher than PENN respectively. Apply those multiples to the share price and you would get PENN at $115.86, $105.29, $35.56. Even with a huge safety margin PENN is seemingly massively undervalued. 
   * Even excluding some of the outliers PENN is trading so much lower than its competition. 
* **Short Interest in PENN is 12.47%** of Shares Outstanding, 2.83x the average of its competition and 2.11x the next highest in the field (DraftKings). 
* **None of these numbers include added revenue from the ESPN deal yet** since they have not had a quarterly or yearly report since its launch. I think now is a time to buy the stock before that all gets priced in. 

In conclusion, they have created this flywheel of their 3 businesses: casinos, online betting, media. I feel as though even just their deal with ESPN Bet alone would make for a large growth opportunity over the next 10 years, but to add it on top of an existing foundation of their casino business is the icing on the cake. They showed strong revenue growth in their Interactive segment even as the Barstool experiment failed, and have strong margins compared to DKNG and FLTR for online sports betting considering the reach they get from the ESPN integration and in-house tech stack with theScore acquisition.

Someone who's qualified, go look at this stock and tell me if I am crazy.

"As with most IPOs, ARM is overvalued as fuck. Share lockup expires on 3.12.24, and a lot of regards here are waiting until then to buy puts. They will miss out on **HUGE** gains. The play is: ~~FDs~~ **OTM puts expiring 12/15**. I will explain why in this post:

(Skip to end for TL;DR if you can't read -- this is long)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Fundamentals**

ARM has not mooned **40%** from its lows because of its fundamentals.

PE Ratio: 172.4

Forward PE: 66.3 - Over 2.5x NVDAs FW PE.

Forward PS: 21.6 -- This one is especially regarded.

Price/Book - 14.4

A rudimentary look into their numbers shows that the company is probably overvalued by 60-70%. High margin tech companies (which ARM is not) have a trailing Price/Sales of around 6-7. I'd expect that it will probably dump under $25/share by the end of 2024, at MINIMUM. Because things get even worse from here.

Most IPOs have prospects of incredible growth, which shrouds their suspect fundamentals. ARM doesn't have that luxury, as it is oversaturated in many of its markets -- and unable to significantly expand in others.

""We have maintained market share in the mobile applications processor market of greater than 99% for many years"". They can't grow in the smartphone market, and the industry itself is not projected to grow much in the near future. 

""Our market share in the IoT and embedded chip market has grown from 58.4% as of December 31, 2020 to 64.5% as of December 31, 2022"". Growth, but not the type of growth you look for at a P/B over 14.

""Our market share in the cloud compute market has grown from 7.2% as of December 31, 2020 to 10.1% as of December 31, 2022"". They have potential to expand more in this market, but they aren't projecting that they'll be able to do so. 

\^ All from their F-1. 

Because ARMs chips are traditionally more efficient and thus have less power than Intel's x86 architecture, they don't have the current ability to expand in these more lucrative markets that require beefier processors. They already completely control the market in smartphones -- which would be good for them, **if they actually made money off it:**

[Apple makes up less than 5% of Arm's revenue, and Arm can't do anything about it - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/29/apple-arm-licensing-revenue/) 

Some highlights:

""Despite Apple’s reliance on Arm as the instruction set for iPhone chips, **Arm earns less than 5% of its annual revenue from Apple**.""

""Apple pays Arm “**less than 30 cents per device** for the right to use Arm-based chips in the hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches it sells each year""

""At one point, Son called Apple CEO Tim Cook to tell him Arm would be raising prices for all its major smartphone and chip customers. **Cook’s team reassured him that Arm couldn’t raise fees, because the companies’ contract at the time lasted through 2028**. Son backed off. Since then, Apple and Arm have been through several rounds of negotiations that have kept the financial terms of Apple’s deal largely in place, people familiar with the matter said."" 

Yep, that's Masayoshi Son, trying to fuck up yet another company. 

ARM's business model is DOGSHIT. They make miniscule amounts off of incredibly lucrative technology, AND THEY CAN'T CHANGE THAT. They have no leverage, because all of their deals are already in place. *And here's the kicker:*

**""In the meantime, Apple has explored the long-term possibility of using a competing technology in the chips for its devices, according to one former Apple employee.""**

They are talking about **RISC-V** \-- the OPEN-SOURCE architecture BASED OFF ARM (Advanced **RISC** Machines) architecture. ""RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses"" (Wikipedia). 

In simple terms: ARM is a monopoly, but in the future (think 8-15 years) they will be **DISPLACED BY ROYALTY FREE OPEN-SOURCE LICENSING.** Why the fuck would you want to own this company long term, when they will become irrelevant in a decade? This is a ticking time bomb.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Gy-na**

I'll keep this part more succinct. ARM DOESN'T OWN ARM China, from which they get **25%** **of their revenue**:  [Arm's China relationship complicates IPO | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/arms-china-relationship-complicates-ipo-2023-08-22/) 

Highlights:

**""Arm itself holds an effective interest of only 4.8% in Arm China.""**

""Arm said in its filings that ""in the past, **we have received late payments** from Arm China and have **had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China**.""""

""24% of revenue came from Arm China in the fiscal year ended March 31, but **40% of accounts receivable were attributed to China**, meaning **Arm has still not been paid** for all products sold in China.""

So, ARM China is a separate entity despite the name, and they only pay ARM when they feel like it. ARM literally has to pay debt collectors to fly over and get ARM China to fork over money. **What happens when ARM China decides that they don't want to pay at all?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Timing**

I hope I've established that ARM is a complete dumpster fire. But this could go higher short-term, right? Why am I saying that the stock will dump this specific week?

The Oompa Loompas on stocktwits are disgustingly bullish on this stock. They had been waiting for yesterday -- a breakout above the closing price on IPO day -- as an entry point (despite the fact that there has already been a substantial move up). Well, how did they enter? 

[Huge call volume coincided with 8&amp;#37; pump on 12\/8](https://preview.redd.it/8fx24f6uhc5c1.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fbd787ba00b9cdb505e4bce030e9e05a9533e5)

I'll tell you how: they all bought calls **expiring this week**. In fact, that alone is likely what caused the breakout, as options sellers had to hedge against these morons piling in. 

As we all know, options are a zero-sum game. You regards especially know full well that options sellers usually come out on top -- why not take their side for once? Now that dumb money has all jumped into the same boat, they'll sink it. 

There are a couple technical lines of interest. The support at $61 (closing price on 9/15) is support. That will break. There's another at $60, and that may hold for this week. But if it fails, this is drilling to $55 -- a long term resistance before the initial breakout, which is conveniently also max pain.

(Additionally, I expect the broader market to fall this week due to FOMC / dot plot not showing as many cuts as the market wants / Hawkish Powell. This is a nice way to combine two theses.)

[Fun with Crayons: First exit under $61, but $55 is possible.](https://preview.redd.it/xm3zqcs6lc5c1.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5329aa8bd85735f628a314d34957268f62bf1a64)

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Strategy**

I have 12.15 64Ps, as well as 4.19.24 65Ps in anticipation for the longer-term dump. 

The way to play this is to target any strike (or combination) from 65 to 60, doesn't really matter which. I honestly think that the 50s are possible, but this stock has a really fucking high beta and it could have a dead cat bounce -- so you should sell some when it breaks $61. 

Buying at open is the best strategy, as this thing has been making its daily move in the first hour(s) of the day recently. However, I also wouldn't be surprised if it goes sideways/up on Monday/Tuesday, so there's potential to just wait until Tuesday close to buy. CPI fuckery is what I'm specifically worried about. Wednesday through Friday should be blood red, so getting in before then is crucial for maximizing returns.

"TL;DR: The high valuations of AI-related companies have a positive impact on their fundamentals. A feedback loop emerges in which higher stock values further improve company fundamentals, which in turn justify higher valuations. George Soros called this reflexivity. In addition, AI is spreading across all industries. This will eventually make it difficult to identify a sector-specific bubble.

The full text can be found [here (Medium)](https://chaotropy.medium.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed-c652441fbd9f) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed/).

""As George Soros explained in his 1987 book “The Alchemy of Finance”, stock prices are not just a passive reflection of fundamentals: The current AI buzz is likely to strengthen the fundamentals of the companies involved.So anyone who expects AI stock prices to become bluntly disconnected from fundamentals in the coming months or years, until valuations become so stretched that the bubble has to burst, is likely to be wrong, in my view. The current hype around the wonders of AI will have an impact on the fundamentals of the companies involved. In almost every industry, AI is being touted as the solution to many, if not all, problems. Significant investments are being made that are driving the revenues and ultimately earnings of the companies that provide AI services, operate servers, build servers, and produce computer chips. This growth will continue to drive the valuations of these AI-related companies (i.e. investors will be willing to buy the stocks at higher price-earnings ratios). Obviously higher stock market valuations allow companies to raise more money for fewer shares in seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Much more subtle, however, a positive feedback loop is emerging between higher stock market valuations and the fundamentals of these companies; George Soros called this phenomenon reflexivity. Higher stock market valuations allow companies to offer attractive stock-based compensation to employees, reducing labor costs and boosting profits, which in turn translates into lower price-earnings ratios that justifies higher stock market valuations. The companies at the forefront of a technological revolution will also become more attractive as employers and will be able to recruit the brightest minds, possibly at lower salaries. Although it should play a minor role, loans may also become cheaper for the fast-growing participants in the AI market. Lower interest rates ultimately lead to higher profits. Because all of these effects affect fundamentals, a bubble may not be visible to investors at some point.

At the same time the AI sector will expand horizontally and proliferate into all other industries, making it difficult to isolate a single sector bubble. New technology will create new problems, which in turn will be solved by new technology: Server operators, for example, are already groaning at the enormous power costs of running the new language models. One solution may be to use analog chips that can perform the matrix computations that underlie AI in a [much more power-efficient way](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5). As you can see, the focus may shift to sub-developments within the larger trend.

I started trading while in college during COVID, turning what was just originally a few thousand into about $300K over two years by going on margin long and short on COVID-affected industries like airlines, cruise ships, shopping malls, pharmaceuticals, and some tech stocks like Zoom, and then of course riding meme stocks up and down until my brokers restricted trading meme stocks and I turned to options, blowing my then-$300K account in about a week. Undeterred and having developed a firm passion (or addiction), I’ve been reading dozens of books and experimenting with a variety of strategies, from making careful entries and exits to idiotic YOLO impulse moves, from gut feelings to careful analyses. I do a little of them all now, though the regarded and emotional (revenge) YOLO moves keep doing me in, usually at times when I’m convinced I’m right and the market is (temporarily) wrong about something and I just start impulsively buying instead of exiting with moderate losses. This mistake wiped me out two months ago on an oversized bet on BABA calls after I first gained recognition here for making $5K a day (and then $10K and later $20K a day; maybe should’ve stuck with $5K). The very same sort of mistake happened again Thursday when I saw Uber, after entering the S&amp;P, showing overbought signals on the RSI and Stochastic lines and a bearish MACD crossover, and triggering my experimental tools for double top, rising wedge, and head and shoulders patterns on several time frames, all while the price impulsively raged higher as if to test my hubris. Who knows, the signals may have been right and it may drop next week as if to spite me, but as John Maynard Keynes once said, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” Truth.

Friday was rough, no doubt. I was awake at 4:30 AM watching premarket activity, and things were looking good for my expiring UBER puts after the jobs report triggered bearish initial reactions, but everything reversed upward as soon as the market opened, and I didn’t have time to get out. There were about 10 seconds right at 9:30 when my puts were up, but I doubt there was enough liquidity to sell everything, and I froze as the prices rose with renewed ([baby boomers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/N5TUUBAEzh)) buying. I have a few big takeaways that came with the pain, including the advice people here gave me to move to Robin Hood to avoid fees on large volume options trades, even as I’ll be probably staying away from such trades for a little while. The good news (good at least for everyone’s ongoing entertainment and for r/thetagang’s loyal business) is that I do still enjoy trading immensely (or am pleasantly addicted to it); moreover, I’m lucky to have a Wendy’s job that pays me well enough to continue funding my education and (gambling) habit. My upcoming year-end Wendy’s bonus is also usually quite large, and I think everyone can guess what I’m going to be doing with it, though I promised myself to break it up into several trades and space out my moves. Furthermore, since there seems to be a bit of interest in following my struggles and triumphs, I may go make a new Reddit account completely devoted to trading. Feel free to DM me for the details or to help me pick a username that’s not randomly generated by Reddit like this one is. Also looking into Discord, if anyone has suggestions of channels to join or ideas for creating a new one.

Going forward, my strategy will be evolving over time and hopefully will eventually become less YOLO and more stable and analytical. But in the meantime, I’m still going to be continuing many high risk / high reward moves while developing and refining my techniques. You’re welcome to bet against me that I won’t change and will keep blowing up my account; time will tell. Assuming I do improve my ways, the goal would be to become consistently profitable through hedging and risk management and continue to refine the quantitative techniques. Some may ask me at this point why I don’t just try to go work at a hedge fund. And actually, some Wall Street firms, including Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, and Citadel, do actively recruit students and alumni from research programs I’ve been to; those programs were how I had a chance to [meet Jerome Powell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z65h5e/9_days_ago_i_quoted_milton_friedman_to_j_powell/) and ask him [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ylinlf/what_should_i_try_to_ask_jerome_powell_if_i_have/) you all suggested (see the last photo I attached from when I was sitting in that meeting). However, I’m not so sure I’d like the culture working at one of those places (they’re covered a bit in the new book Going Infinite about SBF, as well as some of Michael Lewis’s other books I’ve been reading), and a lot of people consider them evil, so I’d rather do my own self-directed trading for now with paychecks from the Wendy’s I know, as opposed to the one I don’t. I just hope this won’t become my villain origin story.

Besides working on decisiveness to take gains and cut losses and more self-control with the impulse revenge buying, I’m planning to start automating the entering and exiting of trades more in order to remove the human error element (alongside some automated risk management), as well as potentially incorporating some machine learning techniques while I learn them in my part-time masters degrees in math and computer science. There are a lot of interesting differential equations and probability theory ideas that come into play with derivatives trading and hedging, and I’ve been reading about the origins of statistical arbitrage strategies in mathematician and hedge fund manager Edward Thorp’s autobiography, A Man for all Markets. While the inefficiencies his fund was exploiting at the time are no longer as viable since everyone started to understand them, I’m certain there are other opportunities in today’s markets that can be found with enough research and experimentation. I had taken a break from reading his books a few weeks ago when my trades started making lots of money again, but I think I should get back to them now. I also realize WSB is just a bunch of regards hanging out behind a Wendy’s and not an official exchange for rigorous academic discourse, but I see enough insights here to stick around for the interesting discussions alongside the insults, memes, and regrets. So once again, feel free to comment or DM if you’re interested with suggestions for Discord or ideas for a new username, or whatever compliments or insults you want to throw at me. Always the best compliments and insults, of course, are when the market tells us we’re right or rubs it in when we’re wrong; “the market is always right.” Happy trading!","$10K to $100K and then blew it all on a single trade twice in two months.

I want to talk about why we should consider selling and shorting Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) stock. The stonk has been on a wild ride, but it's time to face the facts. The company's financials are looking like a weakend shitpost, with an EPS (TTM) of -$3.90 and a net margin (TTM) of -68.05%. It's like holding a bag of flaming tendies.

I know some of you might be thinking about holding on to the stock with diamond hands, but let's not forget that we only live once (YOLO). It's time to make some smart moves and bet against BYND. The short interest in BYND stock is at 27.87M as of November 15, 2023, with 45.81% of the float shorted. The bears are circling, and it's not looking good for the stonk

So, let's not be the bagholders in this game. It's all about making those sweet, sweet tendies, and BYND might not be the way to get them. We need to focus on the fundamentals and make informed decisions based on the company's financials. Don't be a weakend shitpost, and sell and short BYND.

With Augmedix and Google Cloud entering a partnership with healthcare giant HCA to bring ambient clinical documentation to acute care settings are we seeing the beginning of larger growth and ultimately a great opportunity for share holders? HCA is known to run lean and strengthen their financial resiliency plans year over year. 

HCA was one of the few healthcare corporations to turn COVID into a financial success and it seems they have learned how to execute on efficiency while having a focus on mitigating challenges for time management within their workforce.

Beyond the evident financial success from Augmedix itself, it appears that HCA is utilizing this specifically in the ER and if successful there is opportunity to roll it out in other clinical spaces throughout their hospital systems.

"The first is all about the number 4607. That’s the S&amp;P 500’s intraday high for the year, hit in late July. At just under 4600, the index is currently up about 19% for the year, but every time it nears the intraday high, sellers come in to knock it lower. If sellers keep coming in near this level, it could eventually cause a wave of additional selling.

Here’s how that works: The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has dropped to 13 from a multi-month peak of about 22 in late October. A high VIX indicates that investor uncertainty about future earnings and how to value stocks is cresting. A low VIX means the market is becoming more confident, and often coincides with an increasingly expensive stock market. Any measure of risk to the economy and profits could cause the market to drop. When the VIX enters a year under 14, as it could in the new year, the average return for the S&amp;P 500 by the six months ended in June is down 6.9%, according to Wells Fargo. 

What could drive such a drop? Not getting the one thing the market currently expects: rate cuts. The fed-funds futures market is currently reflecting a 47% chance of a rate cut in March as the rate of inflation has aggressively declined from its peak last year. But inflation is still above the Fed’s 2% target, and the Fed may not be able to cut so soon. If it does, rates across the board might drop, fueling more economic demand, and keeping inflation above the target, a potential outcome like that only provides more reason for another rate hike or two. ",4 Things That Could Cause Stocks to Plunge,18e3lhy,1702089843.0,https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-rate-cut-stocks-plunge-f7acc23b,
"Nonfarm payroll employment increased at a 1.6% annualized pace in the past three months, with about 199,000 jobs added in November 2023. While the second and third quarters saw a slower growth rate than the first quarter’s 2.2% rate, this was in line with the 1.7% average annual growth from 2015 through 2019.

Given that the unemployment rate has fully recovered to about 3.5%-4.0% since peaking at 14.7% in April 2020, the remaining shortfall in employment is due purely to lower labor force participation—that is, more people choosing to remove themselves from the workforce.

We expect that widespread job availability and healthy wage growth will draw marginal participants back into the workforce (that is, people who are available to work but aren’t actively job-hunting).

"Xponential Fitness (XPOF) owns many workout studios including Club Pilates, Pure Barre, Rumble, Stretch Lab, and more. 

Bloomberg wrote how Xponential and it's CEO Anthony Geisler misled franchisees about the upfront capital investment and return on cash. 

They mention short seller ""Fuzzy Panda"" released a report in June that said more than 50% of Xponential's studios were unprofitable.

Stock is down \~20% on the news.

I’ve done this before, making large gains without much capital, but never with such a little amount to start and getting such a large profit in such a short span of time.

I used futures options, and ran both sides of calls and puts. I called it quits as this is enough to pay off high interest debt and all the dental work required due to medication I take for a rare autoimmune disease.

I was feeling pretty down before today, I was slowly working my way out of debt (I’d bailed myself out with trading before, but was too scared as if I lost too much I’d be in a situation where my income wasn’t enough to save me). I’d caught COVID which put me out of a job I just started and my other part-time job I had prior. Plus, some asshole stole my dog’s special fucking vet food and medication. I’m debating buying another box from Chewy and filling it with stink spray in a hope the jackass steals the box again.

Anyways, good luck and hope everyone has a good trading day.

### The Bull Run: A Retrospective

The current bull market has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our community has witnessed and participated in events that will likely be discussed in financial textbooks for years to come. However, it's essential to recognize that markets move in cycles, and prolonged periods of bullish sentiment are often followed by corrections.

### Signs of a Shifting Tide

Several indicators suggest that we might be approaching a turning point:

1. **Inflation Concerns:** Persistent concerns about inflation have led to increased scrutiny from both investors and the Federal Reserve. If inflation continues to rise, it could prompt central banks to adopt more hawkish stances, potentially impacting market dynamics.
2. **Economic Data:** Keep an eye on economic indicators such as employment numbers, GDP growth, and consumer spending. Signs of a slowing economy could contribute to a shift in market sentiment.
3. **Valuation Metrics:** Elevated valuations across various sectors have raised questions about the sustainability of current stock prices. Investors may become more risk-averse as valuations reach historically high levels.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

As responsible investors, it's crucial to have a plan in place for navigating potential bear markets:

1. **Diversification:** Consider diversifying your portfolio to reduce risk. A well-balanced mix of assets can help cushion the impact of a downturn in any particular sector.
2. **Risk Management:** Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Implement stop-loss orders and set realistic profit-taking goals to protect your gains.
3. **Research and Due Diligence:** Stay informed about market conditions and the performance of your investments. Thorough research can help you make informed decisions and identify potential warning signs.

### Conclusion

While the prospect of a bear market may seem daunting, it's essential to approach it with a strategic mindset. By staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, and implementing risk management strategies, you can position yourself to weather market fluctuations successfully.

Remember, this is not financial advice but rather a call for thoughtful consideration and preparation. As a community, let's continue to support and share insights that empower us all to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market.",Navigating the Shadows: Anticipating the Onset of a Bear Market,18dkkar,1702033786.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18dkkar/navigating_the_shadows_anticipating_the_onset_of/,

**Why NIO is undervalued.**

A lot of people take a look at the daily or weekly chart and go back to the beginning of NIO’s IPO and see that the stock rose to about 60 bucks and then dropped all the way down to the price today which is about 8 bucks.

I’d like to point out a few things that maybe haven’t been considered or given the right amount of weight when evaluating NIO and its potential growth.

Here’s my case as to why I believe NIO is undervalued. I will keep it simple and only focus on the biggest pieces that I believe make NIO a unique business with a long successful lifespan ahead of it.

**\*\*I spared you all the pain of reading hundreds of details about each point. I simply think a mention of the feature would be easier to digest on a quick read.\*\***

1. NIO has a clear and achievable vision.
   1. NIO’s vision focuses around sustainability. They place a lot of focus on this and it shows in their business model and actions. For example, NIO doesn’t have a dealership network. They sell their cars via an app. The interior of their cars include recycled water bottles and they are also involved with green initiatives in the Sanjiangyuan area. Furthermore, they are a member of the UNGC - The United Nations Global Compact.
2. NIO’s research and development has already paid off and will continue to do so.
   1. NIO developed the ability to swap out a depleted car battery in under 3 minutes. This is something that Tesla has not either considered doing or been able to do.
   2. The cars NIO has developed are not only stylish, but technologically advanced. They feature AI assistance integrated in the dashboard along with state of the art exterior sensors that enable AI driving.
   3. NIO’s cars offer not only one or two drive modes, but nine.
3. Ultimately, NIO has a diverse pool of talent spanning all over the world.
   1. NIO has R&amp;D departments in Silicon Valley, Beijing, Copenhagen, and many more places. NIO’s talent spans across the globe and because of this, the company benefits greatly from differing perspectives and cultures.
   2. This is NIO’s biggest strength. Any problem that may arise will have an opportunity to be solved as there are multiple kinds of people from very different backgrounds tackling the issue.

**So what is NIO considering doing now to improve their business model and ultimately their profits?**

NIO is thinking about a spin-off. They are playing with the idea of separating their money-losing battery business into its own entity to better their financial situation. This would be amazing. Other companies have done this too. McDonalds created Chipotle. Ebay spun off PayPal after they bought it. Other big companies have done the same.

NIO’s cars are priced to sell. The average price for their cars is from 25k to 45k which is amazing when you look at the features and the specs of these cars. They are absolutely beautiful cars and are priced very reasonably. In my opinion, Teslas are outdated in comparison.

I know that NIO hasn’t been profitable BUT, NIO is a new company that literally just started nine years ago. It is a very young, innovative, and refreshing company that has so much potential I can’t wait to see where it goes.

As for me, I can’t wait to see NIO in the U.S where I am convinced it will be received with very positive reviews. Lucid Motors is extremely expensive, Rivian is also expensive and poorly designed, and Tesla has yet to demonstrate any innovation or production ability.

So let me finish this off by summarizing and stating why NIO is undervalued.

NIO is a great company with a clear vision that is focused on providing modern, beautiful, technologically advanced AI intelligent cars to everyone, not just the wealthy.

NIO’s stock price has hit the floor and is now showing signs of a bull run. It has grown +10% in the last week! How is nobody seeing this??? At its current price of $7.85 NIO is a steal.

I’m bullish on NIO. I’ll be betting on NIO for the next few years. Wish me luck!

"Degens.......Where are my bears at?! I am watching this bum on CNBC talking about SPY @ 520 in early to mid '24. I think he has too many dollar signs in his eyes and is literally blinded by the green in his account. I think the FED is going to be forced to cut rates early-mid '24. Below is my pro con for a TLT play and I want your thoughts.  


PROs for TLT

\-FED rate is likely to decrease in '24 due to slowing of economy

\-'24 is an election year. Markets are always touchy

\-Business loans are more expensive to refi vs the last 2 years. More coming to maturity.

\-Spy seems extended based on the last 2-3 years of a bull run since covid

\-Inverted yield curve has always predicted a recession. FED will lower rates to stimulate economy.

\-Volume on TLT is interesting. Seems to be showing smart money interest/inflows

\-Pending housing sales are very low. Cost of money is too high for many borrowers. Housing prices are declining.

\-Credit card debt is at ATH. Delinquency rates are rising. Along with other personal loans. Especially car loans.

\-TLT appears to be bouncing and heading towards EMA. My play below should still be profitable even if TLT doesnt move much to the upside.

\-Not a PRO for TLT but a PRO for long term options play. VIX is low. Long term options are relatively cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

CONs for TLT

\-FED keeps rates high and the economy keeps flying. Debt keeps rising and people could give two shits about their personal/business financials.

\-No one wants to buy treasuries anymore because the US has too much debt. No one wants to be a bag holder.

&amp;#x200B;

  
THE PLAY

So the theta gang doesn't eat my ass out I am going far out.

&amp;#x200B;

BUY TO OPEN TLT 16 JAN 26 CALLS @ 100 STRIKE  


If VIX normalizes I am still green with a lateral move

Plan to close around July '24 maybe early September prior to election unless FED raises rates more than a .5% in early '24

"Appreciate everyone here who was rooting for me. It’s certainly been a wild ride. For those new here, I YOLOd my life savings of 38k into META calls on Tuesday that expire this Friday. I ended up selling my META calls yesterday for a 10k loss, then like a true regard YOLOd the rest into 🕹️🛑 options that became near worthless overnight.  I currently have only 5k left from the original 38k. To make things worse, I woke up from my sleepless night to see that META rocketed this morning and if I had just held one more day I would’ve been up to 140k at today’s peak.

After that crazy YOLO went as bad as it possibly could, I want to reiterate that I’ll be alright financially - yes I lost like 90% of my life savings but I have no debt and some money in my checking account to live on while I’m working part-time and even a bit to cover any emergencies. I am only 20 years old and I still got time to set myself up financially (because of my ACT score I got a full ride to a private University so I don’t have any student loans. And yes, just because I’m academically smart doesn’t mean I’m financially smart as you all can see 😆).

I’ve always considered myself a workaholic and I almost never spend any money on things that I don’t need, so I amassed that money doing various jobs like fast food, food delivery, and internships whenever I had free time throughout my teenage years (saying this because some people were assuming this was my parents’ money). It’s time to save up again and move on past this loss. I’m obviously not doing the greatest mentally but a few people have reached out which I really appreciate and I know it’ll get better. Also, I think it’s important to note that I YOLOd the money with the mentally to take full responsibility and accept the loss no matter how severe. I’ve always wanted to do something crazy and illogical and decided to just go for it. We only get one shot at life, why not do something insane? When I’m 80 I know I’ll look back at this thinking of how much of an idiot I was but at the same time kind of glad that I wanted to do something so insane and had the balls to just go for it. You only live once, right? I hope this makes people feel better about their losses, and serves as a warning to those considering doing something as stupid as I did. Long live feta, and FUCK META ✌️

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.

The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732786907971539235) (formerly Twitter) that he should be ""fired immediately"" and that Walt Disney himself is ""turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.""

Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta](https://www.nmag.gov/attorney-general-raul-torrez-files-lawsuit-against-meta-platforms-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-and-human-trafficking/) and its CEO — and longtime Musk rival — Mark Zuckerberg.

The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were ""not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,"" according to AG Raúl Torrez.

One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-companies-drop-ads-x-twitter-antisemitism-elon-musk-2023-11) after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11).

Musk [chimed in](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732773421610606801) (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): ""Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy.""

When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: ""He should be fired immediately.""

He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: ""truth.""

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: [""Go fuck yourself.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-advertises-get-lost-twitter-dealbook-summit2023-11)

At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.

""Is that clear?"" Musk asked. ""I hope it is. Hey, Bob.""

Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.

""We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) or SpaceX or now X,"" Iger said.

Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.

""By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,"" Iger said.

Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11) over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the ""absolute truth."" Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it ""foolish.""

Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years. The billionaire has publicly dissed several major figures and companies, including [Apple ](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-war-with-apple-history-of-criticism-2022-11)and [President Joe Biden.](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-elon-musk-feud-tesla-union-republican-06-2022)","Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately'",18d1ifi,1701972401.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18d1ifi/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_says_he/,

,Is CAVA “dumping” this month?!?,18d0h3f,1701969538.0,https://i.redd.it/bdf4j3a9pw4c1.jpeg,
"Below is my personal thesis based on my own research. And I do research… all the time… perhaps too much.

**1.** **OVERVIEW &amp; CATALYST**

CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA) owns and operates a chain of around 280 Mediterranean restaurants. The company offers salads, dips, spreads, toppings, and dressings. It sells its products through whole food markets and grocery stores. The company also provides online food ordering services. Cava Group, Inc. was founded in 2006 and is based in Washington, DC.

The company had a successful IPO in mid-June of 2023. Shares opened at $42 apiece on the NYSE, nearly double the IPO price of $22. Cava sold about 14.4 million shares in the offering, raising around $318 million.

However, the IPO Lockup Period Expiration is happening next week (12/12/2023), where a huge amount of insider shares will become available to trade on a thinly (recently averaging 1-1.3M shares/day) traded stock. Year-end tax benefits or not, no one wants to hold the bag as many early investors are likely to realize a relatively quick profit (initial pre-IPO shares were sold for $19-$20/share or cheaper).

Every time I was involved in situations where the individual/institutional investors would have to “HODL” their shares/coins, it never worked, not even once. Everything gets dumped the second it becomes possible.

As more investors try to realize their profits and there are minimal number of buyers, the stock might enter a free fall for a while. Also, other institutions would want to come in at a much lower level, so they will not interfere for a while. Eventually the stock will find its floor, but I expect it to be at much lower price point, possibly at $8-$12 range. I specifically chosen the Jan 19th puts to give this play some “breathing” room.

**2.** **VALUATION**

IMO, by every measure the company is currently is overvalued. With the last quarter revenue of $175.55 million and negative net income, the company’s current free float valuation stands at over $4B with a P/E ratio of over 460! CAVA is expected to have about $850M of revenue in 2024 with about 9% EBITDA margins, but only 1.5% net income margins, which at best would make it a $1B company and that is everything goes perfect by the end of next year, which again would equate to about $9/share (in the future).

As initial IPO hype has dies down, the stock (peaking at around $58/share) seems to continuously trend down (similar to Sweetgreen Inc., which started IPO at around $53/share a couple of years ago and got all the way down to $6.50/share, before recovering to a current $10.50/share). Ironically, Sweetgreen ($SG) was founded in 2007 also in Washington, DC.

The trajectory repeating Chipotle’s success stock-wise, even long-term is unlikely for multiple reasons (including Product &amp; Competition section below).

Portfolio managers at Artal Group, T. Rowe Price, Swan Hospitality, Revolution Growth, Capital International Investors or all other major $CAVA shareholders (as well as company principals) that control tens of millions of shares in total should trip over each other to offload at least a portion of their holdings (as I am sure, like me they see the stock dwindling down to sub-$10 price range). This can create a temporary death spiral and bring the price down very quickly.

**3.** **PRODUCT &amp; COMPETITION**

I have personally been a Carnivore now for several months. I am down 48lbs (and counting) and feeling much better than before. I have studied the Carnivore diet in great detail every day for the past 7 months, listened to hundreds of lectures and read thousands of testimonials. It is blatantly clear to me that I have been eating completely wrong my whole life and there’s an overwhelming amount of data to show that Carnivore (or at least Ketovore) is the way to eat. I am continuously sharing my research with my family and closest friends, but I do “meat” (couldn’t help myself) lots of resistance – it’s a process.

As the Carnivore movement gains more and more popularity, I expect a major shift from plant- based “healthy” choices to animal product outlets, restaurants and chains. Please check out thousands of video lectures and interviews on YT of Drs. Anthony Chaffee, Shawn Baker, Ken Berry and many others and see for yourself. This could be one of the most important decisions for you and your family.

That said, I source, grind, grill and season all of my meat and fish myself to ensure the hyper-optimal quality of my nutrition. However, when travelling I occasionally buy meat-based dishes at Chipotle, QDOBA, Shake Shack, McDonalds, Burger King, Chick-fil-A and other food chains and restaurants. I would strip out all the carbs and vegetables and consume just the meat/fish. While that’s not ideal, it suffices once in a while and most Carnivores would agree with me. And by once in a while, I mean once or twice per month out of 60 (or so) meals.

I’ve looked into CAVA’s menu and found nothing that any Carnivore would find appropriate for human consumption, let alone anything being “healthy”. While some dishes do contain chicken, typically birds are considered barely above eating cardboard in the Carnivore world, as they are typically kept in horrible conditions, fed absolute (often GMO) garbage (including cuts of other birds), and don’t have multiple stomachs (e.g. cows) to process their own (modified) food properly. So, technically it’s still considered meat, but it carries very marginal nutritional value. All other items include carbs (converts to sugar), sugar (feeds cancers) and vegetables (thousands of various low-grade toxins), none of which our ancestors ate in any significant quantities.

So, while other chains and restaurants are not particularly great by any stretch of imagination either, at least you can find meats and fish there (if you must eat out), while CAVA would be my least favorite choice. I’ve read many reviews and people’s reactions are mixed between the price and quality of CAVA’s food (seemingly more negative than positive). Like many other places they are fighting an uphill battle. Rebranding to a radically opposite diet would not work well either.

Furthermore, there are other chains out there with somewhat similar offerings on top of hundreds of thousands of general restaurants on every corner. Their prices are not particularly great and margins are quite thin, like with most restaurants.

**4.** **CONCLUSION**

I expect a bloodbath in the next few weeks. The stock already started to crack. “Don't sugar coat it, Taj” (Van Wilder, 2002) seems an appropriate quote here.

Questions and comments are welcomed.

"AstraZeneca has introduced Evinova, a new health-tech business focused on speeding up innovation in the life sciences sector and enhancing clinical trials to provide better health outcomes and a more positive patient experience.

Also, as far as I know, AstraZeneca made a deal with Pfizer, led by Alexion, and they're also working on improving platforms and technologies with wide applications in therapy (they say that this opens up new opportunities for Pfizer in the gene direction btw).

Moreover, according to stats, things were going pretty well for Alexion — it made it to the list of the top five companies with the best returns.

Also, Alexion resolved its longstanding lawsuit over its illegal sales strategy and is now [paying a $125M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/alexion-shareholder-settlement) to its old investors.

[Buffet Recently spent a lot of money on homebuilder shares.](https://preview.redd.it/eyvo7xjs3w4c1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52ee410bb0a5e7cf6a9e5d886bc55a22419f6a6)

[Housing Market Crash 2024: Did Warren Buffett Read the Signals Wrong?](https://investorplace.com/2023/10/housing-market-crash-2024-did-warren-buffett-read-the-signals-wrong/)

&amp;#x200B;

[In what looks like a momentum move, Berkshire picked up quite a few shares in homebuilder DHI, Dr. Horton Inc.](https://preview.redd.it/q8w2xgqm4w4c1.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6440a89d529ecea4138068929d2dd0619c7b883a)

Was this a rare short-term play for Buffett? He tends to hold his positions for an average of 7 years. He could actually make some money on this play in the short-term, due to the recent EOY rally. BUT, DHI has rallied before.

&amp;#x200B;

[DHI didn't fare to well last time the housing market cooled off.](https://preview.redd.it/wy21jrtu5w4c1.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3d7a4a54526d9175da5058939a64b5fb6554e24)

The housing market is showing quite a few signs of cooling off since Berkshire Hathaway finished purchasing their DHI shares in Q2. Shortly after they opened their position, mortgage interest rates spiked nearly 150 basis points, and new home sales began to falter. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Home sales trend downward since average mortgage rate peaks at nearly 8&amp;#37;. Analysts expected 725,000 home sales in October, but their estimates missed by 7&amp;#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/sm16ksmm7w4c1.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b316f50a50cc4f6e0e555c92f77840a4e6782559)

&amp;#x200B;

[Prices have simply gotten too high.](https://preview.redd.it/6vfowa8x9w4c1.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f318e932ddc1a99f8d2788f94b62d52163283411)

The dip in existing home sales is one of the most blatant warnings of a housing market crash. New home sales have enjoyed a small bump, but as the market cools, it will trend downward. People are simply no longer willing to pay the current asking prices.

&amp;#x200B;

[Perhaps Buffet saw the relatively low valuation metrics as a buy signal.](https://preview.redd.it/4t2rrgyicw4c1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db2482a72f0281fa2f2332882b719133a670066)

Compared to many stocks these days, DHI shows conservatives metrics as far as PE and PB ratio. But then again, it always has. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Perhaps investors are overestimating the buying power of Millennials.](https://preview.redd.it/6wxtbakjdw4c1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b5ac48e202762a22e6bfd437daf4376690e4472)

The average age of homebuyers continues to rise, as younger folks are continually priced out of homes. The average age of homebuyers in 2021 was 33, jumping to 36 in 2022. Millennials are struggling with mountains of insurmountable debt due to student loans and credit cards. They also have the lowest credit score and history of any age group, which will make it difficult to accrue additional debt.

**Closing remarks**

With high interest rates here to stay, incredibly high prices, and eroding Millennial creditworthiness, the housing market is going to crash... HORRIBLY. Be prepared for homebuilder stocks to drop over 80% as younger folks ditch mortgages and look to rent or live with parents.

"**GOOGLE**I have been very bullish on Google given MSFT stock performance but for some reason the market has been lagging. MSFT has been driven up, up and up based on Sam Altman, Open AI, GPT, and AI, AI, AI. The Bing supposedly takeover of Google Search was a FIASCO, won't happen.

Google's Deep Mind is another level. Not a generative text bullshitting your prompts. Google is the only actor that has been serious on AI since 2015. Now they are proving to you - have you seen the Gemini AI release? [Google launches its largest and ‘most capable’ AI model, Gemini](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/google-launches-its-largest-and-most-capable-ai-model-gemini.html)

Google should be trading in the 160$ range by now - But it's ok, market is lagging.

Ignore AI, google without AI is the best tech business you can buy.

**AMD**

Just anounced: [Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMD’s new AI chip as an alternative to Nvidia’s](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/meta-and-microsoft-to-buy-amds-new-ai-chip-as-alternative-to-nvidia.html)

It is a matter of time that NVIDIA loses its momentum. It was nice to see a 1200% YoY revenue growth - that's really impresive. But... AMD and other actors want a piece of that cake, NVIDIA won't be able to eat it alone for longer. Chip buyers are already feeling the supply shortage or overprice in their pockets so they are looking for alternatives. AMD is the next best player known, right?

AMD hasn't rallied like NVIDIA. It is still trading as pre-AI thing.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the 2 most clear companies that you can buy at a fair to cheap valuation. I am not touching MSFT, nor NVIDIA, nor APPLE at this valuation. Either AMZN, AMD or GOOGL run a 2x from current level or the other 3 mentioned have a correction of 30% to 40%.

WTF do I know.  I get my market insights from the FinViz sidebar comments.  Did some hard screen switching back and forth from my Schwab app and an investopedia article about cup and handles and have come to my own conclusions.     

I do know that [William J. O’Neil](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp) defined the cup and handle (C&amp;H) pattern in his 1988 classic, *How to Make Money in Stocks*    

Anyway, I know Ishbia’s personal money machine has had mixed returns for bag handlers and holders alike.  Sitting at the $7 bounce line right now.  Just throttle purring ready to get jacked to the tits.  More tension in this puppy than a new OP after posting to pinnacle4. 

With rates going down and stupid people with money and people hungry for houses, house-heavy hedgies going through customary recession-proofing, I’m going bullish on this cup and handle.      

Bullish on the RSI.  Super bullish knocking 80 rsi in the last few dividend cycles, and the forming handle on the last pic in 15m candles shows it trending on the 40.  Purple rsi chart has period based on the dividend cycle, about as purple as my nips from all the absent-minded twisting I’ve been giving them while waiting on the screens to load.

"Not sure what the politics policy is on wsb but I promise this is important to stonks.

With the war in Gaza going on, the Houthi’s have been launching missiles in the Red Sea to stop ships from going through the Mediterranean. This has caused ships to have to go all the way around Africa to get to their destinations.

With that, freight costs are expected to hit $10,000 when they’re usually around $2000. That’s a 5x difference. One of the biggest reasons for inflation was the supply chain issue. If you compare shipping rates and CPI, you’ll see they follow closely. If shipping costs go up, so does inflation.

Now, it’s not quite up to the $20,000 that it cost during COVID, but if the Houthis continue to launch missiles at ships and prolong this conflict, it could continue to keep inflation high. Ultimately the federal reserve might be forced to keep rates higher or even raise them again if inflation starts to creep upwards due to shipping costs. The federal funds futures market still seems too optimistic and hasn’t priced this in.

On the other hand, it’s possible the supply chain disruption won’t last long if the military can intercept Houthis missiles. What do you regards think?

"As we approach the end of the year, I was wondering what word or phrase stands out from the year?

Here are some from me:

• **Soft landing** \- was almost a joke in the sense that it seemed an impossibiltiy. According to many metrics though it seems like this may be the best way of describing the current economic situation. History may show otherwise though, depending on how 2024 pans out.

• **Recession indicator** \- seen numerous posts on this subject (some serious, some not...). For me, the gold standard is the inverted yield curve - and as the recession typically follows after 12-18 months I guess we will find out if it continues to be a successful predictor during 2024. Even the 2019 inversion resulted in a recession - albeit due to Covid - we will never know if a recession would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic though!

• **A.I.** \- throughout the year and especially late spring and early summer. CEOs mentioning it given any opportunity and the resultant boost to the share price. Nvidia becoming a hot topic in conjunction with this.

• **Zero days to expiration** \- continued rise in popularity and news stories about the size of the 0DTE options market.

• **Pivot.** When will it happen and why will it happen... this year (no), next year (maybe)? A cut in interest rates because a soft landing enables a boost to growth without worrying too much about inflation; or a cut in interest rates due to a recession - to get the economy going again.

Finally, I would like to wish everyone on WSB happy holidays and best wishes for 2024.",Your word or phrase of the year?,18omp2m,1703272835.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18omp2m/your_word_or_phrase_of_the_year/,
"So, I had some drinks a few nights ago and decided to do some Due Diligence Under the Influence and ended up going down the rabbit hole of looking over BABA. I’ve made money from them years ago, but have never felt comfortable taking a strong position in them even though their financials always seem decent. Anyways, I left myself a note in my phone with some rough figures focusing mainly on comparing their financials and site traffic to their competitors. 

Has anyone else taken this approach before? I don’t remember what all sites Crown &amp; Coke me sourced this data from, so I’m not sure how accurate it is. I do believe it was all mostly from the same source though so should possibly be comparable. I’ve tried this before quite a while ago and came to basically the same conclusion. 

BABA seems to outperform other ecommerce sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy in revenue per visit in spite of having higher bounce rates along with the majority of their consumer base being from countries with much lower median annual incomes than their competitors. 

Maybe there’s a flaw in my reasoning or figures, but the last time I did this it convinced me that maybe I should put my money elsewhere and considering how the stock has performed since then I’m glad I did. The PE is tempting, but my instinct says leave this alone completely and don’t bother with taking either side of the trade.

"Tried making this post in January when MARA was at $6. Downvoted to oblivion, laughed and ridiculed with no actual discussion. Then deleted by automod because the market cap was too low. Now the stock is up 300%+ so I’ll give it another shot.

If you are bullish on Bitcoin, or even if you aren’t but acknowledge that a Bitcoin ETF will significantly increase crypto traffic, then Bitcoin mining companies have been, and are going to continue to go exponential. Even now, looking at how much they’ve run this year it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed out, but let me put it in perspective:

During the last run in November 2021, Bitcoin topped out at ~$60,000. $MARA peaked at a market cap of $7.5B, held 7,600 Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and 3.2 Exahash of compute power. Note that I use market cap for most of the Bitcoin miner comparisons as these companies prefer to hold their mined BTC on their balance sheets and fund purchases with dilution. If you believe Bitcoin price will go up over time, this is a great strategy, but it also means comparing historical stock prices isn’t accurate, and I’m not here to trick people by ignoring it. I digress.

During the current run, Bitcoin is sitting at ~$44,000. $MARA has a $6B market cap, holds 14,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, and has 23.2 Exahash. 

Read the numbers again: They have SIGNIFICANTLY more mining power (23.2 Exahash/s Nov 2023 vs 3.2 Exahash/s Nov 2021), SIGNIFICANTLY more assets, and Bitcoin is looking like it will reach a new peak sometime in the coming months. 

I’ll be making a proper comparison of the 4 of 5 biggest miners this weekend for anyone who’s interested, as there’s even more bullish data with their mining efficiencies, growth plans, and transaction fee revenues; but I’m personally  convinced these are generational wealth building companies that I’d like others to be made aware of if crypto is something they’re interested in. I’ll say it again: only if crypto is something you’re interested in. If you don’t believe Bitcoin is going up in the future, theres no point buying these companies. It’s easy to see the screenshots of gains that have flooded this sub lately and blindly FOMO in, but it’s a volatile industry and you’ll end up losing a lot of money if you’re not actually familiar with what these companies are, how they operate or how they’re growing.

"Many asked me why I wanted to become a professional trader.

The answer, during interviews, was ranging from being in a more quantitative rather than qualitative role, having skin in the game, working in the balance of money making and personal consciousness, improving the self-ability to deal with risks.

But the answer is that my whole life has been a giant acting drama, where I’ve been interpreting a variety of roles with the purpose of letting others believe what they wanted to. I think I have reached a mostly decent ability in acting and it’s probably the single only skill I’ve ever mastered and possessed since I was a child. 

Hence, back to trading. You can’t fake it in there. The accountability of your results is such that a number can’t be prone to much debate and being right or wrong is not a matter of opinions. 

And I do could tell you that it’s an ever-changing type of role, where your convictions are daily stressed with uncertainty, your ethics are challenged by personal risks, your self-belief is crucial and merged with needed obsession, that you need to get back up and keep going, and ultimately that inaction is equally punished as bad actions, alongside the realization that results are meaningless without efforts, but the reality is just that trading is about outcomes. And the outcome is the only thing that eventually counts.",Trading,18ol03j,1703268281.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18ol03j/trading/,

The uranium price is jumping higher based on fundamentals.

There isn't enough uranium available for short term delivery (0 to 12 months), that isn't allocated to an utility yet (uranium consumer), to satisfy all uranium demand for short term delivery.

This imbalance can't be solved in 1 year time.

Add to that the nearing start of uranium restocking by utilities after years of uranium destocking.

"Let's jump into ARKK's dumpster fire and scoop up those stocks left in the dust. We're building a dodgeball team of stock market asthmatic underdogs, scaling them like ARKK, and DCA'ing our way in. Time to ride these underperformers to Valhalla!

\----------

**Constructing an ARKK Underperformer Portfolio:**  
*(Note: ARKK's portfolio originally had 10 underperformers. However, I removed 3 tickers that didn't meet WSB's unofficial market cap threshold of $500MM. If you're interested in a more comprehensive approach, you can include these tickers in your own portfolio. Their weights in the full list of 10 underperformers start from 0.45%, 0.70%, 1.49%, etc., ascending in allocation.)*

**Investment Thesis:** We're betting on the underdogs here, those currently facing headwinds but with the potential for a serious comeback. Think mean reversion - these stocks have been beaten down, but history's shown us what falls hard can bounce back harder.

**Portfolio Allocation:** We align with ARKK's autists, scaling stocks based on their ARKK weights. This isn't just copying homework; it's leveraging their deep-dive research. For instance, ZM and TDOC are big pieces of this puzzle, representing major plays in future communication and health tech.

(*Relative Weight of stock = Total Weight of Underperformers in ARKK / Weight of stock in ARKK*)

**Weighted Allocation (Example with $10k, scale to your wallet's size):**  


|Ticker|Company|Portfolio Allocation ($)|Portfolio Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ZM|Zoom Video Communications|$3,478.04|34.78%|
|TDOC|Teladoc Health Inc|$1,470.89|14.71%|
|NTLA|Intellia Therapeutics Inc|$1,348.31|13.48%|
|DNA|Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings Inc|$1,235.96|12.36%|
|PD|PagerDuty Inc|$1,210.42|12.10%|
|BEAM|Beam Therapeutics Inc|$1,001.02|10.01%|
|VERV|Verve Therapeutics Inc|$255.36|2.55%|

  
**Risk Analysis:** Let's not sugarcoat - these stocks can swing wild. But for the YOLO-hearted, this volatility is where the thrill (and potential tendies) are at.

*(Disclaimer: This is high-stakes speculation, not financial advice. Be smart, DYOR!)*

**TLDR;** We're betting on ARKK's underdogs. High risk, potentially high reward. Is it time for these stocks to shine?

**\*\*So what do you think, apes? Can these underdogs have their day?\*\***

Data Reference: ARKK holdings and YTD returns as of 12/21, with underperformers highlighted. Orange redactions are those 3 tickers under $500MM MC.

Its integration with Apple CarPlay could provide Apple with an efficient and comprehensive way to access a wide range of vehicle data without the need for separate agreements and development with each car manufacturer and OEM.  This integration could mean that CarPlay would not only display content across multiple screens within the vehicle but also tap into the deeper functionalities and diagnostics of the car. Access to data such as engine performance, fuel efficiency, temperature controls, and more, could significantly enhance the user experience, making CarPlay a central hub for both infotainment and vehicle monitoring.

"In the latest denial by the SEC to write new rules which Coinbase requested, the SEC made it clear that their is already an exchange who is coming into compliance with their rules. They did not name it but that exchange is prometheum (https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/21/prometheum-earns-final-regulatory-nod-to-try-hand-at-fully-compliant-crypto/).  They are also creating a new rule in April which will only allow registered entities to act as custodians. 

The SEC will almost certainly not allow an entity which is currently involved in litigation and charged with securites violations to act as the custodian for the new Bitcoin spot ETFs. It is far more likely that in their recent meetings they have advised Blackrock to modify their application to designate Prometheum as their custodian. It also does not make sense to allow $COIN to be the custodian and then pass a new rule 4 months later saying only registered entities can be custodians.

In summary, the SEC has beef with $COIN and is already hinting that Prometheum will be their golden child in the Crypto asset space because they are playing by the SEC's rules.

" At this stage, Microsoft is essentially an AI copilot factory, as Satya explained in the conference call:

""We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce.""

It is a unified server that dishes out business applications to billions of people worldwide. As folks use these apps, they generate data, which can then be used to train AIs that automate work.

What' was interesting is we saw margins expand this quarter (Q1 FY2024).

Microsoft’s gross margin came in at 71.16% in Q1 FY2024, up from 69.84% last quarter–a high since 2014.

In turn, operating margin came in at 47.59%, up from 41.08% last quarter \[1\].

It turns out this was mostly due to a novel architecture that Microsoft has deployed, to obtain maximum leverage per AI model.

According to management, increases in gross margin are due primarily to ‘improvements’ in the cloud and Office 365 businesses. Satya clarifies these improvements during the Q&amp;A:

""But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service…

The lesson learned from the cloud side is–we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses, it's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio, and that, I think, is going to be very important because that discipline, given what it will look like for this AI transition, any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.""

Over time, this architecture will enable Microsoft to maximize the number of users engaged with copilots daily, while minimizing computing expenses. This should ultimately equate to a higher earning power.

I wonder whether other cloud players are doing the same?",Why Microsoft's gross margins are expanding (up 1.89% QoQ).,18p3r0i,1703330862.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18p3r0i/why_microsofts_gross_margins_are_expanding_up_189/,

"To start, Ive owned shares of US Steel for a while, bought in the low 20s because ""infrastructure""  and I sold when the news broke and it went over 50. I already got paid. Im only giving you sone info so you dont get suckered into a bearish position over nonsense and lose your money. In fact if you dont have a position, dont play it all because we know the ceiling.

Ownership of the stock brings up my first point. These are both publically traded companies, anyone can own them. There are countless ""US"" companies owned by foreigners as well. These company invest because they want to make money and do business here. Nippon Steel planned to expand and wants to take the fight to chinese Sreel companies who dominate the top ten of largest steel companies on the planet. Those jobs at US Steel arent going anywhere and Nippon already said they were going to honor previous deals with the union etc.

""But muh national security"" 

First of, Japan is our ally and those Steel Mills are on US Territory worked by Americans. Second of all, if we needed to suddenly build a bunch of shit using steel for war or whatever, we could hit the numbers we need without US Steel at all if neccesary. Lets face it, US Steel isnt the big company it was a hundred years ago.  They fell behind to several companies in the US and were very slow to adapt to new tech comoared to their rivals. Nippon Steel is a top 3 company globally, maybe wed learn a thing or two from them. Why are we weakening our alliance with one of our strongest allies over nonsense? Most of our steel comes from.the US, Canada, Mexico, etc. This isnt changing that. US Security experts already said this wouldnt be a security issue. And like I said before, publically traded, anyone can own it..I owned a piece of it and I trade in my underwear.

Plenty of American companies are foreign owned..GE is owned by a chinese company for example, I bet none of these politicians made a fuss over that. Funny how most of the politicians opposing this are from Ohio. Couldnt possibly because they want CLF to buy US Steel, could it? Of course it is..Are they going to make a fuss over the ten other companies or so that made better offers than CLF? Attracting foreign investment is a sign of stregth economically. Nippon Steel sees a lot of business to be done in the US. US Steel also had plenty of offers. So youd be a fool to short or buy puts.

I think this deal is better for consumers. Its another big option domestically which keeps things competitive. Competition is good, otherwise you end up with situations like the cable or phone companies whete most people only have two choices and both companies know they can work together to fuck the consumers. And maybe the US learns a thing or two from a top 5 steel.company on the planet. Nippon + US Steel would become the third largest steel company on the planet overtaking a Chinese company Ansteel Group. The largest US company is Nucor who isnt even top 15 globally.

So how do ypu pkay this as a stock? You dont...unless you had a time machine and got in when I got in, or listened to me when the first offers to buy US Steel came in and I said its got some room to run up. Like I said as soon as that 55 a share deal was announced I sold at 50 because id rather have guarenteed  profit now over waiting for just a few bucks per share more. In fact thats probably a lot of thevrecent sales, a lot of people taking their profit..I more than doubled my money on some boomer stock with a slight dividend  that usually moved at a snails pace..Thats a win in my book. 

They might scare you into puts shorts with xenophobic nonsense and politcal theater but I think youll lose your money..This industry has a lot of upcoming work, this company had a bunch of offers to buy it, someone was willing to pay nearly $15 billion for some ancient relic of a company in the industry, and I highly doubt this gets rejected so more than likely goes for $55 a share like planned. We have an idea what the worst case scenario for a floor is, we know what the ceiling is, theres not much toom to play.",Why the outrage over US Steel being bought by Nippon is dumb- just the dumbest politicians trying to rile up their xenophobic supporters,18oyexo,1703308597.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18oyexo/why_the_outrage_over_us_steel_being_bought_by/,

As I sat at my laptop last weekend staring at CHARTZ (because lol @ spending time with my family or doing anything at all productive) and I happened upon something that I think may score some post-holiday cheese whilst providing less stress than the typical trading strats I tend to employ, which are mostly impulse-buying 0DTE spy call/puts and then looking on helplessly as they become losses.

As rumour has it, Winter is Coming©. The prophesies tell us that people everywhere will be using natural gas to heat their ~~homes~~ lean-tos and help them survive the harsh winter temperatures and frozen undead attacks. This gives us the opportunity to invest in something we might (read: would almost certainly) never consider under normal, sober circumstances: energy stocks. To be more specific, I am talking *natural gas* stocks.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: But JL, energy stocks are boring and shit and have done nothing but lose money all year, wtf would I even want to think about them let alone *trade* them? And you'd be right to think it, for those reasons and others. However, after “studying on it a bit” as my grandad used to say, I discovered something I found interesting that I'd not seen before. Actually, I’m pretty sure is common knowledge to everyone but my dumb ass…but, well, we are where we are so I figure I’ll share it anyway and get some wsb opinions and maybe even see if anyone else has had success with this before.

If you’re like me, gods fucking help you. Also if you’re like me, you might assume that natural gas stock prices tend to rise as winter approaches...because natural gas prices are rising because winter is coming and people will be expected to use more gas, right? Makes sense. However, even if natural gas stock prices were tied perfectly to the price of natural gas (they’re not), a quick perusal of historical prices reveals that natural gas prices have little correlation with how cold it is outside:

[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdW.htm](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdW.htm)

For our purposes here (or at least the purpose of furthering my argument) this is a *good* thing; as natural gas is a commodity, we are not completely in the dark as to what the price will be in January:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngf24](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngf24)

As the spot price history shows, there are seasons where we see natural gas prices increase as winter approaches/progresses...and there are seasons where we don't. So wtf is going on here? How should I fucking know? All I know is that these turds tend to rise to rise in price from around like, well, early November to now-ish, into January, sometimes February, sometimes even March. Afterward, late March - April or so, they tend to fall, as we will see. 

In addition to the lack of correlation between natural gas price and stock price, the severity of the season also does not appear to have (much of) an impact. Winters of 17-18 and 18-19 were colder than normal in North American per wiki, but we generally saw less ng stock price movement (see below). Winter 20-21 was colder than either of those (the phrase ""polar vortex"" presented itself repeatedly in my research) and there was a lot of upward movement that season...but the entire market was still in recovery from covid lows, so I am not certain it can be entirely  (or even mostly) because of the weather. Plus, the movements were often larger in 21-22 and 22-23, both of which were mild winters.

Therefore, I have talked myself into believing that we can use this, er, call it a ""tendency,"" to our advantage. I seek either validation, or reasons why ""this has been tried a million times before and it never works and wtf are you wasting my time with this crap?""

Anyhow, below are a few of the tickers I’ve looked at:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Antero Resources (AR) – last close 22.76, 52-wk rg 34.66 - 19.91

\-at 43.69%. it is the highest IV stock I looked at, HV 47.35% (100D), 23% IV percentile, 28.73% IV rank

\-based on 3 month squiggly lines if TA is your thing: RSI about 42; MACD recent crossed above signal line; current price is slightly above 10-day MA, but around $4 below 50-day MA

\-no dividend

\-next ER due 2/14

\-if you hate charts or just prefer tables, you can get historical weekly prices here, click the link then click ""historical data"" then enter the dates above (I used weekly frequency):

[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AR?p=AR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AR?p=AR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

I found this one interesting for a few reasons. 1) The high(er) IV should give us the best option prices initially if we are shorting; 2) AR has one of the better buy/hold/sell ratings that I saw of all of them, from the ones listed on Yahoo to Barchart to Merrill/RH, though Fidelity's cited analysts aren't as excited; 3) it isn’t far from its 52-week low, so the optimist in me thinks it has room to run, and 4) they are a NATURAL GAS company, so theoretically not susceptible to oil price swings fucking up our mojo (more on that below).

On the other hand, it doesn't follow the ""tendency"" as reliably as some of the others. It followed least in the covid meltdown year and recovery year after. That might be forgivable considering the circumstances, but there were others that DID follow the pattern even then, though it’s arguable that this was coincidence as the market bottom happened to hit in March.

2. Matador Resources (MTDR) – last close 57.64, 52-wk rg 42.04 – 56.94

\-second-highest IV I looked at, 39.76%, HV 35.52% (100D), IV percentile 30%, IV rank 29.5%

\-assorted TA shit: 100-day RSI 50.43%, MACD recently crossed above signal line, just above 20-day but below 5 and 50-day MAs, whatever

\-pays a quarterly dividend, 1.4% annual, last ex-date 11/09/23, last pay date 12/01/23

\-next ER due 2/20

\-no weekly options

Like AR, MTDR is company that deals with natural gas, not oil or other commodities (again, more below). It has good buy/hold/sell recs from multiple sources (I didn’t see any sells) so it might be a good play independent of this trend. The best part is that it follows the trend every winter since 2017. The movements were not as big (i.e. profitable) in 17-19, but from then on, forget about it (with the above caveats about the covid crash and recovery).

Possible downsides include the dividend, which could be a false sell signal, the fact that there are no weekly options, making it more difficult to roll positions if needed (though OI does not appear to be an issue), and the possibility that I am simply full of shit.

3. Coterra Energy (CTRA) – last close 25.74, 52-wk rg 22.25 – 29.89

\-IV 23.85%, HV 22.27% (100D), IV percentile 13%, IV rank 9.79%

\-TA again: 100-day RSI 48.91%, 25.46 5-day, 25.48 20-day, 26.86 50-day, MACD recently crossed signal line except the wrong way; I know you’re skipping this part

\-dividend of 3.17% paid quarterly, last ex-date 11/15/23, last pay date 11/30/23

Honestly, I was mainly attracted to this one because of the bargain level options premiums but, as you can see for yourself, that may not mean much. If I am to believe that this is a cyclical, HISTORICAL trend, I can’t handwave the 100D HV away, and it’s shit. So is the 52-wk range, suggesting this one does not have far to move and it may be range-bound. That said, we can see by the chart that it’s at least capable of not being a deadass, and again calls are kind of cheap, so I threw it into the mix.

4. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) – last close 84.73, 52-wk rg 75.36 – 93.69

\-IV 21.37%, HV (100D) 30.82%, IV Percentile 14%, IV rank 14.57%

\-What’s the point?: 14-day RSI: 52.81%, 84.56 5D, 83.73 20D, 85.29 50D; MACD above signal line blah blah

So XLE, you would think, wouldn’t work, right? This EFT only has 26 holdings, and only a handful of them are natural-gas-only companies. Nearly 40% of it is comprised of only two of these, XOM and CVX, two companies known mainly for oil. In fact, if you compare the XLE chart to the XOM chart over the same time period, they look quite similar. So why put this one on here?

Well, XLE is one of the tickers most faithful to the winter trend of them all. This suggests that, despite the assumption that this would be overly-sensitive to changes in crude prices, that does not appear to be the case (again with the qualifier this is not just a figment of my imagination). Plus, oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are major producers of natural gas, producing 14% of all US natural gas in 2022 [https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60902](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60902). Furthermore, despite the low IV numbers, there is plenty of movement between winter and spring; more than enough to justify its inclusion and a possible play. That there are no earnings to deal with is an added bonus.

I looked at other tickers as well, but this post is already too long and those charts were tedious as hell to create. I will list them here if you would like to take a look yourselves. Some are better than others, of course:

With the lowish IV, CSPs are out (plus we know it will go down if the ""tendency"" holds), which leaves maybe vertical spreads. But I'm thinking instead something more simple: buy calls now, sell calls when it ""peaks"" (or when we think it's peaked), then buy puts to cash on the expected decline. The problem, as always, will be figuring out when the ""peak"" has hit. But even if we are wrong in our timing, we might be able to just keep rolling until the expected move(s) happen. Or they could just not happen at all, which would obviously suck.

I have already bought a (small, very small) handful of calls on a few of these, all with 1/19 expiry except for XLE which is 2/16, most of which are already red thanks to Wednesday's bullshit.

"Navigating the dynamic landscape of stock markets demands a discerning eye for emerging trends and investment opportunities. Among the stocks poised for a meteoric rise in the coming years stands GameStop (GME). This analysis is grounded in the anticipation of a gaming renaissance in 2025, driven by the imminent release of highly awaited titles, including the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) and an array of other blockbuster games that promise to reshape the gaming landscape.

The Gaming Industry's Growth Trajectory:
The gaming industry's exponential growth over the past decade has been nothing short of spectacular. Propelled by advancements in gaming consoles, virtual reality, and mobile gaming, the market's expansive reach has given rise to diverse gaming experiences. As we approach 2025, the industry is on the cusp of a transformative shift, fueled by the release of groundbreaking titles set to redefine gaming experiences.

Highly Anticipated Games and GameStop's Strategic Positioning:
At the forefront of this gaming revolution is the highly anticipated release of GTA 6, a title that has ignited the imaginations of gamers worldwide. Rockstar Games, the venerable developer behind the Grand Theft Auto series, boasts a proven track record of delivering blockbuster titles that not only captivate gamers but also generate substantial revenue. The impending release of such a highly anticipated game is expected to drive unprecedented foot traffic to GameStop's brick-and-mortar stores and amplify online sales.

Moreover, a lineup of major game releases scheduled for 2025, featuring new installments in popular franchises and innovative titles, is poised to contribute significantly to the surge in demand for gaming products. As a leading retailer specializing in video games, hardware, and accessories, GameStop is strategically positioned to capitalize on this surge in demand.

Digital Transformation and GameStop's Adaptive Strategies:
In the face of the gaming industry's digital transformation, GameStop has showcased remarkable adaptability by diversifying its business model. The company has positioned itself as a hub for gaming enthusiasts, offering a comprehensive range of products and services beyond physical game sales. GameStop's strategic focus on e-commerce, digital downloads, and merchandise has enabled it to maintain relevance in an ever-evolving market.

Furthermore, the renewed interest in physical game collections, limited edition releases, and gaming peripherals represents additional revenue streams for GameStop. As gamers increasingly seek a holistic gaming experience, GameStop's ability to cater to diverse preferences reinforces its central role in the gaming ecosystem.

Community Engagement and Unwavering Brand Loyalty:
One of GameStop's unique strengths lies in its robust community engagement initiatives. Through carefully curated events, promotions, and exclusive offerings, the company has successfully cultivated a loyal customer base. The sense of community fostered by GameStop creates an environment where gamers feel connected and valued, fostering a level of brand loyalty that extends far beyond transactional relationships.


In conclusion, GameStop's potential for a significant stock price increase in the coming years is firmly rooted in the anticipation of a gaming renaissance fueled by the release of highly awaited titles. GTA 6 and an array of blockbuster games are expected to propel increased demand for gaming products, positioning GameStop as a key beneficiary in the retail space. As the gaming industry continues to flourish, GameStop stands ready to ride the wave of success and deliver value to investors who recognize the company's strategic positioning in this lucrative market. The confluence of highly anticipated game releases, GameStop's adaptability, and its community-centric approach paints a promising picture for investors seeking opportunities in the ever-evolving gaming landscape.",GameStop's Potential Soars: A Bullish Outlook on GME Stock Amidst the Gaming Renaissance and Upcoming Blockbusters “Any thoughts?”,18qmk8k,1703524156.0,https://i.redd.it/4fv1czmx3h8c1.jpeg,

"This bank is actually about the same size as the Swiss Economy. About a year ago, it was handed a gift by the Swiss Government. The faltering Credit Swiss was forced to sell itself to UBS for about $1 per share, when the true value was about $30 per share.  Several months ago, UBS was required, by financial accounting rules to recognize this boost to its balance  sheet.  While the stock has climbed from $18 a share to $30 a share, there is still another $30/share growth built into the shares.

"I 've been receiving numerous requests from various trading groups for insights into my methodology, and I've taken the time to articulate it for everyone's benefit. Before venturing into swing trading with this strategy, it's essential to conduct thorough backtesting on your chosen symbols. Personally, I apply this method in the forex market, focusing on major pairs like USDJPY, NZDUSD, EURUSD, as well as indices such as US30 and US100. This approach demands patience and emotional discipline, operating on a longer time horizon that takes weeks and months to fully play out. Profits are typically substantial, often reaching into the thousands of pips, though market fluctuations can result in smaller gains. Key to success is adapting the method to your preferred symbols, diligently backtesting, and embracing a patient, disciplined approach. Thoroughly understanding the performance characteristics through backtesting is crucial before live implementation. Profits may not be immediate, as this strategy requires time for market conditions to align, and gains are usually seen over extended periods.  


I initiate my analysis on the weekly chart, observing the trend direction based on the slope of the RSI. A downward slope signals potential short opportunities, while an upward slope indicates potential long opportunities. I prefer going long when the weekly RSI approaches oversold conditions. However, if the RSI is near the 30 line and has recently crossed a swing low, I consider this a suitable entry point for long positions. Conversely, for short positions, I focus on a sloping down weekly RSI, avoiding selling when it's at 30 or below and never buying when it's at 70 or above.  
After marking significant swing points on the weekly chart, I zoom in on the daily chart, maintaining the same RSI conditions—avoiding buying when RSI is at 70 or above and never selling when it's at 30 or below. On the daily chart, I seek RSI signals of reversal, such as divergences or double top/bottom patterns. Additionally, I look for price action that clears out liquidity from old swing points, with a preference for double touches over singles. The ideal entry scenario involves a new trend forming, characterized by lower highs for short positions and higher lows for long positions.  
Upon meeting these conditions, I further zoom in to the 30-minute chart to identify potential reversals in price action. It is crucial to recognize the preliminary stop and the automatic reaction, anticipating a secondary test. In the case of a one-touch reversal, I look for confirmation in the form of a choch and for the price to hold above the last swing point. I avoid entering when the RSI is in extreme conditions, waiting for it to relax on the 30-minute chart. This brief wait provides an opportunity to assess whether price will fill any imbalances created during the automatic reaction. A secondary test into a fair value gap is an optimal place to set a limit order, sometimes placed below the new higher zone created from the choch accumulation.  
Certain reversals exhibit a clear preliminary stop, followed by an automatic reaction and a buying/selling climax before bouncing back into the zone marked out by the preliminary stop. On the daily chart, this is often represented by a long wick.  


In addition to RSI, I pay close attention to candlestick patterns on the weekly and daily charts, particularly engulfing candles. A reset in RSI, coupled with an engulfing candle, prompts consideration for a position on the 30-minute chart. After a buying/selling climax, I anticipate the RSI to cross the midline, signaling a potential proper choch in price structure. The climax should ideally create a divergence on the RSI or a double touch, with lower volume than the preliminary stop.  
Exiting positions follows the same principles as entry, but inverted.  


My risk management strategy involves starting with a 30-pip stop, adjusting it to break even +1 once price consolidates past my entry. If the price shows signs of continuation and moving against me within 10 pips, I opt to close the trade to minimize losses. My stops are typically well past the last swing point to avoid being triggered by market makers during a sweep. Stops are never placed on the point or inside any imbalance. I begin trailing my stop past break even +1 after about 100 pips, moving it below the last liquidity sweep, and 50+ pips from price. When the weekly RSI reaches a new reversal zone, my stop is approximately 30 pips from the price.  


To manage risk, I impose a limit on drawdowns, ensuring that losses for each trade do not exceed the predetermined risk threshold. These rules collectively form the foundation of my trading strategy, allowing for adaptability to changing market conditions. In addition, I incorporate the MACD to identify potential reversals by examining its location and color. For instance, an overbought RSI coupled with a MACD crossing from green to red suggests a potential short entry with a 30-pip stop, and vice versa for long positions. For optimal results, I prefer extreme MACD conditions before the crossover; however, a crossover above the midline from red to green indicates favorable conditions for longs, while a crossover below the midline from green to red signals potential shorts.  


The required patience in this strategy is not without its well-deserved rewards. Structured to capture substantial profits, often extending into the thousands of pips, this method is designed to withstand the natural ebb and flow of the market. While occasional smaller gains may occur, the allure lies in the potential for significant returns. Success in this approach pivots on a meticulous adherence to the method's principles, with the waiting period being integral to the strategy. For those who commit to the patient and disciplined execution of this trading method, the potential rewards are not only substantial but also a testament to the efficacy of a methodical and patient approach in the dynamic world of trading. In an arena where impulsiveness and emotional reactions can often lead to losses, this approach stands as a beacon for those seeking significant benefits over time.  


I want to emphasize that my insights into financial markets, akin to studying the movements of market makers and price delivery, are presented purely for educational and informational purposes. I meticulously employ methods such as chart analysis, indicators, and historical data to decode market behavior and make predictions about future price movements.

"I've never posted anything useful on WSB, so thought I would take a stab at giving something back to all you regards. Here goes...

First off, a little background. Back in 2020 Covid hit and Western policymakers literally lost their minds and embarked on MMT on a truly breath taking scale. Let's use a simple chart to drive home the point. Here is the YoY growth in M2 as per the FRED website ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).

https://preview.redd.it/ke0jg9bmz88c1.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddadcfddfb53d184e4530f3a14ce8e8dd56e3ab3

Inflation skyrocketed and speculative assets went berserk (crypto, spacs, meme stocks etc). Of course the inflation was transitory and almost certainly caused by Covid-related supply chain shocks (sarcasm).

https://preview.redd.it/9rhvq5j6198c1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3de93ef0fb8a2aab425198c53b2f0fbff2744d01

You don't need a PhD in economics to know that Santa Claus isn't real, and you also don't need one to know what caused inflation (hint - it might have been handing out free money to everyone).

Eventually the FED decide that inflation might not be so transitory after all, and decided to rapidly increase the FED Funds rate from basically zero to just over 5%. They did this after around 15 years of zero interest rate policy where borrowers had all become addicted to free money. Another hint, people borrow a lot more money when interest rates are low and are therefore even more sensitive to increases.

https://preview.redd.it/g1nblggkv88c1.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a2e05b14a969975b13a1a2b3483c8acdf923c79

As we can see in the charts above, the M2 YoY growth has gone negative, and interest rates have risen by 5% off of a near zero base. Most investors were expecting this (quite logically) to result in an economic slowdown.

Now, inflation is clearly falling (is that surprising given how far/fast monetary policy has tightened?) but the economy is apparently doing just fine because unemployment is still low. Powell has pivoted and the media is fawning all over him for achieving a soft landing (note, we haven't landed yet).

Meanwhile, are there any signs that maybe we should be worried?

\- The Conference Board's [Leading Indicator Index](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-conference-board-leading-economic-index-lei-for-the-us-fell-again-in-november-302021055.html) just fell again and continues to signal a recession in 2024.- US credit and auto delinquencies [continue](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-buy-now-pay-later-splurges-raise-holiday-debt-hangover-risk-2023-12-20/) to rise.- China's real estate sector is still [imploding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bricks-banks-chinas-real-estate-190110747.html).- German property prices are [tumbling](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-home-prices-fall-record-102-third-quarter-2023-12-22/) and Europe is heading for a hard landing.- The UK appears to be [heading](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67799713) for a mild recession.- FedEx just [slumped](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fedexs-stock-drops-as-company-trims-sales-forecast-10478d00) after a profit warning.- We just had an unusually [weak](https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/2023/11/sp-500-2023-q3-earnings-review-aggregate-earnings-reach-an-all-time-high/#) Q3 earnings season.- In the long run current valuations tend to predict future returns, and these look [pretty unappealing](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) in the US.

I could go on and on.

Investing is a game of probabilities, a soft landing is certainly possible, so is a resurgence in inflation, and so is a hard landing. I find it absolutely mind boggling how confident so many people suddenly seem to be so confident in the soft landing.

I'll leave you with two parting thoughts...

\- In **November 2023** most people [thought](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more) that interest rates were going to be high for a decade or more.- In **late 2007** plenty of experts were [sure](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26247192/) that we were heading for a soft landing.

Personally, I look at all of the data and still think that there is a real risk of a hard landing but am trying to maintain a portfolio that will survive in many scenarios. I hope that this inspires some of you to think for yourselves rather than falling for the FOMO and jumping into expensive equities because indices are surging and there is a growing chorus that you are going to be left behind in the next bull market.

&amp;#x200B;",Year end reflections,18pw67d,1703427860.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18pw67d/year_end_reflections/,
"**RIOT Stock**

The first crypto stock on our list is Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT). The company owns 7,358 BTC at a market value of $315 million. While Riot Platforms started out as a small patent holding company known as Bioptix, it ditched its original business model in 2017 and turned into a fully dedicated Bitcoin miner.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to become a leading BTC mining company, Riot purchased tens of thousands of high quality Antminers from Bitmain developing a massive fleet of high-end miners in the process. Riot achieved an impressive 112,944 miners by the end of November which allow it to produce an average 18.4 BTC every day.

&amp;#x200B;

The company sells hundreds of Bitcoins each month to increase its liquidity, but it was still holding 7,358 BTC, with a market value of $315 million, on its balance sheet at the end of November.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of the crypto rally, RIOT stock increased around 72% from November until now. As BTC’s price continues to increase, Riot’s revenues and profits should increase correspondingly since the company mainly depends on selling Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to selling Bitcoin, the company plans to stabilize its long-term operating margins by selling its excess power back to the grid at spot prices. Riot Platforms has a market cap of $3.44 billion and its stock trades at around $16. Additionally, its expected earnings growth rate for next year is 60.1%.

&amp;#x200B;

**SQ Stock**

A second crypto stock to consider is Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. which owns 8,027 BTC with a market value of $343 million. Block Inc. offers an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers. It is also the parent company of Square, Cash App, Spiral, Tidel and TBD.

&amp;#x200B;

Block Inc. is an important player in the crypto market since its subsidiary, Spiral, is focused on Bitcoin development. It offers a convenient entry to the crypto market through Cash App, which allows its users to buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. Additionally, the company’s decentralized TBD platform allows developers to build finance applications to run on programmable blockchains.

&amp;#x200B;

In its Q3 earnings results, Block generated $5.62 billion in revenue, of which 43% came from Bitcoin. The company’s gross profit also increased by 21% year-over-year, reaching $1.9 billion this quarter. Meanwhile, Cash App reported 27% increase in gross profit reaching $984 million.

&amp;#x200B;

These signs of life for SQ stock are very promising. The company’s performance was squashed in the post-pandemic era, and while it may never reach its pandemic highs of more than $260 per share, it offers a more diversified play for investors looking to benefit from catalysts in the crypto market and a broader recovery in consumer spending.

&amp;#x200B;

As for its exposure to crypto, Block shared that it achieved $45 million in bitcoin gross profit. Block sold $2.42 billion worth of crypto to customers, a 37% increase YoY. This notable growth is thanks to the increasing price of BTC as well as greater demand for the digital asset.

&amp;#x200B;

Beating earnings expectations and raising guidance helped spur SQ stock on a run. Now up 97% since its earnings, the company could continue running in sympathy with any crypto rallies. Considering that the RSI is significantly overbought at 82 on the daily chart, investors may want to watch SQ stock for a pullback to take a position in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

**COIN Stock**

Next on the list of best crypto stocks for 2024 is Coinbase Global. The company owns around 9,000 BTC at a market value of $385 million.

&amp;#x200B;

This company offers a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing cryptocurrency. It provides its customers with a main financial account in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications.

&amp;#x200B;

Coinbase can benefit greatly from the establishment of a Bitcoin ETF since it has been selected as a custodian by nine out of twelve spot-traded BTC ETF candidates. This is not surprising, given that BlackRock picked Coinbase to offer crypto services to institutional investors back in August. Although this crypto exchange came under some scrutiny from the SEC, it is still considered one of the most regulated crypto platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

COIN stock has climbed a whopping 145% since its earnings despite reporting a decline in Q3  trading volumes from $26 billion in 2022 to $11 billion this quarter. The RSI of 80 on the daily timeframe shows COIN stock is significantly overbought, investors may want to wait for a pullback before taking a position.

&amp;#x200B;

Since COIN stock could benefit the most from the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, it is definitely a crypto stock to watch in 2024. Additionally, its expected earnings growth rate for next year is 30.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

**MARA Stock**

A crypto favorite, Marathon Digital Holdings ranks with the largest holding of Bitcoin out of the four stocks chosen. In fact, the company owns 14,025 BTC at a market value of $600 million, making it one of the largest holders of Bitcoin among publicly traded companies in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

MARA is a favorite among crypto stocks and for good reason. As one of the largest, most energy efficient, and most technologically advanced Bitcoin mining companies, MARA could substantially capitalize on the crypto market’s recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

So far Marathon Digital Holdings has differentiated itself by investing in the newest technologies for Bitcoin mining. Very recently, MARA announced it was investing $179 million to acquire two new mining sites which are expected to add 390 megawatts of capacity and reduce the cost per coin mined by around 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

This all cash deal could be just one of many as MARA works to capitalize on acquisition opportunities ahead of Bitcoin’s halving in 2024. Marathon noted that its has more than $800 million of cash and bitcoin to “capitalize on strategic opportunities, including industry consolidation” ahead of the halving event.

&amp;#x200B;

This acquisition announcement has given MARA stock a notable push. The stock has climbed 33% since the announcement but had already climbed 134% since its November earnings. The RSI is notably overbought on the daily timeframe reaching an incredible 87.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, MARA has a market cap of $4.89 billion and its expected earnings growth rate for next year is 74.5%. Those interested in capitalizing on the BTC rally may find opportunities in MARA stock in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

**BITO Stock**

Unlike the other 4 crypto stocks, this one is a little different. While it does not hold BTC, it moves according to changes in the prices of the crypto making it a great opportunity for investors waiting for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF aims to produce returns that correspond to Bitcoin by tracking Bitcoin futures. However, its not without its disadvantages, for example, its 0.95% expense ratio is much higher than the average expense ratio of equity ETFs at 0.16%.

&amp;#x200B;

Because BITO holds Bitcoin futures it is able to more closely track Bitcoin returns than for-profit companies that deal with overhead costs and may have less direct exposure to Bitcoin. On top of that, BITO was one of the best performing ETF’s of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Its YTD daily total return reached 140.08%, and it offers a yield of 14.98%. Additionally, BITO is up nearly 58% since mid-October the ETF has net assets worth $1.46 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

*Crypto Stocks Forecast*

As the crypto market rallies into the end of 2023, its outlook for 2024 looks particularly bullish. With a number of catalysts ranging from Bitcoin’s halving in April, to interest rate cuts, and potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval, crypto stocks like these could be too good to ignore.

" Over the past few decades, Nvidia has been doing the same with its GPUs as Tesla has been doing with its cars: fostering a retro-compatible architecture, enabled by **software**.

Nvidia’s CUDA (a software which enables developers to seamlessly interact with Nvidia GPUs) is effectively a network which ties together all of these seemingly disparate hardware units.

Every iteration of the software accrues to an ever larger installed base, which creates an **ecosystem** that draws talent towards it. The more people that use Nvidia GPUs, the more valuable **each** GPU becomes.

Additionally, Nvidia continues to improve its software at breakneck speed. This quarter it released TensorRT-LLM, which allegedly ‘without anybody touching anything, improves the performance \[of a GPU\] by a factor of **two**.’

During the quarter, Nvidia also announced the launch of the latest member of the Hooper family, the **H200**. It increases inference speed by a factor of **two**, with respect to the H100.

Thus, the combination of hardware and software has enabled Nvidia to increase the performance of its GPUs by a factor of **4** in a year. This would’t be possible without the software.

Additionally, Pandas (the world’s most popular data science framework) is now accelerated by Nvidia CUDA without a single line of code, thanks to the recently launched **cuDF Pandas**.

Further, in my AMD deep dive, I explain the concept of Gen 4 datacenters and how they are a requirement to bring AI to the world at scale. By becoming an indispensable part of these datacenters at the **networking** level, semiconductor companies can gain an **additional moat**.

Gen 4 are essentially **stateful**, meaning that they hold data about their state at all times and can use it to train AI models, so the datacenter gains **autonomy**.

For a datacenter to be stateful, it has to move data around the place **very efficiently**.

Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 enabled it to onboard **two key technologies**:

1. **The BlueField** **DPU:** a data processing unit (DPU) is a specialized processor designed to offload networking, storage, and security tasks from general-purpose CPUs, that enables datacenters to **hold** information about themselves.
2. **Infiniband**: a high-performance networking technology that provides ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and scalable **connectivity for data centers**. It is a key enabler for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and other demanding workloads that require **fast and efficient data transfer**.

While AMD is pursuing a similar roadmap with the acquisition of Pensando, I see no particular progress made on this front.

On the other hand, Nvidia’s networking business now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate, ‘driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew **fivefold** year-on-year.’",Why it's not so easy for AMD to catch up with Nvidia.,18psv7f,1703414539.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18psv7f/why_its_not_so_easy_for_amd_to_catch_up_with/,

Welcome fellow regards, let's dive into UPS's upcoming Q4 earnings. Smells like a dumpster fire, and I say it's time to load up on puts. 

**Slowing Economic Climate:** As the economy faces headwinds, consumer spending and business investments often retract. For UPS, this means potentially fewer packages shipped, directly impacting revenue. Given its position as a logistics behemoth, UPS's performance is tightly interwoven with economic health, making it susceptible to broader market downturns.

- **E-commerce Plateauing:** After a pandemic-induced surge, e-commerce growth is normalizing. This return to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors can lead to decreased shipping volumes. As UPS heavily relies on e-commerce for bulk shipping volumes, any stagnation or decline directly hits its top line.

- **Competitive Pressures:** The logistics space is fiercely competitive, with players constantly innovating to cut costs and improve delivery times. As competitors enhance their offerings or undercut pricing, UPS may need to invest more to maintain its market share or risk losing out, impacting its profitability.


**The Labor Victory: A Double-Edged Sword**

UPS workers ratified a new five-year contract, staving off what would have been a historic strike. This deal, heralded as a major win for both parties, introduces significant wage increases and improved working conditions, including air-conditioning in new trucks and a substantial rise in full-time positions. On the surface, this seems like a clear win for stability and could be seen as a bullish signal for UPS's stock. However, let's peel back the layers:

 **Increased Operating Costs:** While averting a strike is undeniably positive, the substantial increase in wages and benefits might squeeze margins. For a company that thrives on logistical efficiency, these increased costs could impact profitability, particularly in a slow economic cycle.
- **Market Reaction to Cost Pressures:** Investors might be jittery about how these increased expenses will affect the bottom line. If the market perceives that these costs will significantly dent future earnings, it could lead to a bearish sentiment, making puts a relevant play.

**Economic Gloom = Slowing Shipments:** Tightening belts mean fewer packages flying. Less business for UPS spells more bad news for their bottom line. Consumer spending is tightening, and this directly translates to lower package volumes. For a company that prides itself on being at the heart of commerce, any reduction in consumer and business spending is bad news. This isn't just about a single company's earnings; it's about a broader economic trend that could pressurize UPS's performance.

This isn't about guarantees; it's about risking all of my money on one play.",UPS Earnings: Loading Puts for the Q4 Dumpster Fire?,18qv9vo,1703550984.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18qv9vo/ups_earnings_loading_puts_for_the_q4_dumpster_fire/,

I feel with Intel they have a lot of potential because they are starting to compete a little bit better with their new meteorlake chips, and by getting into the AI space. Intel is also a lot more cheaper and I can get a decent price for a further contract. This would give me some more time to hope for them to come up with something good. AMD is a lot more expensive for a contract expiring sooner. This doesn't give me much time and I don't know if they really are cooking up anything different from what they're already doing.

"What I find interesting is that at-the-money calls are currently only pricing in a \~3.8% annualized return through the end of this decade.

For example, the 4,700 calls are about 1,261 each ($126,100 entry cost), implying a break even index value of 4,700 + 1,261 = 5,961 by the end of 2029. The S&amp;P 500 is currently at 4,755.

The S&amp;P 500 has historically returned over 9% annualized. Even with a more modest 6% annualized return through 2029, you’re looking at potential massive gains on this option contract.

If the S&amp;P is below 4,700 when 2030 rings in (implying a lost half-decade), something is seriously wrong with the economy.

"I’ll try to make this as short as possible for everyone. This is a bit more of a “longer term” DD post.

TSLA is being significantly undervalued for the upcoming Optimus humanoid bots. If you look at a couple of videos TSLA has released, these bots have gotten significantly better over the past few years and their capability will only exponentially grow.

Sure we’ll start off with just a few extremely wealthy people having these bots, but Musk is planning to mass manufacture these things. A decade or so down the line, you’ll be able to get your own robot maid for 10K a pop. Everyone and their grandma will have one to do mundane tasks for us. And there are no competitors to this. Creating a robot like this is extremely difficult, much less mass manufacturing them. 

There are no competitors in the field and they won’t show up for years due to sheer difficulty of the task as a huge portion of creating these things are software. And TSLA will only get further ahead with time with their monopoly.

If TSLA is successful with Optimus, they will bring in trillions of revenue over the years, making 5 trillion market cap eventually seem fairly valued. 

800B market cap today is undervalued.


Edit: it seems there are some understandably quite pessimistic pundits in the chat. This take on TSLA is obviously not definite, but it might help get you ahead of the curve when people start speculating on Optimus perhaps one, two, or even three years down the line.

### Power Charger 4.0

The Power Charger 4.0 boasting a 640kW peak charging power, 765A maximum current,  a maximum voltage of 1,000 volts, and the lightest liquid cooled cable in the industry. It's launching in April 2024 so we can expect to see revenue reflected in its Q3 and Q4 earnings. 

## NIO ET9

This luxury vehicle is very spacious with the largest in-class 23-inch wheels to elevate its presence even more. It has a 0.2 meter ground clearance giving its drivers a higher stance and a commanding view. If its height is too much, it can even be lowered by 0.05 meters in just one second, for an easier entry and exit. With best in-class 0.22 suspension travel, it can also absorb shocks and vibrations easily. 

Its body is made of high-strength aluminum steel, magnesium and composite materials and its smart restraint system can precisely detect different collisions and the bodies of the car’s occupants. This coupled with automatic airbag inflators and seat belt adjustments makes it a very safe vehicle.

Beyond that, the ET9’s intelligent lighting system comes with four different safety standards and reduces risks of accidents by enabling interactions with other road users. Its braking system can also take control at any time and make sure that the car pulls over safely. With an evolving Watchtower sensor layout and wide-angle side LiDARs, it is equipped for both autonomous and assisted driving.  


**NIO ET9 Interior**

As impressive as this car may be, if Nio does try to market it outside of China it may have issues translating to the European market given its size and limited seating. However, the car’s interior illustrates that Nio is clearly targeting the luxury market.

The bridge connecting the back to front of the vehicle has a mini fridge drawer with a 10 liter capacity which opens with just one touch. The second row even has a fold-out table with a 360 degree range, allowing occupants to use the table for anything.

The seats themselves can be set to lounge mode with one tap, offering a range of adjustments. Besides this, there are 14.5-inch screens which automatically adapt to the position of the seat, giving users the best view from any angle. To cut out the glare from the sun, there are even 7 electric sun shades.   


**NIO ET9 Battery**

As for the battery, it allows up to 600kW fast charging, achieving 158 miles of range in just 5 minutes. The NIO ET9 is already available for preorders in China, at a starting price of around $113,000, but deliveries won’t begin until the first quarter of 2025.

Nio has tried to stay out of the cost cutting battle in the Chinese EV market, but with this price tag it is clear that the ET9 will not be competing with EV rivals for economically minded consumers.

  
**Nio’s In-House Chip**

The goal of the NX9031 chip is to deliver the same performance as the industry’s 4 leading chips with its 5 nanometer automotive-grade process and over 50 billion transistors. It has a 32-core CPU, with 615 thousand DMIPS, able to run over 6 trillion commands every second. This is an incredible 2.5 times better than an industry leading processor. Additionally, the in-house developed NPU can run various AI algorithms flexibly and efficiently, outperforming many of the mainstream AD algorithms.

"With the prospect of rate cuts in 2024, we should ask ourselves how we can best benefit. 

This is just my opinion and not financial advice.

One approach would be to look at companies with slow (but steady) sales growth and high debt that have not performed well recently. Interest rate cuts should ultimately reduce their interest payments and thus allow these companies to grow earnings despite their slow sales growth. This would be an investment thesis for Verizon Communications, for example.

Of course, rate cuts could also have a positive impact on homebuilders such as KB Home, M/I Homes, Green Brick Partners, Toll Brothers, etc. In addition, there is a housing shortage in much of the U.S., and millennials are starting to need to put down roots...

Recently invested $14K into CPE Call Options due to recent news there are rumors of a potential buyout on the horizon.
 I’m not expert at valuations in the slightest. Just looked at a recent buyout and plugged some numbers in. Example : Crownrock was offered $12B by OXY in acquisition. It’s production rate is about 170mboe/d. Not sure what Crowns’s debt is, as it is a private company. 
CPE’s production rate is 102mboe/d, so comparable. This would value CPE (exclusive of debt) at $7.2B. Subtract out $2B of debt and maybe you get close to $5B valuation which represents $73/share. Current CPE Market Cap is about 2B. Also this company has a short interest of about 24%. Any thoughts on this?

With the incredible 2023 performance of the Mag7 and Mega caps, it would be naive to think this same growth will be the case next year. The AI paradigm shift is being priced in all aspects required to build its infrastructure. Machinery in AMAT and ASML, chips rising rapidly (literally pick anyone in SMH) or major software companies including cybersecurity. This shift of a new world economy and society is just the beginning of further change.

The other major shift concurrently taking place on consumers and it could likely happen much quicker. $KO is going to be a strong growth stock for the next 3 years (I would argue potential of over 200% growth over this time).

Why, you ask? Fairlife protein shakes. It is being consistently reported by $LLY and $NVO in their research. There is clear and growing importance to pairing with Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. The consensus is that with a lack of craving for ""more"", nutrition is being obtained through these high protein and vitamin shakes with Fairlife. The difference here is the most crucial piece though- they are significantly better tasting and enjoyed for the value and nutrition (according to almost anyone/any forum/ LLY and NVO data). It could be predicted the average diabetic/weight loss patient is likely to be purchasing these for meal replacement. 

If you review  r/Costco posting in regards to this trend, you will find them constantly sold out. Individuals and employees state they are getting as many of the 18 cases as they can. Others have noted the price of such increasing from 27$ to 35$ per 18 pack in a 6-month span. 

If we just use the most recent data from Goldman Sachs projecting 5 Million patient users, who could expectedly drink one of these Fairlife shakes per day, (Note: Goldman expectation is JUST for Mounjaro), $KO Market cap can expect to grow 10.9% up to $286 Bln. However, this assumes a stagnant PE ratio at current \~23 level. If there is any further growth expectations from investors, or sustainable forward/current PE levels; $KO could be a top performer in the next 3 years, especially compared with Large Value peers. Additionally, if any form of insurance coverage supports these new drugs, there would likely be a neon swan event that could propel $KO near $800Bln-$1Trln market cap over the 3-5 years.

Update: it will cost you 61$ and 3 weeks to get an 18 pack of Fairlife

"In this post, I am going to use some actual logic and reasoning, some anecdotal evidence, and some degenerate logic to appeal to everyone as to why this is gonna be my #1 pick for 2024.

Let's start with some degenerate logic for you guys: Wix is based in Israel. They've been getting attacked for 100 years and still managed to become a tech powerhouse. Intel just announced a multi-billion dollar investment there, and they're gonna win this War on their terms no matter what some mamby pambys crying on social media do.  When they win: Bam. Rally. So buy in for the ""Israel won the the war"" rally, coming soon.

Actual Logic and Reasoning: Wix is a leader in a growing and important space. There's some easy transitions into some big markets, and the area of 'no code' websites and tools are becoming a growing part of basic e-commerce sites and most low hanging fruit. Sure, there will always be complex tools needed custom built from professionals, but most restaurants, e-commerce stores, personal brands, news outlets, media brands, and anything of the sorts is where Wix shines.

I am a writer, have a few of my own companies, SEO professional, news, data &amp; analytics, ran some stores, etc. I've used and built with WordPress, Wix, and custom stacks (react), and have used Shopify, Squarespace, and GoDaddy. Basically, I've used all the options in some capacity. Wix currently has a 43% global website builder market share AND GROWING.

Right now, I think Wix is quickly becoming the #1 overall option. As far as investing goes:

Shopify is at a forward P/E of 73, and Squarespace is at 31. Wix has a P/E of 23 and still largely depressed stock price after their fall from grace duringthe 2022 crash. (like Zoom and other stay-at-home stocks.)

As far as the competitors, I've used them all and the advantages between them are quickly fading. Wordpress used to be the 'default CMS' and #1 option for SEO. Now, in my experience, Wix is better for SEO. Let's break it down:- Shopify:  Tends to be the go-to for the e-commerce side of the house. It has a few advantages, like built-in warehousing and some other key features. But largely falls flat on many things outside of this. Wix is making some quick headway here and has apps, services, and other options here for users to build out.

\- Wordpress: Wordpress used to be the go-to CMS for anyone looking to write blog posts or news. It still is in many ways because its an 'open-source' solution. You can develop on the WordPress program to let users publish on, for example, a custom-built website that's not WordPress. But for anyone with a casual blog, or even a semi-professional basic news site, Wix is more than enough. Wix has an open source program called Velo now to compete with this anyway that I know a lot of people use. I have top-ranked stories published through Wix, and my Wix site has done better SEO-wise than many WordPress sites I've used (I know, for example, backlinks play a huge role in this, but it's just something I've discovered.)  I don't know anyone that uses Wordpress for e-commerce.

\- Squarespace: It used to be top of the line, then they just gave up.  It's like the budget option that everyone starts out with then abandons because it's terrible at everything.

Here's some key points of growth for Wix:

\- Payment Processing: You can now use Wix as a payment processor. They take 2.5% and that can QUICKLY add up when you've got millions of websites around the globe. As they keep taking market share, and become a more legitimate option for medium-to-large companies, that could add up quick. It's cheaper than competitors by like .3%, so makes it easier to switch. They're already getting involved in integrating POS devices so people can use Wix to process payments in physical stores as well. So now, they can get in physical retail stores of all the companies on their list.

\- Newsletters: Everyone has a newsletter now. It's exhausting. I have like three. Wix gives you all the features everyone else has and more because you can integrate it all in one. Lots of people would, for example, use Mailchimp, Beehiiv, or Hubspot for their newsletters AND THEN have several other services for hosting their website, accounts, etc. Wix has a paid newsletter service now, which means people will now launch a website + a newsletter on their site all in one. It maxes out at about $60/month for unlimited email sends. Convert a few hundred thousands users there and you're looking at some solid rev growth of pure profit.

\- Velo: For people that want that all-in-one solution that Wix offers but using a more open-source and custom solution, Wix launched Velo. Wordpress isn't the only opensource CMS option now, and you can build out some impressive options with the site.

Position: 500 shares (on margin, for the degeneracy.) I'd buy calls.... but there's not enough volume which sketches me out there a tad.

However, IGT is a hidden gem overshadowed by its reputation in gambling. IGT isn’t just a casino play; it's a tech powerhouse waiting to be revalued. The following DD explores why a potential sale of their business will send the stock to Valhalla.

# Potential Sale, Merger / Spin-off

Written in a [press release](https://ir.igt.com/news/news-details/2023/IGT-to-Explore-Strategic-Alternatives-for-its-Global-Gaming-and-PlayDigital-Segments-to-Drive-Long-Term-Sustainable-Value/default.aspx) from June 8th, 2023:

`LONDON, June 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- International Game Technology PLC (""IGT"") (NYSE: IGT) announced today that its Board of Directors is evaluating potential strategic alternatives for IGT's Global Gaming and PlayDigital segments in order to unlock the full value of IGT's portfolio. IGT's Board of Directors is considering a broad range of potential alternatives, including but not limited to a sale, merger or spin-off, as well as retaining and further investing in the Global Gaming and PlayDigital businesses.`

`“Over the last three years, IGT has sharpened its strategic focus by reorganizing around core product verticals, monetizing non-core assets, reducing structural costs and significantly improving its credit profile,"" said Marco Sala, IGT Executive Chair. ""We believe the intrinsic value of IGT's market-leading businesses and diversified cash flow profile is not currently reflected in our stock price and the timing is right to assess opportunities that may enhance value for IGT's shareholders.""`

The IGT execs believe that the stock is undervalued due to market perceptions of its Global Gaming and PlayDigital segments. They think these perceptions are not reflective of IGT’s actual value and potential. This concern has led them to consider strategic alternatives, like a sale, merger, or spin-off of these segments, or further investment in them, to realize their true value and improve shareholder returns. The aim is to better “align” the stock price with the company's overall performance.

*Tldr; they want stock price to go up and are actively exploring methods to make this happen.*

Oh, and after this announcement, the stock pumped 24% in speculation over the potential sale.

# But what will happen?

*They’ll sell off the PlayDigital and Global Gaming business.*

How do I know this? Because:

1. Selling could net them a whopping $5-6 billion – that's like 50 times their annual net income, for selling just a slice of their total business. (well slightly less than half)
2. The stock will pump like crazy if this happens. It’s not only the most entertaining outcome but it will secure generational wealth for the execs when they inevitably unload shares at the pico top.
3. IGTs Chief Accounting Officer just retired (more on this later)
4. This will slap the market in the face and get people to re-evaluate the stock and company.

After the initial press release, not much really happened. Things were sideways again. However, the stock had a mini 10% pump again on September 14th after there were reports that Apollo Global was a potential suitor for the deal.  [Indy Gaming: Hedge fund and Venetian operator Apollo may be eyeing IGT - The Nevada Independent](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-gaming-hedge-fund-and-venetian-owner-apollo-may-be-eyeing-igt)

This indicates that 3 months later, IGT was still exploring the option of a potential sale. I also like seeing the positive price action as a result of this news, as it validates that the price of the stock may increase if bigger news were to drop.

It’s been another 3 months since that report, and things have continued sideways. But something interesting happened in the meantime.

**Chief Accounting Officer Retires**

`LONDON, Dec. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- International Game Technology PLC (""IGT"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: IGT) announced today that Tim Rishton, IGT Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, will retire at the end of 2024, following 29 years with the Company. Rishton will be succeeded by David Morgan, who will take on the role of IGT Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer on January 1, 2024. During 2024, Tim will support this leadership transition.`

This to me is pretty much confirmation that they’re going to sell. Why else would the Chief Accounting Officer retire?  His job was about to be 10 times more work when they start rolling over the paperwork. Also, his shares are about to be worth absolute bank after the news drops.

BTW, slightly off topic but related; in 2017, Jeff Bornstein, GE's former CFO, left the company and shortly after his departure, GE underwent significant restructuring and sold off various parts of its business. So this isn’t a totally uncommon move.

**Sony Partnership:**

Did you know IGT is partnered with Sony? Well, it's just because they lease the rights to Wheel of Fortune, and it's Sony Pictures Television... but still pretty neat.

**My thesis:**

IGT has good fundamentals, seems undervalued, and will skyrocket when they lock in a suitor for the sale of their business. I believe they will pursue this strategy because it will increase value for themselves and shareholders.

"This has got to be the most regarded attempt at a buyout offer I've ever seen in my life. Nippon steel saw Cleveland Cliffs offer $35/share for US Steel and decided to YOLO an extra 57% for good measure. Just to be clear, the average buyout price is like 30-50% above the share price prior to announcement. $CLF already hit the 50% target with their offer of $35 when the stock was hovering around $23. You're telling me that the true value of US Steel is actually 157% of the original share price? That's insane.

This is a troll offer. US Steel is absolutely in no way worth the $14B valuation this $55 share price implies. I believe Nippon knows this. They have to. I believe this is an attempt by the Biden administration to generate an opportunity to look tough on foreign investment. Biden can do this by rejecting the offer from Japan's Nippon Steel when it is not just foreign but also an absurdly high offer well above the price from any standard pricing method. 

There's already a ton of talk coming from the government about blocking this deal. I think it 100% gets blocked and $CLF completes the deal at $42, which unfortunately for them is still an overpay.

Had to copy &amp; paste &amp; redo this post because I mentioned banned stocks. Regardless, I’ve been posting updates mostly on holidays. Looking back on my Reddit history, it was almost 100 days ago when I first posted. 98 days ago I finally broke even essentially. Less than a year ago I had an unrealized loss of over 21k.

I originally dipped into stocks when the stock that shall not be named &amp; apes started. Made like $300 on it but promptly lost 1k soon after. I was understandably wary of options and even selling stocks. So if you look at my history there is barely any movement the first year.

Towards the end of 2021 I had the code cracked. This was easy! Buy tech! It NEVER goes down. I even started doing some options. The day pattern trading tag made me not pull the trigger a bunch of times though. I swore when I hit 25k I would make bank. Promptly lost 4k.

2022 was my year tho. I learned my mistakes and was ready. Lost 6k. But this diamond handed regard gained it back in a few months. I was a genius! Tech can’t tank!

Took 2 months to drop 13k. But luckily I had divested of all options and was simply holding stock. After all this was fool proof. Tech can’t keep going down. Oh no? Watch this they said. By the time Christmas rolled around I hit -21k.

I was literally pouring my paychecks directly into Robinhood JUST to prevent getting margin called on stock. Yep. I forgot to mention I was leveraged to the tits the entire time. Figured I was averaging down the whole time. I guess I was but I was leveraged entirely and almost about have these losses realized.

Kept holding though. Kept holding. Kept holding. Held and held and held. Up and down down some more. Up again. Amazon looked like it was mooning after hours in like late spring I think? That’s when I learned you could sell after hours. And I sold Amazon after holding for close to a year.

Ended up selling Google and various other tech when they rose again. But I decided these gains were painfully slow. I spent over a year holding and in that entire time I missed out on real gains. On top of that, that compare your brokerage to ETFs line that Robinhood had for a minute had me obsessed with not only breaking even, but beating it.

Enter scalp trading. Used my tax returns to day pattern trade without restraint. Made constant $100 profits. Made a shit ton of $10 profits which I’m sure is going to be annoying to look at with my annual report. Whenever a stock went negative I would just hold and try to break even hence the small profits. $100 was always good enough for me though and even though I sold way too early, I kept repeating that gains are gains.

My goal was $100 a day. After a few months, I started doubling that. I’d say it was leveraging myself with my gains along with the bull market. I just eyeballed stocks that I thought were “on sale”. Bought options and scalped stock at 100 shares a pop. Eventually, I broke even and posted for the first time here.

I went from $100 a day to $1k a week goal. But these last few months have accelerated. I’m averaging closer to 2k a week now for the past 3 months. I mostly did it by avoiding 0dtes or short options. Never liked that. Too risky. I’d rather spend money for time. I also stayed away from ATH.

So yea, I see others post 100k gains in one day. A lot seem fake to me so I figure I’ll keep posting each holiday. I’ll be the holiday update guy if anyone is interested.

It feels good to be in the green but I also like the benchmarks I set as it helps me stay focused and keep my mind set on taking those gains. When I get fomo is when I lose. Like this week I’m down 2k strictly because I waited on a sale.

I should probably add that I have withdrawn at least 23k for my fiancés ring, and 6.5k to my IRA. I made another 10k on the IRA as well. So these aren’t all my gains. Technically I’m up about 36k now. I don’t know what my cpa will say when he sees my brokerage. Overall I think my gains are 80% roughly accounting for withdrawals.

Unfortunately I had to redo this post and deleted the other banned one so it's missing two more images. I'll post a screen shot of my loss last 12/26 as well as my IRA gain in the comments.

Tl:dr I basically flipped -21 to +36k… I’m not great at math but I made over 50k since last Christmas and I’m thinking I’m going to owe about 8k in taxes now.

"Welcome my fellow regarded, to a semi-deep dive into Aurora Innovation ($AUR), where we'll unpack whether this ambitious player in the autonomous trucking sector is set for disruption or disappointment. I’m gonna look at the financials, strategies, and market context to gauge if Aurora is a solid long-term play.

**Aurora Horizon: A Future of Autonomous Logistics**

Aurora is staking its claim in the autonomous trucking industry with the Aurora Horizon project, eyeing a piece of the $900 billion trucking market. Targeting a 2024 launch, Aurora aims to redefine freight logistics with self-driving technology. The commitment is clear, but the path to profitability is steep, and the company's success hinges on their ability to execute and deliver.

**Financial Health**

- **Total Revenue:** With a reported total revenue of $2,000 in the trailing twelve months (TTM) compared to $68,000 in 2022, the figures are indicative of a company in the early, capital-intensive stages of growth.
- **Operating Income:** Currently, Aurora is operating at a loss with an operating income of -$835,000 TTM, a common trait in tech firms focused on disruptive innovation. It's a bet on future payoff but demands a sustainable path to profitability.
- **Net Income to Common Stockholders:** The net income stands at a substantial -$898,000 TTM, highlighting the company's aggressive investment in research and development.

**In the Field: Implementing Innovation**

Real-world application is crucial for Aurora, and recent activities, such as the collaboration with Frisco police and the establishment of a Texas terminal, demonstrate a commitment to safety and regulatory engagement. These steps are vital for building credibility and trust in their technology, particularly in an industry as critical and scrutinized as freight and logistics.

**Partnering for Progress**

The company's strategic partnerships with industry leaders like PACCAR and FedEx, alongside their pilot programs hauling freight between major Texas cities, demonstrate progress toward commercialization. These initiatives not only serve as a testament to the technology's capabilities but also are critical to Aurora's operational testing, refinement, and eventual market adoption. However, translating these partnerships into commercial success is an ongoing challenge that Aurora must navigate.

**Calculated Risk or Misguided Bet?**

Aurora presents a compelling vision with its Aurora Horizon project, aiming to capitalize on the transformative potential of autonomous trucking. However, the journey is fraught with financial, technological, and regulatory challenges. The company's ability to manage its burn rate, successfully commercialize its technology, and navigate the complex industry landscape will be critical determinants of its success. For investors, Aurora represents a high-risk, high-reward proposition, demanding close monitoring of their progress, market developments, and strategic execution.

"I just saw AI and I didn't think twice. I bought SoundHound. There is not much I can lose. Besides, I really think that the market for conversational AI will be huge in 5 years. 

The issue of the company is that their revenue relies on a few big contracts at the moment, its revenue depends also on royalties received. Furthermore, the cashflow doesn't look great and they could dilute shares. One could add that there are competitors like Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, but if a company does't want to deal with a big and powerful contractor like them, it can opt for SoundHound and use their (imo) excellent products for conversational AI. 

However, their AI is has been improved a lot over years (it can now recognize more accents and it is much more rapid) and this is, in fact, a mini bet that their market  will expand rapidly in the next year. 
Cool things I saw for the restaurants is that AI is taking orders in an accurate way, it can be used to answer calls in a Saturday night when the line is busy so that the employee can concentrate its time on doing other stuff like a better pizza, and it can be used to help employees in preparing food. 
For the automotive sector AI can be used to get information while driving, like a restaurant location or wheather, or you can ask it to play music and so on. They can monetize this process by giving preferential information, like advising a specific restaurant. 
For the healthcare sector I don't know to much. I can imagine that the market for this will be huge because AI can help patients and also personal.

The fact that they already have big partnerships like with Hyundai, Samsung or White Castle doesn't mean much because if people won't interact with their AI in the future, the contract won't be resigned. Seems that the company already had some contract with Netflix and other companies but I don't think they are still valid. I hope that the company will be well-managed because I see a huge potential in it. I also hope that people will welcome the AI and that they won't find it useless.

"Here is a little belated Xmas gift to you all. There are enough threads posted already about the JBLU / SAVE buy out, so I will refrain from rehashing. The point of this thread is to tell you to load up and load up quick on as many shares as you can get your hands on. This is going to be approved and it’s going to be approved sooner than most think. Here’s why:

Merrick Garlan’s DOJ has lost of their last 9 M&amp;A cases that made it to court. This is going to make it 10. 

Senior judges, such as Judge William Young, typically handle only about 15 percent of the federal courts' workload annually. This means he doesn’t have much else on his plate to mull over. 

On Dec 19th, Judge Young, acting as a visiting judge for the Western District of North Carolina in the Strickland case he is presiding over, said from his Boston courtroom that closing arguments will take place on Jan 4th. 

This was set for 16 days post-trial, after a trial that spanned only 8 calendar days. This is opposed to the JBLU trial, a trial that lasted 35 calendar days, where closing arguments were set for 6 days post-trial. This is because he wants to go into closing arguments on the Strickland case with a fresh mind, not having to deliberate two cases at once.

Lastly, Judge Young is a no nonsense no BS type of guy. He said early on he felt obligated to make a ruling by the end of the year. He wants to stick by his word and will give a ruling by the end of the year, hence the delay in Strickland’s closing arguments. He will make a decision by Jan 3rd, but my best guess is the ruling goes public Friday.

"Hey fellow degenerates! 🚀🦍

PayPal (PYPL) is the diamond in the rough, and it's time to ride this rocket to the moon! 🌕✨

**📊 The Setup:** PYPL, the OG fintech giant, has been beaten down like a piñata at a birthday party, dropping 70% from its all-time highs. 🤯 But guess what? It's rebound o'clock, baby! And why now, you ask? Two words: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)!

**🛍️ BNPL Christmas Surge:** With the holiday season upon us, people are swiping that plastic like there's no tomorrow. Affirm (AFRM) is already making moves, and PYPL is leading the BNPL charge, dominating the market according to the latest surveys. 🚀🎄 Imagine all those sweet transactions flowing into our tendie basket!

**💼 New CEO &amp; Small Biz Focus:** PYPL got a new sheriff in town – Alex Chriss. This guy is like the Elon Musk of fintech (without the tweets). He's building an all-star team, poaching talent from Intuit, Walmart, and Amex. The focus? Small businesses, baby! Say adios to Square (SQ), because PYPL's got its eyes set on that small biz throne.

**🤑 The Potential Squeeze:** Currently down 70% from ATH, this bad boy is prime for a squeeze. Remember when it hit $180? We're not promising tendies, but we're saying the potential is there, and potential is what we live for!

**🚀 Why PYPL? Why Now?**

* **BNPL Surge:** It's a BNPL Christmas, and PYPL is at the forefront.
* **New CEO Magic:** Alex Chriss is cooking up some magic for PYPL’s comeback.
* **Small Biz Showdown:** PYPL is ready to go toe-to-toe with Square for small biz dominance.
* **70% Discount:** It's on sale, fam! The clearance aisle doesn't get better than this.

🚀 **Position:** I've attached a screenshot of my $100K YOLO on PYPL at $62. 🚀🚀🚀

**TL;DR:** PayPal (PYPL) is the comeback kid, riding the BNPL wave, with a new CEO ready to kick butt. It's currently on a discount, and the potential for a squeeze is there. 🌊🌕

"Welcome fellow regards, today I bring to you my highly regarded prediction/opinion. I believe we are currently reliving the 1920s and are doomed for the great depression in the next decade, let me explain why

**1. Economic Growth: Unprecedented Booms and Ominous Shadows**

- **1920s:** Known as the Roaring Twenties, the decade was marked by robust post-war optimism, rapid industrial growth, and technological innovation, leading to significant wealth creation. The GDP soared, consumer culture blossomed, and the stock market became a national pastime. However, this unchecked exuberance, coupled with speculative investments and widespread use of margin buying, set the stage for the 1929 crash. The period was characterized by notable economic disparity, with the rich getting exponentially richer, while the working class saw minimal gains.
  
- **2020s:** Emerging from the global crisis of a pandemic, the 2020s have seen a strong market rebound, driven by technological advancements in digital infrastructure, healthcare, and green energy. Stimmy packages and government spending have injected liquidity into the economy, attempting to stave off recessionary pressures. However, this has also led to concerns about inflationary pressures, asset bubbles in various sectors, especially real estate and tech, and the long-term implications of increased national debt. The wealth gap continues to be a significant issue, with the pandemic exacerbating economic inequalities.

**2. Technological Transformations and Their Economic Impacts**

- **1920s:** The decade witnessed the widespread adoption of automobiles, radio, and cinema. These technologies revolutionized daily life and economic structures, contributing to massive industrial growth and urbanization. This era also saw the birth of consumer credit, allowing more people to purchase these new technologies, further fueling economic growth. However, the rapid industrialization and lack of regulatory oversight eventually led to overproduction and unsustainable economic practices.
  
- **2020s:** This decade is marked by the rise of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, renewable energy, and a continued boom in digital commerce. The technology sector has become a significant part of the economy, with companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google dominating market capitalization charts. However, this rapid growth has led to concerns about overvaluation, particularly as the pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital solutions. Additionally, issues like data privacy, cybersecurity, and the ethical implications of AI are becoming increasingly prominent, posing new regulatory and economic challenges.

**3. Consumer Behavior: From Enthusiasm to Caution**

- **1920s:** The era saw a significant shift in consumer behavior with the advent of mass production and advertising. The availability of credit made it easier for consumers to purchase goods, leading to an increase in consumer debt. The stock market became a symbol of the American Dream, with many individuals investing their life savings, often leveraged, in the hopes of striking it rich.
  
- **2020s:** Consumer behavior has seen a shift towards digital platforms, with e-commerce and online services becoming the norm, accelerated by the pandemic's restrictions. There's been a noticeable increase in retail trading, partly fueled by the democratization of financial markets through technology, but also as a result of stimulus checks and increased savings during lockdown periods. This period has also seen a rise in ""meme stocks"" driven by social media, reflecting a new era of speculative investment and community-driven market movements.

**4. Wealth Disparity: A Persistent Echo**

- **1920s:** The decade was marked by a significant wealth gap. The prosperity of the era was not evenly distributed, with a majority of the wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. This economic disparity was one of the underlying issues that led to the market crash and subsequent Great Depression.
  
- **2020s:** Despite technological advancements and economic growth, income and wealth inequality remain pressing issues. The pandemic has disproportionately affected lower-income individuals and small businesses, while many in the tech and finance sectors have seen substantial gains. The growing disconnect between stock market performance and the real economy is causing concern about the sustainability of current economic policies and the potential for social unrest.

**5. Government Response: Lessons Learned or Repeated?**

- **1920s:** The initial government response to economic issues was minimal, reflecting the era's laissez-faire attitude. However, following the stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression, there was a significant shift towards more active government intervention in the economy under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
  
- **2020s:** Governments worldwide have taken a more proactive approach to managing economic crises, with significant stimulus measures and monetary policy interventions aimed at stabilizing and stimulating the economy. Central banks have implemented policies like quantitative easing and low interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment. However, these policies have also led to concerns about their long-term effects, including potential asset bubbles and increased national debt.

**Conclusion:**

Insane debt, wild inequality, and shaky economic fixes? Sounds like a recipe for a historic faceplant. So, party on, but remember, every rocket eventually comes back down.

"I've been tracking insider trades daily over the last month and noticing some interesting things. There is a lot of insider buying especially around healthcare / biopharma stock and returns have been abnormal.

Here are some examples I'm seeing:

**$ERAS ERASCA** \- Cancer stock - Jonathan Lim made big purchase December 5 at $1.70, now stock is up to $2.15 up 20%.

**$LQDA Liquida** \- Biopharma - 3 insider buys on Dec 14 at $7.16. This was a part of a public offering. However, stock is now $12.19, up over 60%.

**$CATX Perspective Therapeutics** \- Medical Device - Lots of insider buying from in December between $0.27-$0.33. Stock is now $0.47, up 30-60%.

[Source for all these trades](https://app.stockocean.com/latest-purchases-100k)

Obviously the market has gone up over the last month, but these are outsized returns. Some of the companies have announced material news including [$LQDA Court Victory](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/liquidia-court-victory-the-awakening-of-an-industry-giant/), and some have near time catalysts including [$ERAS with multiple Q1 2024 milestones](https://x.com/steve2bacon/status/1739859963730628947?s=20).

The fuck is going on over at Wheels Up? They’re a private jet service like turo for rich people, partnered with delta, have a market cap bigger than SkyWest as of sometime today, they lose $50 million dollars a year and have no real catalyst for changing that. 

Yet, in one week, they’re up almost 200%. 40% today alone.

" I am in the biotech industry and keep a pulse on the Private-S/MID-Mega cap biotech and pharma space. There is a very compelling thesis to buy into either Altimmune ($ALT) or Viking Therapeutics ($VKTX) right now.

TLDR: Americans will continue to get fat and want to buy medicines to get skinny. Regards should buy $ALT or $VKTX to the moon. 🚀

​

**#1:** The obesity market, specifically the GLP-1/GCGR or triple peptide agonists, is blowing up as the greatest blockbuster product. **Ever**. This could be the first pharma market to breach $100bn and maybe stretch to $1T in another decade for a single drug mechanism. On the flip side, only Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have approved products right now and are racing ahead. Merck and Amgen got into the game, but they are late and slow. Pfizer thought it was in the game, then their oral drug got stomped by adverse events in a Phase 2. Lilly has an oral small molecule too that is probably going to have the same issue. Roche wasn't in the game, FOMOed, and bought Carmot last month for $2.3B. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#2:** Pharma is flush with cash and the Inflation Reduction Act made it unprofitable to invest in therapies for people on Medicare. So cancer is out, obesity is in. Fortunately, even young people love Wendys.

&amp;#x200B;

**#3:** The annual JPM conference starts on January 6th. Many of the biggest deals for the year start there. We can expect a number of announcements soon after this conference, but I'm expecting that one of Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, GSK, BI, Amgen or Gilead announce that they will be acquiring either Altimmune or Viking so they can compete in the obesity/NASH space.

​

**#4:** Altimmune I like especially. Their Phase 2 data is on par with others, and the adverse event profile was good. The cardiovascular benefits were also unique in the space, perhaps because it is a dual GLP-1/GCGR agonist. Viking is an interesting angle as they have a thyroid pipeline that may be an adjunct to therapy that has other benefits.

Positions: 500 shares of $Alt, acquiring more daily because I think they are the more likely target. 200 shares of VKTX to diversify and cover the last remaining small cap GLP-1 company in Phase 1/2.",Altimmune and Viking are the last two companies left for Pharma to FOMO into the Obesity market,18s92jr,1703705751.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18s92jr/altimmune_and_viking_are_the_last_two_companies/,

Maybe it’s random, as you pick stocks, every now and then you get a free pick of equal value   $$

Possibly it’s more like a punch card. Every 10th company you hold that files Chapter 11, you get a free one ! Bonus !!

January 19th $420 strike for $META has 40k open interest 949 volume.

Price is $12 a pop so I bought 50. 

Why it might go up.

* High open interest may mean that insiders know something, and the company could have news coming out (but why such a yolo number?!)
* End of the year has a bit of tax harvesting and the January affect may cause stocks to start rising again at the start of the year (happened in 2023)
* Option expiration January 19th may cause rise if people roll their protective puts (happened in 2023.)
* Earnings at the end of the month may set up a floor.
* Interest rate cuts may cause money to flow back into stocks, high beta large cap seeming the most lucrative. 

Why it might go down

* already ran up 11% last month prior to earnings, could consolidate more.
* lower VR sales than previous year. 
* People worried about recession 
* Bank Term Funding Program ending may collapse economy

"Let’s be real, if you’re here you are probably poor. Not just poor, like sucking dick behind Wendy’s for some FDs. Life is terrible. You work 8 hours a day, you have no friends or family, and you’re dumb as bricks. 

To you, and those around you and online, it seems like the world is failing you. You’ll never own a home, you’ll never retire, and even your car payment and student loans are enough to cripple any hope of having savings. After all, that’s why you gamble on the very system that keeps you perma-broke. 

You and your woke ass Instagram high school classmates (aka Wendy’s coworkers) continually post to your feed statistics of generation wealth inequality, the destruction of the middle class, and whatever else helps you rationalize being a lazy and depressed piece of shit. It’s not you, it’s the system that’s broken!

After a while you might start to think about how this can keep happening. How can so many people be okay with being broke? Well the reality is, it’s probably less than you think. Or at least enough of the poors are too dumb to know any better. 

The reality is, the next golden generation is here and thriving. The baby boomers were known for having the easiest path to retirement in history, but damn gen X is making it look easy too.

Think about it. These losers have essentially no life, high paying jobs, mortgages with all time low interest rates, 401k’s that have rallied harder than Jesus on the third day, and a severe lack of personality or passion, which results in a lust to just be richer than their friends. 

We have a hoard of near retirees who work, spend money, and eat unseasoned chicken with roasted potatoes their whole life. A whole generation of buffets balls deep in the markets, who have rightfully been rewarded for their patience. The kicker is, these idiots won’t even retire as they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves if they did. 

These people are the consumers keeping things afloat, and they aren’t going anywhere. As long as these people are buying new cars every 3 years, going out to eat 5 times a week, going on 2 vacations a year, and buying all the new tech in the world for their 20 something year old degenerate kids, things are going to be just fine. so stop waiting around for a crash that you only think will happen because your poor.

"Disappointed you missed the 2023 Lilly fantastic run this from around 365 to a high of year around 620 (+255) due to their weight loss drug Tirzepatide positive trials and subsequent approval?

Gather round and listen to a tale of the next Blockbuster Pharma---Vertex. You know what is as big as weight loss? **PAIN**.

**Pain, VX-548, and Breakthrough Designation:** Pain is a multi-billion dollar industry and there have been no pain alternatives for decades. The race for a Non-Addictive Opioid Alternative is akin to the search for the Holy Grail. Vertex has developed a selective NaV1.8 inhibitor pain drug VX-548. It is being trialed for moderate to severe acute pain and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (different indications/different trials). The FDA granted Vertex Breakthrough Therapy Designation for their Pain drug VX-548 (a Non-addictive Opioid Alternative) based on clinical evidence from the Phase 2 studies demonstrating the potential to treat moderate to severe acute pain. Vertex is concluding Phase 3 VX-548 moderate to severe pain studies this month.

**Opiod Problem:** The opioid epidemic [continues to ravage](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-look-at-changes-in-opioid-prescribing-patterns-in-medicaid-from-2016-to-2019/#:~:text=Opioid%20prescriptions%20declined%20overall%20from,an%20increase%20in%20buprenorphine%20prescriptions.) the U.S., with [50,000 people dying each year](https://drugabusestatistics.org/opioid-epidemic/) from overdose, and [10 million](https://drugabusestatistics.org/opioid-epidemic/) abusing the highly addictive medications annually. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [officially declared](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/statistics/index.html#:~:text=In%202017%20HHS%20declared%20the,to%20combat%20the%20opioid%20crisis.) opioid abuse a public health emergency in 2017, but until there is a safe and effective alternative to opioids, acute and chronic pain present a [silent scourge](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804995) of their own. “There is an immense unmet need for new pain medications, even without the opioid epidemic,” Stephen Waxman, a [Yale neuroscientist](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/stephen-waxman/) who penned [another editorial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2305708?query=recirc_curatedRelated_article) accompanying the recent NEJM study, told BioSpace. (Reference: [https://www.biospace.com/article/promising-vertex-pain-med-points-to-new-era-for-analgesics/](https://www.biospace.com/article/promising-vertex-pain-med-points-to-new-era-for-analgesics/))

**Detail on VX-548 Phase 3 Pain Trials:** The Phase 3 program has two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to assess the safety and efficacy of VX-548 for moderate to severe acute pain treatment after bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. These trials also have a hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen treatment arm. A third, single-arm trial assesses the safety of VX-548 across various other moderate to severe acute pain types for up to 14 days.

**Major Catalyst Coming:** Phase 3 trials for VX-548 conclude this month with readout in Q1 FY24 (January to March timeframe). Successful P3 trials will be a huge forward catalyst leading to the company moving towards drug approval.

**What has the stock been doing:** In addition to moderate to severe pain trials, Vertex just concluded and provided a read-out from a positive P2 on VX-548 for diabetic peripheral neuropathy which caused the stock to increase from around 360 (day before announcement) to around 409 **(+49)** as of today where it is holding steady. Notably-it has been holding steady in the lower 400s since the day of the P2 Announcement.

**Various Articles about potential of VX-548:**

Barrons: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/vertex-pain-pill-non-opioid-573cae68](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vertex-pain-pill-non-opioid-573cae68)

· A nonaddictive pain pill that works as well as an opioid, with none of the same addiction risk and side effects, would be an instant blockbuster. Drug companies have met with repeated failures in their efforts to develop one, but [Vertex Pharmaceuticals](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/vrtx?mod=article_chiclet) (ticker: VRTX) could be close to a breakthrough.

· If the trials are successful, sales of VX-548 could hit $5.1 billion a year by 2030, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. That would be transformative for Vertex, which currently sells treatments for cystic fibrosis and records annual sales of under $10 billion.

· In a note out in early October, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter wrote that if VX-548 appears to work as well as an opioid in the Phase 3 trials focused on acute pain, Vertex shares, recently $362, would be **worth an additional $58 each**. If the drug works even better than opioids, she writes that it would be **worth an additional $88 per share**. In a best-case scenario—if the chronic-pain study is also positive—Richter estimates that the stock would be **worth an additional $119 per share**. Richter is less concerned about the downside risk if the trials fail. She says the market currently isn’t giving Vertex much credit for its pain program, and that the company’s cystic fibrosis franchise alone is worth $326 per share. Leerink’s Risinger is similarly undeterred by the risk. “It’s possible the stock could be down close to 20%” if all the trials fail, he says. “But the upside, if there’s success in those three trials, is quite significant.”

**Other reasons to buy from Motley Fool**: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/12/27/3-reasons-to-buy-vertex-pharmaceuticals-stock-like/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/12/27/3-reasons-to-buy-vertex-pharmaceuticals-stock-like/)

· Rock Solid Revenue Base

· Groundbreaking Gene Therapy just got Approved. Note the Approval for Sickle Cell just happened with CRSP and approval for BT has a PDUFA date of March 30. This could be another large catalyst sending the stock forward.

· Plenty of Cash

**Positions:** This is an expensive stock, so you might have to borrow from your wife’s boyfriend.  **Shares** are the easiest way to get into the stock but for leverage and significant returns the **April 19 450Cs** are tasty if you want safety of the full Q1 (Jan to March timeframe). If you think the readout could come quicker than you could try your luck with an earlier date such as Feb 16. Alternatively, if you think P3 is going to be a bust the April 19 350P will suit you well. Either way my personal theory is we are in for a move of 50+ either way (positive or negative). I’m for the positive side and think P3 will be successful. Lastly, a few things to remember that can also pump the stock-the CEO is speaking at the JP Morgan Conference on Jan 8th and we have a Gene Therapy approval for BT could come in Q1 as well. Good luck to you all.

"ARM is setup for success, hear me out. ARM Powers billions of devices and will power more. Why? Compute power per watt and cost.

* ARM runs on your Television
* ARM runs on smart watches
* GPU's that need compute and cuda core busing runs on ARM
* Microsoft runs on ARM
* Google runs on ARM
* AWS Graviton runs on ARM

ARM is the silicon designer for anyone who wants a custom designed chip for their hardware use case.

Forget everything you knew about ARM pricing and EPS based on historical records. The new new pricing royalties and actual collection of profits from new and innovative design will come into their revenues.

They don't make hardware, instead they will design and get a cut from almost every device you can think of.

The AI boom stands to benefit them in new ways as AI devices that will require low power and less/no heat to run will be a vital aspect of all devices coming into the future.

Yes Intell is a competitor but like most intel products that have come out they are slow to move and come out with inferior products. Look at their GPU lineup (why did they even do anything if you were going to do something so benign).

RISCV is a competitor that is arguing open source but let's get real here. They are requiring royalties too and the IP now stands with ARM and will increasingly stand with ARM.

Is ARM a trillion dollar company in 10 years? I say yes, easily. Mark my words.

They will continue delivering custom chips more and more and more and they will be mostly, if not all, through the ARM and TPU chipset designs.

The future is bright for ARM. Get in on the ground floor now.

What makes ARM so amazing? Compute power per watt and heat transfer. It's why your new Macbooks don't have full blowing old school fans that are running to cool down your pc every 2 minutes. The fan is not even directly on the chip die. Microsoft will soon release all of their Surface lineup on ARM going forward. Mark my words. They have to compete with Apple and Apple is ahead on this. Increasingly, all of Azure data centers will increasingly run on ARM because it's cheaper and more cost effective.

It's compute that is specific for the actual use case. Not the x86 legacy use case of trying to run on and do everything. It's(x86) is not power efficient and power efficiency is ultra important to hardware processes rather than trying to have a chip that does everything but only needs to do 1 or 2 things.

ARM specializes in designing microprocessors, SoC (System on Chip) solutions, and related technologies. They develop the architecture and designs for various types of processors, including those used in smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers and desktops.

&gt;  
&gt;t2.micro – x64 based, 1 vCPU, 1Gb memory, $0.0116 per hour  
&gt;  
&gt;Its worth noting that my ARM instance is costing me 20% less than the t3.micro.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can see from this that our ARM instance is performing much better under this level of load. We can say that:  
&gt;  
&gt;Its successfully completed 60% more requests than the nearest x64 instance  
&gt;  
&gt;It has a roughly 12% improvement on average response time  
&gt;  
&gt;And it is doing this at 80% of the cost of the x64 instance  
&gt;  
&gt;With our Mandelbrot test its clear that the ARM instance has a consistent advantage both in performance and cost.

Position - 500+ Shares - I want to build that to 1000. Haters will say no way. But you will reap the rewards in 10 years and come back to this post and thank me with pictures of your new beach house, summer home and pictures of your kids going to college and smiling family members for making you so wealthy.

"Towards the end of the year, I always look for stocks that have been beaten down over the past year. This year I came across the agrochemical company FMC Corporation (performance around -50% in 2023). FMC has a very high debt (almost as high as its sales). Therefore, interest rate cuts could also have an impact on the fundamentals via lower interest expense (although interest expense would increase if FMC's credit rating is downgraded due to its high debt level). Sales peaked in 2022, presumably as customers stocked up, so the business and company outlook in 2023 was rather poor. Insiders last bought (albeit cautiously) in September and November. El Niño and climate change could negatively impact crop yields in 2024 - the world will always need pesticides... What do you think of FMC?

"Your loss is your gain. Whatever position you’ve taken this year that is currently at a loss, sell it. 
12/29 is the last day of the year for the stock market. All capital gains you’ve made you will have to pay taxes on them, unless you sell whatever positions are lower than your entry point in which you’ll be able to subtract those losses from your gain. If you still believe in the position, then just buy back in January and start over. 

But you have to wait 30 days/a month until buying back in to avoid the wash-sale rule. 

One way around this is to invest in a similar security. Say you sell SPY and you have a good feeling about the S&amp;P as a whole, buy IVV or VOO before the 30 days. Or maybe you sell MARA and you feel the BTC mining market is promising within the first month of you selling it, buy another BTC mining firm that looks to gain. Otherwise, just wait 30 days. 

Also, you can only offset $3000 a year. If you have losses over $3k, you can use them in future years. 

This doesn’t work for things like IRAs that have special tax incentives.

Just my two cents to anyone looking to save a few bucks on taxes.


Curious what everyone is going to harvest their losses from. For me it’s now just AZ and OPRA. 

Also, curious what everyone’s biggest FOMO of the last Quarter/Q4 is? Mine is AAOI.

Coinbase is up 454% YTD with revenue of $623M, net income -$2.3M with a valuation of $44.5B. Now what is driving this news is a few things: Bitcoin price going up, dismissal of lawsuit against them, hopes around approval of Bitcoin etf and optimism around that space.

Now with full transparency, I am a crypto bear. I don't think it really does anything. It is very useful for transactions which involve crime (hello dark web) but for normal people it does nothing - but people will be either for/against and I'm not going to argue that here... though I see the comments coming in already...

Now the good thing is that this thesis doesn't rely on crypto winning or losing - I have a bear case for this company in any scenario

1. Bitcoin goes to moon with halving, blackrock and fidelity ETFs come on board, Coinbase gets fucked as competitors begin to offer access to crypto with much larger institutional money and better products at lower cost. Coinbase can't compete on margins, can't compete with larger established institutions which sell to their own customers, gets squeezed out by the big financial guys
2. Tether collapses, bitcoin sinks, SEC cracks down, legislative headwinds increase. Crypto is headed into deeper winter and Coinbase is a market selling something nobody wants. Trading volumes drop further and stock sinks like a rock
3. The current situation continues - Coinbase is losing money. The valuation comes back to earth. They cut costs and become a modestly profitable business

454% YTD run up with flat revenues? Gotta come back down to earth. P/E is &gt;100 if you take revenue as PROFIT. Even a pretty neutral outlook on this stock would see it as overvalued. There is no upside for this company.

"Intro:

The Caps are small, but the gains are not. No Cap.

I have been thinking of writing up a case for small caps for a few of weeks now. One of my last notes from my TLT post called out my expectations for small caps leading into 2024. Thoughts on small caps into EOY from Dec 12th. Since that time TNA has rocketed up 28%. Sadly my covered calls from the shares I purchased at $28.75 have long been called away at $33. I was not prepared for such a rapid move up after the last FOMC meeting and Powell’s (FOMC Chair) dovish rhetoric. As of this writing, TNA is trading at $41.29. That being said, with a little help from the macro environment, this still has room to move higher. Let’s dig in.

Backdrop and Set-up:

As the Fed hiked interest rates, small caps languished while the venture capital to support these companies dried up and as loans grew scarce with higher interest rates. Now that we seem to be escaping this restrictive environment we should begin to see a run on small caps. Let’s can start by looking into the set up here. There are a few things I really like, and I will use TNA’s big brother IWM (Russell 2000 small cap index), to distill my views. First I want to look at some trade volume data, as of today:


Most of these circles represent trades that are greater than 99% of all trades ever made on IWM. There are a few trades, given where we were historically, that stick out to me, and that I think were buys. The number 8 and 16th largest trades ever were placed around $180 at the end of November, just ahead of the Fed decision and CPI data in December. Around that time we had already seen softer data in both the jobs market and on the inflation front. I detail all of this here in, The Case for TLT. A smart trader placed an educated bet ahead of these events. I can only say this with some certainty, but they are such large trades, it would seem logical that they were bullish given the circumstances around that time. Either way, nobody expected Jpow to go full, “when doves cry” on FOMC day. So they were lucky if it was a buy.

That is where we stand today. Big trades are being made and the macro headwinds are letting up. Let us look at some pictures!

Charting / Crayons / Astrology for Stocks:

This is what I find very interesting, if you’re into the witch craft of charting. IWM is sitting at some very important techincal levels. lets look at the 10yr timeframe.


Two things here, small caps are breaking out from a long held range between $160-200 and we are breaking above a very long term mid-trend line, in red. If we can hold $200, I think this pushes higher, but a retest of the mid 190s is also not out of the question. This wouldn’t shock me short term, but I am thinking for the full year 2024 here, so a pull back after this run doesn’t concern me.

One other thing I would like to point out is where the small cap index stands relative to its all time highs (ATH). If we do get into a friendlier rate environment, I don’t see why we can’t retest those highs, after all, its peers, QQQ and SPY are both testing or at their ATH right now! Seen below.



By that measure the Russell 2000 has another 16% of room left to run - which is 48% for TNA as its 3x leveraged. And it’s coming out of a cold cold winter.

One other thing I want to show here are the moving averages:


Red = 200SMA, Yellow = 50SMA, and Green = 20SMA (simple moving average).

We are on the verge of a golden cross (50MA crossing over 200MA). Given the other factors, this looks like it will break higher. These MAs and the 20MA should be supports also, therefore we have several supports from $200-180. The downside risk here isn’t that bad. Unless somehting changes on the macro level, we wont sniff $180. But let’s discuss those risks anyway.

Potential Downside (risks):

Starting off with the glaring divergence in expectations vs. what the Fed is saying, in relation to the rate cut expectations for 2024. As we stand, the Fed is leaning towards 3 cuts in 2024 according to their FOMC economic projects, seen below, around 4.65 mid:


However! The market, in its infinite wisdom, is pricing in up to 7, count em, 7 cuts. Sorry for the sloppy highlight job. 5.25 to 3.50.


This presents a pretty harsh reality for small caps if we don’t get those expected cuts, even worse if we get less, or lord forbid…..a hike.

Going hand in hand with this are concerns over, war, inflation, deflation, slowing economic growth and so on. You can come up with any number of problems for this trade, but this is true of all trades. It’s just good to be aware of the potential pitfalls so that you’re on the lookout for a turn in any one of these. This allows you to monitor your perspective and adjust accordingly.

Conclusion:

Given what we know, not what may be, I am looking to open a TNA position again. I’d prefer a pullback under $200 on IWM and to get TNA in the mid 30s. En lieu of that, I will write a cash secured put or a put credit spread somewhere in the $30s. This is a trade that will need heavy monitoring of economic conditions and what rates are up too. It’s probably also good to look at other small cap ETFs in individual sectors, to see how they are doing. One of the most beat down was Bio in 2022-23, so something like LABU can possibly give an early warning, as it will be the first to sour.

Everything from mortgages to car payments, has been higher this year. While this is already going back down, the damage has already been done, and the consequences will take time to unfold, but will hit sooner or later.

&amp;#x200B;

For the average company, the cost of borrowing has also been higher.

Again, the consequences are gonna be felt, it's a matter of when. And we probably haven't seen the full effect yet. This could start to get felt more in future quarterly results.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Low Unemployment not being as rosy**

Unemployment has remained low, which may seem like a good thing.

But it has only been a temporary boost, as it hasn't actually come with wages keeping up with inflation, so it's unlikely a long term boost.

On top of that, the numbers look better on paper than in reality, since a lot of the employment is partial and gig jobs.

It doesn't help the overall economy when people with higher housing costs, higher grocery bills, are only working part time for Uber.

&amp;#x200B;

**-But surely, rate cuts will make everything alright in 2024, right?**

It could. 

But it could potentially make the problem worse, and make the stock market even more divorced from reality for a while...and could create ripe conditions for a very large correction later down the line.

Rate cuts will take a while before the effect really trickle down into the economy. And we're talking about economic problems that have a long way to catch up.

Remember, a lot of the Fed rate hikes, higher borrowing cost, bond yields, inflated housing prices from Covid supply chains, etc... are things that will have a delayed fuse, and can take a while before we feel the full consequences.

We haven't even had the full effect on unemployment yet.

Markets could continue to kick the can down the road, but you can only do it so often, and it gets harder with so many heavily weighing consequences that have been piling up.","We may have a stock rally and some good economic numbers, but they all came with underlying costs that are not sustainable.",18t272z,1703791532.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18t272z/we_may_have_a_stock_rally_and_some_good_economic/,

Bullish on NIO for a few reasons.

1. Bullish Indicators - NIO has just crossed the 200-day Moving Average. From a technical analysis POV this shows that investors are bullish on the stock and is a strong indicator of the stock pushing higher. Given that it has already passed the 20, and 50 day MA's, this is a strong indicactor that the stock will continue to rise over the following weeks.

2. Market Stability - Biden is threatening to raise the tariffs in place on Chinese EV's. Why is this a good thing? It's because this is in direct response to Xi telling him that China would take Taiwan. On the 20th it's reported that Xi told Biden that reunification was going to happen ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/xi-warns-biden-china-plans-back-taiwan/story?id=105815520](https://abcnews.go.com/International/xi-warns-biden-china-plans-back-taiwan/story?id=105815520)). The next day on the 21st Biden's administration says they are weighing on increasing tarriffs on Chinese EV's ([https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/biden-administration-explores-raising-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-e439d87d](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/biden-administration-explores-raising-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-e439d87d)). In other words, Biden is trying to dissuade China from starting a war that would not only crash the entire market (save for Raytheon), but cause the US to implement trade embargos, that all of it's allies would have to sign on to. Therefore, Nio should have long-term stability in it's plan to expand out of China and into Europe, it's next target market. Even so, if Tarrifs are added, the US is not Nio's market given their conservative policies around climate change - see 6 (Environmental Policy Edge)
3. NIO's Strategy - similiar to Tesla, they are a tech-heavy company burning a lot of cash to build next-generation AI into their products. This is reflected in how they also have focused on building premium vehicles first with a high price, before pivoting to build cheaper more affordable vehicles. They just announced a rival to the Porsche the new ET7 Sedan, which they will use to offset their R&amp;D, before beginning manufacturing on their more affordable FireFly model in 2025. What's exciting is the battery in this has a range of up to 1,000KM - almost 200KM more than the Tesla S LR. To add on, NIO produced 100K cars in half the time it took Tesla to (6 years versus 12).

4. Scalability - the main issue with the company has been that they are not producing enough cars compared to their competitors like BYD and Li. The issue is again their over-investment in tech over producing cars at scale. In the short-run that isn't great, especially if they get crushed out of the market. However, if they can maintain their size and continued growth, they will be able to surpass their competitors given how far along their technology is. Given that they have just received 2.2 Billion USD and are now sitting on 7 Billion in cash, I think their next moves will be continuing to buy factories for production so they can sell more cars over the next few years.

5. Battery Technology &amp; Infrastructure - they are the largest swappable battery company, which with rising environmental and sustainability concerns, make their IPs exceeding valuable in the coming years. The cost of replacing a Tesla battery can cost up to 20K whereas the Nio battery can be easily swapped for half the price for up to 10k. In addition with them having built over 2000 battery swapping stations, 3000 charging stations and it only taking 10 minutes to charge 100km (or a 3 min battery swap boasting 250km charge in their new Sedan), their tech is so far ahead of their competitors that they will be the iPhone to the BlackBerry once they have scale.

6. Environmental Policy Edge - with China electing to go all electric by 2030, producing for the Chinese economy over American is far more profitable over the next decade. Demand for electric is expected to 10x once 2030 hits. This will give them huge scalability compared to European manufacturers, where gas powered vehicles will be banned by 2035. In the US only 9 states have made the move to ban them by 2035, meaning Chinese EV's will have the superior advantage in market share and manufacturing by then.

Doubts:

\- They have to invest in more production at this point. In scalability, I said their next moves ""will be"" continuing to buy more factories. That's an assumption I'm making as it's the next logicial step. Their R&amp;D is so far ahead of their peers they have to scale up with the cash they have on hand. I’m not too worried on market saturation as the Chinese EV market is only projected to reach 8 million vehicles by 2028 ([https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/china](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/china))

\- Chinese Subsidies could at any point be removed, and that would greatly hamper NIO's expansion if Xi decided to do so (although I don't think he would). Chinese companies really are at the autonomy of the government so there is always a risk here

\- High inflation could both eat at their cash supply while also stunting their luxury cars sales, resulting in them failing to sell and break even on R&amp;D and losing even more cash in the process. Even though China claims they have had negative inflation at -0.5%, I'd be weary at that figure ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/china\_inflation\_rate#:\~:text=China%20Inflation%20Rate%20is%20at,long%20term%20average%20of%201.80%25](https://ycharts.com/indicators/china_inflation_rate#:~:text=China%20Inflation%20Rate%20is%20at,long%20term%20average%20of%201.80%25).) given their history of under/over reporting their economy

\- Continued price wars with Tesla - this has hurt NIO in the past but given the current market, I doubt will be a problem as Tesla has been hurting and even seeing reduced sales in the midst of the price war ([https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-price-cuts-electric-cars-losing-business-strategy-2023-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-price-cuts-electric-cars-losing-business-strategy-2023-11))

In conclusion, I think that NIO has both technical indicators as well as economic and market-based factors that will contribute to propel the stock up over the next decade. This next year will be crucial with Neo's expansion and strategic moves, but I'll be on the look-out in the short-run to see whether they are producing more cars or stagnating after their cash injection.

Then in 2022, he decided to buy out Twitter which hurt investors quite a bit. Dude even said fuk off to Bob Iger. Started beef with Apple, Bill Gates, and JP Morgan. He said if the result of free speech is losing money then be it.

This dude doesn't give an F about investors for reasons listed above.

Now, today, he changed his tone. He said ""if Tesla executes extremely well over the next 5 years, the long-term value could exceed Apple and Aramco combined"". Sound like he begging people to buy Tesla now. Why tf did he suddenly make these bullish comments about the stocks lmao?

Looking at the price action, Tesla is getting shorted almost every day, and investors are losing interest. But from his statement, it sounds like he wants us to hold the bags for 5 years. But his comments was very precise, which can be hard to sue if that doesn't happen.

But the last time he sound bullish like this, he dumped a bunch of shares of his followers lmao. This dude can't be trusted. I would love to be bullish on Tesla if Elon just stfu, and not making any political comments and get alone with everyone.

"Key Takeaways:

1)	 We have progressed over half (1/2) of the way into the +/-1 Sigma zone, which is equivalent to approximately 5.43 months into the 9.22 month-long recession birthing zone.

2)	 It has been 13 months since the yield curve inverted on November 28, 2022, specifically the 50-day SMA of the 10-year minus 3-month yield curve. Historically, at this point from past inversions, five out of the last eight recessions had already commenced. These five recession onsets took place within the first 5.22 month timeframe of the +/-1 Sigma Zone.

3)	 Currently, there's a 57.06% chance that the next recession has started, and this probability is rapidly growing as time advances.  There is a 72.96% chance that the next recession will start on or before late February 2024.

4)	 There is a very high likelihood of 84% that a recession will start on or before we reach the end of the +/-1 Sigma zone, which will occur around late April 2024.  And there is a 95.51% chance that a recession will start on or before late July 2024.

5)	 Seven of the last eight recessions have started within the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, which we entered back on July 20th, 2023.  The only recession that started outside of this zone did so less than 3 months above this zone.

6)	 As we progress through the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, a secular downturn in the overall U.S economy is extremely likely to manifest itself with rising unemployment rates and deteriorating corporate earnings (among many other economic metrics), which will begin to gain momentum as the negative feedback cycle spirals downwards (once a cycle begins, it tend to perpetuate itself).


Note #1:  Most recessions usually start several months before they are eventually declared. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) typically doesn’t declare recessions until well after they have begun.

Note #2: Recessions are a natural part of the business cycle and create long-term health for the economy by clearing out marginal (zombie) businesses and allowing the reallocation of resources to new upstarts and the expansion of healthy businesses.


Explanation of Top Diagram:

Over the past +50 years, inversions of the 50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the deltas between the 10 year and 3 month daily treasury yield curve rates have all preceded the start of a U.S. recession (there have been no false indicators or exceptions to this rule).  And no recessions have occurred in the absence of these 50 day SMA inversions.  The 8 recessions that occurred over the last half a century have started within an average of 12.18 months from the first day that their 50 day SMA inversions began.


Explanation of Bottom Diagram:

This recession probability distribution illustrates the positions of the last eight recessions over a +50 year period.  These positions are superimposed on the probability curve with each recession's location based on the time from the first day of their corresponding 50 day SMA inversions (10 Yr. minus 3 Mo.) to the beginning of each recession.  The best-fit representation employs a normal distribution with a mean of 12.18 months and a standard deviation of 4.61 months.  The solid red vertical arrow that is pointing upwards represents our current time position on the probability curve, initiated from time zero (the first day of the latest 50-day SMA inversion) and sliding to the right as time elapses.  The prediction indicates a 73% likelihood that a recession will commence on or before late February 2024, with a greater than 95% probability that a recession will start on or before late July 2024.","Critical Recession Update: Crossing the midpoint of the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)",18ve2jh,1704048012.0,https://i.redd.it/ku5cfpjmdo9c1.png,

This is after a different American company, Cleveland-Cliffs (which also deals with steelmaking) offered to purchase US Steel for less than half the amount.

I want to understand from you people, would you have preferred consolidation with another US company? Do you realize that that would mean that they would basically be a monopoly and could control the prices as they wish.

Not only will this cause a significant drop in the valuation long term it will be enormously profitable short term for those granted approval. 

Transactions through the ETF will be cash only and therefore no in-kind redemptions will be allowed. 

So if you sell your actual bitcoins for cash to invest in the ETF the bank is going to take that cash and buy the bitcoins you sold and then charge you a fee for doing it. 

This also creates a new pool of inflows for people that were hesitant to invest in bitcoin until SEC approval which will allow long time holders to continue cashing out at the top.

"Hey fellow stonk enthusiasts, gather 'round for a hot take on the electric rollercoaster that is Tesla. Here's my breakdown of the imminent mayhem that's about to hit the fan:

1. **Twitter(x) Tightrope - Elon's Social Symphony:** Rumour has it that Twitter is wobbling on its financial tightrope, and Elon himself has admitted as much. In the first act of this financial symphony, Elon faces a dilemma: play the hero or watch the show from the wings.
   1. Elon might decide to rescue the sinking Twitter ship. However, the real cliffhanger is how he plans to fund this rescue mission. Selling his TSLA holdings seems like a logical move, but the market might start doing its own rendition of a flash crash as investors rush to mimic his steps. A dance of financial calamity reminiscent of the 2022 disaster could unfold, but this time with Tesla in a more precarious position.
   2. On the flip side, Elon letting Twitter go under could be equally disastrous. It's not just about the financial hit; it's about dispelling the myth of Elon as the 4D chess mastermind. The stock, heavily wrapped in the mystique of Musk's visionary maneuvers, could suffer a Shakespearean tragedy. Besides without his Twitter platform, Elon loses his megaphone to the masses, leaving him vulnerable to the orchestrated dissonance of mainstream media. he'll just be a billionaire shouting into the void – a cosmic injustice.
2. **Growth in Slow-Mo:**  Tesla hits pause on growth projects, akin to a director halting a scene. The plot thickens as the company's once-soaring valuation now teeters on the edge, impacted by a macroeconomic rationale explained in the last earnings call.
3. **FSD/Robotaxi Slow Clap and Elon's ""Soon"" Chronicles:**  FSD has become the ""I'll do it tomorrow"" of the tech world. People aren't dumb; they're just patient... until they're not. When the FSD bubble bursts, it'll be a revelation as sweet as finding out the magician's tricks. And the robotaxi dream? Let's just say it's on a time-out, sipping a cold beverage somewhere in Elon's mind.
4. **Cybertruck Comedy Hour:**  The Cybertruck – because nothing says ""innovation"" like a car designed with a protractor, faces production delays, regulatory headaches, and a price tag that makes you question Elon's math skills. It's the underdog of the electric vehicle race, and not the cool, Rudy-esque underdog – more like the ""why did I bet on this horse"" underdog.

Eddit - forgot about Optimus 

5. Optimus Distraction-Musk's Belated Robo-Show:
In the Tesla circus, behold Optimus, Elon's latest shiny distraction. A new lure to captivate the public's attention a little while longer, reminiscent of the fading charm of Hyperloop, Solar City, and Mars City. Much like its predecessors, Optimus is poised to slowly fade away once its distracting capabilities are depleted.

Anyone entertaining the idea that Tesla can just pop out of nowhere and take over humanoid Robotics should be laughed out of the room, but just to entertain the idea, here are theain reasons this is ludicrous:
 A.They are FAR too late, they will need a minimum of 10 years to just catch up with the current leaders. 
B.  Current battery tech spells trouble for a humanoid robot, offering a mere 10 minutes before it's tethered to a socket. What productivity can be achieved in such a short span?
C. Entertaining the idea that the success of Full Self-Driving (which is highly doubtful anyway) in cars seamlessly transfers to humanoid robots is a fantasy. FSD operates in a simplified 2D environment, following predetermined paths on a map. This is vastly different from the complex 3D interactions and tool handling required for humanoid robots. Even if they manage to get FSD for cars, it will be absolutely useless for robots. Thus, Tesla has no inherent advantage over established players in this field. They will likely end up just another robotics company, assuming they follow through, which, I guarantee you, they will not. In about two years, this venture is likely to be nothing more than a distant memory.


&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Twitter tap-dancing turmoil, Elon's financial ballet might trigger a TSLA nosedive. Growth hits pause due to macroeconomic whispers, while FSD's ""soon"" saga and Cybertruck hurdles add to the stock's cliffhangers. Not to mention supply chain chaos, EV rivals, and regulatory risks join the cast, painting a backdrop of uncertainty.",2024: A Stormy Forecast for Tesla?

Today, XPENG concluded the launch event for their newest vehicle, X9.

[XPENG X9](https://preview.redd.it/1tbvhw857u9c1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1908db72d171a2cf08e53edd2877a062426d4da)

This is a Multi-Purpose-Vehicle with a 3rd row that hides into the floorboard, doubling as a massive Sports-Utility-Vehicle.

It's been very popular online over the past month due to the following features.

* 800V architecture for fast charging
* Rear wheel steering which gives this massive 5.3m vehicle the turning radius of a sedan.
* Best in China self driving technology

The car also comes with a bunch of QOL features like a fridge, 2nd row TV screen and much more.

The biggest selling point is the announced price point of 388k RMB (Ard 50k USD) which was contrasted with the Li Auto Mega which would cost ""no more than 600k RMB"" while offering not much more.

With the following factors, I suspect the new few weeks will bring us some 🚀🚀🚀

* The stock has been selling off the past month from $18 to $14.
* Company has recovered significantly over 2023 in terms of deliverys to 3 record months of 20k delivery each.

* 30k pre-order for X9 announced yesterday before today's launch event (Shd be firm pre-orders but I could be wrong).
* Livestream of launch event today hit 2.5m live viewers.
* Lowest price configuration was reduced from 388k to 359k during the launch event.

TLDR: Beaten down car company's latest product is looking to be a popular high-volume high margin product.

"2023 was the year I realised the power of Reddit. I am really impressed by the quality of knowledge and how helpful people are. Also, compared to other platforms (like FB), I see no hate speech, and respect (self sarcasm is more often). This is an experience I truly felt when I started participating.

Also, I am impressed by the  the sense of a community, and their great knowledge in some AI related discussions (a new passion for me are LLMs). However, the investing and stock market channels, lack people of knowledge, and even if people try to help each other, the advice in Reddit is a recipe for economic disaster. People who know a thing or are experienced investors are really rare, and don't use Reddit.  


My explanation is that Reddit started with **tech** as its main vertical. IT people became wealthy through high wages, and discovered the **stock market** which became the second vertical. Tech is a place that great outcomes can come through smarts, but the stock market needs a different skillset, and it's like theatre or sports (maybe the top 1% is capable to achieve something great). So we have a situation, that helpful and smart people in a great community repeatedly offer disservice to investing.  


How do you think that this can be improved? How can you drag into the platform more experienced and non-tech oriented people, who don't know the magic of reddit, or they disregard it because of the quality of investing content. I have been investing for more than 20 years, heard of reddit a few years ago, but 2023 was the year I got engaged. This would not have happened if I did not develop passion about LLMs and AI.  


Is it right to think that Reddit great for tech, a joke for the stock market, or it's my rookie state in AI and experience in investing, that make me feel this way?

Please, offer your perspective.

"TLDR; Fed Funds going down, Yield curve still inverted but going back up, I put $22 Million on the yield curve going up at least above 0 within a couple years.

\*\*\*EDIT 2, P/L Prospectus;\*\*\*

Notional Value of holdings: $22M (-34 /TN futures, +87 /ZT futures) \*EDIT: I am going to flip the short /TN position into a long one because it's currently in backwardation and the entire treasury bond market is going to rise)

Current Account Value: $1M

Leverage: 22:1 (with treasuries though so low volatility, beta on account is only 1.5)

Margin Req: $250k

Margin Call Point: Yield curve at -4.5% (if it actually gets that low which hasn't even gotten close in history, then I'm fucked)

Reward:Risk: 4:1 (positive yield curve range : negative range)

P/L sensitivity: 1% yield curve change = +/-$500k ... 2-3% move up = +$1-1.5M, +100-150%

Brief Context: The Treasury Yield curve is the difference between 10Y yield and 2Y yield, when the 2Y yield is higher than the 10Y its called an ""Inverted Yield Curve"". The normal/base state is not inverted because it means the 10Y is more expensive than the 2Y treasury which for the sole reason of people would rather only have their money locked up for 2Y rather than 10Y, the 2Y is usually more expensive. well, it's not, and hasn't been for the past 1 1/2 years. That means the 10Y is much more expensive than the 2Y from what it would normally be.

This usually only lasts about 3 years (\*we're currently 1.5 years in which marks the halfway point\*) and settles at about 2% within 2 years, if you bought in at the first inversion you'd have an estimated 5 years to ride it up to the peak. we are 1.5 years in so there's technically 3.5 years left to the peak but profit will be made well before that. and the Fed is expected to cut rates by around 3-4 times just in 2024 and short term bonds track closely to the fed rate, so all the pressure is for it to shoot up.

What's the trade? Short long term treasury, long short term. I'm bullish on both, but I'm betting on the difference between the two.

What about slippage from contango? (Edit: Well, I’m a regard, there is a lot of carry/slippage, I’m going to flip the short long term position into long since it’s in backwardation, if it ever goes back to contango, then I will roll short for it to go back to hedging the 2Y which is really the main focus.

People shorted this shit because there was oversupply in this sector and the shipping rates tanked. But no-one expected this Red Sea conflict.

**Why am I a long fan now?**

Because in my view the shorters are completely trapped and because of the changing fundamentals. The world is not going to be able to solve the problem with the Houthis any time soon which will put some pressure on the shorters, especially now the shipping rates are exploding and ZIM has a 70% spot exposure. The longer this conflict stays, the more pressure will be built on the shorters. Some make the world believe that the USA can easily control that bunch of desert rebels and will quickly bring order with an Armada of different countries. Well? The truth is that this problem is much bigger and more complicated than the West makes it seem. With support from Iran and ballistic missiles at their disposal, you can keep this sea strait closed for as long as you want. And if you start a conflict, all commercial ships can not be there anymore.  

It is somewhat ominously said, but the only quick solution in my eyes is to bomb Yemen. Diplomacy I don't give a chance to an opponent who wants the death of the State of Israel (and preferably all Jews). And do you think this conflict will get resolved quickly? People seem to forget that the Saudis invaded Yemen for 9 years (see the multi-country invasion of Yemen) until the truce in 2022. They are still standing. 

Conclusion

In my view, the pressure on container rates will remain for a period of up to 3 to 9 months. And that is all the time we need to make the shorters feel very uncomfortable. The next step is the threat of a positive earnings alert. Every day that rates go higher puts pressure on the shorters. And even without the shorters, I think this share has potential. Not for a buy and hold, but for a buy and sell strategy to play out this short squeeze seems interesting to me. 

In my country we always were singing the following song as children:

""Little bird you are caught,

In this cage you will hang.

You stay here, you stay here,

Dear shorter you stay here"".

"Have been looking into Lovesac, the company that originally created those huge bean bag chairs. They since created ""Sactionals"" - their version of sectional and modular couches which makes up 90% of sales. 

Recently, there's been some large insider buying by **Satori Capital** and **Andrew Heyer**. 

# Satori Capital

Satori Capital originally invested $10 million in Lovesac in 2017, before their IPO in 2018. Since the IPO, they've sold down over $70 million in shares, realizing **over 7x** their initial investment.

On Dec 13, 2023 they purchased $3.8 million worth of shares on the open market - their first purchase since 2017.

# Andrew Heyer

Andrew Heyer is the Chairman of the Board for Lovesac. On Dec 27, 2023, he purchase $230k worth of shares in LoveSac. 

Andrew has a pretty good track record of investing in Lovesac... He purchased shares of Lovesac in late 2019/early 2020 at around $14 a share before the stock ran up to $90 at the peak in 2021. 

[Source and Analysis from here](https://app.stockocean.com/company/love)

Granted, home goods is down post-pandemic and there are numerous competitors in bean bags and sectional couches. However, the macro environment could be turning given expected rate cuts in 2024 and Lovesac has held up relatively well compared to competitors.
