"So I have a friend and we normally if not every day, pretty frequently. I sent him a DM on Messenger last night but the delivery status is still sitting on 'Sent' (not delivered or seen). I'm not blocked and so I thought I might be restricted, but I can still see his profile picture and his profile as usual. I can still see his private posts (the ones tagged ""John's friends"")- but it's just unusual that he hasn't been on. It's very unlike him to not be around/respond to any of his messages for more than 24 hours. 

He's an online friend so it's not like I can check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know his number so I can't call. It's the holidays and he may just not be around, he's probably with family and just hasn't been online. Possibly traveling. But I just worry that one day he's going to block me or restrict me or something for no reason. He's not a jerk and I haven't done anything wrong, that I know of. I just sometimes feel like I bug him or chat too much, but I don't know for sure what he thinks, so I worry he might just stop responding to me some day. I'm just hoping it's not now.

"I know that there is a mathematical answer here and maybe this is ELI5 but if there’s a rectangle with sides a and b, then to traverse from one corner to another along the edges you will travel a+b distance. Now, if you split the sides into a zigzag so you traverse 1/2a + 1/2b + 1/2a + 1/2b then you will still travel a+b. Then if you make the zigzag finer and finer you will still be traveling a+b. At some point, the very fine zigzagging looks like a diagonal but it’s still a+b. At what point does it become sqrt(a*a + b*b)?  I know it’s something to do with infinity.

"I'm a 23 year old woman who has no support system, so I'm posting this here because I can't seem to find an answer to this. I know this isn't a professional sub, but im more so just searching for some possible perspective.  

I have CPTSD and I suspect thre may be schizophrenia.  I have experianced Visual, auditory and tactical hallucinations since I was a child. 
Back then, it was mainly just tactical accompanied by paranoid beleifs.

 (Such as feeling a hand rest on me every night in bed, turning to see no one there. And being so convinced people were able to hear my thoughts that i learned to turn them off) 
The rest peaked when I reached 19. 

I have had auditory voices (at 19)  that subconsciously made me act out for them, but I *knew* that it was a voice coming from within my own brain...opposed to how others deem it as God or something sentient. 

Our identities did get blurry and mixed up and I wasn't sure why I changed my name tags at work to his name, but regardedless i knew something was wrong. This lasted for 3 weeks. (I did call my parents and tell them, but no one has ever thought to get me help)  


Anyway, my question is this: 

What do you think causes two people to both experiance hallucinations, but one is not aware that they are hallucinating, while the other (me) *does* know what is happening? 

I often wonder if my ""self awareness"" means I don't have as big of a problem as I think, or if it is just me coping. 
 
I will be seeking medical opinion when I have the resources to do so, I'm mostly just in need of conversation.

"I never thought I would be in a situation where I needed to contemplate how to address a grown man's farting issues in a public workplace. I want to preface this entire thing with: my coworker just told me that this guy recently mentioned he is slightly autistic. I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue or not.
 
This guy joined our team about a year ago. He is probably about 35-40 yrs old. At first he seemed normal enough. A few months into joining the group, I slowly started having more and more issues with him. He's constantly burping under his breath all the time. His sneezes are the loudest sneezes I've ever heard come from a human, but what makes it bad is he always sneezes directly into his hand or sometimes just into the air (we work in a microbiology lab, so this is especially not good). In general he looks kind of unhygienic and grimy. He's the most socially unaware person I've ever met. But my biggest problem with him by far is his farting.

The first time or two I heard him fart, I thought not much of it because everyone has slip ups. But it kept happening. His cubicle is directly behind my cubicle, so I hear everything. Sorry for the detail but I think it's necessary:  It went from hearing quiet little farts once every few weeks, to hearing them every single day. The loudness and intention of the farts are also increasing. They used to be quiet and almost seemed like they were slipping out/maybe an accident. But at this point they are getting pretty loud, and it's clear they are intentional. I hear him push them out and they are no accident. 

What is driving me nuts is since I am the one who sits closest to his cube, I hear the most out of everyone by far, so I feel like I am going crazy. My coworker has told me that she has heard him fart like once, but again she sits further away from him. He'll do quiet ones all the time when the cube area is full of people, and I think I'm the only one who hears it because of my proximity. But conveniently when it's just me or maybe one or two other people, he farts loudly. Not sure if this is a coincidence or not, but it almost feels like he is becoming more and more comfortable doing it around me or something? One time there was a small meeting with my manager (me, him, the manager, and 1 other person). My manager was talking and he farted over her. There was an awkward silence, no one said anything, and then everyone pretended it never happened. A few weeks later, I was walking directly behind him in the hallway and he let out a big fart.  I was fucking pissed. I think everyone is coming to the realization he is kind of a gross person, but they don't realize the extent of it because they don't sit right next to him. I don't know if I should confront him, wait for someone else to get fed up so they will say something instead, or maybe just get over it?? I'm a passive person and confronting someone is way out of my comfort zone.

There is only one empty cube that would be available for me to move to, but it's directly in front of where I am sitting now. So it would give me a little bit of distance from him, but I don't think it's nearly enough.

The one event I didn’t get sick at, was the one when I wore a mask and didn’t eat anything. 

I take vitamin c every single morning, and I am constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer - especially before eating something.

"So, I've been trying to look into this topic, and I've even posted about it on AskScience but the automod kept refusing it for some reason. I hope someone here can help me out.  


I found two essays called ""Animal Cognition and ""Animal Consciousness"" hosted by the Stanford Department of Philosophy. For me, the TLDR is that it can be mistaken to attribute human-like characteristics to animals (anthropomorphism), and science is traditionally wary not to do that. Recently, however, this seems to change, e.g. ""Kristin Andrews and Brian Huss (2014) coined the term “anthropectomy” to refer to the mistake of denying that an animal has a certain characteristically human capacity when in fact they do have that capacity. They argue that anthropomorphism and anthropectomy are both errors, they both amount to a false depiction of how the world actually is, and so there is no reason to fear one over the other.""

im 19f and currently in the 3rd semester of university, there is this one guy i really wanna meet/ get to know and be friends. the thing is we only have two lectures together every week and we are in the big lecture hall and he sits with his friends, i sit with mine. does anyone have any tips for me on how i could approach him? get to know him? 


for the curious ones who wanna hear all my delusions and roast me for it: 

so im turkish but i was not born or raised in turkey but in the country i live in rn. i love this country and i would say im well adapted but i still try to make as many turkish friends as i can bc we have the same fate and i relate to them better. the guy i wanna be friends with is also turkish, thats why im so desperate to get to know him. 
i noticed him in the first semester and in the second semester we were in the same statistics group (we were about 20 ppl in each group) and it was a coincidence i ended up there with him but i blew my chance to meet him. 
i did see him in other lectures but he was always sitting on the other side of the lecture hall (its divided into three sections). this semester though, what made me somewhat hopeful was that especially in the last few weeks he´s been sitting on the side of lecture hall where i usually sit with my friends. he was sitting either in the row behind me or in front of me and we did make eye contact a few times. 

once i had to call my sister and we were talking on the phone (in turkish) and i was sitting outside of the lecture hall and he was walking by with his friend group and then when i was speaking he suddenly slightly turned around and smiled (?) at me. 

and the very last time i saw him i was sitting alone and he had just entered the hall, he sat on the other side but after some few minutes he changed his place and sat in the row behind me but next to a girl and when i was putting on some hand cream they suddenly started talking about dry hands and hand creams and stuff. 
anyways i just want to be friends with him but when i see him sitting with other girls i feel like i have no chance, like if he wanted to get to know me he would. now we´re in the winter break and after that ill probably see him only twice or three times so any advice/tips yall have is appreciated.

Context:
I bought a pair of $135 hiking boots online and they arrived while I was out. They were gone by the time I got home, so I contacted my landlord and he looked through the security camera footage. I just wanted to know if it was stolen by someone in my apartment building or not (It wasn’t). The landlord was the one who made the police report and gave them my name/number. When they called, I cooperated and described what was in the package. After that, I talked to customer service for the boot company and they sent me a replacement pair right away, so no harm done for me. When the police called back days later, they said the found the guy who did it and asked if I wanted to press charges. Apparently he also stole from another tenant in the building who did decide to press charges. I said no, I didn’t want to press charges, because: 1, theft is not a violent crime and I live in an area where a lot of my neighbors probably aren’t doing well money-wise so the guy was probably someone who needs some extra cash for his family; 2, i got a replacement pair so literally no harm no foul.

Later on, I asked my friend why this equation equals 1 and not .9 repeated. My friend is this super smart genius who is valedictorian and seems to know everything. I’m smart too but my friend is Einstein compared to me. She said that my reasoning was correct (the equation does equal to .9 repeated) but she also said that .9 repeated equals 1. Therefore the equation can equal both. I had no idea how that was even possible considering that .9 repeated is getting infinitely closer to 1 but never reaches it.

"Hi!  
I am a single adult (29M) with private health insurance through my employer. I feel like I would greatly benefit from therapy. It has been recommended to me by my doctor. Because of all these things, I naively assumed that I could get therapy covered by my health insurance.   


However, I discovered quickly, this was not the case. My insurance will not cover psychotherapy until *after* I hit my deductible for the year. My deductible is around $1500. Because I am young and very healthy (physically at least...), I never even get *close* to my deductible for a year. This year, for example, I spent about $500 on healthcare for the whole year.   


I decided to bite the bullet anyway and schedule my first session to see what the final bill came out to. After a few weeks, I got my first bill for $200. This means that, if I wished for weekly therapy appointments, I'd need to be ready to spend $800 dollars/month. That feels insane.   


I certainly would hit my deductible fast... but I still feel like this is a bonkers system, where I need to shell out $1500 dollars within the first few months of the year to even be considered for support.

"I think making it through those gut wrenching tough times makes us the people we are.  It certainly shaped me and changed my perspective on life.  A few years back I had the job of my dreams and an amazing wife.  I also had my first born on the way.   In my spare time I worked out like crazy and even fought in a couple amateur MMA fights.  Life was good!

  
While driving home after signing for my first house I was stopped at an intersection.    I don't remember much after that besides waking up in a heap of twisted metal in someone's front yard.  I was later told I had been hit by a drunk driver. I would end up in the hospital for a couple weeks and endure months of physical therapy.  A place I affectionately called ""The Land of the Misfit Toys"" because all of us had something wrong with us.   I went from being 225lbs of muscle to a very frail and defeated 150lbs.  

   
I spent the next year in more pain than I even knew existed.  I was totally devastated and felt trapped in my own body.   I ended up getting divorced and losing some good friends.  I was totally convinced my life was over.  My doctor told me to prepare for the worst and that I may never be the same.  Fortunately after a couple very miserable years of very hard work and persistence I made it back.  Somehow I managed to get up every day and push myself more and more.  I went from not being able to walk ten steps to finally making it around the block.  I eventually started dating again and made new friends.  I even ended up having new career highlights I never could have imagined. 

   
I'm just curious about what life changing tough times and obstacles people have made it through?   This time of year it's especially good to be thankful not only for what we have in life but with what we have overcome.  Maybe this can help serve as inspiration for others who are dealing with similar circumstances.

"Hi There!

I'm reaching out in the hopes of finding where I can find others who share my interests and geek out. My passions lie in the areas of tech, science, space, and video games, along with web development, game development, digital design, VR, and machine learning. I'm genuinely curious about the world and what it has to offer but in no way a smart person. Admittedly, my memory isn't the greatest unless a topic really grabs my attention. But that's a whole other issue entirely I'm sure.   
  
A big part of my daily life involves immersing myself in the passions I described above and experimenting with new tech ideas. Whenever I stumble upon something exciting, especially technology that could benefit others, I'm eager to share it. However, I often find that my enthusiasm isn't matched by my friends. Whether it's discussing the latest tech or offering advice on purchases, the response tends to be lukewarm.  
  
I'm also keen on learning about other people's hobbies and sharing insights, but it seems to go unnoticed. My challenge is not just finding joy in discovery but also in conveying why these advancements are important, and how they could be beneficial.  
  
I'm not looking for validation but rather, a community where I can share my excitement and explore these topics in depth. It would be great to connect with people as enthusiastic about these areas as I am.  
  
If anyone knows of a community where this kind of passion is shared, or if you have any advice on bridging this gap in understanding and interest, I'd be very grateful to hear from you.

"I (22F) am confused about my recent experience with a coworker (22M). 

There’s a guy at work and we kinda speak but not very often. We’ve just began to get to know each other and I’m crushing hard. 

I’m an intern that’s leaving the city soon and going back to college. His vibe has always been a little bit reserved with me. Today is his last day at work before break and I noticed he was remote so in the afternoon I sent him a text message, and here are the texts word for word:

Me: “Hey &lt;name&gt;, since I’m leaving I just wanted to say I had a good time with you the few times we spent together. Also completely forgot to thank you for insisting on waiting with me after &lt;friend’s&gt; bday dinner. Have a good break! :)”

Him: “Shoot are you leaving rn?”

Me: “Leaving Friday but you mentioned today was your last day lol”

Him: “Oh cool I’m on my way to the office rn, I get to say goodbye in person”

Me: “Oop see u soon then”

Him: “Yup”
Him: “Still loved the text tho” *went back to heart my paragraph*

Me: “Guess I’ll have to repeat it to you in person😔”

He came into work in a bit (he lives walking distance away). He may have come into work just for me maybe? He’s never before walked into work during the second half of the day like that so that’s a first. He also seemed to need something there tho so maybe that’s why?? I’m unsure here but he smiled at me brighter than usual.

At 5pm, I noticed he was caught up in a foosball match and decided he wasn’t as interested as I thought so I left and was waiting for my Uber outside when I saw him walk into the lobby possibly searching for me (I sometimes sit on the couches in the lobby). Saw him leave the building and then got a message -

Him: “I think I missed ya but have a great break and good school year! Hope to one day see you again”

Me: “Sorry didn’t wanna disturb your last foosball match with &lt;insert intern name&gt;. I hope I see you again too!”

Him: “you definitely should’ve but I got you”

Me: “Welp my Uber driver is going in circles so I’m waiting outside if you’re still here”

Him: “double welp, I left when I first texted ya😂”

Me: “Rip”

Him; “it is what it is”

Me: “are you leaving tn?”

Him: “tmrw”

Me: “gotcha, safe travels”

Him “you too when you leave”

"We have a guinea pig, it was part of a pair of guinea pigs that belonged to our two kids. One passed away from old age. 
It’s legally abusive for anyone to have a solo guinea pig where he’s from because they are herd animals and it’s very bad for them to be alone. He has always been strong about that. 
I hVe been trying to find a new home for our remaining guinea pig, and now it’s time to clean her enclosure but we haven’t found a new home for her. 
I’m always the one to clean their enclosure even though they are family pets. I asked for his help and he asked for specific tasks unwanted him to do for it, so I asked if he could remove the old and dirty substrate and dispose of it and then unwound do the rest. 
He complained that I was giving him the worst tasks and that I was the one who wanted guinea pigs to begin with (they belong to our—young- children, and getting them was a family decision). 
But he is trying to influence me to deal with them completely. 
I argued that he’s being unreasonable about it and he’s saying, “okay, fine, I’ll help find an owner for the one we have left, is that good enough for you? Even though it was your decision to get the damned things?”
I feel like he’s manipulating me. Am I crazy? I feel like I’m being gaslit but maybe I’m just imagining it?

"""Father figure"" to 2 teen boys.

English is not my first language might be hard to read sorry) Hi everyone, long story coming but i need guidance in a situation that i think needs context. 5 years ago, i was working as a street worker and i met those 2 boys who got attached to me pretty quick. Turns out those boys were almost my direct neigbours. Their father died when they were 3 years old and their mother was unfit at the time, drinking a lot, etc. So i took care of them a lot in the context of my job but also as a neigbour. I also met their mom and worked with her and got her the help she needed in terms of counceling, social workers, but also just being there for her and her children.  
                                                                                       
When i met the boys they were 11, they are now 15 (im 26).                                                         Ive been seeing them on and off for the past 4-5 years,  i usually bring them climbing since its a passion theyve developped through me. As their only passions back then were smoking pot and stealing. I also play hockey and some other sports with them, i try to make them interested in healthy stuff basically. The thing is they see me as a father figure by now, i constantly tell them i see myself more as a big brother due to my age but they still interact with me as more of a father.                                                                  
    
 There now in foster families and visit their mom here and there. I know the foster families by now and i provide them with information that worries me about the boys from time to time (they confide in me a lot). The problem is since there in good hands i dont feel like they really need me there anymore but they keep coming to me, knocking at my door, texting me to go climbing, calling me when they need guidance, etc. I tried to tell them exactly what i just said wich is that i dont really see myself as an asset in their life anymore but i got a really dramatic reaction from them and they told me                        that they'll still go on with what theyre doing.                                      
                                                                                                                    I honestly dont mind it since ive frankly became kind of attached to them by now, it isnt much of a chore to spend time with them since i mostly do what i already love to do with them. Still i just dont know if this dynamic should go on. I also dont know if just starting ignoring them would be good for them since theyve gone trough so much abandonment in their lifes already. I know its a lot but any feedback would be appreciated since their isnt really a blueprint for this kind of situation 😅 Thanks a lot!","""Father figure"" to 2 boys",18nku4n,1703157847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18nku4n/father_figure_to_2_boys/,

As a child, around 7-8, I remember being pulled out of class with a few other children. We went into a room with adults that I know weren’t teachers at the school and given blank paper and coloured pencils. They played a tape that would tell a story and we had to draw a map based on the story. 

The story would say things like ‘we started in the bottom left of the forest, next to a wooden house with a green roof.’ And then we’d have to draw a wooden house with a green roof in the right place. ‘We walked to the right of the house and found an orange and green tree with birds, we looked at it and then kept walking right.’ So then we’d have to draw the tree to the right of the house etc. 

I remember being pulled out of class to do this at least 2 times, with the same classmates. My parents don’t remember this test. It was in the UK, early 00s.

"Okay, I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

I've read multiple articles that talk about how antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are an issue with people who take antibiotics. However, these articles usually say that the reason for this is that someone does not finish a full course of antibiotics, leaving the strong bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics.

The solution given in many of these articles is to stop prescribing as many antibiotics. While I understand that would also solve the problem, doesn't just finishing your antibiotics also solve this issue?

If I'm prescribed a full course of antibiotics, and I take them all as directed, is there a risk of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria?

I've been seeing a lot of memes (possible dog whistles) of women making fun of this sort of physical maintenance that they do?? Mind you, this isn't the usual thing like taking a bath, brushing ye teeth and cutting your nails typa thing.

It's where you supposedly have to shave your pubes every two weeks, and also you limbs (arms and legs) and it's sort of mandatory for them. And your nails (hands and feet) have to be manicured and pedicured as well, and if you don't do this, you're considered unattractive.

This may not seem a lot to y'all but it has got me questioning things, is this an actual thing or am I just being fucked by the algorithm and it's just a small population that does this or have I just been living a rock?

• Bedsheets washed &amp; changed biweekly

• Bathroom cleaned lightly 1-2x per week, and deep cleaned 1 time per month

• Entire apartment picked up and generally tidied about 3x per week on average

• Laundry done 1-2x per week

• Clean laundry *does* sometimes sit unfolded in a pile for up to 2 weeks

• Trash is a tiny under-sink can that gets taken out at least once a week, usually more. Same for waste paper baskets

• Recycling is a pain in the ass in our building, and so it habitually gets left until it's a giant heap. Easily like 2 months at a stretch

• Vacuuming...is on hiatus (I *know* I know, don't look at me. We have no carpet though, and whenever something obviously dirty happens to the floor, it gets cleaned) lmao this one has me too embarrassed I'm likely gonna delete this shortly 💀

• Doors and windows opened every day, for fresh air

• Dishes are a constant battle. There's just usually a small amount of them waiting, since no dishwasher. They get tackled regularly

• The range is sanitizer every time the sink and countertops are

We’ve been married for almost 5 years, and he used to compliment me all the time (even after gaining a shit ton of weight). Recently lost about 45 lbs and am continuing to lose, yet he hasn’t noticed at all and if anything he’s been less interested in me in general… 

I throw out compliments to him like Halloween candy (he’s a bit insecure but I always always let him know how attractive he is, whether he’s in lazy clothes or feeling like shit, he never goes a day without hearing how attractive he is.) literally the only way I ever receive even the simplest “compliment” is if I verbally judge myself or wear a full face of makeup, and even then it’s always just something like “you look good” or “you look fine”. I spend at least 30 minutes every day trying to find clothes to wear that I think he might like, but does he ever notice or say anything? Not at all. I even put on a lingerie bodysuit and some cute sweats and he didn’t say a word, basically ignored me because he was so busy judging himself in the mirror (of course I remind him of the things I do like about his appearance but he didn’t even smile) and then went to bed. 

There has been VERY minimal affection from him, physically and verbally. What’s even worse is that if I ask what he loves about me/what makes him love me, the only answer he has ever come up with is that I have nice tits and that I gave him a child/family like he’s always wanted… (if he asks that question, I always name off every little thing about him that I love, I mean EVERY thing). 

Y’all he’s even told me my opinion doesn’t mean shit to him…what?? I have never ever said that (even tho I definitely have reasons to feel that way about him considering he likes to jerk off to bitches with bbl’s and tiny waists online and not touch me at all for weeks) and if we do have sex it lasts just long enough for me to finish and then he’s done, cleans himself off and then goes to sleep after saying “sorry I don’t last that long”

"I keep getting feedback from people saying that I shouldn’t be dating if I don’t know what I want. The problem is, I feel like I very clearly can define what I want. I’m not sure where people are getting confused…

I want a real, genuine, deep, relationship with a companion/partner. I don’t want to be a booty call or on someone’s NSA roster. I want a partner. Someone I’d take care of when they’re sick, or drive to work if their car breaks down, or be at a funeral to support them. Someone I’d LOVE. The relationship does not necessarily *have* to be sexual in nature, but it would be nice. (Because of trauma history, I could survive just fine, never having sex again—but I don’t actively avoid it or anything. In other words, physical/sexual attraction is not even in my top 10 of attractions.)

But: 
A. I don’t want a husband. (Long-term committed partner? Yes. Completely monogamous? Not required on his end; I tend to be more monogamous by nature, but don’t expect anyone I’m with to be. I’d prefer something fluid and communication-based.)

B. I don’t want to move in with anyone. (Spend lots of time together at one or the other’s home? Yes, of course, a million times, of course. But I love my space. It’s very important to me. People that I love and trust are invited in whenever they’d like. But it’s *my* safe space.)

C. I don’t want kids. (If he has kids, that’s ok, as long as I’m not expected to be a parent. I love kids, I just don’t want to be a mom. I could possibly imagine myself being a more hands-off step parent, but I don’t want the responsibility of raising anyone.)

I want to go on romantic dates, learn everything there is to know about each other, travel, get excited about each other’s passions, have individual goals that we can celebrate for the other person, share amazing experiences, learn things together…. All of the basic shit that a boyfriend/companion/partner could provide. But I won’t compromise on my A, B, or C.

Am I Asexual? Aromantic? Demisexual? Something else? An asshole? Delusional?Maybe I’m just fked up from all the sexual violence in my past and only *think* I know what I want.

Either way, I’m pushing 30 and have never had a serious, long term relationship. Tons of short term ones. I’m perfectly fine with that being the case; I’m in no rush. But I was hoping for some outside perspective:)

The cooked rice weighs the correct weight…but something seems different from the last batch. Less dense, easier to stir in the pot and there was a very small amount of water that just didn’t seem to soak up. I do remember thinking the cups of water were a little over filled though, the rice might be slightly overcooked from me, and I accidentally didn’t have even heat for part of the cook time. 

Does all the weight from rice come from water? Could I have only put one cup in the water and not noticed?

So me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for over a year. We have been long distance for the last three months but will  be together again soon. 
The whole time we were together in person, we met every day and we even went on vacation together. We are extremely close and I feel like I can tell him anything, he accepts everything about me, he likes everything about me, he thinks I'm the prettiest girl he's ever met. He is kind and considerate, and treatsme better than I was treated by other guy. I like being with him, I feel comfortable. He has told me he loves me several times too though I have not yet said it back to him. 
During those three months we were long distance, I didn't talk to a single guy, but sometimes when I look at some guys my heart skips a beat and I feel butterflies in my stomach. My boyfriend is not really my type, I mean face wise. I like that he's taller than me and has nice shoulders. It's not that I'm not attracted to him, I am and I enjoy having sex with him( he's also generous in bed, he always tries to satisfy me). But I guess if I guess he never really gave me butterflies, not like when I look at random guys in the street and I think I want to talk to them.

I don't want to ruin this relationship, he's really important and I feel like he's the first person outside of my family whom I felt so comfortable with. And he's loyal too he would never cheat on me.
But when I look at those guys who are my type I feel kinda sad because I so want to talk to them. I want to date those guys.

"Would you say watching anime at 30 years old is childish?

Apart from watching digimon, Pokemon and DBZ as a kid, I’ve just discovered a whole new world of anime at 30 whilst I’m off sick from work trying to desperately to get my mental health back to normal. 

It’s blown my mind and in a good way. I’ve just watched my first official anime as an adult: Fruits Basket and it has changed my life in many ways. That’s certainly not a childish program either, the themes within it are ones adults can certainly relate too (love, death, trauma, abuse)

Would you say it was childish? I know for a fact that if I told some people I watched anime, they’d tell me to grow up. 

But I’m a firm believer in doing what makes you happy and not abiding by social constraints and norms.

"I'm in the US. I know he makes about $150K and often laments about the fact that he hates living in his apartment. He lives on a top floor of a home owned by his landlord who actually lives right downstairs. I haven't asked him this as I think it might be too intrusive, but I often think, if he's making six figures, has no kids, no spouse, and he only has to care for his dog, why doesn't he get a nice condo for himself, a townhouse, or a regular apartment so he lives on his own rather than with the literal landlord? No, the landlord isn't a relative, so it's not like he's caring for sick family or getting a big discount on rent which is forcing him to stay there.

He's just 30 and so can be paying off student loans, but even then with his salary, I don't understand.

"I (20m) am afraid that I have way too little empathy or that I'm even a sociopath.

I often read horrible stories, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n33fo/overnight_ive_lost_my_wife_and_our_babies/). When I read horrible things like these (about death/war/abuse/other horrible things), the first thing I think is: ""wtf that's horrible"", but I just don't really automatically picture it as I don't want to think about it I guess. So I don't feel indifferent about it but I also don't have to cry, but lots of people do. What weirdly does break my heart though are videos of elderly or kids crying and being broken, especially in war zones. 

If a close friend or family cries in front of me, I want to console them and hold them and make things easier, but I don't necessarily have to cry or feel *super* sad. My ex-girlfriend sometimes told me that when she told her sister or mother about something bad that happened to her, they had to cry with her. In one way that's beautiful (as I see it with my mother and sister too), but I maybe had once or twice in my life max when I had to cry because someone else was crying, especially at memorials. 

What I also *do* feel a lot is when I made someone cry in the past because of my own actions. It's like a stinging guilty feeling on my chest when I picture them crying because of something I did. But I was still capable of making them cry, and that's the opposite of empathy. I feel so much shame

I've had a girlfriend like 7 months ago that I had just recently broke up with had been the person I actually liked. She started to become dry like she wasn't interested in me anymore and I told her about this and she gav3 me some good advice. Like a day later she wrote a long paragraph that she liked me but didn't wanna get in the way of me and my girls relationship. I thanked her for telling me this but I didn't tell my girl. I asked her what made her tell me this and she doged the question. We started talking some more when the talking kinda became flirting, I'm definitely in the wrong for this but she asked to sext and I agreed. We started off just talking dirty and then we just sent nudes to each other. I realized that I wanted to date her more than my actual girlfriend but I already got really close to my girls parents. I told her to stop but she offered a deal I almost said yes to, she said I could do whatever I want to her. She said she would be my little sex slave bascily and could even go as far as to abuse her. I didn't want to hurt her but you know where I'm going. I told her no but she said she's always open to me. When I broke up with my girlfriend she started to open up to me. I was going to bathroom in school and she followed me in and showed me her tits.

"I (23tf she/her) have been dating my partner (22NB, he/they) for over a year now. We are fairly adventurous in the bedroom, although not much interest in PiV sex, which is great with me.

Strictly because I think it's important for this question in particular, I was born with a dick and he was not.

We are both on HRT (2+ years) and I feel it is very important to note that has totally changed what our bodies like in bed. Nothing is standard enough about us that I can read or watch a video to learn, and I can almost guarantee what feels good on cisgender genitals tends to become neutral at best on transgender genitals. We have however done a lot of learning by doing, and we do our best to be open about how it was, what we want different next time, etc.

I was very explorative of my own body prior to us dating, so I had a lot I could tell him, and I'm very vocal in bed. He hated that he even had a libido until starting T, and has never explored his 'entrance' on his own.

When he goes down on me, he makes me cum regularly, sometimes several times within a few minutes. He has probably made me cum without needing me to touch myself at all 10s if not 100s of times. I have made him cum on my own without his help so rarely I can count it on my hands. 

I care a lot that he feels satisfied in bed. I ask what feels good, I try to listen and watch how he reacts, but no matter what I try or how closely I follow instructions, I just can't make him cum on my own. I take my time, it's not uncommon to spend over a half hour with my head between his legs. 

He groans, moans, thrusts, thrashes, begs me not to stop... The sex is good and HOT. But I always reach a point where I know my stamina is failing me around the 20-50 minute mark, and I find some way to kinkily invite him to help me out, at which point he strokes his 'clit' (not that we refer to it like that, youd be surprised how much this part changes on T) and I finger him till orgasm.

He does feel that he cums way harder with me than without me, but I want to be better. I want to feel him finish because of something that *I* did. I want to feel like I'm not bad in bed for him... Which I suppose means getting better in bed xD

Is this normal? How do I improve? Does anybody in my position have some advice?

"**My go-to response to lacking data or being unsure about a decision in my life is seeking validation for it. However, I'm unsure about most of my decisions and I'm always dealing with new situations so this just makes me an insecure person in general. How can I manage without data or certainty?**

Overall, I seek validation from people too much. It's interesting because I sometimes seek it even from people I don't respect or whose validation wouldn't have any meaningful impact on my life.

It's that momentary or long-term lack of certainty about my decision that leads to me to challenge my own beliefs constantly while simultaneously seeking for my views to be validated for a sense of certainty that I know will always elude me.

I speak with confidence only if I find that it will benefit a goal that I have in the moment but none of my beliefs are certain. They're all stacked probabilities that I take a leap of faith on because it allows me to live a life that's consistent with my values, regardless of anything else. I'd say that the only consistent ""core"" aspects in my life are my main values of growth, efficiency, and security.

If I want to live a life worthy of my own respect, I need to get rid of this weakness of seeking validation at all times. It's tough though because I'm aware of how incapable I am as one person and so I throw things out to get feedback of any form but in doing so, I'm acting in a way that's insecure, and this bleeds into my day-to-day decisions.

In certain new situations, I freeze or act out simply because I lack the data to navigate and I don't have the time to seek out feedback to ""validate"" my thought process and bounce ideas off of someone. This takes time but it's not always possible in day-to-day life without a large range of reference experiences to use as a model.

"Had to go anon on this one lol

This is a very bizarre question, I know, but it’s something i’ve been curious about for a while. I’ve noticed if I sit on the toilet for an extra 10-20 mins after my first bm, more stomach “cramps” will come and so will more turds with it, as if they’ve been in there the whole time. Usually the longer I wait the more turds come out… and this makes me wonder, is there always poop just on the other side of that sphincter muscle keeping itself closed up? Or is the rectum fairly “clean” inside (yes ik clean is not exactly the correct word lol, but I mean it more so in the sense of not containing a bunch of poop just chilling in there). I get the gist of how our digestive system works obviously but I can’t help but wonder about the fact that there could always just be more poop hanging out up there even if it feels like i’ve completely relieved myself. Google searches have both told me yes there’s likely all the poop my body has produced since my last movement in there, and no the rectum is clean 99% of the time and the poop is stored a little higher up than just right there inside the rectal canal. I guess the reason I think about it so often is because, I could technically take 10 mins on the toilet and drop just what’s ready to go and leave it there, and possibly have to use the bathroom again soon after, or wait that 10-20 extra minutes and let a little extra go then and there. Sorry for defiling everyones minds who read this but i’ve been so curious about it for so long I can’t help but ask at some point, and I figured the sub called NoStupidQuestions would be the perfect place to do so.

"Not American but all my friend attended state school so they all graduated debt free. 


I saw some post here on Reddit that people have 100k-400k worth of student loan forgiven and I deeply confused by it. People take on loans knowingly because they can’t afford the school tuition, yet they still bite the bullet and now they are waiting for government bailouts?

"So I went on a vacation with my girlfriend and we picked up a small snack for my platonic female friend who had asked for it. I said it was a gift from my girlfriend and took a picture.

Two weeks pass.

One day I had lunch with my platonic female friend, during work hours, typical lunch hour, we're both remote.

This good friend of mine, surprised me with a gift for my girlfriend, which dwarfed the small snack that I brought. It was a gift bag including booze.

The small snack that I brought was a tiny tiny bag, and I easily could have bought two, but it's only available in that distant vacation spot. 

Making matters worse, I jokingly had the snack in a giant bag themed after the place we got the snack from. Which was funny, but made the snack look too small. I ended up offering the bag too, she said no.

It stretched out to almost 1:30, my friend was able to give a work update at 1, however it did stretch out too long. I don't know how much of a problem this would have been for my friend. About half an hour after noon, I asked if we could stay up to half an hour after the update, since we're both flex schedules, and she said that sounds good, and I double checked again. However, I think she was just being nice.

Anyway, the whole time I was using kind of ego humor and kind of flirting (like making poses and dirty jokes) but no actual flirting. At the same time, I was also making grossout humor. I was also complaining about my girlfriend the whole time, although it was clear I was obsessed with my girlfriend.

An hour later, I felt like I fucked up, and texted her another thanks for her gift for my girlfriend, and apologized for acting a little crazy and taking too long, and wished my friend and her boyfriend a nice holidays.",How badly did I fuck up socially?,18o0vox,1703202216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18o0vox/how_badly_did_i_fuck_up_socially/,

let's say that amazon country wants to annex other nearby land for their people for the resources/wealth etc and wage war on other countries to do it.

Let's say the nearby countries are all male with all male militaries.  with similar military capabilities

"So back in the early days of phone apps (iPhone 2 - 6 era) there was this one mobile game that had a BANGER sound track and was also super fun but, for the life of me I can't find it anywhere.

To give a quick description of the game. It was a 2d side scroller endless runner. The screen was split between horizontally with a person running on each side (like a mirror effect. example shown at the bottom).

You tap left to jump one person and vise Vera with the right. trying to jump over obstacles (cliffs, ledges, etc.). and your objective is to see how long you can last (no shit, It's a endless runner). If one of the person dies then gameover.

I also believe that the name of the game was based off of one of the names in Greek or Norse misology.

"I have a very hard time understanding people in any case, I can't empathise or sympathise very well at all. I'm also waiting for an autism diagnosis which might go some way to explaining things if it comes back a certain way.

I've been making a point of learning to become more self aware, and I'm realising that I can be very quick to judge people's hobbies, and can be very dismissive because of that. 

For example, I've been saying for years that music festivals are awful, partly for the following reasons
- poor audio quality
- people screaming for no reason
- people are frequently on drugs
- camping is terrible but that's a whole different issue

... And I'm only recently figuring out that just because it sounds like a terrible time to me, doesn't mean it's objectively a bad thing. People enjoy all sorts of things and I shouldn't think less of them for it. I still don't understand what the appeal of festivals actually is, but that's not really the point.

"Now, I can understand generally how ""normal"" inflation rises and falls. For example the inflation over this past few years spiked and is now going down to normal levels again. But I mean as an overall trend, inflation goes up every year and just continues to do so.

Does that seriously just keep going up forever? How are we supposed to deal with that long term? Can our decendents just expect to pay like $15 for a loaf of bread in 2055? Is everyone going to make like $50/hr to keep up with inflation? 

I feel like every time I try to ask somebody about this, they just act like I don't understand and everything will just work itself out.

"I work in a factory located in the industrial district of my area. Parking spaces in the lots are limited to office workers only. Us floor workers have to fight for open street and parallel park. Because there are other businesses, there are several drive ways and other areas that have post signs stating that no parking is allowed with a picture of a tow truck under it. 

Today, I parked right next to a no parking sign, but a foot away from the prohibitive area, meaning I was the first car in that stretch of road. The car behind me parked closer that you normally would, but since I could just drive forward, it didn't matter. 

After work, I get to my car, and another car has parked in front of it, in the no parking zone. They also left, and I am not exaggerating, a mere 1 inch of space between our bumpers. I was stuck. I had zero clearance to move forward or backwards. There wasn't any identifying information on the car to figure out which building they worked in. 

After waiting a hour, the owner appeared, saw me, quickly got in and sped off. No sign of apology, guilt, or remorse and no time for me to approach them. 

I checked my car and saw no damage, so I don't think they made contact with my car.

"So I’m considering upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE 2020, and right now, the OnePlus 10T is looking like a very tempting option. A Snapdragon 8 chip, an improved camera setup, crazy fast charging, and more for under $400. 

However, one thing that’s keeping me from definitely buying it is that OnePlus, a subsidiary of Oppo, is based in the People’s Republic of China. And as far as I’m aware, the Big Brother that is the CCP can access data of its citizens and any companies whenever it wants. I know that Oppo doesn’t have ties to the CCP like Huawei, Honor, or ZTE, but I’m still concerned about how much of my data they collect and if it poses a risk to me and others in my country (the USA).

Not to drag out a story without missing details, usually every morning, we would get woken up and get breakfast first thing in the morning in jail. I just so happened to up that morning (I actually woke up like at 4am and couldn't go back to sleep) Two COs (correctional officer) came into the block. (one female, one male.

They stopped mid way through the block. I was completely dumbstruck when I watched the guy open up a new jug of milk, spit in it, while she stood there watching him and passed out breakfast. I could tell I was the only one up since nobody said anything. I didn't say anything, nothing really to say since it's two of them and it's my word against them.  
However, there is a camera in the room that has 24 surveillance, and I'm sure it caught the extra wet milk footage, but I do not know how long they keep it on file or who to reach out to, and I don't have the means to get a hold of an attorney.

Despite this we both have the same disposable income because I pay rent but he lives rent free as his family own properties which he lives in and his family send him an almost monthly allowance with cash. For this reason we split things equally most of the time. Things however appear very transactional to him for example if I buy something for both of us he won’t think about it or offer to pay me back but at the same time won’t hesitate to ask me to transfer him money when he pays for something even if it’s a small amount. 

His parents are the same age as my grandparents and have the family business in Malta (we live in Wales, U.K.). For this reason he was speaking about us eventually moving there to assist with his family business. I do not speak the language and would have to leave my career and my family to do so. Additionally he mentioned that I would be a significant part in growing his family’s business and supporting it due to my knowledge and skills. 

When I asked what I would get out of making this sacrifice I.e. being out of the labour market, being isolated and away from friends and family, not being able to earn money from my career (I can only work in the U.K. due to the type of career I have) he did not have an answer for me but instead said he would make sure I was looked after but in my view that does not make up for my lost career. When I mentioned that the prenup he wanted would also mean I am contributing to a business that I would not share success in he just replied that he had to protect his family’s money in case something went wrong in the relationship. 

I’m not sure if I am in the wrong for wanting more security.

I (23F) recently have seen a lot of chatter online about how ""kids these days don't read anymore"",""reading comprehension is down"" etc, and idk why, but it made me reflect back on my teen years in the 2010's, when so many teen novels were released and then turned into movies, and everyone in my school would read the books because they wanted to go see the movie, books such as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent,etc (I live in the US btw). And it got me wondering, do they even make films based off books for kids/teens anymore? Do they even write books for teens anymore?

You see, I have a tight knit family, my mom and dad and his step kiddos are wonderful in their own distinct ways.
However, this year has been one of the worst we've ever gone through financially, my mom and my siblings had to move more than twice this year due to rising costs, and for the first time in our lives, we came to the pretty unfortunate realization that we are gonna have to skip this Christmas almost altogether, no gifts at all.

The problem that I have is that for whatever reason, I can't accept that for them at all, so I've been trying to find ways to fund raise for a while, and I seem to be running out of time, so the question is, is there any website or any way at all that I can raise funds for christmas in time, even if it's just for a cone cup's worth of change?

"I stared working for this pressure washing company about a year and a half ago. When I started here it was great, the boss/business owner was super cool and friendly. It’s a small business and I’m the only employee which I liked because I could grow with them. I have to climb really high and sometimes sketchy roofs with no safety equipment. He would tell me I would never have to climb one if he wasn’t there to watch me but now I have to do it all the time without him there but that was fine with me. They would tell me every day how I was such a great employee and they were lucky to have found me. They even gave me a Christmas card last year that said I was a “part of their family” and had a $300 bonus. Business was slow when I started and most weeks I would work about 30 hours. He told me the job is salary pay and I would be paid for 40 hours no matter what. So over all it seemed great at first. Then summer time rolled around and we started working 40 hours a week and sometimes over that and he would say we‘ll make up for it in the winter time when u get pto. I also started to do the jobs by myself when summer started soo it was just me doing everything which was great because that part came with a raise. Soo all summer long I work long and hard days just trying to hold out till winter. As soon as school let back in business started to slow down. He would have me come in and do yard work 5 days a week 4 hours a day instead. I was wondering why I wasn’t getting pto. He then proceeded to tell me the business is very slow and hurting for money and that he needs me to go doordash and pay him all the earnings soo that he could use that to pay my wage. This happens the day before he leaves to go on a cruise (he takes them once a month). Soo I started doordashing for him and it wasn’t going good and he would constantly be on my ass about not making enough. That went on for two weeks then he says we need to have a talk during the talk he tells me It’s not that the company is broke he said it was the best year they have ever had. He said that the real reason was because business cost went up by “%30”. He tells me doordash isn’t making enough and gives me the option to either use his car and DoorDash for my own wage and he wound only pay me the days I work or he would pay me only for the days I work. He tried to make it seem like it wasn’t that bad by telling me he made 80 in 3 hours the night before but I don’t think he knew I was still signed in on his account so I looked at the delivery’s he took and it was only half that. He literally lied to my face. So now I’m doordashing in his car and stressing out about how I’m gonna pay rent while he’s gone on vacation the week of Christmas. I feel like he’s been lying this whole time and he just wanted an employee for 1 year soo he could get his investments off the ground. It’s put me in a really shit situation where idk if I’ll be homeless after Christmas. Meanwhile I’m watching him spend all this money and not pay me a cent. I’ve confronted him and told him I’m looking for a new job which I am and he basically said okay just don’t forget to give me a 2 week notice and I’ll hit you up next summer.

I've had 3 long-term partners in my life, each relationship lasted around 3 years and all of them were really healthy and loving, and ended due to some outside circumstances (having to move to another country or stuff like that). 

Like 90% of times, when I got undressed around a boyfriend in non-sexual situations (changing outfits etc), he would just show no reaction, or would occasionally grab my boob or slap my butt, but more in a joking around way, rather than anything sexual. 

When we kissed outside of sexual situations, none of them has ever got hard.

"For the record, 31M.  Married and with a healthy sex life at home.  Not particularly religious or sheltered, this stuff just makes me uncomfortable.

My first dabble with dating apps back in 2015 was a weird experience.  I was genuinely looking for dating and “taking it slow”, but often times I’d meet girls who would immediately let me know they just wanted sex.  Sometimes we would have great conversations and go on a date, just for them to initiate sex afterwards.  Going to bars was never enjoyable because the public flirting, provocative dancing, stuff like that just made me uncomfortable.  I felt like a real loser, as all my friends at the time would make a game of going to the bar to hook up with a stranger.  

I met a girl who I ended up dating for a while, but her confidence and sexuality made me feel uncomfortable at first.  She initiated sex the first time, and while that did open the floodgates to a lot of sex, her confidence was always intimidating in a weird way.  Also, the fact that she had so many partners before me never sat right with me, and I couldn’t tell you why.

I don’t care what other people do with their body, but I just couldn’t imagine having sex with someone that I just met.  The partners I have had over the years have all been great, and it’s not like I don’t enjoy sex… I love it.  Just with the right person I guess?

"So I usually have long hair, shoulder length or longer. My hair is extremely thick (I'm native american so it's probably similar to some types of latino hair) and slightly wavy. 

Anyway I cut it short myself because I was bored, and it looked great while wet. Once it dried, it was so fluffy. I don't want to say it was an afro because my hair isn't kinky and I'm not black, but it had a similar amount of volume and size.

That's what I get for following haircut tutorials for white people.

The only way I've gotten it to behave is to put gel in it and then wear a tight hat until it dries. 

Would a professional barber be able to cut it differently to reduce some volume? Should I stick with the hat method? Just putting product in doesn't cut it, it still fluffs up when it's dry.

Now, this is a tricky question to ask clearly because I can't post a picture for references. But, I am a general contractor (in US that is someone who build homes, etc) so, I fully understand the purpose of support beams, posts, collums, etc.

 However, on a space ship that is entirely made of some sort of metal; The bays/hangars where the fighters and smaller space crafts will launch out of almost always have these large (probably 4-6 foot spans) equally spaced beams at the entry ways, and normally completely open floor plan inside. 

Again, I understand that they are essentially for structural integrity and load bearing. But, it's space, there is no weight in space, and most these ships have some sort of force field, I'd assume that would be enough to maintain structural support.

I'm pretty sure the roads heading away would become completely jammed with cars.

My main question is would I be safer to get on the main road heading away from the fire that is 4 lanes wide (2 in each direction) and which will probably be at a stand still with cars trying to escape out.  Or, head perpendicular to traffic a half mile to a nearby lake that is about a half mile wide and get on the downwind side of the lake?  Would people stuck in traffic on a wide road all still get suffocated if large fires are burning on both sides of the road?  There is also a large supermarket parking lot devoid of trees as well nearby.  Is a large parking lot pretty safe or would you just die of smoke and suffocation in a car?  I'm thinking the lake is the best option, but it would probably mean driving towards the fire and riding it out in the lake instead of trying to escape on the roads with 10,000 other cars, essentially getting stuck in a traffic jam..",What should I do in the event of a quickly moving fire in a densely populated suburban area?,18okzrd,1703268256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18okzrd/what_should_i_do_in_the_event_of_a_quickly_moving/,

"So I have been seeing this girl for 6 months now and her ex (her only other boyfriend she’s ever had that she was seeing for 2 years) lives on the same street as me. My gf doesn’t live with me but is only about 15 min drive away.

My gf only met me 2 weeks after the break up (I didn’t know till a few weeks in that it was so recent) and after 2 months of us being together began finding things in her room of his and she’d go over to his to give him it back or he’d find something of hers and she’d go over. 

This has been happening about once a month and it’s usually while I’m busy and not around. The most recent time was last night. We agreed to meet up last night a few days prior and not on a specific time but just ‘when I get back from work’. Got a message from her while at work saying she was going over to her exs to give him back a pair of joggers and asked to  come over saying she assumed I was gonna be home shortly so it would all work out time wise. Which I usually would be if I wasn’t working overtime but thing is she knows that I’ve been doing overtime for the past few weeks and wouldn’t be home for hours to come and when I remind her I won’t be home for hours she just says “oh okay well there’s no point in me going home just to come back, I’m fine chilling her for a few more hours and so is he” and will end up hanging out at her exs for a few hours when it was supposed to be just a quick exchange.

 This sorta thing has happened  a good few times now and he still is into her (he occasionally tries to call her and texts her late nights at least a couple times a week) which makes me uncomfortable already but her willingness to hangout with him in his bedroom for hours just makes me feel uneasy about it all. Especially since when she does tell me when she’s going over before she goes she tells me she doesn’t wanna go to his since it was a bad breakup with him being abusive near the end of the relationship and just wants to stay outside his apartment door yet when she goes over she’s always fine with spending hours alone in his room. Have also noticed that while when she’s not at his and we message (mostly through snap) we usually just send photos and videos to chat but when she’s at his she only send texts or voicenotes.

Dk if I’m just paranoid and haven’t said much to her about it and I wanna trust her and don’t wanna seem crazy but I’m just worried she’s cheating. Any unbiased opinions or advice?

"Hey all, 23M here. I've always struggled with my frustration and alot of anxiety as a teenager but I honestly wasn't very much of an angry teen or a grumpy person until I moved out of home. Alot of stuff happened in a short two year window that included the death of two friends and parents that weren't overly the most supportive with both that and also me trying to talk about what I want to do in life,  As I've gotten older I'm learning to accept the things that happened and I no longer want to feel this deep frustration and anger that's deep within me. I'm currently in a relationship with a loving partner who really genuinely cares for me and loves me and I've been with them for a couple of years now, they know everything about me, my past, the hurt, the good bad and the ugly.  I blow up over the smallest of things and I know when I'm blowing up that it's not right, but I cannot seem to snap out of it and just realize what's actually happening vs what I think is happening and before I know it, I've said something extremely rude or been really nasty. Currently in my life it's very stressful, I've currently been made redundant and it does stress me out, I live far away from my family and friends  nowadays and can sometimes feel pretty isolated due to this, sadly alot of my mates are in that party stage still in their lives and I don't think they realize how isolating it is, I did bring this on myself though.  I think this has caused me to be a bit more on ""edge"" recently however, I don't want to be an angry person and continue what my parents were like to me so so much as a person growing up.  I don't want my lovely partner who does so, so much for me to feel like they have to walk on egg shells just to avoid setting me off, that's just not fair. We talk out all of our arguments and hug them out each time and i do genuinely try to do better and learn from my mistakes and I do know that im slowly improving with small steps and learning very slowly on how to desculate and taking a few moments but I still struggle with blowing up over the smallest of things, a good example would be like me tooting at a car and getting told I don't need to do that proceeding by me explaining in detail about how no, I was in the right to toot and x y and z and your not driving blah blah blah. In recent years I've talked to my parents about my quick to fire and inability to calm down and move on and my mum refers to it as ""red mist"" or ""red eyes"" and she also struggled alot with it as a teenager and early adulthood, she said that her brothers/my uncles all have the same problem that I describe and they both found there peace by talking to their dad/my grandfather about the things that hurt them the most on his death bed. I don't want to wait until then, nor do I overly want to bring everything back up for my parents now. I was just wondering if any other fellow users somewhat relate to this and if so, how have you managed to kind of take control of this rage when it comes on rather than becoming reactive?

"Pregnancy Scare?? Maybe?

Hey I’m turning to Reddit just to get an outside opinion on what’s going on.

My girlfriend (16F) and I (17M) are having a pregnancy scare. To go into detail, she was giving me a handie over my underwear. Then we switched positions and I started rubbing her vagina over her sweatpants. During this time she first massages herself over the sweatpants, then underneath and inside her vagina. The scare is that if she had some of my precum on her fingers and had her fingers inside her vagina, that she could get pregnant.

It sounds dumb, but we’re terrified. I plan on buying her Plan B but we’re worried that she might already be ovulating. But we’re still trying to be smart about it.

Are we right to be terrified? Her fingers weren’t dripping with the precum, and she rubbed them on clothing before inserting her fingers into her vagina, plus the fact that it’s precum and not actual semen.

"Thinking of writing two important characters to my story. These two characters are actually the reason the power system in the universe I’m creating exists in the first place. 

(This story takes place in a God realm similar to the Greek one) Thousand of years ago massive natural disasters swarmed the earth for 9 months, no one knew why it was happening but one day it suddenly stopped. Hades and Apollo, the miracle children. Seemingly born out of the ground are found by a farmer woman and are adopted by her. 

Even as babies Hades and Apollo show remarkable power but that’s not all, mortals start noticing that they’re gaining powers too and it seems that the Gods suddenly aren’t the only people with powers. This is revolutionary finally mortals can gain powers that even rival the Gods

What happened was when Apollo was born he started emitting pathogens that would spread and unlock peoples latent abilities but Hades and Apollo are still more powerful than anyone in the universe

Later in life Hades and Apollo are hailed for their powers and treated like royalty meaning they’re taken away from their mother but they don’t know she’s not allowed to see them

Hades mother eventually finds a way to sneak into Gold Fort (a place for Gods and royalty), Hades and Apollo thought they were abandoned but their mother confirms how much she loved them and she’s quickly executed in front of them

In the moment, consumed by grief, Hades has a realisation. He realises the only people he cared about in this world were Hades and his mother, he realises everyone is insignificant and weak and he can do what he wants. To which he starts killing everyone indiscriminately, when he wants and wherever he wants. He can do anything he wants like steal and kill

It takes several Gods to take him down and it wouldn’t have worked if they didn’t manage to convince Apollo to help (he turned pacifist and wanted to stay away from conflict) and all the manage to do is seal him. Hades also emits a pathogen that can turn anyone into shadow beasts which are brainless monsters that are insanely powerful, this happens when someone experiences extreme trauma but it’s also rare

So what do you guys think?

"My dog of 12 years passed away yesterday. We had gotten him when I was 7 and he was 2. So he lived to be 14 and he saw me grow to be almost 20. I've never had another dog, and it is unlikely I will have one for a very long time, if ever again. Every memory I have, he is included. There was never a time he hasn't been around since I was 6 years old. And the fact that never again will be ever be here, especially around Christmas (as he was born in December and died in December), is almost unbearable to me.

Yesterday people spent a lot of time saying they were sorry, but I guess I must have become intensely cynical over the years, because it just made me extremely bitter. All I could think was, these people are telling themselves it's just a dog, when he was quite literally almost another sibling to me. It angered me that they truly were only slightly sorry.

They also spent a bit of time saying he was ""in a better place now"". And this is the comment that really frustrates me. Where? Where is he? He's not at home, where he needs to be. It annoys me that people can say things that are so blatantly untrue, and that's how I see it. I believe, deep down, I will never see that dog again. Not even after I die. We had him, and he's gone. Forever.

But maybe I'm being cynical again, and there's really more proof toward an afterlife than I'm allowing. My parents are Catholic so I don't even want to bring up this conversation with them, as I don't want to make them think anything other than that he went to heaven.

"I failed a mandatory course in my undergrad senior year, and my life feels ruined alongside my grad school dreams which I was supposed to start in Fall 2024

I am a U.S./Canadian senior mechanical engineering student, studying at a Canadian university. I have been very fortunate to intern at 3 NASA research centers and also obtain a publication too. All my recommenders for grad school were NASA PIs, and I am also a candidate for the GEM Fellowship. I applied to 19 M.S. programs (including Columbia, MIT, Yale, Princeton, NYU, UCF, etc) and although some may be cash cow, as a GEM Fellow these could be funded through an employer or associate fellowship. I have a mediocre GPA (3.3) but still received acceptances to 2 of the 19 schools, with others having pending decisions. Unfortunately, I was writing an 80% final exam due to me deferring the midterm because I was very sick, and I ended up failing the exam and the course by a lot. I fell into a deep depression, and now I have to let my family know, my NASA supervisors, and the schools that accepted me know that I can't attend grad school in Fall 2024 because I failed. I'm so disappointed in myself and I don't know what to do. I know grad schools defer under extenuating circumstances, but I don't think failing counts, plus the fellowship is tied to start Fall and there's no guarantee I get it again next year. I also can't take the failed course (which was electrical systems, a mandatory course) until Fall 2024 due to it not being offered in the Winter or Summer semesters.

My partner rarely initiates sex. When we do it, half the time he just wants me to suck his dick. He has admitted to having issues with porn in the past. He had naked pics of his ex from their relationship in his phone but claimed they were saved because she always asked why he didn’t save them on Snapchat. He deleted these pics after I found them. He doesn’t have a single naked photo of me saved. His instagram explore page is filled with chick with huge tits. I have modest boobs. He never calls me beautiful even when I get made up for a night out. I have to ask him to tell me I look beautiful. Today I walked out of the bathroom naked and he quickly looked away from me. I asked why he looked away and he said he didn’t want to be “creepy”. 

Idk. I wouldn’t mind all the other sexualized women if he was into me sexually. He claims he is attracted to me and finds me beautiful but I don’t want to have to always ask to get a compliment or have sex initiated.

"Tl;Dr: ChatGPT + Voice replication = Possible impersonation? 

Foreword: I highly doubt an 80 billion dollar company cares to impersonate some jagoff fox, this is food for thought which considers the technology both now and within 5-10 years. 
 
With ChatGPT’s voice option, it almost gives me the feeling that they’re in natural conversation and I think this will get better as time goes on. Since OpenAI stores all its data, with enough use, couldn’t they theoretically use all my saved dialogue as training data to make a chatbot that perfectly replicates my manner of speaking? Further, couldn’t they then use voice replication software to make a Bottrot4Real who sounds exactly like me over phone? Even if OpenAI themselves don’t do this, I feel that it is very possible and indeed probable that others will do this in the future. 

I fear this could be a very convincing way to scam the elderly or even some sharper people. Snag some clean audio from a teenager trying to start his streaming career, replicate it, then call up grandma and use his voice to ask for emergency money. That is only one application, too.

"Ive recently turned 35f and realized my time has passed and my value in the market is too low. It’s been sad.

I married my ex in my 20s for half a decade and spent another half decade being completely single as in not sleeping with someone as my ex was my first real relationship and only thus far but it was so toxic I needed to heal a lot and my Dad died which tore up my life and left me mangled in grief.

I’ve decided to make myself receptive to finding a man and have a terrible time because my age even tho I am attractive and naturally fit it goes nowhere. No date nothing. 

Here are my red flags i immediately have:

🚩I’m damaged goods because I was married in my 20s to my first and only real relationship 
🚩 I didn’t have a present mom growing up so I have average, basic, subpar cooking skills if that compared to men’s moms &amp; other high value women 
🚩men wake up between 4-6am &amp; expect breakfast &amp; I know I would not be able to do that consistently as I make a breakfast on the go before I leave for work @9am.
🚩 I am *painfully* boring like sleeping in a coffin because I love to be home and preoccupy myself at home doing little tasks or lounging being home but most men want an active girl who always doing constant fun things
🚩I have no friends or family and many men want a popular woman with an active social life 
🚩 I have a toxic dysfunctional ghetto family that loves to fight &amp; meddle in my life to ruin any potential of something good for me so I can be dragged down to their ghetto standards which I work hard to minimize my life away from them which has left me an adult orphan 
🚩 I have 20yrs of conditioning by my family to find a man who mistreats and cheats on me which I don’t want as I already did that for my family
🚩I don’t know how to be loved and have never been in love (my first marriage was arranged pretty much)
🚩I’m divorced 
🚩 even though I haven’t been with different men I am experienced and men expect me to hook up with them 
🚩I’m not a hook up girl
🚩 I don’t drink or go to bars etc
🚩I have a low body count sadly (for women this is a huge negative not sure for men)
🚩 I don’t have tattoos or have piercings
🚩 I’m very boring but nice not doormat nice just respectful
🚩 I just work a simple job and pay bills like every other adult 
🚩 I’ve tried finding a man in a church but because churches are just businesses their moms tell their sons not to get with me because I don’t drink, have tattoos, and didn’t have a hoe-phase and since I don’t mesh with their mom &amp; sisters I don’t mesh with the son even tho they find me attractive and good.
🚩 I get really, really shy where I shutdown 
🚩 no man just wants to talk to me first and see where it goes just talk like text &amp; call and hang out in a group for a month or so then go out for tea alone &amp; from there
🚩my domestication skills are average basic subpar compared to other women 
🚩 all my gal pals with a past have perfect amazing lives with their husbands and even if they were single like me would be taken off the market quickly 
🚩I’m desperate but not so desperate for the men who hit on me or take interest and they have obvious red flags themselves. I just want a simple person like myself and am worried everyday he doesn’t exist
🚩 my biggest red flag even in churches I try to have a spiritual faith which the only way I’ve survived living without my Dad
🚩compared to all the options men have these days they don’t stick around for it to progress but do stick around for all their other women
🚩 I’m no longer naive .. or young lol
🚩 since I know men are bombard with easy access to women &amp; have the upperhand I’m extremely cautious to take things slow once we’ve expressed interest which has lead nowhere 


Please don’t say I’m young because I’m not. In my 20s I had no shortage of options and def notice a difference even if men hit on me superficially just weekly because now men have no shortage of options of who they seriously choose.

Men around my age are uninterested but 50+ &amp; elderly men are but I’m not into men *that* much older.

"I remember when I first read about aphantasia I thought ""oh that must be horrible"", because people described their mind as a completely black space. It is not really my case. But it put the doubt in my mind and as time went by, I realized I cannot relate to the imagination processes of most people, who talk about ""vividly visualizing something"" in their minds and having their thoughts be expressed as an internal monologue.

I remember when I was learning English and my English teacher told us that when you've lived in an English-speaking country for long enough, at some point you start to ""think in English"". I was so confused by what she meant. My thoughts aren't *ever* structured as a ""conversation"" with myself or anyone else (I mean unless I'm remembering an actual conversation ofc), it's not in ""language form"". It's only shapeless ideas and pure concepts in their fundamental form, striking right at the spot of my brain that processes ideas and concepts. It feels direct, pure and instantaneous. The whole idea of having these ideas have to go through the intermediate step of being phrased in language form seems like a limiting slog to me

Same for visualisation. When I think of something, say a mountain, I think more of the pure concept of a mountain. Sure it does conjure some form of visual representation of a mountain, but it's not *really* visual (do people actually *see* just as with their eyes? It sounds so weird to me, there's no eyes involved in the process), and it really is more a conceptual representation rather than a picture. No details, more like ""an abstract illustration of the pure concept of a mountain put into shape"". When I say conceptual representation, I mean very simplistic, with only the core elements presents that highlight its ""mountain"" nature.

When I read a read a book, it doesn't hinder me from imagining what's happening - just more at the conceptual level with barebone visuals to illustrate it. When I read a description of someone having a big black beard, it just adds to the fundamental characteristics that get *conceptually* pictured when I later think about that character. But it's never ""vivid"".

When I say that, people expect that ""mental"" stuff like mathematics is out of my my reach. Turns out I work in a mathematics-related field, and I have been blessed with a deeply mathematical mind. Since what I """"""""picture"""""""" in my mind are the conceptualized essences of things, it's just perfect for mathematical thinking. And I have no trouble having a high degree of organizations of my ideas in my mind, my mind is never a mess (my home however..).

Also I always was a very imaginative kid, always lost in fictional worlds and stuff. Just not in a ""vividly visual"" manner, in predominantly a concepts-driven manner with barebone abstract visual illustrations.

So I don't know, I may be in an intermediate situation on the spectrum of aphantasia. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm like people that are blind from birth - I'm content with my state because I've never known otherwise, but if I experienced it just once, I would realize how limited my perspective actually was.

"I believe this question will depend highly on where in the world you live but I really never understood how credit cards manage to generate such crazy profits, especially in more affluent economies. I completely understand the business model but how does the math add up?

Almost everyone I know, my friends, my family, my coworkers, all have multiple cards and pretty much max out the benefits of each card (i.e I use a specific dining card, a specific travel card). Almost everyone I know uses autopay or auto debit and the uncommon late charge is on such a minor amount that it’s a rounding error. I have paid annual fees for cards but that is the exception not the norm.

So what I fail to understand is how the credit card companies can sustain these big rewards (like 5-8% cashback) on what I assume should be very large volumes, on what should be a disproportionately small interest fees. I doubt anyone uses a credit card for large amounts of financing as bank loans would offer much better rates, and those that are consistently spending above their income would likely be lower net worth, lower amount customers?

In a nutshell, how do credit card companies make money when they pay such high rebates on all sorts of common transactions?

"TL;DR: i believe my daughter has a corn intolerance. ige blood test came back negative. because of that, her pediatrician refused to give a referral for an oral food challenge to test for a non-mediated allergy so i can get her formula and thickener covered by medicaid. what do i do now?

hi guys! i need some advice. this is gonna be pretty long but i want you guys to understand where i’m at and help me figure out where to go from here.

my 3 and a half month old daughter has had hysterical, inconsolable screaming fits since she was 2 weeks old. as well as an awful stuffy nose and sneezing. at first we assumed colic, but it didn’t seem quite right. she had to be held and comforted constantly, and even then she was she was still in extreme pain. she was eventually diagnosed with reflux, cows milk protein allergy, and lactose intolerance.

by that point, we’d had her on nexium, and 8 different formulas. 2 lactose free, and 3 hypoallergenic, and she couldn’t tolerate any of them. i was at a loss. there were a few nights i almost took her to the ER to make sure there wasn’t something physically wrong like appendicitis or a bowel obstruction etc…

my mom mentioned that her coworker has 2 kids with corn intolerance. it’s pretty rare, but it led me to some research.

in formulas without lactose, or hypoallergenic formulas without cows milk proteins, the main ingredient is usually corn! i did some more research, and found out that the formula she was on at the time, powder similac alimentum’s main ingredient is corn, but the ready to feed’s main ingredient was tapioca starch! we made the switch to ready to feed, with no lactose, cows milk protein, or corn. we also stopped her nexium because it contains xanthan gum, which is made from corn.

and oh my goodness, day by day she is a happier baby! no more hysterical fits, she finishes 3-4 oz of a bottle on average and chills for awhile on her own after eating. instead of eating an oz, screaming, calming down, eating another oz 30 mins later and repeat. she smiles so much more, is soo close to laughing, and her stuffy nose and sneezing gets better every day! it’s the ONLY thing that’s actually helped her.

the only problem she has now is her reflux, since every reflux medicine has some corn derivative in it. but we found an infant formula thickener that is corn and dairy free that we are going to try on saturday. (unfortunately it’s very expensive. medicaid will cover it if a doctor tells them it’s medically necessary but you’ll see why that’s gonna be a problem as you read on.)

now here’s the problem. wic will NOT cover ready to feed, no matter the situation or prescription etc… only medicaid will if a doctor deems it medically necessary. it’s $13 a bottle, and a bottle lasts 1.5 days MAX. that’s close to $400 a month.

i made an appt with her pediatrician, and mentioned a corn allergy. he looked at me like i was crazy, saying it was extremely rare and he had never seen it in person. after my insisting, he agreed to do an ige allergy blood test.

now here’s another problem. ige blood tests only test for antibodies that come from allergies that have the potential to become anaphylactic.

there is something called a “non-mediated allergy” which basically means the body is allergic to something the food is broken down into during digestion, not the food itself. therefore it doesn’t show up on blood tests. but either way, both allergies mean the food cannot be tolerated and it can cause severe damage to the body over time.

unfortunately, my daughters ige test came back negative. so medicaid will not cover her formula because to them, she has no allergy.

non-mediated allergies can only be confirmed by an elimination diet (which we did, and she’s improved drastically), and an oral food challenge test after the elimination diet. this basically means she would ingest increasing doses of corn in a doctors office while they record the effects.

immediately after finding out the results to her ige test, i called an allergy clinic near me and asked if i could book an appt for an oral food challenge. they take medicaid, and they offer the test i need, but they would only book an appt if i had a referral from her pediatrician. medicaid will only cover it if it’s medically necessary.

i called her doctor’s office and asked them for a referral after explaining the situation, but her doctor denied it! his reasoning was “her blood test was negative so this test is not needed. continue on the formula she can tolerate.”

i was LIVID. obviously i was going to keep her on the formula that helps her, i just need proof of medical necessity so that i can get help PAYING for it and you denied even testing for it!

i cannot afford $400 a month in formula. we have food stamps, but we only receive $406 so basically every penny we get for food would go towards my daughters formula. she’s fed and happy then but how are WE gonna eat? that’s not even counting the $30 a week for thickener if she has to stay on that too!

i was gonna just switch her to doctor after doctor until i found one who was willing to refer her to the allergy clinic, but then i realized that medicaid will ONLY accept the referral if it comes from her primary doctor, and i can’t change her primary doctor until open enrollment or something in july.

i do not know where to go from here. i refuse to take my daughter off of this formula but i don’t know how we’re gonna continue to afford it. nobody is listening to me, im being talked down to. all the doctors and nurses i’ve talked to act like i’m stupid and web md-ing my child which is NOT the case. even if the oral food challenge came back negative, at least we’d know for sure that it’s not the corn and we can go back to square one and figure out what the problem ACTUALLY is.

i have this momma bear gut feeling that i figured out what her problem is, why she was in so much pain. i just need proof so we can continue to help her.

any advice or steps to take from here is greatly appreciated. and if you made it down here, you’re a trooper! i’m known to write novels 🤣❤️

"It seems the answer depends on who you ask.

First of all, I am aware of two very important facts:

1. The statistics show that the overwhelming majority of lethal dog attacks involve a Pit Bull
2. The behavior of a dog is largely shaped by the owner and fucked up people are more likely to get a Pit Bull than, say, a Border Collie, thus skewing the statistic.

Then again, I've been around many dogs, none of them in a bad environment (I mean in my firends' and family's homes). There is a noticable, clear difference in behaviour between breeds. And any dog enthusiast knows that some breeds are, say, more active, some less. Some enjoy certain activities more than others. Some are by nature very patient and some act like crackheads most of the time. Usually the behaviour of the dog seems somewhat alligned with the intended purpose the breed was initially bred for.

So it doesn't seem too far fetched to thing that a breed that was bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head could have a disposition towards violence.

Yet people seem to adamantly defend the statement that aggresion is a trait that has nothing to do with genetics (somehow, despite other traits being partially determined by genetics).

So I'm confused, but would like to learn more.

"\*\*\*\*Requisite acknowledgment of how stupid I am\*\*\*\*

2 days ago (In PA). I'm at a bar/nightclub.

It's 10/10:30 PM. I'm standing with my front towards the bar. A guy (total stanger, with his girlfriend, I presume) begins to touch me from behind, rubbing my coat and mocking it, touching my lower back, and essentially making fun of my coat. I ask him to stop. He continues a few minutes later. All just sort of it in a mocking/drunk-behavior manner.

I don't think he was interested in me physically.

I take out a pocket knife, show it, and ask if we have a serious problem. Wanna-be-macho BS stuff, you know. He leaves. No further confrontation. The whole interaction is approximately 10 seconds. The dude leaves. No other words exchanged.

The bouncer came over a bit later, asking if I had a knife on me. Assuming the guy or someone else saw me flash my pocket knife. I said yes and that a guy was getting handsy. I apologized. The bouncer asked me to leave and began escorting me out. I asked if I could pay my tab first. The bouncer said yes. Then he walked me to the door, the guy checking IDs took a picture of my ID, and I left.

No injuries. Police weren't called. Interaction with the bouncer was super cordial, all things considered. This place can get pretty rowdy and has seen its fair share of fights.

Needless to say, I'm ashamed. There's no reason to threaten someone with pocket knife. I use it for DIY furniture that I build.

**Really what I'm asking is: is it likely I got lucky (and hopefully learned a lesson) and nothing will come of this, or is there a good chance the bar filed a police report at the end of the night?

"Hope this is the right place to post this...the TechSupport subreddit didn't seem right as this isn't really a ""problem""....just trying to understand the concepts better. I'm fairly tech savvy and I understand what pixels are and the basics concept that 1080p means there is 1080 pixels times 1920 pixels (typically) on the screen. I understand more pixels means greater detail. My question though is more about how this comes together with Resolution, Aspect Ratio, and TV size....and which term means exactly which thing. 

I use a laptop that is connected to a flatscreen TV. I just recently got into modding Skyrim (a video game for those who don't know...and modding is kinda ""upgrading"" it for lack of a better term) and I'm trying to understand some things about graphics better and if there is any point in modding to 2k graphics. Would it even be noticeable on my cheap TV? 

My specific questions are this. In my display settings panel, I have ""Display Resolution"" and the options range from 800x600 all the way to 1920x1080 with 11 options in between. However, the only thing these seem to change is the size of things on my screen (such as icons) and how the display fits in the screen. I thought that was aspect ratio? Isn't resolution supposed to make my graphics ""better""? As I don't see any improvement or worsening in graphic quality between settings. Personally I like and usually use the 1360x768 setting (which is actually the recommended one) as it makes my icons/text/etc perfect size. The bigger numbers just make everything really small, and the lower numbers make it too big. So can I even watch/notice 2k graphics on my screen and if so, is there a certain ""display resolution"" setting I need to use? What is the difference between display resolution and aspect ratio?  I think that about covers everything....sorry if this is kind of rambling, hard to put it in concise questions.","Understanding Display Resolution, Aspect Ratio, and TV Size.",18p8x90,1703347959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18p8x90/understanding_display_resolution_aspect_ratio_and/,

"I was using a website earlier which gave me a popup basically saying 
“using *website* requires acceptance of our terms and conditions” 
with an Accept button under the text. There was no Decline button next to the Accept (which, considering the fact they said accepting is mandatory, makes sense), but there was an X at the top right of the popup in order to close it. This obviously isn’t my first time seeing this on a website, but I’ve never really given it any thought until now: 

By clicking that X and closing the popup, what’s the status of my acceptance of the term and conditions? I’ve obviously never read nor accepted them, but accepting them is stated to be mandatory for further use of the website, so I’m confused what the website thinks of me when I click X to close the popup without accepting, yet continue to use the website afterwards.

Is the X essentially a decline button, and the website was lying about clicking accept being mandatory? 

Is the X essentially another accept button, since accepting’s the only option?

Does the website work off the logic of “You’ve been made aware that you can only use the website if you accept the T&amp;C, so using the website means you accept the T&amp;C automatically (since it’s necessary for use), regardless of if you’ve actually clicked Accept or not” 
meaning my choice doesn’t matter, and really the only way to decline is by exiting the website entirely?

Is it some other fourth thing?

Is there no definitive answer to this question, as the laws around this stuff are loose enough that multiple of these options are possible depending on the website?

* When posting, apparently searching for a community just doesn't work anymore?
* Can't collapse single comment replies anymore
* I actually used the ""open in app"" button to switch between accounts (one in browser, one in app). Now it's a fuckin banana.
* Opening large images in preview no longer zooms/scales so they're readable
* Trying to go back/forward on multiple images in preview requires pinpoint accuracy on them arrows

Recently I’ve been seeing more and more racist remarks and comments about people from the Indian subcontinent.

Then, the auditor inquired about the reason for the traffic stop. The cops claimed it was none of his business and asked him to leave.

"Mind you, it's late and nearing 4AM Eastern Time where I live, so it's technically the 23rd of December. 

I have two Christmas presents for a loved one that are on their way. One is shipping through USPS, and the other is shipping via UPS. To my frustration, when I track these packages, they both say the expected delivery date is Tuesday, Dec 26th. That's quite a bummer because I really wanted the stuff to arrive by Christmas.

However, just recently I checked the status of both shipments. While they still both say the expected delivery date is Dec 26th, both packages have moved through the system and are currently now in my state. The USPS shipment was at a ""distribution center annex"" around 6PM yesterday the 22nd in a major city about 30 miles from where I live, yet still says expected delivery is the 26th. In my experience, once the item gets to that particular distribution center it usually arrives the next day, which would be today, but again, it still says expected delivery Dec 26.

The other parcel, shipped via UPS, also still lists Dec 26th as the expected delivery date. However, tracking shows me that as of 11PM Dec 22, just a few hours ago, it had arrived in a city that borders my own and is about 10 minutes away from me. I cannot imagine it taking several more days to arrive when it is so close, but the expected delivery has not updated and still says Dec 26th.

Is there a decent chance that these parcels will arrive before Christmas? They are quite close to me now, and I feel as though it's not crazy to believe they might be delivered sooner than expected because they're already so close.

I texted my dad and explained the situation and he believes both items will arrive by Sunday, before Christmas (he's retired USPS). I just don't understand why neither has updated from Dec 26th as expected delivery when they're both so close to my home right now.

"For context my mother has been an elementary public schoolteacher for her entire life, she teaches in US Indiana.

Recently she’s been complaining to me just how different teaching is anymore. She also said that the higher ups are literally giving them a script on how to run their classroom. Forcing teachers to use shit software for tracking student success. As if teachers don’t already know which student are lacking and which ones are excelling. Now I understand there a rules public teachers must abide by that are given to them by the state and then enforced by districts idk, all I know is it’s top down. There are a lot more things I would like to speak on but the most troubling and mind boggling thing to me is the fact she is forced to pass students even if they’ve failed, so I’m talking tests and hw etc. What does this mean, well she says some students know about this and because of it they don’t try cause they know they’re gonna pass anyway. 

What im asking is, is passing kids who are sometimes too illiterate and stupid to move on to the next grade level only to be taught harder material which they won’t even understand or have a concept of okay?

"Hello friends. Want to start this off with saying how hard it is to even make this post. I’m not someone who’s overly sensitive or prone to blowing things out of proportion but I’ve had enough. I’ve been dealing with this condition or syndrome if you will for the better part of 10 years. I’m (26M) and finally facing the fact that I’m dealing with faulty nerve signals that trigger eccrine sweat glands to become overactive. This has affected my ability to communicate in normal ways, as I’m constantly wiping my face from excessive sweat. I understand sweating is normal, however most people I’ve talked to said they sweat in their armpits, palms, or maybe lower back. I’d trade for that in a heartbeat. For me, it’s my face, my hair, and completely wipes out any confidence I’m attempting to display, or conversation I’m trying to have. This is mainly happening in public settings, which I thought was just social anxiety but now I know it’s much more. It could be room temperature, not warm/hot in any way, shape, or form and I break out. Everyone around me is just fine, noting that it’s not hot in the room or it’s nice outside, yet this affects me. It literally could be snowing outside and I’ll walk into a room and start sweating. As I said this has greatly affected my social life; I can’t take women out on dates in a formal setting, I can’t hold conversations or make eye contact for longer than 30 seconds. It’s exhausting…and for the record I’m not on drugs, or coming down off any substance. Yet, this syndrome almost makes me feel like I am the way people look at me dripping sweat in an air conditioned building. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice/tips on how to rectify this?

"I have a specific scenario:

Let’s say I’m a teenager who’s in High School/Secondary school. Suppose also, that I come from a Lower-middle class family. Not necessarily dirt poor, but below the average income of a family relative to my country. For the location, I could live in the US, Canada, Western Europe, or Northern Europe. For the time period, it’s 1995-2005.

I really like pulling pranks on my friends. And Halloween is just around the corner, so I really want to give them a scare! So I devise a plan to leave a scary voicemail on their Landline pretending to be a stalker or spy, or whatever such thing that would scare/intrigue them.

Assuming it’s in the parameters I said in the first paragraph

- Is it possible to hide or distort my voice to make it unrecognizable to my own? It doesn’t have to be a high tech solution or perfect, but just reasonable enough so that they don’t know it’s me.

- Is it possible to hide my landline number so that they don’t know it was me? Could I use a phone booth or a landline from a different location? (If they see it’s my number, they’ll know it’s me!)

- Assume I’m **very** determined on this prank, and I’m willing to spend hours, perhaps days, to plan and execute.

That’s the scenario. I was born in 2003 and I remember that my parents had a home phone, but don’t really remember how it worked. So I need some older people to enlighten me on the technology of the time.

"So i get that the differential (more or less) is present where the engine is located (generally) or better is located where the driven wheels are, so the driven wheels need the differential because...are driven, so the engine's power must be transferred to the wheels in a way that allow different rotation of wheels...but this is the case in the driven wheels, since they must be connected to the gearbox (sorry for mistakes, if present, i have only a basic understanding of mechanic in a car).

If the thing i said above are correct, the rear wheels (in the case of a FWD) are not driven, but they still should be able to spin at different speeds, so when we talk about ""axles"" in reality...what do we mean?

they can't be connected by a solid axle, so there's like two ""half"" of axle that are connected to a some kind of differential? Or just connected to ...well something?

Also, if this is true, in reality there's one ""axle"" for wheel, since they have to be all connected yes, but not ""attached"" in a single axle.

"So I am a 24-year-old male, I’ve actually known this girl since childhood we actually went to elementary school and high school together. I’m about to tell you a long story before I get into any more personal issues that I’m dealing with in regards of our relationship. We met when I was in fifth grade, and she was in the fourth grade, she was a nerdy girl who had no friends, and was often really quiet. I was hanging out with a group of friends, and for some odd and messed up reason my friends started picking on her, but because I wanted to impress my friends, and wanted to be in their group.

 I played along with it, and one day my friends made me push her on the playground which I did, and when I pushed her her, I felt guilty. Ultimately, she yelled and screamed at me, and the yard duties came to see what happened and of course I got in trouble, and she started crying and I was heartbroken because I didn’t mean to do it, and of course I got suspended for it but I remember I couldn’t sleep all night and I felt guilty for what I did. 

The next day I came back from my suspension. I walked up to her and she was scared and told me that she didn’t want any trouble and to please leave her alone and what I did was I just hugged her and I told her how I sorry I was and that I didn’t mean to and that I actually liked her in the beginning and that I was just following along and then, of course, from there we became friends and I let her in with open arms and we were inseparable and of course those idiots didn’t want to be my friend anymore and started picking on me as well. 

Eventually we had our puppy love experience, we held hands we hugged, and we had our first kiss on the playground and then after that, I said, I love you and then she said it back. Eventually , she moved away, and I missed her and we didn’t reconnect up until high school. She was still living in the area and we were still friends. Then, eventually, she moved away after high school.

 She was still living in the area and we were still friends, a few months ago we started connecting more and everything else especially when I went out to LA to visit her and eventually we started dating and then she moved to my hometown so we can be closer and we’re together and not too long ago she revealed to me that she was related to one of my favorite singers, and I’m not gonna say who and the reason why she didn’t tell me soon enough it’s because she was told to keep it a secret but when she knew how trustworthy I was she was able to spill the beans. 

So with that being said the problems that we’re having in our relationship is how I’m gonna be able to pursue the relationship knowing that she’s related to one of my favorite singers who is really famous and what I’m worried about is that if anybody catches glimpse of it how much publicity we’re gonna have to face and I just want to live a normal life and not deal with crazy fans hassling us because they are impressed that I’m dating someone who’s related to a huge celebrity and everything else so I just need advice on what I should do since she’s related to a well known celebrity?",How do you pursue a relationship normally with somebody who is related to a really famous celebrity?,18ozi98,1703312576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18ozi98/how_do_you_pursue_a_relationship_normally_with/,

"So this happened just about a year ago and I have not gone back since. But before this happened it was absolutely my favorite restaurant. It is the only place I can get a real bowl of Ramen that's a reasonable drive. Me and my family ate there almost every other week, likely too much but still.  
The day it happened I finished the whole bowl and was about to start sipping the broth when I noticed it floating there (I do have pictures but won't post them here, if people ask I could post in comments or DM) We called the waitress over, which of course she was horrified, and grabbed her manager. The manager apologized but she did not comp the meal, instead she gave me an extra free to-go order of the same type of Ramen. which did not feel right (we did not ask to be comped over just the shock of it all) and they also gave this free bottled drink which honestly wasn't bad. But to get the point. I for sure miss going to this place. their reviews have never gone down, 4.8 stars, and I've not seen any complaints close to what had happened to me.

"*Not sure if this breaks the rules because it’s about illegal substances, but I want to clarify that this is purely curiosity. I’m not looking for advice on doing or trying to source drugs.* 

Pretty much the title. To elaborate, alcohol, nicotine, weed, shrooms, and prescription drugs all have rules for responsible consumption that are pretty easy to find. 

Growing up as a faithful D.A.R.E. kid, I’ve always been afraid of all drugs, which extended to prescription drugs as I got older. And now, I won’t try something unless I can find a lot of information about safe consumption practices and knowing the risks before hand.

"Hello! 

I recently went at a molding session for custom Ear Pro(tection), but now I have to order it's hard to decide with color use 🤔
So, a stupid *not stupid* question : what color for custom Ear Pros?
Because, ""*do or do not, there is no try, and pay 90 bucks*""

Usage : 
+ good chunk of the day, almost always when outside, used most of days, because very annoyed of noise (kinda autistic)
+ listening loud concert (Rock and Metal 90 to 113 dB (place where custom Ear Pro don't seem to be an unpopular thing))
+ my hearing is already a bit damaged so 'am protecting what's left. 

They told me to get the -26 dB linear filter when they saw my audiograph because of ""yeah, you really need it"". 

On one hand, taking them white or transparent, people wouldn't notice I wear them, so, maybe no or less bad behaving against me when wearing them?
 
(I already have enough bad behavior against me because of my main disability, like, stuff I need to walk, etc) 

On the other hand, if a take the black or flashy colored ones, people would understand from the start that they should talk louder to me, or make me a sign so I'll take them off. 
So... easier interaction? 

I don't have that much interest / preference about the color or how it is fashion or not

There are : highly visible (let's say green phosphorescent) or almost invisible (transparent or white, with ""glitter"" effect). 

On one hand, some people could think ""he doesn't want to be disturbed"" bc of them while wrong. 
On the another hand, color could be an ice breaker or catch the eye in a good sense 😅?

"I would like to know why it is that certain beaches are protected by lifeguards and others aren’t? This lifeguard protection I am talking about includes things such as lifeguards saving drowning people, different flags to indicate if it is safe to swim and surf or not, and also warning signs.  
I notice that places like California and Hawaii are heavily protected, but the beaches in my area in the South-West of Scotland have nothing like this, even though we can have 25 degrees centigrade summers, jellyfish, and rough water currents and dodgy weather at times.  
I feel it would be useful for people in my area to know how safe the beaches are, so I find it to be a bit of a outrage that no one is smart enough to use flags, signs and lifeguards, even though these things make beaches far safer than they otherwise would be. It’s not that we are remote either, some coastal towns here have over 15,000 people, and Ayr in South Ayrshire has around 45,000 citizens.

From the ages of 14-15, I went on a diet to lose some weight. I ate 3 small meals a day and didn’t track cals or anything (oats, tuna sandwich, chicken/rice) and exercised a lot (did lots of running and sports). 

I ended up getting pretty skinny (44kg at 5’3), but started bulking up by 16, and grew to 5’7 by 21.

For context, my parents are 4’11 and 5’8.

With the pain came swelling of the wrist and hand. It was most noticeable yesterday and today when the pain reached its peak.  
Soothing hydrogels (i.e. solosite) have only temporarily alleviated the pain.  
We went to see an orthopedist about the issue and we were advised it could be due to high uric acid concentration in her blood, thus causing gout. The doc came to this conclusion partially due to her recent blood tests showing a higher-than-normal uric acid concentration (849 umol/L).  
She's also eaten seafood (including shellfish) and some soup containing pork the last few days.  
The doc also recommended wearing a brace/cast for the wrist and using a type of anti-inflammatory patch for the next few days to help reduce the pain/swelling.  
Since seeing the doc, the pain somehow seems to be travelling up her arm today.

I reached other conclusions, but, as I did with this one, they were all also dismissed. All this thinking, reaching a conclusion only to end up dismissing said conclusion has exhausted me. Now, looking back, maybe the initial conclusion I reached is actually it, at least for me.

The purpose of life is relative as with all things. The purpose of a hammer relative to a carpenter would be for hammering in nails to wood. However, relative to a psycho it's purpose could be for murder. Same goes for me, my purpose is relative. Relative to my mother, my purpose is to love her, and many more. Relative to a friend, my purpose is to be there for them, and many more. Relative to those I care about as a whole, my purpose is of course to care for and love them, and many more. Relative to humanity as a whole, my purpose may be to leave a positive impact. Relative to the universe as a whole separate from me, my purpose may be to understand it, and many more.

It can be a place you have only seen on a photo or TV, or even better, you already were there and it was a bulls eye for you. I am asking because, as a guy born and raised in Croatia, it was always something on a seaside with a beach what would make a perfect holiday for me and, more or less, everyone I know from my friends I grew up (Hawaii for example). But then, I moved to Munich a few years ago, and there is a large number of people that prefer to go to mountains or for example Alaska, Norway, cold places like that, what my close minded brain can not comprehend. It is obvious for me, that it is influenced by surroundings where you were born and that it is also some kind of a habit for many people. How many of you are sandy beaches type of people, and how many are there more for ice and snow?

"I was watching a video or documentary on Youtube where the guy filming who happens to create social media content on travelling and what not, was actually travelling with the migrants from Brazil to the US border.

It was interesting to watch but at the same time you realize that the route or routes these migrants follow, can be really dangerous. They cross countries, jungles, rivers, lakes......till they finally reach the US Southern border.

There's a risk of being robbed or simply killed and unfortunately this seems to happen to some of those who don't have enough money and take the more difficult and risky paths.....

Most end up crossing Rio Grande and then wait for the border agents and guards to arrest them in order to be sent to facilities where they claim asylum. But what happens if some lose their IDs and belongings and have nothing on them as they arrive? How would they prove who they are, how old they are, their names, etc..... because I guess that US authorities need that information to process the whole thing. But if someone lost everything on the way, with no possible way to prove their identity, what happens?

"This has puzzled me for a long time because it's a way to force the referee's whistle even as the opposing team's striker runs into a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper, and the arguments against it don't appeal to me.  
The counter-arguments I came up with and why don't make much sense in my opinion:  
1) **It's a matter of culture and fair play of fans watching the games** \- this is certainly a nonsensical argument in my opinion, because I don't believe that there won't be at least one fan at such a World Cup final who could do it to make his country win the championship, for example.  
2) **It is impossible to smuggle a ball as a fan** \- that's not true, it is very easy to smuggle at least an uninflated ball in your pants or anywhere under your clothes, and a small pump, fans inspection before matches is not so strict, I've been to several matches and it was possible to do something like that without any problems.  
3) **Penalties discourage fans** \- the same as in the first point, I do not believe that there is not a single fan who could do it even in exchange for a sizable financial penalty, just so that his club wins the Champions League or the national team wins the World Cup  
4) **It's hard to throw that far** \- if you have a seat behind your team's goal in most stadiums there should be no problem for someone physically fit  


I understand that not in every match such an action would be useful, but it still happens much less often than I would have bet on looking at how much it can change the course of a match - especially during counterattacks from which there is a good chance of scoring a goal.

I was shoveling the driveway and went to grab my ice chopper which I hadn't used since last Winter. It's usually kept in a large bin in the corner of my garage along with various other large tools.

Well I looked inside and could not see it. So I moved some of the other tools around, used a flashlight and it was nowhere to be found. Probably looked for a solid 5 minutes.

I searched around the garage, couldn't find it anywhere. Went back to the bin a few times, not there either. 

I was annoyed but figured maybe it got stolen or someone took it by accident somehow. I just shrugged it off.

Well the following day I decided to go out and buy a new one, but figured I'd check the bin one last time. 

And sure enough it was there, right in the bin where it should have been. Not even hidden or anything, quite visible. I kid you not I looked in there SEVERAL times.

"I’m not exactly sure if this question fits here, but I genuinely don’t know where to post it. None of the affiliated subs seem to fit any better.

My ex and I split up years ago. Their grandparent gave them a piece of jewelry that they rarely ever wore, since it meant a lot to them and that particular grandparent had passed away before they and I met. They were heartbroken when they couldn’t find it one day, and it never showed up.

The jewelry item itself is worthless monetarily (as in, it’s not precious metal or stone, purely decorative). But, during the holiday today I was helping my parents by fixing their dryer belt (which requires taking off the front of the dryer). My ex and I used to wash clothes at my parent’s house when we were together, and lo and behold, while fixing the belt, I found the piece of jewelry covered in lint. It probably fell into the dirty clothes bin, or was in a pocket before we washed clothes and must have fallen through the lint trap since it is fairly small.

Normally I would think that yes, I should return it. But our relationship ended after I found out she was cheating, which just so happened to be the same night my brother died. Their completely nonchalant attitude towards my grief and being glued to their phone while I was crying is what clued me in that something wasn’t right. It fucked me up and I really still haven’t gotten over it. I cut contact with them shortly after, ignoring calls and texts for a couple years until I stopped getting them.

On one hand, I know that having this item returned would make them extremely happy because they were heartbroken at its loss. On the other hand, I don’t want this to be interpreted as me wanting to be involved with them. The petty side of me thinks I should just toss it in the garbage, but the bigger person in me thinks the right thing to do would be to return it.

We maintained 0 mutual friends and the last time I looked at their profile online they were moving to another state. That was almost 3 years ago. The only way I know to contact them now would be sending a message on Facebook.

"Again this is my belief, nothing is based off of any evidence and I’d like to just know what others think about this. 

So ever since I was young I’ve always measured intelligence bracketing them down to 4 different types of intelligence. 


- Physical intellect: Having an extensive knowledge and understanding of a certain subject or that of a wide variety of subjects to a greater degree than the average.

- Emotional intellect: To have a greater understanding than the average of the feelings within yourself and others. To be emotionally intelligent one has to be able to sympathise with others of all walks of life throughout the entirety of the emotional spectrum. 

- Social intellect: This is defined by the ability of knowing what to say or do in a variety of situations to manipulate and influence others via interactions of any kind intentionally. 

- Environmental intellect: Being aware of your surrounding environment to a greater degree than the average, knowing how to take care of one’s self or others within the environment that they live in and or have a greater understanding of other environments and being able to quickly adapt. 


In summary, I believe that true intelligence is measured by these 4 factors.
Someone could excel in one of these 4 categories but not the others may score lowly due to their lack in the other categories. 

For instance a doctor of medicine may have an extensive knowledge of a variety of different medications and their ability to have an effect on the human body would score quite highly when it comes to physical intelligence.

However this theoretical doctor may not know how to nurture and care for a child or give the emotional support to a dying relative and would score quite lowly on the emotional intelligence bracket. 

Or for instance the personal trainer knew exactly what to say to sell his services to his customer to encourage them to train with him, would be considered socially intelligent. Because they were able to understand how to persuade said customer, in turn benefiting themselves. 

However if any of these people forget to look both ways before crossing the street and die they would rank quite lowly due to them not being environmentally intelligent. 
As opposed to the street hoodlum who might be a complete nuisance to the rest of us but is so used to being on the streets that he knows to look both ways on that partially busy road.

To conclude I believe all of these intelligences are just as important as the other to measure intellect accurately.

"Everything seems to go in one ear and out the other instantly, I can't even perform basic tasks.

I first started really noticing it when I was 14 and I worked a fast food job but for some reason I couldn't figure out the most basic things. I had to have everything repeated, walked-thru, and when left to do it myself I was entirely lost no matter how many times the task was demonstrated. Im still that way😭

Same thing with school, I could never understand the most basic shit, and I always went thru multiple people trying to explain it to no avail. 
Even when I did manage to learn something, I forgot the next day even if I spent the entire previous day going over it.
My ass dropped out

Admittedly it was lack of effort, UNTIL I genuinely started trying, studying, asking questions, etc, and was still dull ash

It's not even just work or school though, I can't understand what my friends are saying half the time, and they aint even tryna explain anything. Im never really aware of whats going on around me, I have eyes but they don't see. The most basic every day things confuse me.

Also recently it took me a month to find out the same person was texting me from a different number despite them explicitly telling me💀 AND IT WAS OBVIOUS ASF 

People around me get frustrated by it, and I don't blame them. 
I'm frustrated too.

I'm currently 17 which is practically an adult, and I don't want to enter adulthood this stupid because it's more embarrassing than just being a dumb kid💀 like how tf am i gon survive like this

"Hello,

I am having a hard time looking this up online as I'm not sure how to word this concisely. Searching ""entire dinnerware set chart"" brings up how to set a table and that's not exactly what I'm looking for.

My question is: Is there a list or chart of every single dish you could own for serving food in a household? Not for cooking food, not cookware like pots and pans but more like the things that go on your table like you have this many plates with these utensils and your butter dish and your sugar dish and your side dish bowls, and a coffee/tea pot, a pitcher and the glasses sets, and the salad bowl, and dessert plates, etc etc.

The reason I am interested in this is because I have been into cooking lately but I don't have a complete set of plates. I have a few plates that match bowls and a set of cups that are neutral enough that it look cohesive but when serving more people like now during the holidays I have to put food in different bowls and such. I'd like to get a complete set of everything I could need!!!! for any kind of meal!!!! And have it on hand. The tricky part is that I don't like white plane decor I like things with a design. I think it's a bit wild of me to want this but I think I can make it happen or at least get the main things with a design and separate things that match enough that are the same color to look cohesive : )",dinnerware and serveware set,18qce98,1703482891.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qce98/dinnerware_and_serveware_set/,

I am certain I did not ejaculate inside her, but I woke up the next day and realized that the condom broke, meaning we likely had a bit of unprotected sex. I texted her this, saying I was a bit worried and that maybe she should take plan B? Her response was that she was due for her period in a couple days (therefore likely infertile) and that she was on birth control and had not missed a day so she thought it would be fine. I said ""thanks, that makes me feel better - I'm heading back on the plane to my city, shoot me a text if you're ever in [my city]."" She didn't respond.

Anyways we haven't spoke since then due to being 6 hour plane ride away from each other. I saw that she's posting instagram stories as normal.

But out of the blue, 2.5 months later on the night of Saturday December 23rd she texts me last night ""Hey"" at 1am my time (11pm her time), at which time I was already sleeping. I woke up the next morning and this has sent me into a panic spiral. I texted her ""what's up"" at 6:30am when I woke up and then ""all good?"" at like 1pm, and no response. It's 4:30 pm EST now and no response. I tried calling her a few times but it's gone straight to VM each time.

Basically I'm really worried she's going to tell me she's pregnant. Or maybe she was drunk at her Christmas party and decided to text me late at night.

A few days ago I tried making plans with him. He said that day probably wouldn't work because his work would probably be running late. Last minute he then texted me asking if that day would still work. I said no because he said it wouldn't work and that I had made plans already. I then asked why we don't just make plans in advance. He then said he doesn't like being ""held up"" unless it's for his job, otherwise he prefers doing what he wants. I said I respect that, but asked how we could meet. He didn't answer. He then called me, very pissed and annoyed, asking why we can't meet. I again said I'd made plans because he said that day wouldn't work. He was seething. This kind of thing has happened several times.

There have been times where I've complimented him or wished him a good day and he gets pissed off. One time he called me ""facetious."" I once said I was from [insert US state] and grew up there, to which he said ""Yeah you seem like you're from there."" He says he values silence, but then when I'm silent while hanging with him, he gets pissed and asks me ""What?"" to which I always reply ""Nothing."" I once said I was going to the Hamptons to visit, and he said ""You definitely like the nouveau riche."" I asked him what made him think that, to which he changed the subject.

I cannot remember someone ever being so bold in asking for drugs. I’m not a square but I have ever even seen cocaine in my life much less possess it to sell.  So I responded “uhh nope sorry”

* Him: Are you sure? Someone told me you did. 
* Me: Uhh nope, just here at the game with my son (gesturing towards him)
* Him: Oh ok, good. I’m actually undercover so it’s all good

This is what I’m guessing happened:  Someone was selling cocaine in the bathroom, and someone did tell the guy to find a guy that looks vaguely like me and ask him. He mistakenly asked me and when he realized that I really am not a drug dealer he pretended like he was an undercover cop so that I wouldn’t go tell someone that some dude is trying to buy coke in the bathroom.

"Most people seem to have a very negative option of that subreddit, and I feel like I'm one of those... but does the sub have anything going for it?

I would say that there is definitely value in what the idea of a subreddit where people can ask for honest ratings and genuinely receive them rather than being coddled by people who don't want to hurt your feelings. I would even say there is some credibility to some of the material they link to with regards to a few things that are ""objectively"" attractive like high facial symmetry, even proportions, healthy skin, etc.

However, the memes are very much true about the subreddit. If you look at the comments, you will see ""warning for over/under rating"" on any rating outside of roughly the 4.5-5.5 range. It even seems very common for people to be banned for consistenly overrating or underrating.

The mods are apparently strict on their idea that no rating is allowed to carry subjective reasoning... but then why allow voting at all? Is the idea not then to have the rating guide (presumably produced by one or more of the mods) on one screen and rate people referencing that? That kind of just seems like a roundabout way of having the mods rate you, and given how heavily subjective I would suggest the higher end of their scales are, there doesn't seem to be much value in that.

I'm interested in the concept, but it seems like the execution is poor enough that the subreddit is basically just a place to go to rate everyone a 4.5 or be told off and eventually banned. I would argue that subjective ratings would need to be allowed, then averaged, to have value to the person submitting their photos; personal preference is too much of a factor to be ignored.

I’ve seen a lot of memes and videos about a “goth gf” and I’ve also seen people complain that those jokes get goth culture super wrong.

People seem to associate goth solely with dark colored, revealing clothes and niche/kinky interests. Meanwhile the subreddit for goth people seems to say being goth is mostly about exotic, horror-esque fashion, and the gothic music genre. 

Although, EDM/rave culture does seem to have some of the stuff people want a “goth gf” for. Dark clothes probably make the neon light accessories stand out so that’s probably common. The rave subReddit showcases a lot of revealing clothes people wear at rave parties and there is also heavy emphasis on the niche of drug use for pleasure.

He was very polite and said he understood my hesitance, then handed me his card and told me two cryptic things: first, to “not go with the other guys who were gonna make the same offer” and also to have a happy new year as he “had a feeling 2024 was going to be a big one for me.” 

I googled his name when I got to the car and he’s legit— he’s a top level executive at Warner Brothers who is mentioned in a couple articles, and his picture online is definitely the guy that was in the store.

"A few days ago I accidentally got water on the screen and some went down by the bottom and possibly went behind the plastic covering. Attempted to get it all wiped up but couldn't really get behind it. Tested the TV an hour later and it worked. Later that night I turn the TV on, everything was fine, then the remote acted like it was shorting out because every time I aimed it directly in front of the TV and towards the bottom panel where I think the receptor is? it wouldn't work but it would work if I aimed it to the sides or indirectly at the TV, so I thought it was either the receptor, batteries or remote. I've went through 3 different pairs of batteries so it isn't that. 

I don't know how or why my remote would just quit working, it fell a few times since having it but nothing broke so far. And I want to think (but don't want to since that's a larger issue) that it's the sensor but it isn't like a lot of water got on it. The water smashed right at the bottom near where the screen and plastic connects so it's possible some went down behind the plastic but wtf? I just got this TV as a present earlier this year.

"I found a spider in my bed almost a month ago, Chunky thick one the size of a dime. I'm thinking it's a wolf spider. But crawled into the sides before I could catch it. 

I pushed through my fear to sleep in my bed, until tonight, I wake up with a swollen kind of flat lump mosquito bite. Except I hear no mosquito. Now I'm researching a bunch of spider facts i have found for your amusement below read some horrible quora stories, and would like an opinion on if you think the spider is still there?

P. S. Some facts I saw

1. spiders try to find warm places in winter e.g. I have the coldest room in my house, but then my bed is warm so..... 

2. Spiders are more likely to be near your bed if you have storage underneath (I do) 

3. Wolf spider males travel around, especially at winter looking for female mates which like warm places. 

4. Spiders can slip through cracks into your homes. (my house has giant cracks in the walls that I can put a whole hand in) 

5. Most spider bites are actually just bacterial inflammation. A study recorded spider bites in Australia only to find 2 were bitten passively, the rest were when ppl tried to catch a spider. (though how do you know u were bitten in ur sleep) 

6. Most spiders try to stay away from us, but unfortunately despite 8 eyes, have very bad eyesight (except for jumping spiders) and can only detect motion. So your motion either seems like a potential predator or prey to some curious spiders","Found a spider in my bed, then a bite, what are the odds it comes back",18q5prj,1703457923.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18q5prj/found_a_spider_in_my_bed_then_a_bite_what_are_the/,

"Recently a man local to me went missing and the picture the family used looked absolutely nothing like him at the time he went missing. It was an old pic from when he was clean, I didn't even recognize him (I knew who he was from seeing him around town semi-regularly). He was missing for about a week but when they found him deceased it was rumored he'd only been dead a day or two and it occurred to me that people who have seen him wouldn't have been able to recognize him from the picture. There were more recent pics on his social media that looked more like him at the time of disappearance so it wasn't for lack of recent photos. 

Opioid addiction is a big problem where I live so this situation is not uncommon but thankfully missing persons are often found alive. I've noticed a trend though, more times than not the photos the families use are often from times when the person was clean and healthy looking, and if you come across a current photo of the person they are barely recognizable from the older photos used in the missing persons posts.

"I have two friends that I met while in esthetician school and we got super close while there. We were a trio , and spent ALOT of time together. The other 2 member of this group — a little background. 

Person A —(28 F) just got out of a physically abusive relationship , has a young dog.
Person B — (28 F) also just got out of a toxic relationship , and her mom is dying. 
Me — (22 F) just had a baby 4 months ago , single mom , still dealing with ex , SA’d by a family member while going to school. 

Person A and Person B live close to eachother , I however live 30+ minutes away. I was driving to them every time we hung out. It started to get annoying bc I eventually moved out of my parents and into a new apt while in school , and person A did as well. I have been to her apt , and AMPLE amount of times , while having a newborn , and brought him with me. 

She has not been to my apartment once , and barely makes time for me unless it’s on her terms and convenient for her. And every time I bring up them coming to my place , Person A uses her dog as an excuse , which I told her she could bring with her , it wasn’t a problem. 

I’m obviously closer with person B , she has the same love languages as me and she’s like a sister. Person A thinks spending money on meals and such is enough to make a friendship go round. She’s also very absent minded and half listens to you when you speak — you have to repeat yourself 10 times before she registers it all. 

A lot of her habits feed into my fear of abandonment — gifts and money were always used against me as a child,  she’s late for everything , and I feel like I come second to everyone in regard to her.

"I’ve always been quite sensitive to negative things that people say to me and the memory sticks and angers me for years and years. 

Some examples are I remember many things my aunt said to me as a kid. Although she was a good help in some situations I still feel resentment. For example I fainted on my first day of work and kept having periods of intense anxiety/panic attacks avoiding college. I remember her saying stuff like don’t be soft and ‘ we were made of stronger stuff when younger’. She was a mental health nurse too which just made me feel extra weak. There were many catty comments she made similar to this 

It’s the same with my dad I remember being angered by comments. whenever I wanted to discuss something which contradicted his view his reaction was just ‘oh piss off’. I was called a b**** countless times and he often put my looks down. I’m no angel I mean I said stuff too I guess up to being about 14 then I started to ignore him. Though ignoring only does so much he has to be called out on his name calling/sarcasm now and then or else if totally ignored he gradually gets worse and worse. 

My point is whoever is right or wrong, how can I stop feeling resentment for people for comments they made years ago?  It happens at work too peoples comments flow through my head at night and I feel angry/can’t get to sleep.

"So, you're put in a spot where you want to invite over your group of friends for like a nice reunion get-together to catch up with one another. Only thing is, one of your friends is asking for vegan options - you on the otherhand, are on a short budget and could only really cater to the majority of what the other guests want to eat.

For this example - let's have a simple barbecue. You can feed a lot of people there and shouldn't break the bank too much, only thing is - whatever veggie meat option there is would stretch our budget too thin.

Would you be in the wrong to just tell your friend that they'll either have to bring their own food or just tell them that you cannot accomodate for their particular needs?

I personally am leaning currently on just not accomodating them if it ever comes down to it. I know that it would be mean spirited of me to not try and include them, but there's also this thing with most vegans I know - They don't even know how to compromise with the average person not being vegan. Like, the situation then revolves around the vegan preaching and how we should get on the same lifestyle too.

Like look man, you're really leaving me with little options here. If you're a vegan with non-vegan friends, I hope you never try to get them into that lifestyle, because oh lord is it a huge pain in the ass to find the fucking food accomodation for you and your people. Not to mention, most vegan options are expensive dude, at least learn how to sympathize a bit with how much we're struggling currently.

"So my grandfather wrote a book about his life that I've just recently gotten a physical copy of. My grandfather is generally a man of few words and difficult to have a conversation with at his age and after a stroke, but I've heard from other family members that he has lived a really incredible life. 

It is only printed in Mandarin Chinese and I want to translate it into English. I can understand conversational Mandarin pretty well, but my reading and writing skills are not enough to understand a book as complicated as this one with military and political jargon. 

I don't want to hire a professional translator and I don't mind that it will probably take me a while. I'll do it as a little side project. 

The book itself has the spine on the right and opens to the left -- which is different from what I'm used to -- and the characters are read top to bottom, right to left. It is about 166 pages. 

I'll try to scan the book to pdf first and then I figure I'll use some sort of translating software to help me out with a rough translation. Then I'll go through it manually to correct any mistakes and do some research on political context to make sure I'm getting it right.

Of all the verses, I’ll accept that five golden rings could be about ring-necked peasants. I’ll even consider pipers— as these are another type of bird. Milk maids, drummers, ladies dancing, leaping lords. I’m not buying every verse is about birds.

obviously everybody has their preferences, and every couple is slightly different, if not drastically

Drove right down the street and back up and drove off down the main drag. Dog isn't barking any more but they heard it (noise bylaw is in effect) and did absolutely nothing and I believe it's because it's one of their own.

"This has been a long time coming, as I’ve started to get a little more desperate in reaching out for advice. I know he has a harder time doing so, as he’s so ashamed of his addiction. 

My partner has been using Meth for over a decade. He started using various drugs in his mid teens, but that’s what has always stuck. About 3 years ago, he chose to quit and left a toxic relationship with a partner that also used. Around this time, he also got a DUI as he had been using and drinking, but was only charged for the alcohol in his system as that’s what he was pulled over for. Obviously COVID slowed everything down, and he finally “failed” his diversion program in November and was sentenced to complete the 90 day outpatient sobriety program by June, as well is on probation for 18 months. He has not started the 90 program, as he has not been able to pay the evaluation fee yet. 

I have been under the impression that in the past three years, there has been more time sober than relapsing. Today, I was coming inside from taking the dog out and saw a pipe sticking out of his backpack. He occasionally smokes DMT, and I know what that pipe and substance looks/smells like. This pipe neither looked nor smelled like DMT. I calmly informed him that I am aware of the pipe and that I know it’s not DMT. He initially tried to gaslight me and tell me that that’s just because “he cleaned it”. I waited, and he admitted it was meth. He’s relapsed a few times, and has always been honest with me when I confronted him, but lies to me when I’m just suspicious. I asked him how long this time and he said “for the past decade”. He explained that he’s definitely had moments where he wasn’t using, but that they have been very short lived and he starts to use again very shortly after. He got upset (understandably) and went to leave. I asked him if we could just talk about it tomorrow as it’s Christmas and I’d like to not end it this way, he agreed. 

He’s currently in a SMART recovery program voluntarily, but this is to address a gambling addiction. His previous diversion program was aimed to help with drinking. He also doesn’t have many friends, and the person he spends most of his time with outside of work and home is an older person who he has nothing in common with and met through their dealer years ago. This person has no respect for my partner and only reaches out when he needs something or wants to go get drugs (I’ve been told the same current dealer supplies meth and DMT). This person is a huge source of conflict in our relationship. 

I know none of this is my fault nor my problem to fix, but my partner means the world to me and I truly think he’s an incredible, kind, giving, beautiful person who struggles with addiction, rather than a “garbage addict” as he usually refers to himself. I’ve been direct, but supportive through everything, but I am all too aware that a person doesn’t change unless they want to and put in the work to do so.

So what now? Will he fail his sobriety program and go to jail? Do I kick him out and stop paying for his lifestyle and let him figure out his own mess? We’ve been together for 1.5 years, moved in together 3 months ago, I helped him get a job he actually enjoys and not working with other users, we’ve spent the past few months setting up an aquarium (I funded this as a gift) so that he had a new hobby to focus on. I can’t afford our apartment by myself. 

If anyone has advice on what they think would be helpful to him or this situation, even brutally honest, I’d be so incredibly grateful. Thanks for reading this and thanks in advance ❤️",My partner is in active addiction. I’m not sure if I’m coddling/enabling or being supportive.

"I posted this before but deleted the wrong post.. give me a break, it's super early here. XD 

I know I am a very literal person at times (I am German) and an overthinker. I've worked on it, but part of it is upbringing and cultural. I also know we all have things to improve on, including me.. I'm not angry at my wife, I love her very much actually. I'm just lost on communication styles sometimes and would like a different insight. I know she doesn't do this on purpose. Help me understand myself, constructive criticism or ways to not overthink or get anxious... maybe a book I or we could read? 

Example 1: we did Xmas separate this year. Her back to the US and me to Germany. She told me she'd let me know when she landed safely so I wouldn't worry. She didn't.. I got text messages she must have sent from after boarding about 15 minutes after landing, which must have been sent when she connected to wifi.. that was around 0200 my time, but nothing like, ""Hey babe, I made it."" I didn't get anything until almost 5 hours after she landed. And I got a, ""Sorry, my phone doesn't have service unless I'm connected to wifi."" I know she connected otherwise I wouldn't have gotten those other messages. 

When I landed in Germany, I didn't have wifi either, but I connected to airport wifi and then my mom's phone to let her know. It would have literally taken a minute to do so.. i.e., while in customs or baggage claim... which she said took over 30 minutes. It takes like 1 minute to say, ""hey I landed safely."" 

Example 2: I had to pick her up from work. In a pretty poor country we currently work in. Her phone died during her work event. I waited at her work for over an hour, and nothing. I asked a coworker who came out of her work and asked him to text her other coworker, so I had an idea how long I'd be waiting or if I should head home. She then said it didn't even cross her mind to ask somebody else to use their phone, or send an email. 

Example 3: she visited her sister. She told me she'd call me at 1700. I had left work early to go grocery shopping and got to the store at 1655 and thought, ""damn, if I go now, I will miss her call."" So I waited. Until her call 30 minutes later. I was annoyed, I could've at least gotten a quick 3 word text that she was busy and will call later than agreed upon.

Example 4: she said hey I'll text you later and send you a bunch of pictures from her dog and herself, and Xmas dinner. I was super excited and waited almost two days and only got pics after I asked twice. 

In the end I think I'd rather not be told something and then not get it. Or should I just expect that it will be a 50/50 if it happens? 

And no, I'm not controlling or need communication 24/7. I used to need communication, but have worked a lot on myself. I just assume that when somebody says something, they do it, or at least let somebody know when they can't.. especially when I'm awake half the night worrying something might have happened at the airport or with the flight. 

I dont want to bring it up, I want her to enjoy her vacation, she deserves it and I don't want to argue. I just feel when you say you will contact me when you made it safely to the US from an international flight, I kinda expect that to happen?

Is it just different communication styles? Is it because I've been military all my life and you're constantly expected to respond and be accurate, on time and precise?

"So, a few months ago my friends pushed me to purchase the dillion danis fight so we could watch it. I did, regretfully. Now DAZN won't stop trying to charge me $20 monthly. I've cancelled, but the charges continue monthly for a full year, which is obviously weird and different from any subscription I've ever used before. I have them on my cashapp though, which does not have enough money to be charged.   
Will this hurt my credit and will there be any other reprecussions in the future if I do not let them charge me?

"I apologize for putting a downer on everyone's Christmas, and I hope this question isn't too stupid because the standard answer on Google is therapy, but I'm trying to find a free or low cost place to go and cry so I can process my feelings. 

Disclaimer that I am not, and will not, think about self harm in any way, shape, or form. 

Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option for me right now due to cost/lack of insurance. 

I'm not at a place mentally where I can talk to my loved ones at home or go to my friends or anything like that. I can't let my vulnerability risk the way I'm seen, and I don't mean that in a tough man way. I mean that in a I'm trying to handle my issues properly as an adult without constantly turning to others living their own lives so that they trust me to handle my issues by myself. 

If I could afford therapy, I’d go in a heartbeat. But sadly, none of the options that exist for me in a different physical location work due to cost. 

So if there’s any way I can find a place to cry that isn’t my bathroom, that would be amazing (if I spend too much time there crying, it’ll come off very suspicious too to those who live with me. I’m not specifying who for anonymity. Could be roommates or family or wife and kids or maybe even I’m in a commune but that doesn’t matter because the point is there is someone else here that my privacy is limited and I have to acknowledge that as I process my issues and trauma. I’ve never been the type to take a long bath or shower so I can’t turn to that either.)

I’ve thought about the library, a coffee shop, and many other places in my area, but unfortunately, none of them have what I need. At least not the ones I can afford to be at. Staying at a hotel/motel isn’t an option for me either due to immense cost. 

I just want to cry. And once I build my money back up, I’ll go to therapy like I should have in the first place.

"Look. I know how people can be on this website, and I know that a lot of questions like this can be thinly veiled attempts to rail against lgbtq folks. So I want to start by saying that I am bisexual and that I believe that the identity of non binary people is entirely valid. I just don’t understand it. 

So like, I get traditional trans people right? They’re born in the wrong gendered body their brain tells them they should have been born in the other type of body and that they should be treated like the gender that’s different from their sex. That I get. But from my admittedly limited understanding of non-binary people, their transiness??? Isn’t like that. From what I understand With most non-binary folks they feel like they don’t conform to societies expectations of what either gender is supposed to be and thus feel that they don’t fall in the category of he’s or hers 

Now part of this could be because I have autism, but that seems strange to me. Not trying to attack anyone. I just genuinely do not understand the concept of changing your identity because of what society thinks. It seems odd to me to like, care about what society says about how boys and girls should act.

"Alright so to start off I’m a high school senior. If you know me you would know that I work my butt off in high school taking leadership positions and hard classes and all that stuff. I know I’m watering it down but just know I mean I worked like REALLY hard so I can apply to good colleges. I did early decision and got into a really good school being in the top 10 schools in the U.S. and I just feel bummed because it feels like my mom really does not feel the way I do. I’m really pumped that I got into this school and I was honestly expecting her to be somewhat also pumped but as soon as I got in she started researching the school I got into and then proceeded to question why I didn’t apply to an Ivy or something. Honestly I felt really hurt and I’ve told her in the past that I don’t want to apply to an ivy because I feel like it’s too much for me (and I wasn’t confident I would get in, I wanted to apply to a school where I felt like I would have somewhat a chance at the time). I remember that I did want to apply to an ivy at some point but it was because I knew my mom would be really hyped that she could brag that her daughter was accepted into an ivy. It just feels really disappointing for me because although I have somewhat acknowledged that I have worked this hard up to this point for myself, there’s a part of me who also worked hard for my mother’s reputation and opinion. Recently I did something not too proud of and my mom then proceeds to comment “you should have gone to (sisters college)”. To give a little bit more context about my older sister, ever since middle school I’ve always been compared to her and everything which developed a lot of insecurities for me and so when she said that it really hurt me because I wanted her to see me for me for once and not compare me. My mom obsessed over my sisters college and so I think she was a bit upset I didn’t apply there. I feel like she also said I should’ve applied to my sisters college because I would have someone look over me. I mean but isn’t going off to college something I should explore on my own because I’ve always relied on my sisters and this new step makes me realize that i want to be more independent and rely on myself. I just feel like when she said that it really just sounded like she isn’t happy I got into my university. It makes me mad at her and myself because what am I even doing. It also makes me feel hurt because I literally don’t want to go to my sisters college (and my college is also ranked way higher so why does my mom obsess over her college so much) ok I know that sounded dumb but I just mean why can’t she also just acknowledge me too. I just remember she was being like this the day I was accepted when I was really hyped and her mood just totally kind of made me kind of sad and disappointed. I feel like it taught me that I should really just work for myself now. Sorry my rant sounds so jumbled but I’m just really upset right now.

**TLDR**: The married professor of the college has been giving a lot of attention and affection. He is trying to get closer and closer through various actions. He is trying to get very personal and tries to stay connected outside of the college. What should I do? How to deal with him?

He's married and he has children.
I know him for 2 years. 

Here are some unusual things I have noticed him do:

1. He usually doesn't remember the names of most students but somehow always remembers my name. With other students, it's like ""What was your name again?"", ""I don't remember her name..."", etc. But he always remembers my name without fail. He even acknowledged it to me, ""I can't remember most students' names, but I always remember yours!""

2. Compliments me and my work to other teachers and colleagues (in front of me, and in my absence as well). 

3. Takes care of me and does little things for me. Like, opening a door, for me turning the fan on, giving me a chair to sit, doing/helping me with a task if it's too difficult for me, like carrying something heavy.

4. Keeps telling me to sing in the singing competitions, or during the prayers (yes, it's an education college/teachers training course and we are taught how to sing prayers). It has happened multiple times. He kept trying to repeatedly tell me to sing and come on the stage during a function. But I didn't obey him. I know I am poor at singing.
Then he was like, ""You are not complying with me! Not fair... Try it, try it just once! I am sure it will be very good!""

5. Teases me and jokes around me, trying to make me laugh (when we are talking one on one). 

6. Weirdly stops speaking during the lecture he's giving, just to stare at me for a long time, then continues the lecture after several seconds, like nothing happened. It has happened several times in the classroom. It made many people uncomfortable.

7. Tells me the positive things his colleagues and other professors have told him about me. 

8. Texts me personally to congratulate me on special achievements and good academic progress.

9. Picks me specifically and gives me little tasks. Like, ""Give me that book from the table"", ""Turn on the light"", ""Give me a pen"", etc.

10. Often picks me specifically to answer the questions in the classroom, even if I don't raise my hand.

11. Watches how I write my answers during the examination, by standing right in front of my seat for several MINUTES.

12. Once he called me for help and made me sit next to him in the staff room to help him arrange and sort the documents/papers for 2 HOURS.

I just know this question is gonna get me executed but I'm very curious about this topic.

So I found myself down a rabbit hole on YouTube again and discovered a community of viewers and creators that focus on ""meltdown videos"", the videos range from cartoon characters being angry to human children being angry, sometimes these videos are skits and sometimes they are full-blown TV shows (Supernanny, Driving Mum and Dad Mad, I Want My Mummy, etc).

In the comment section of these videos, you may find comments that talk about the children/cartoon misbehaving, and quotes from the children/characters. These are normally left by accounts that are maybe fans of a cartoon or some other niche topic.

"I would classify this person as a friend. As we talk pretty often. Very least we have a work friendship.

I feel like I know a lot about her, but I don't think she knows very much about me. She asks the basic how was your day or how are you doing, but any deep conversation has never really been about anything with me.

To my point, I know she's had a very rough year. She's had a car accident, had her school future kind of go into a frenzy, her parents got divorced weeks before Thanksgiving and things have been really crazy for her and she's told me she's not doing well since the divorce. She's told me all about it.

I shared some of my experiences when my parents got divorced so I could tell her I could relate and know how it is.

Ever since she really told me about the divorce in detail a few weeks ago, she's been basically my shadow. She had come into my work area more than once to talk to me. Expressed that she wants to be in contact outside of work but we were interrupted before we exchanged numbers.

During our holiday party, she told me she was disappointed I didn't get to meet her mom and sister because they left before I showed up. She also expressed she wanted us to work together on a project, which we never do.

There's been times before the divorce where she's asked if I'd be interested in doing things together outside of work a few occasions before this, but never thought it was a good idea because I knew she had a boyfriend.

I'm not sure if they are still together, but she's just been laying it on pretty heavy the last few weeks and I can't tell if she just is looking for comfort or something.

"Curious to know if anybody else has kinks you could never openly discuss. I.e. when I met my now wife, I said I have a huge queen of spades, hotwifing kink. She said her biggest kink is an MMF threesome. And man, do we have fantasies sometimes... XD 

I.e. she wore a fake QOS tattoo in public and at the pool and both of us were super turned on by it... I don't think we'd ever do anything, we are loyal and loving. But the thought is what counts.. 

I get you can openly say, ""I like butts, or heels etc."" You can't really openly say, ""we fantasize about my wife sleeping with a black bull."" 

If you do, do you know what caused your kink? As for me, I don't fit into the stereotype-&gt; I'm not a cuckold, or small, or insecure, im fit, successfull etc, I don't want to be degraded... I don't know what caused my kink. Again, I think it's just a fantasy though. I stopped trying to figure out the why, I think it's just a kink. Even though I have been curious to the WHY.

"So, I have not accepted this kind of offer before, and I have never had a credit card either. I need to make a big purchase, and this offer would help if it's legitimate. I have no idea whether, when I'm approved, it'll charge me or ruin my credit score or anything like that.   


I've read through the offer details itself, but it is pretty purposefully unclear on whether being approved for a Prime Visa is the same as having one sent to me, being forced to use it, and automatically being forced to pay it's massive interest rates, and so on.  
   
My questions are: What will I have to do if I accept this deal? What can Amazon do to me? What are potential consequences?

The terms of the Rewards Program Agreement apply to the 5% back and 3% back earned at Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market, including any physical Whole Foods Market locations in the United States and the website accessible at wholefoodsmarket.com and the participating Amazon stores and sites operated by Amazon’s affiliates listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits, and through Chase Travel.  
  
% back and Points: “% back rewards” are the rewards you earn under the program. % back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in % back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see “% back” in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. Eligible Prime memberships only apply to Amazon.com accounts (and not accounts on any other affiliated websites outside the U.S.) and may include, in Amazon’s sole discretion: annual and monthly Amazon Prime subscriptions and members of their Amazon Household (excluding Amazon Prime Video and invited guests of an Amazon Prime account), Amazon Prime Fresh, Amazon Family, Amazon Prime Student and trial memberships of Amazon Prime. Whether a purchase earns 5% back or 3% back, as described below, is determined at the time your eligible Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market or the participating Amazon stores and sites, or Chase Travel purchase is made. How you can earn points: You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Prime Visa or Amazon Visa credit card by you or an authorized user of the card account. Buying products and services with your card account, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count and won’t earn points: transactions on Amazon.com to which you choose to apply a promotional financing offer, balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 5% back or 3% back at Amazon.com, Whole Foods Markets and the participating Amazon stores and sites: You’ll earn 5% back with an eligible Prime membership or 3% back without an eligible Prime membership for each $1 of eligible purchases made using your card account at Amazon.com (including digital downloads, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Fresh orders, Amazon Prime subscriptions, and items sold by third-party merchants through Amazon.com’s marketplace), Whole Foods Market, including any physical Whole Foods Market locations in the United States and the website accessible at wholefoodsmarket.com and the participating Amazon stores and sites listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits. 5% back equates to $0.05 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 5 points. 3% back equates to $0.03 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 3 points. 5% back or 3% back is not earned on (i) purchases from merchants using Amazon Pay, (ii) purchases made at international Amazon retail sites (including but not limited to Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, or Amazon.co.jp), or any other website operated by Amazon that is not listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits, (iii) purchases made at international Whole Foods Markets, (iv) purchases of Whole Foods Market products and services through third-party sites such as Eventbrite, Instacart, Google Express and Shipt, (v) online purchases of Whole Foods Market gift cards (including through buyatab.com), event tickets or classes, (vi) purchases from certain third-party vendors operating at Whole Foods Markets, (vii) purchases of massage services at any Whole Foods Market, or (viii) purchases from Spa@Ink, in each case in Amazon’s sole discretion. 5% back or 3% back through Chase Travel: You’ll earn 5% back with an eligible Prime membership or 3% back without an eligible Prime membership for each $1 spent on purchases made using your card account through Chase Travel. 5% back or 3% back is not earned on purchases made using your card account directly with travel suppliers including airline, hotel, car rentals and cruises. 2% back in rewards categories: You’ll earn 2% back for each $1 spent in the following rewards categories: gas stations; local transit and commuting; restaurants. This equates to $0.02 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 2 points. 1% back: You’ll earn 1% back for each $1 spent on all other purchases. This equates to $0.01 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 1 point. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including eligible purchases at Amazon.com, cash, travel, gift cards, and products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options may vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don’t expire as long as your card account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won’t qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.

The extra % back rewards are earned after the close of each qualifying Daily Rewards posting and are generally available to be used the same day; however, it may take up to one additional day to become available if the extra points are earned after the close of the last qualifying Daily Rewards posting. Daily Rewards will post Sunday through Friday each week. To qualify for these promotional offers, your account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment.

Oi meu nome e Gustavo e hoje na noite de natal dia 25 de dezembro de 2023 eu estou em um dilema se eu mando ou não feliz natal pra uma menina.
Essa história começou a uns 4 meses eu conheci uma menina porque ela estava com ciúmes de mim e de uma melhor amiga minha e por incrível que pareça eu me apaixonei por ela, sei que isso foi uma idiotoce mais ninguém manda no coração, passei por muitas coisa com ela vi a minha melhor amiga se cortar e ela tentar ajudar ela e se cortar tbm mesmo que fosse sem querer isso me machucou muito ver as duas com as mãos vermelhas de sangue, fui inventar de ""proteger"" ela de uma amigo nosso que iria bater nela com uma garrafa e acabei cortando a meu dedo não foi muita coisa mas ficou na minha cabeça, depois de um tempo com influência dos meus amigos eu fiz a maior loucura da minha vida, eu pedi ela em namoro em uma festa que eu e uns amigos meus fizemos juntos, eu não tinha um pingo de esperança que ela iria aceitar mas por incrível que pareça ela aceitou não sei se foi por influência de alguém ou não mas eu me senti a pessoa mais feliz do mundo, dois dias depois eu fui conhecer a mãe dela não sei se ela realmente gostou de mim ouse era só pq eu era namorado da filha dela,contei algumas coisas que seriam pelo menos importante de ela saber por exemplo minha data do meu aniversário, eu jogo bola em uma quadra perto da minha casa eu joguei bola um dia antes de ir na casa dela e fui ameaçado de morte lá fui no dia seguinte na casa dela pq ela tinha me chamado pra ir lá, contei pra ela que eu fui ameaçado de morte pensando que pelo menos ela iria se importar mas claro que ela não se importou pq ela tava muito ocupada mandando mensagem pra a minha melhor amiga (que ela teria tido uma briga) ao ponto de a mãe e a irmã dela ter que brigar com ela pra ela me dar um pouco de atenção, a noite eu perguntei pra ela brincando pq agente tava falando quando era a data de aniversário de cada um e ela não sabia a minha data de aniversário mas não me importei com isso sinceramente ela tentou me dar algumas desculpas de merda mas não me importei, 3 dias depois ela me mandou mensagem me pedindo desculpas sem ter motivo algum pelo menos era o que eu pensava ela tinha brigado com a minha amiga pq ela disse que não gostava de mim como namorado depois de um tempo ela não me respondia e me falou que iria se matar fui correndo pra casa dela pra ver se ela estava bem e ela estava bem, no dia seguinte foi o último dia de aula eu não queria ter ido mas meu pai me obrigou então fui,lá fiz muitas coisas legais me despedi da minha amiga pq ela viajou pra outro estado, dei um EAE vago pra ela mas estava mal na hora da saída ela praticamente se humilhou pra ganhar um tchau da minha amiga eu passei por ela não do lado nem atrás na frente dela e ela me ignorou e antes que vc ou vcs pensem que ela não me viu ela estava na porta da sala e eu sou uma pessoa de 1,80 de altura mesmo sendo muito novo, e do mesmo jeito me deu um tchau forçado, e recentemente eu não estava me importando de mandar nenhuma mensagem pra ela estava esperando ela me mandar pelo menos um oi pq eu ainda pensava que ela se importava um pouco comigo mas pelo que eu falei ela não se importa ela me mandou um oi sim Depois de quase 4 dias sem falar comigo pra perguntar da minha amiga se ela tinha chegado no estado e se ela tava bem teve mais conversas mas eu não me lembro muito e não cabe a mim dizer pq e algo pessoal dela, eu comecei a ""discutir"" com ela e mandei umas mensagens pra ela e a bloqueie e recentemente precisei desbloquear uma pessoa e desbloqueie todos os meus contatos bloqueados e deixei quieto ela não me mandou mensagem mas um amigo nosso em comum me perguntou se eu iria mandar  feliz natal pra ela e eu disse que não estava falando com ela e ele está me enchendo o saco desde o dia 22 pra eu mandar Féliz natal pra ela.",Desabafo,18qxpud,1703558609.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qxpud/desabafo/,

They're small enough issues that all together, it might take a tech-savvy person about 3-4 hours to get things in working order. And to be honest, a lot of what I need is for them to look through all the ""tech drawers"" and tell me what pieces are useless, which wires go with which pieces, etc. It feels so ridiculous but honestly nobody in our family or friends circle knows technology well enough to do this.

I have seen some potentially helpful services online, but they seem computer-oriented and seem to require purchase from that store for help. Any ideas? Even some tips on what search terms to use would be helpful. Thank you!

Okay Reddit, I have a genuine question. Today I (28F) was talking to my boyfriend (27M) and he had asked if he (about 6in / 15cm maybe slightly bigger) was the biggest I’d ever had. He said he was asking for an honest answer so I told him no my ex was probably around 19cm. Long story short he seemed hurt or insecure after I told him, and I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings. No I wasn’t like “it’s okay, the big ones hurt,” or anything like that, I just gave him an honest answer because I know my favorite dildo is 16cm and my last boyfriend was significantly larger.

"To preface the situation, I dated a guy for two years that towards the end of the relationship treated me like absolute trash. He would not talk to me for days, talk to multiple other girls and was adding girls he randomly met on Snapchat and would talk to them but ignore me. Called me ugly to my face and lied about being in a relationship with me to other girls. He was just awful to me and constantly gaslighted me to the point I felt zero self worth. I wasn’t allowed to see some of my girlfriends, go out to bars, he was controlling. He had convinced me to move in with him and THEN started this behavior, so when I left him I was literally homeless. I was absolutely heartbroken to end it because I really loved him and it affected me for a long time afterwards. Please note that when I talk about my sister and my mom, they are actually my step family. My mom passed when I was little and my dad remarried.

My family constantly insisted that we were going to work things out and were blind to the way he treated me because of how much they liked him. Even after the relationship ended he would talk to my sister all the time. My sister was my closest friend. Even after watching what he put me through she would talk to him about me and acted like I was being over dramatic about the things he did. My sister has only ever been with one person and that is her husband, so she has never had a bad experience with a significant other. It got really bad to the point that I told my family I don’t feel comfortable with them continuing their relationship with him because he was mentally abusive to me and would use whatever they shared about me as an excuse to reach out. (Example she posted about me graduating college and he called me “to congratulate” me and let me know he was doing well.) 

My mom and sister refused to unfriend him. They said it was their choice who they could and couldn’t be friends with. I told them that I didn’t want them sharing anything about me then as i was trying to move on and I don’t want him to have any access to information about me. He gave that up when he decided to do the things he did. My sister and I got in a huge fight about it and we didn’t talk for months. I told her I felt she chose my ex boyfriend over me and doesn’t think I’m serious about the way I was treated. Months later she came back and apologized and I forgave her and that she was wrong for not believing me. She had unfriended him. I started dating someone new and we are happy. I found out my sister re-friended my ex on everything. I let her know this upset me and she had no excuse just said “sorry”. My mom posted a picture of me that I had asked her not to post and refused to take it down. I confided in my sister and told her I didn’t want my ex to see it because my mom had tagged my sister. My sister of course came back with “I shouldn’t care” because I’m with someone new. To me it doesn’t matter. He did things to me that were awful and I cut him off for a reason and forgave my sister and allowed her back into my life. I told my sister I was pissed we were going through this exact conversation all over again and that our relationship will not be the same again, that she has broken my trust because she had made a promise to me she wouldn’t do this to me again. I had to set a boundary. My mom got mad I did this and screamed at me on the phone and didn’t talk to me for 4 months. It took me coming back and apologizing to my mom because I missed my family. It was hell for me. I reached out to my sister to see if we could talk and she said I am cut off and am not her sister anymore. I saw screenshots later on my mom’s phone of my sister saying awful things about me and my mom agreeing. I can’t stop thinking about this. I don’t know if I should have just kept my mouth shut about them being friends, but I felt like I needed to set boundaries for my family as this wasn’t the first time they have done really hurtful things to me before and I don’t want it to continue.

"I’ve never been drunk before but my interpretation of it has always been a state where, you’re basically kind of “sick” for lack of a better term. I can see that it is not only mentally impairing but also physically impairing as well, which always gives me the impression that the person is not their normal self. But when other people explain it to me, it seems kind of contradictory. On one hand, it’s supposed to lower one’s inhibitions and therefore, they will act as if they aren’t held back from what might be an impulse or their feelings. Some would say that it’s even a more honest version of themselves. On the other hand, as I mentioned before it seems like an impaired state where the person has kind of lost control of themselves, and feel that they can’t be held responsible for what they do or say.

I personally don’t really know how I should feel about or interpret drunk people and their actions/words. I typically just try to ignore them or keep my distance, but in the case of something happening I don’t know if it’s right to hold them responsible for what they do in that state. I don’t think that “mistakes” or “accidents” they make should really only be blamed on them being drunk.

[[skip this chunk of text to get to the point, it’s mostly backstory]] I want to find a therapist due to personal shit I wanna sort out and I’m worried from that personal shit that I’ll become a more bitter and resentful person unless I deal with this as soon as possible. The problem is as far as I know, every therapist is booked up completely with clients for months on end giving me very little to see. I’ve had a therapist once before who had a low client volume,, and she wasn’t very good… which leads me to believe most therapists who have opened space aren’t the greatest at their job. I consider myself pretty good at expressing exactly what I’m feeling in the moment and why what concerns me does, and at least ok at reflecting on how we got here: I just need a therapist that can help narrow down courses of action and ways of thinking and maybe reassurance so I can stop feeling shit about everything.

 How would I know how good a therapist is beyond just seeing public reviews and just blind guessing? Everyone’s experience is subjective and I’m worried I’ll just spend the already difficult time to get a therapist only to not get anywhere in multiple months of sessions. 

Possible useful information: I live in Ontario Canada, don’t have financial concerns (cost isn’t a factor for the therapist, I wanna prioritize it) and am perfectly fine doing online sessions, I’m not gonna turn down options just because I can’t see them in person.

"I’ve noticed that I often get interested in certain topics to the point of ending up in a completely different place. 

Just this morning I was watching a video about television and the media evolution over the decades. This led me to an hour and a half video about the entire history of Fox News. Me not being American and not really knowing much about the subject, I had to click on it. 

This video was a masterpiece, it was a complete analysis of their history and the influence they’ve had on the real world. In the latter half of the video, Fox News is described as postmodern. I didn’t understand what the term meant to its full extent, so I had to search for a definition. 

While trying to fully understand what the term meant, I’ve encountered another difficult term I should understand first - modernity.

"So I will give full details of my situation and try to be as clear as possible. This is also for my documentation so I have a point to reference back to, so sorry if it is messy to read.

A few days ago, I was dropping my younger sister off somewhere in a small plaza. I noticed while walking around and looking at the stores there was a massage parlor. A man walks out and he was acting somewhat strange. He was looking around a lot like he was nervous of something. He walked past my car and start walking out of the plaza/parking lot. There are no houses around this area so it was strange to see someone walk off like that, but I had no reason to question anything and went into the store.

Inside there wasn’t anything particularly strange. There were heavy curtains that blocked most of the windows, but they didn’t cover the whole window or anything. I thought this might be strange but just chalked it up to an atmospheric thing. The prices were on the cheaper side (but from what I know they weren’t out of the average range). After I purchased my massage, I got sent to a room and the massage happened. Something I noticed was how there were a few customers who came in from time to time, but they were all male voices. Usually women are the ones who would get massages so I found that strange. In total I think there were 4 people who walked in.

Once that was done I left the parlor and talked to my sister about the experience. She mentioned how massage parlors are commonly used in human trafficking rings and I should be careful. I looked up some articles and I started to get worried.

I also went to look at the reviews of the place and some pictures. A few of the reviews mentioned that this place does sexual services. One of the reviews noted strange noises and another one made fun of the women for doing such a thing and left a one star for it. There was also the names mentioned. Lisa, Amanda, Kelly, and Amy (names were changed) four names were mentioned months apart from each other but none of them were mentioned twice. The pictures also showed that the heavy curtains use to block the WHOLE window so you couldn’t see into it at all.

The possible signs I noticed was:

- The strange guy who left the story

- All the employees were Chinese middle aged women who spoke little English.

- The customers were predominantly male

- The store is difficult to look into from the outside 

- the reviews for mentioned sexual activities 

- there seems to be a high turnout rate

There were a few things that makes me think it is possible I am just overthinking things though. For one, I am Female. The fact they let me in at all seems to be a decent sign. From what I know, usually these kinds of place don’t let women in to avoid having potential witnesses or something. Another thing is that the women had phones and were relatively relaxed looking. Lastly the store is very visible and doesn’t have a backdoor entrance or a buzz in system.

Still I am not at ease about this or anything. I have decided I will try to call in a private investigator and see if I can get more information before I act. I don’t want to call in the police since I heard that may make it harder for the women to escape and possibly make things more complicated.",What should I do if I may have accidentally supported a human trafficking situation.,18qw3wx,1703553544.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qw3wx/what_should_i_do_if_i_may_have_accidentally/,

I don’t think it is fair to say that all these Greek marmor statues portraying important Greek citizens had small cocks in real life too.

"Bear with me. Me and this guy are in a similar friend group so every other week we see each other. I was told by our friends that he likes me and I declined it and I did mean it at the time.

Now I'm so unsure. He is not my usual type at all. Like every attribute he has is the opposite of my usual type.
However the last times we've hung out in the group we've always talked and spent time with each other and I enjoyed our conversation every time and it's fun.
I’m always smiling around him and I enjoy talking to him so much. 

However everyone our Friend group seems to be so invested in this between us that I feel like I can't even breathe around him without someone asking me if there's something going on. Plus the fact that I do know that he's interested in me, so I really don't want to hurt him
So now I'm in this dilemma that I can't figure out if I actually like him or could like him bc im scared of doing something wrong or hurt him. 
And because he's not my usual type I just don't know if maybe I'm just trying to convince myself that I like him bc it's just nice to be treated nice and to be liked.

But also I don't know how to figure it out bc my way would be to just get to know him but bc I know that he likes me I can't do it bc if I figure out I don't like him I'll just hurt him twice be I'll give him hope and then reject him AGAIN
and bc all of our friends are invested it's even harder bc everyone feels entitled to know what's going on and I'm scared of being judged if I hurt him bc theyll think I'll played him


EDIT: To clear something up about the rejection part - 
I didn't reject him in a classical sense. I think it was like the second time we saw each other in our group and a mutual friend came up to me telling me that the guy liked me - (I felt really overwhelmed by that info bc 1. We didn't know each other really and 2. It felt weird that the mutual friend kept pushing me about it while the guy didn't talk to me about it)
So I told the mutual friend that I'm not interested
(I didn't know him at the time and he's not my usual type so I just didn't think about him in a romantic way but also bc our friend was really pushy so I felt pushed in a weird situation) and that I thought it was none of his business and until the guy comes up to me directly I don't want to talk about it bc it is a matter between the two of us. And if he wants to get to know me he should come up to me directly However our mutual friend disagreed and went to tell the guy that I'm not interested

Alternatively if you wanna read some random persons thoughts and feelings go right ahead. Also most things in this post have been floating around I'm my head for years.

Hi, so I'm doing this on a throwaway account because of how deep this is and I just wanna preface this post by saying that this is not a cry for help but rather a lot of thoughts all put into one post/question. I'm hoping this post flies under the radar a little bit.

So I'm 23, I'm gay, I'm a white British male who is living in a very small flat and just about getting by. I'm 5'11 with an average-ish body, except my torso has long had a dad bod, which I'm completely fine with! I always look at it with the mentality of ""if I can do most things everyone else can and I don't have any negative health issues, why does it matter if I'm not skinny or jacked"". I like my body how it is and I love myself, I'm confident, I can be outgoing and kind and loving, whilst still sometimes being selfish and indulgent and self-loving at times.

I suffer with depression, I have done since I was around 12. I've never gone to the doctors or had this diagnosed or even gone to a therapist, mostly because by the time I fully understood what was happening when I was around 17 i already had this mindset of 'I've beat it once and I will beat it every time', I even fully comprehend and am at peace with a lot of the events that caused this. But I know it's depression, after living it with this long and learning as much as I can about it I can say for certain that I've struggled with it frequently over these last 11 years. I've had bad moments and even life threatening moments but when I'm not depressed I know I'll always beat it.

I'm also pretty sure I'm on the autism spectrum and by quite a bit. Once again I've never gone to the doctors about it, because learning in my 20's was more of just an explanation and closure. Since I haven't had it diagnosed I always make sure people know that I'm not 100% on this and I never put it on any legal documents and such. But after doing Psychology in University, various tests online and multiple people telling me I've come to the conclusion. To be honest I don't care about getting it diagnosed, it would just be another label that I don't care about.

We finally come to my burning question. ***

Basically I wanted to know if anyone else thought ""is there anything more"". I also want to quickly add I'm very grounded and aware of what's real or not. I daydream a lot, on these daydreams I live completely other lives sometimes, being a hero, being out in the stars or just having a loving partner or family. But is there anything more out there? Is there actually a possibility of life after death, a thing we don't know for certain I know. What if somewhere magic was real or that people had powers of sorts. Is there actually a higher power or have we humans just made up so many concepts like time and space and gods and made everything to complicated and fabricated. Is there even such a thing as true happiness ( I just want to add, I'm content in life even if it may not seem like it, could be better, could be worse). How are any of us actually truly supposed to understand anything, let alone the meaning of life. At the moment life just seems to be a wave that we ride until it washes onto the shore and there's no more wave. I'm happy just riding the wave, some part of me just wishes it was a bigger wave or a magical wave.

For about 3 or 4 years there was this one recurring daydream, I was some sort of cosmic being around before the Big Bang. One night I went to sleep and awoke in an empty world and after wandering around I woke up to find out I'd been gone days. Basically let out something else the same as me that wanted to just destroy, so I trained with the people who themselves were the dream prison and stopped him. The story continues from there over the course of years. I keep telling myself one day I'll write it into a book.

That's the end of me projecting my thoughts onto the Internet of strangers. 

tl:dr: Is there anything more out there, what am I really doing here?

Is there anything purchasable, such as meteorite or some other solid space substance, that I can just straight up buy?

My other half and I have a sentimental connection to the big old floating mega-marble just for various reasons, and I’d like to be able to do something sentimental with the ring when I pop the question. 

Obviously with this being the case it only would need to buy a tiny quantity, although I’m happy to look at whatever size/shape things come in, guess I can’t be fussy with space rock. I haven’t got a plan of how to get this stuff into a ring, I’d rather figure that out if I know it would be feasible to even source something like that that I can say with confidence is at least linked to Jupiter.

"I’ve (F37) been seeing my boyfriend (M38) for a year and a half now. He goes out drinking a lot with friends but we don’t do it often as a couple. We went out a couple of nights ago. He was lovely at the start of the night but by the end I was shocked by his behaviour. He has admitted he doesn’t know when to stop and he has a bit of an issue. 

We were sat upstairs in the bar sharing a table with a couple and two girls. He was trying to speak to all of them throughout the night but whenever I went away and came back he was sat near the two girls. He’d move back over to me when I came back. 

As the night went on he was just getting up and going over to this young brunette girl. Talking to her and putting his arm round her. He was also kissing other random people including a guy. He said to me I offered to buy the girls a drink, I asked why, they didn’t seem interested in talking to him anyway. He said because I’m a nice guy. When this behaviour carried on and he started calling her babe I started to feel really annoyed and I stopped talking to him. We left and asked me what’s up and I was too angry to speak to him. He was too drunk to talk to and I was shocked by his behaviour. He started angrily shouting at me saying a real women would have said something. Why the hell didn’t you say something. 

The next day he says he couldn’t remember anything and he blacked out. I told him what had happened and he apologised. He said why didn’t you say something to me. I told him I’m not here to tell you how to behave. He said sorry I was just drunk it’s not the end of the world. 

Do you think he was deliberately testing me? Was he after a reaction? The next day he was very affectionate but also having little digs about my appearance. Pointing out little flaws all day.

I’m really confused by his behaviour lately and I felt so disrespected. Should I walk away?

I’ve seen several posts about this but I just wanted to get a general consensus on people’s thoughts and practices. By graze or grazing I mean when you go to a store and grab a drink or snack and eat it throughout the store and then ring it up at the end (or at least I hope so). As someone who worked as a cashier at Walmart I saw it often but mainly with older men and people with kids. Which I definitely understand bc anything to get some silence especially in public is worth the effort. I also never really had any problem with it. Like unless it is something is rung up by weight like produce then who cares as long as you pay. But then on the customer side I’m always too scared to do it. My grandfather always used to do it with me but like I just feel like I’ll get yelled at or something.

So I have a slightly famous friend, she and I have known each other for years, way before she got any sort of fame. 

Recently I met a guy and he started talking and eventually went on a couple of dates. After the 3rd date I really felt a spark. I opened up more to him. I let him know about my friend. He acted as if he had never heard of her. He asked a few questions about her and then said maybe I can introduce them one day. And we quickly moved on. 

Later I found out that he has been following her on instagram and twitter for years. And his old tweets show he used to engage with her on twitter called her beautiful and such things. (she never responded). 

This has made me feel some type of way. I really liked him but it now feels like he figured out who I was and found a way to meet me. He approached me at a bar by the way.

I'm not a writer, but my best friend lost her best friend, and she's heartbroken that they can't share Christmas together. I want to help or give her something that might, but I don't know. Is this like... very weird or messed up though? The story generated is below:

""From my place beyond the stars, I watch over Rebecca, my dearest human. My name is Art, a dog whose heart forever beats in sync with hers, even now as I tread the ethereal realms. Christmas nears, and I sense the heaviness in her heart, the echo of her longing for my presence.

As she packs her bags, preparing for a Christmas unlike any we shared, I hover close, unseen but ever-present. Her whisper, soft and laden with memories, reaches me: ""I miss you, Art. I wish you were here."" Oh, how I wish to nuzzle her hand, to offer the comfort that only a loyal dog can. Yet, I trust in the love we nurtured, a love that transcends the physical, residing deep in her heart.

The house, now quiet without our shared laughter and play, stands as a monument to our love. In my spirit form, I stroll through the memories – our games in the yard, our peaceful moments on the couch, our adventures that seemed to stretch endlessly under the open sky. Each memory, a testament to the love and care Rebecca showered upon me. In these recollections, I find solace, knowing that our bond is not tethered by the need for physical closeness.

On Christmas morning, as Rebecca sits by the fireplace, the flickering flames casting a soft glow on her face, I feel an ache to comfort her. In that silent room, I envelop her in my unseen embrace, a gentle, soothing presence. I watch as a subtle warmth spreads over her, a faint smile appearing on her lips. ""I feel you, Art,"" she whispers, her words a balm to my ethereal heart. It's a silent, sacred exchange, a moment where our souls touch across realms.

Throughout the day, I remain by her side, unseen yet palpably present, sending waves of love and comfort. I want her to feel our unbreakable bond, to know that I am there, in every gentle breeze, in every warm ray of sunlight – an eternal companion, unwavering in my devotion.As night falls and Jessica drifts into sleep, I lay my head across her arm, just as I always did. In her dreams, I dance, a joyful spirit reliving our happiest moments. I whisper into her slumbering mind, a promise that transcends time and space – my love is forever hers, an endless embrace from a friend who walks the starlit path, but never truly leaves.""",Would an AI generated short story be a horrible thing to send to someone who is grieving?,18qph86,1703533310.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qph86/would_an_ai_generated_short_story_be_a_horrible/,

"AFAIK, one of the criteria for defining who belongs to Jewish community is that the person needs to be born from a Jewish woman, who needs to have a Jewish mother and so on.

I am not Jewish and neither were my grandmother or great-grandmother, and I don't know of any matrilineal ancestor beyond. But I am from a region populated by Portuguese and Spanish immigrants, so I started to wonder if eventually I would meet a Sephardic great-great-great-(...)-grandmother in a matrilineal lineage.

Extrapolating this digression, considering the Jewish diaspora that dates back to two millennia across Europe, could this apply to every person of European descent?

I know that every person of European descent has any arbitrary common ancestor from long, long ago (e.g., everybody has Charlemagne as their ancestor), so every person of European descent has likely many Jewish ancestors. Nonetheless, in order to be Jewish by this criterion, the rules are more strict, as there should be an unbroken sequence of women that have a Jewish woman ancestor.

Is it possible to create or gain the donation of a brain and keep it alive independently of a body? We know all which is necessary to keep a brain alive and have the technology to do so. 

Would it be possible to replicate the living conditions necessary to keep it alive while researching its activity? Could we introduce ways of mental stimuli for the brain for it to think it has a body and research how it reacts?

When I say ‘create’ I mean genetic replication (I kno it’s not that simple but will we have the science one day to do so even if we’re all not here) or it be given as a donation of a dying donor.

for my entire life my parents have stressed the importance of school and getting a good job in the future (as most asian parents do) and have put a lot of pressure on me to get perfect grades, test scores, etc, as I need scholarships in order to be able to afford to go to college, and they want me to go to a good school (so thats even harder ;-;) (we’re middle class so i think we live pretty comfortably, but my parents definitely dont make enough to support me through college and i probably wont get much financial aid) even with this, they wont let me get a job bc they say they i should be fully focused on school (so i RLLY need a scholarship) 

bc of all this (since middle school and pandemic) my mental health has been gradually decreasing and so have my grades (they’re still ok (mostly Bs right now but ive gotten all As and one B the previous 2 years of hs) relatively speaking, but i go to a super competitive public school and my parents basically think a B is not good and anything below that is failing)

The only problem is, is that my crush I sn’t in my classes, and I don’t have any mutual links to meet her. I could always DM her but it’s almost weird? I see her in the halls maybe once a week but that’s just to tough to wait it out and find a perfect time, and she’s with her friends mostly. 

Also for the last part this is a little obvious, it’s a little scary lmao. Like asking someone, and like even though I wouldn’t care really about a no, it’s that I’m pretty popular and she is too so like half the school would know if she talked about it, and like it would be embarrassing to walk past her in the halls. 

We used to be in classes together and she would stare a lot at me I could see it by the corner of my eye and stuff. I think she is so pretty, and she is really nice to her friends, she is also religious and I am too, so I think that is very nice. Unfortunately back then I never talked to her because I really wasn’t that interested in girls, now I regret it though cause I had a few chances. 

I would love to get to know her more and maybe start dating her maybe later down the road.

"I'm concerned about either seeming obsessed, or seeming low effort/immature.

So we had a separate Christmas 2 days before Christmas. I gave her 4 novelty gifts which she loved.

We had her family Christmas on Christmas Day. I gave her another novelty gift that she was, uncertain about, it seems like she was fake-happy with it, but it's hard to tell. My guess is it either took away from the energy of the previous gifts. Or it felt obsessed. Can't tell.

She has a birthday in a few days as well, but she's traveling with her parents (she's an only child and been very close with her parents) on her actual birthday, and celebrating her birthday socially next year. The january party will probably have more gifts from her coworkers. 

So I'm seeing her tomorrow. For a nonchalant hang out at home, because we've had so much stuff going on and no private time.

So, given that I already gave her a lot of Christmas gifts, that seemed to decline in how she viewed them. I was feeling uncertain. I'm thinking I'd give her a birthday card with a gift card to a place she absolutely uses (100% chance, but just an everyday thing), and tell her to wait to open it. I'd joke like ""Kinda feels like the 12 days of Christmas"" and kiss her forehead so it doesn't seem too sarcastic. I'd also get a box of kitchen items that I know she has a shortage of, that should be about $25 dollars.

I don't want it to be like ""he didn't get me a birthday gift"" basically, but I'm also starting to seem obsessed and buying her affection with gifts.

"If this is the wrong sub for this then my deepest apologies 

So I M20 have been very lonely for a long time. When I was 16 in school I had always thought I had friends but in reality they all just sort of put up with me and everyone hung out with eachother when I wasn’t around and I was unaware. The word people used to use for me was s*ast*c if you can decipher that, and I thought it was all in good fun as young guys do but it turns out they really meant it. Then in school one day I hurt 2 people at lunch and they all really let me know what they thought of me etc. they weren’t outright mean but they were very honest and I realised a lot then about what kind of person I was. For the next 3 years of school I mostly tried to stay away from people and did things like eat lunch alone in the toilets and avoid big nights out. I was always afraid of being friends with anyone incase I did the same things to them or they weren’t really my friend and I just wouldn’t be able to tell. When I was 16 about to turn 17 I even tried to take my own life but failed which is a whole other story.
Since I’ve gotten to college the only solid social connection I’ve made is my girlfriend f21 and even then I still question whether she really likes me or if she is just sticking around for the time being even though she actively makes an effort to show that I can trust her I just find it difficult because I don’t understand why she is around me.
The problem that I need help with comes in the fact that for these last few years the only way I have found to keep myself in check is to adamantly tell myself that I should be alone and that making friends would make me comfortable and when I get comfortable i become the version of me I don’t like. My girlfriend knows all of this and actively tried to boost my self esteem but I can’t let myself believe what she sais and I refuse to tell her more of how I feel because she has her own struggles and I feel that I would be rude to put mine on her too even though she actively wants to help. She has suggested therapy but I won’t let myself go to it because of the fact that I believe I should feel how I feel and deserve it. Though now that it has come to Christmas she has been out with her friends a lot and I have spent most of my time at home doing nothing as I have no one to do anything with when she’s gone home to her family for the holidays and I feel that my reluctance to get help and my lack of social life might be upsetting her and potentially be harming our relationship because she might feel that me refusing to better myself is a bad sign for the future. She hasn’t said this but I feel like she thinks it and I don’t really know what to do as I’m backed into a corner with the only ways out being things that terrify me so what do you guys think I should do, thankyou",Can someone just give me a tad of advice because I’m a bit lost in lifeand need help,18rcqy1,1703610454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rcqy1/can_someone_just_give_me_a_tad_of_advice_because/,
"Ever since I can remember I have always been torn on what I want to wear and who I want to be. I know it may sound rather silly but I genuinely struggle with this everyday. I often see women who are girly, with pink nails and put together outfits then, I see girls who are more on the darker side. For me I have been straight down the middle. 
 I admire women who are strong in who they are and have discovered their personal, unique look. 
For me I am never sure what I want to be and don’t know how to express myself. 
I think these certain aesthetics have been pushed on social media and it almost feels like I have to pick a side. I just truly want to discover what’s meant for me and be comfortable in my own skin. It all seems so black and white to me.

"Pardon the inappropriate question. I am not trying to shame anyone for their interests, but I have always been very confused and would love to know if I am alone in this.

I am a bisexual cisgendered male in my late 20s, with a preference for women. I am ***not*** asexual by any means, nor am I homosexual.

However, I find myself the outlier on the internet. The very, very mainstream things make me disgusted, and I am not sure what the appeal is.

Examples:

\-Vaginas in general. I find them very unappealing to look at, but a lot of people seem to enjoy how they look, and I do not understand that. I find them genuinely very gross.

\-Buttholes. There's even a subreddit for ""buttholes behind thongs,"" and anything related to buttholes can actually ruin my arousal entirely.

\-Squirting. It's so common but I cannot understand why.

\-Creampie close-ups. I can appreciate climaxing inside someone, but I very often see people zoom in on it, and it makes me very grossed out.

\-Anal. Anything related to butthole play makes me very uncomfortable. Feces are a turn-off.

I enjoy female and male bodies alike, and I find them sexually attractive, but these things in particular have always puzzled me. I cannot feel anything but disgust for them.

It usually happens about once every year or two years - a holiday or a life event - but it’s infrequent. Usually, for a holiday (like Christmas celebrations this week), we’ll spend time with one family and then another. We don’t integrate them often.

They’re quite different people so I don’t think they’d be great friends anyway, but I also think sometimes it’s good to keep things to tight families so we can focus on that unique dynamic and speak more freely in that situation. My wife’s parents are also divorced, so I think she feels a desire to integrate them more since they are more frequently alone for certain things.

We also don’t have kids (yet) so that would probably be a factor that encouraged it more.

We are loyal and loving to each other and love sex together, tbh the best we've ever had. But the thought is what counts. And plus point, it does occasionally lead to some very exciting times and role play. 

I get you can openly say, ""I like butts, or heels, etc."" You can't really openly say, ""I/we fantasize about my wife sleeping with a black bull. Or I think about my wife going out for drinks/date with a black coworker or boss.."" LOL

Obviously, in my fantasy, it's all consensual for our excitement and pleasure. As well as purely sexual, nothing more. 

If you do, do you know what caused your kink?

I feel like I’m a pretty attractive woman. I get hit on a lot, in person, online. I get hit on when I’m at the store or even getting gas and don’t even look my best. 

I’m a college student and I’m graduating a year early, I was already accepted into my graduate program. I have job, car, and internship. My hygiene is also really good. I know this may not be relevant, but I’m trying to figure out if there is something physically hindering my dating. 

Most of my friends would say I’m funny and usually when guys compliment me after getting to know me they usually call me funny, smart/intelligent, and/or interesting.

I say all this, because I get a lot of attention from men and I don’t think I’m single because I’m not physically attractive or hard to be around…I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong.

I’m usually not attracted to the guys that approach me which lowkey makes me wonder if maybe my standards are too high and that I should give them a chance. 

I have been on dates and talked to guys, but it never gets anywhere. A guy will verbally express that he likes me, but more often than not I will find out he was entertaining other women in a sexual way. For more context, I’m a virgin. I’m very open about this and will usually tell guys “I’m not interested in casual sex  and will only have sex in a committed relationship” or things along that line. I say this so that they don’t try to intiate or try anything when we first start talking/dating.

*edit: I don’t bring up the virginity randomly, but if sex comes up in convo i’ll make it known. Often times they don’t believe i’m a virgin and claim I don’t look like one, which is also weird.*

I’m not anti-sex or waiting for marriage, i’m just personally anti casual sex and hookups. There have been situations where I know the guy would have stayed if I had sex with him. 

Guys will leave and go have sex with other girls and then come back and complain they miss my company (which never fails to make me feel shitty). I have had guys tell me they like me, but then the next day I found out they trying to arrange hook ups with other women… It’s strange.

He compares this to 'domesticating' (like livestock) and 'fully civilizing' humanity,by in his view 'breeding out' people's 'lowest instincts'. To him,all of this is necessary for the end goal of 'absolute and undisrupted order and peace'. His idea of 'peace' is 'everyone blindly doing exactly what they are told'.

"While this happened back in the elementary to high school years, I will never forget this insanity. I was a very small and very smart nerdy boy. That will likely be very important.  


  
Strangely, the kids near me would constantly be taking my things without my permission. I have never ever taken their things without their permission. I always try to be nice and respectful kid.  


  
One day in 7th grade Spanish class, I made the mistake of using the bathroom. When I came back, I quickly noticed that my pencil case is missing. I noticed that my classmate is looking at me. I asked if he took it. He said no. Then, I spent the rest of class looking for my pencil case around the class like a dumbass. My teacher even asked what I was searched for. When I gave up, I noticed that my classmate is looking at me again. I ask him if he saw anyone near my desk. He said no again. I continued to search, but the bell rings. The teacher says the class will not leave until I get my pencil case back. That is when that dumbass classmate gives it to me, but says something like ""Fine. Here."" What the fuck was the point of that? We definitely are not friends. We just talk to each other because we sit near each other in a few classes. He ended up stealing the money that was inside the pencil case.  


  
Another time was in 12th grade. I made the mistake of using the bathroom before class began. When I come back, my backpack is completely gone. I was so confused that I thought I left it in my previous class until I notice that it is hidden under the desk of the kid in front of me?!? When I took it back, he literally says,""BUDDY."" We have never ever spoken before. We only spoke a few times after this.  


  
Yet another time was in 11th grade. I was using my phone to do my hw. The guy in front of me randomly turns around to take my phone. It slips out his hand and flies a few feet across the room. I was shocked, but he then takes it from the floor and gives it back to me. He took my phone many times from me. I have never even touched his phone. Thankfully, it had a case.

"When I started smoking weed I thought Ill be glued to the couch but the opposite happened.

I remember I was playing a match in some competitive game and I was having a bad performance day and those really really suck so thought ""fuck it might as well smoke it up"" after the match. 5 minutes later I find another match and I am suddenly playing 10x better than before and it feels like a veil has been lifted off my mind.

I thought it was some kind of fluke so I tried recreating a similar scenario, I was playing an instrument and felt like my hands werent listening to me and I wasnt able to play stuff Id consider easy. I was having another bad performance day (this time a different activity but it doesnt matter), 5 minutes after smoking some weed I can suddenly play even better than usual. This is pretty consistent and feels like a cheat code.

Im able to go into a deeper state of focus and for longer, my body feels more responsive anddoing things like chores becomes much easier.

I have very mixed feelings about this, on the one hand I finally found a way for me to perform more consistently on a high level at some things but if I dont have weed I cant do anything and I hate it. I feel like something is wrong with me.

I thought it might have to do something with the fact that I was diagnosed with ADHD and maybe weed made my mind slower and more relaxed but after reading other peoples accounts who have ADHD and smoked weed, some people hate it and some people swear by it. Idk what to think but my goal is to be able to control my body and mind better while sober but tbh after 22 years of living I doubt I can do that.

"I know the title is a bit rough but let me explain myself. 

As a guy I’ve always wondered when my partner is in one of her moods, is it something that they are aware of and can’t control it? I know for me personally if I’m ever in a bad mood I will straight up tell some one something like “hey I’m just feeling alittle off right now, it’s not you it’s me. I’m not mad at you or anything” and I definitely don’t get snappy to people around me. So I’m 100% aware of my emotional state and how it could potentially affect others. And that’s if I’m in a bad mood, they are typically rare.

Anyway my issue is, assuming you actually didn’t do anything wrong, and I mean truly you know for sure you didn’t do anything to put her in this mood. 

How do you handle the situation and not want to blow up on them when she’s being incredibly rude to you? 

I try to do the right thing like hug them and ask if everything’s okay but she will always say nothings wrong but yet be super “bitchy” with me and give me attitude.

I just wish she (and honestly a lot of woman) could be straight forward with their feelings rather than making guys play 20 questions.

I’m the sort of person where if you start to give me attitude I don’t play into it and will walk away. Because I refuse to waste my time with that bullshit. But lately I’ve tried to change my ways of thinking and actually go along with her and that doesn’t seem to work either. 

Sometimes I feel like it’s damned if you do damned if you don’t. If you comfort them they get annoyed, if you give them space they think you don’t care and are an asshole. 😂😂😂

How do you deal with this? Do you just roll with the punches and wait it out until she’s back to normal?  I’ve only ever dated 2 woman.

"Me f18 and my (ex) boyfriend m19 have been dating for around 9 months at this time and we have had sex multiple times and yeh it was okay but after talking to some of my girlfriends about this they asked why I didn't break up with him sooner.

I have talked about this before on this chat about that my bf won't go down on me so this is kind if an update / plea for help 

So.. at this start of our relationship I was 17 and he was 18 being the ages we were sex was one of the first things we did when home alone and being my first time I kind of knew there was a low chance of me cumming first time which I didn't but he did which I understood being that I sucked him off for a while before he inserted it. During are relationship we did it alot more times but he never went down on me like I did for him and I did question him about it and his short answer was that he thought it was gross but I just brushed it off but I did become needy for someone to touch me down there so in the end I just used my vibrator to give me the orgasm I needed after he had cum and was cleaning up it become the normal thing to do. I did suggest that I use my vibrator while he fucked me but he shut that down without giving a reason just that he didn't want to so I didn't. 
Over time I was getting a little jealous towards my friends when they would talk about how much there bfs would go down on them (yes that is what girls talk about) so yeh. 

I did end up breaking up with him and this is where I might be a bitch as I did use this as one of the reasons for our breakup and he did shut me down saying that it isn't his fault he found it gross but yeh. I just came on hear to vent really and to really get an answer about if I'm a bitch or not because my friends say I'm not but I am in to minds about it.

I got an internship, so I was not stressed out about that anymore. He surprisingly said that he didn't apply to anything and has no interest. He just wants to graduate to get a full-time role.

"So my kitten was bought from the neighborhood a while ago. I don’t know his exact age but under a year definitely. He’s a super sweet, cuddly dude but recently he started doing this weird thing. So he’ll start meowing at me. He’ll then climb into my lap, still purring and happy. He’ll meow pretty annoyed if I try to pet him and he’ll give me like warning bites but he’s cool if I don’t move. But then he’ll grab my forearm with his front two paws like a hug. The back two paws will be stepping over and over again like he’s trying to keep his balance, which makes sense cause I don’t have particularly big arms.

When he does this, he pins down my forearm, laying on it with his torso parallel to my forearm. It seems like when he does it, he really prefers to lay parallel to my arm, pinning it down and does not like me to move. I don’t think my cat is sick or anything, he’s a really happy boy.

"Ok I just learned about dye packs. Now I’m curious about how bank robbery would work if dye packs are involved.

As far as I understand, in case of robberies, the bank cashiers would slip the fake bundles of cash with dye packs inside into the bag, and after a certain amount of time, or if they pull on the money of the pack, or when the robbers get out of the bank (or far enough), the proximity censor will deploy the pack, render the whole bag of money unusable.

But then how would robbers pull the million-dollar robberies? Was that because with such a large amount of money, the cashiers would not put the dye packs in? Or the robbers were more professional and would detect the packs?

I read somewhere that bank robberies are not as common anymore. I would imagine it’s because most people use cards nowadays so banks don’t have as much cash on hand, but do dye packs have a role in this too?

Thank you and have a nice day.

"This was back in 2008-2010. She was my first crush and she didn’t give a shit about me. For context, I am good-looking, not tall, and have had few relationships. She used to make fun of me for being 5’8 (although the avg. height in India where I was born isn’t the same as in the US). I immigrated to the US in 2012, have a great family, love my wife and daughter, earn a solid salary, which is 4x the median in the US, and I am blessed and privileged to be in the position I am in today. No part of me wants any part of her. 

I dream about her maybe two times a month, and in most dreams, she is either happily talking with me, going on a vacation, or just eating in a restaurant, none of which was remotely possible in the real world. In the real world, she should make fun of me, tell me that I was being cheesy with my poems, and think I embarrassed her. This is is not affecting me but I want to remove her existence from my mental space.

"First time making a post so bear with me

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little backstory, I am a m(30) and have been out of a relationship that I ended for 3 years now. Since then, I have been casually dating (I always let this be known up front about my intentions) because I do not plan to live where I am now for long and many women I have dated nearby aren't willing to relocate on average or I tend to be far more adventurous than they are. I am pretty adventurous, I have lived in other countries, visited more than 10, I have an active lifestyle which keeps me fit, I volunteer, I travel often, and my week can range from binging some books or skydiving. I don't like the flex money, but I make around 50% more than the median household income where I live so fortunately I don't have an issue affording to date.

  
  
I live and work in a town that is a college town and multiple surrounding towns are college towns as well, so the party hard and often mindsets and/or the recreational drug use mindsets are extremely common even amongst crowds my age. I am not saying that lifestyle is bad, it just is not for me. This tends to lead to slim pickings so I have made dating apps as well as approach women in public when I'm not working. Getting matches on the dating apps aren't difficult for me, but finding someone who I like physically and has a similar mindset is few and far in between. I approach in public as well, dating apps are just a passive way to search, I'm fine with rejection in person.

  
  
\*\*Now to the heart of this post lol (remember I said bear with me)\*\*. Constant partying and any current recreational drug use are dealbreakers for me to take someone seriously (hence the casual only for so long). The crowd that tends to have a similar mindset at least where I live are the single mothers. I get an excessive number of matches from single mothers on dating apps and I have flat out been approached by a few.

  
  
I want to have children but I am in no rush. I previously tried to date three women over the last 2 years that were single mothers and they were short lived. One was not over the child's dad, another had zero control of her son, and the third was always busy so we would go sometimes 6-7 days without seeing each other which is not enough for me at all. This happened because we worked opposite schedules and for 5 months, I was willing to spend my only day off with her and her child after working 6 days of 10–12-hour shifts, going to the gym afterwards, and cooking before I would shower and sleep. I was exhausted in every sense, but I still went to pick pumpkins, to the zoo, and even some big musical festival in town with her and her kid. I did not get the same energy in reciprocation, honestly, I got a ton of ""my kid"" excuses because the father was nonexistent. There really was no effort to accommodate me at all. After a while I was tired of it, I understand putting the child first but man that was the epitome of being a second-class citizen.

  
  
Also parenting styles are a big thing too especially when it comes to discipline and I have been in a situation where I respectfully yet firmly verbally corrected the child for jumping on my couch (no swear words, no derogatory terms, etc) and I received an ear full from the mom even though she allowed the behavior..  
  
  
  
Now there's a very sweet divorced woman with kids that coparents who shows interest in being with me. We have been talking for a short time now and I let it be known that I am unsure of the situation up front. They have a split custody system for the kids so a week at the dad's then a week with her and the holidays are alternated. 80% of me wants to just decline based on my past experiences, but that may be a bit unfair which is why I am here today. I have had no problems with her as of now, but things are still early on. The thought of the custody reminds me of when I didn't see one of the other women for 6-7 days and it felt as if I was part-time dating and honestly, I'm huge on physical touch. I know that the final answer is my choice to make, but I would like to get honest and nonbiased feedback on if dating a single parent is worth it for someone who doesn't have children yet and especially someone with a lifestyle like mine?

  
  
TLDR; Single m(30), drug free, active and adventurous only seems to find single mothers in the area that have some of the same interests as me. Have not had any good experiences dating single moms though, so is this a sign that this is not good for someone with my lifestyle? Or have I just gotten terrible picks?",Is dating a single parent before you have children of your own worth it?,18r63l8,1703589754.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18r63l8/is_dating_a_single_parent_before_you_have/,

I want to move across the country and start a whole new life, cutting most of the people out of my life here where I am completely. (Probably would have to be a more temperature-moderate state and have good cooling and heating systems though haha.)

But obviously, housing is expensive, rent prices are crazy. I don't want to just live paycheck to paycheck with most of my income going to rent.

I'm talking 60+ hours a week, 2 or 3 different jobs if necessary. All day every day if necessary. Think about renting your own, nice place anyway. You'd be at work so much you wouldn't even have time to enjoy your ampartment or place you're renting, and you still have to pay 1500-2000 per month! 

I can shower at the gym. I can park in different Walmart parking lots overnight ( lots of people do this ). I can invest more in better security, not an issue. I can see myself having a pretty good setup in there. I'd be completely happy with just my phone, laptop, headphones, and a few other essentials.
