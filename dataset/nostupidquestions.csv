"So I have a friend and we normally if not every day, pretty frequently. I sent him a DM on Messenger last night but the delivery status is still sitting on 'Sent' (not delivered or seen). I'm not blocked and so I thought I might be restricted, but I can still see his profile picture and his profile as usual. I can still see his private posts (the ones tagged ""John's friends"")- but it's just unusual that he hasn't been on. It's very unlike him to not be around/respond to any of his messages for more than 24 hours. 

He's an online friend so it's not like I can check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know his number so I can't call. It's the holidays and he may just not be around, he's probably with family and just hasn't been online. Possibly traveling. But I just worry that one day he's going to block me or restrict me or something for no reason. He's not a jerk and I haven't done anything wrong, that I know of. I just sometimes feel like I bug him or chat too much, but I don't know for sure what he thinks, so I worry he might just stop responding to me some day. I'm just hoping it's not now.

"I know that there is a mathematical answer here and maybe this is ELI5 but if there’s a rectangle with sides a and b, then to traverse from one corner to another along the edges you will travel a+b distance. Now, if you split the sides into a zigzag so you traverse 1/2a + 1/2b + 1/2a + 1/2b then you will still travel a+b. Then if you make the zigzag finer and finer you will still be traveling a+b. At some point, the very fine zigzagging looks like a diagonal but it’s still a+b. At what point does it become sqrt(a*a + b*b)?  I know it’s something to do with infinity.

"I'm a 23 year old woman who has no support system, so I'm posting this here because I can't seem to find an answer to this. I know this isn't a professional sub, but im more so just searching for some possible perspective.  

I have CPTSD and I suspect thre may be schizophrenia.  I have experianced Visual, auditory and tactical hallucinations since I was a child. 
Back then, it was mainly just tactical accompanied by paranoid beleifs.

 (Such as feeling a hand rest on me every night in bed, turning to see no one there. And being so convinced people were able to hear my thoughts that i learned to turn them off) 
The rest peaked when I reached 19. 

I have had auditory voices (at 19)  that subconsciously made me act out for them, but I *knew* that it was a voice coming from within my own brain...opposed to how others deem it as God or something sentient. 

Our identities did get blurry and mixed up and I wasn't sure why I changed my name tags at work to his name, but regardedless i knew something was wrong. This lasted for 3 weeks. (I did call my parents and tell them, but no one has ever thought to get me help)  


Anyway, my question is this: 

What do you think causes two people to both experiance hallucinations, but one is not aware that they are hallucinating, while the other (me) *does* know what is happening? 

I often wonder if my ""self awareness"" means I don't have as big of a problem as I think, or if it is just me coping. 
 
I will be seeking medical opinion when I have the resources to do so, I'm mostly just in need of conversation.

"I never thought I would be in a situation where I needed to contemplate how to address a grown man's farting issues in a public workplace. I want to preface this entire thing with: my coworker just told me that this guy recently mentioned he is slightly autistic. I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue or not.
 
This guy joined our team about a year ago. He is probably about 35-40 yrs old. At first he seemed normal enough. A few months into joining the group, I slowly started having more and more issues with him. He's constantly burping under his breath all the time. His sneezes are the loudest sneezes I've ever heard come from a human, but what makes it bad is he always sneezes directly into his hand or sometimes just into the air (we work in a microbiology lab, so this is especially not good). In general he looks kind of unhygienic and grimy. He's the most socially unaware person I've ever met. But my biggest problem with him by far is his farting.

The first time or two I heard him fart, I thought not much of it because everyone has slip ups. But it kept happening. His cubicle is directly behind my cubicle, so I hear everything. Sorry for the detail but I think it's necessary:  It went from hearing quiet little farts once every few weeks, to hearing them every single day. The loudness and intention of the farts are also increasing. They used to be quiet and almost seemed like they were slipping out/maybe an accident. But at this point they are getting pretty loud, and it's clear they are intentional. I hear him push them out and they are no accident. 

What is driving me nuts is since I am the one who sits closest to his cube, I hear the most out of everyone by far, so I feel like I am going crazy. My coworker has told me that she has heard him fart like once, but again she sits further away from him. He'll do quiet ones all the time when the cube area is full of people, and I think I'm the only one who hears it because of my proximity. But conveniently when it's just me or maybe one or two other people, he farts loudly. Not sure if this is a coincidence or not, but it almost feels like he is becoming more and more comfortable doing it around me or something? One time there was a small meeting with my manager (me, him, the manager, and 1 other person). My manager was talking and he farted over her. There was an awkward silence, no one said anything, and then everyone pretended it never happened. A few weeks later, I was walking directly behind him in the hallway and he let out a big fart.  I was fucking pissed. I think everyone is coming to the realization he is kind of a gross person, but they don't realize the extent of it because they don't sit right next to him. I don't know if I should confront him, wait for someone else to get fed up so they will say something instead, or maybe just get over it?? I'm a passive person and confronting someone is way out of my comfort zone.

There is only one empty cube that would be available for me to move to, but it's directly in front of where I am sitting now. So it would give me a little bit of distance from him, but I don't think it's nearly enough.

The one event I didn’t get sick at, was the one when I wore a mask and didn’t eat anything. 

I take vitamin c every single morning, and I am constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer - especially before eating something.

"So, I've been trying to look into this topic, and I've even posted about it on AskScience but the automod kept refusing it for some reason. I hope someone here can help me out.  


I found two essays called ""Animal Cognition and ""Animal Consciousness"" hosted by the Stanford Department of Philosophy. For me, the TLDR is that it can be mistaken to attribute human-like characteristics to animals (anthropomorphism), and science is traditionally wary not to do that. Recently, however, this seems to change, e.g. ""Kristin Andrews and Brian Huss (2014) coined the term “anthropectomy” to refer to the mistake of denying that an animal has a certain characteristically human capacity when in fact they do have that capacity. They argue that anthropomorphism and anthropectomy are both errors, they both amount to a false depiction of how the world actually is, and so there is no reason to fear one over the other.""

im 19f and currently in the 3rd semester of university, there is this one guy i really wanna meet/ get to know and be friends. the thing is we only have two lectures together every week and we are in the big lecture hall and he sits with his friends, i sit with mine. does anyone have any tips for me on how i could approach him? get to know him? 


for the curious ones who wanna hear all my delusions and roast me for it: 

so im turkish but i was not born or raised in turkey but in the country i live in rn. i love this country and i would say im well adapted but i still try to make as many turkish friends as i can bc we have the same fate and i relate to them better. the guy i wanna be friends with is also turkish, thats why im so desperate to get to know him. 
i noticed him in the first semester and in the second semester we were in the same statistics group (we were about 20 ppl in each group) and it was a coincidence i ended up there with him but i blew my chance to meet him. 
i did see him in other lectures but he was always sitting on the other side of the lecture hall (its divided into three sections). this semester though, what made me somewhat hopeful was that especially in the last few weeks he´s been sitting on the side of lecture hall where i usually sit with my friends. he was sitting either in the row behind me or in front of me and we did make eye contact a few times. 

once i had to call my sister and we were talking on the phone (in turkish) and i was sitting outside of the lecture hall and he was walking by with his friend group and then when i was speaking he suddenly slightly turned around and smiled (?) at me. 

and the very last time i saw him i was sitting alone and he had just entered the hall, he sat on the other side but after some few minutes he changed his place and sat in the row behind me but next to a girl and when i was putting on some hand cream they suddenly started talking about dry hands and hand creams and stuff. 
anyways i just want to be friends with him but when i see him sitting with other girls i feel like i have no chance, like if he wanted to get to know me he would. now we´re in the winter break and after that ill probably see him only twice or three times so any advice/tips yall have is appreciated.

Context:
I bought a pair of $135 hiking boots online and they arrived while I was out. They were gone by the time I got home, so I contacted my landlord and he looked through the security camera footage. I just wanted to know if it was stolen by someone in my apartment building or not (It wasn’t). The landlord was the one who made the police report and gave them my name/number. When they called, I cooperated and described what was in the package. After that, I talked to customer service for the boot company and they sent me a replacement pair right away, so no harm done for me. When the police called back days later, they said the found the guy who did it and asked if I wanted to press charges. Apparently he also stole from another tenant in the building who did decide to press charges. I said no, I didn’t want to press charges, because: 1, theft is not a violent crime and I live in an area where a lot of my neighbors probably aren’t doing well money-wise so the guy was probably someone who needs some extra cash for his family; 2, i got a replacement pair so literally no harm no foul.

Later on, I asked my friend why this equation equals 1 and not .9 repeated. My friend is this super smart genius who is valedictorian and seems to know everything. I’m smart too but my friend is Einstein compared to me. She said that my reasoning was correct (the equation does equal to .9 repeated) but she also said that .9 repeated equals 1. Therefore the equation can equal both. I had no idea how that was even possible considering that .9 repeated is getting infinitely closer to 1 but never reaches it.

"Hi!  
I am a single adult (29M) with private health insurance through my employer. I feel like I would greatly benefit from therapy. It has been recommended to me by my doctor. Because of all these things, I naively assumed that I could get therapy covered by my health insurance.   


However, I discovered quickly, this was not the case. My insurance will not cover psychotherapy until *after* I hit my deductible for the year. My deductible is around $1500. Because I am young and very healthy (physically at least...), I never even get *close* to my deductible for a year. This year, for example, I spent about $500 on healthcare for the whole year.   


I decided to bite the bullet anyway and schedule my first session to see what the final bill came out to. After a few weeks, I got my first bill for $200. This means that, if I wished for weekly therapy appointments, I'd need to be ready to spend $800 dollars/month. That feels insane.   


I certainly would hit my deductible fast... but I still feel like this is a bonkers system, where I need to shell out $1500 dollars within the first few months of the year to even be considered for support.

"I think making it through those gut wrenching tough times makes us the people we are.  It certainly shaped me and changed my perspective on life.  A few years back I had the job of my dreams and an amazing wife.  I also had my first born on the way.   In my spare time I worked out like crazy and even fought in a couple amateur MMA fights.  Life was good!

  
While driving home after signing for my first house I was stopped at an intersection.    I don't remember much after that besides waking up in a heap of twisted metal in someone's front yard.  I was later told I had been hit by a drunk driver. I would end up in the hospital for a couple weeks and endure months of physical therapy.  A place I affectionately called ""The Land of the Misfit Toys"" because all of us had something wrong with us.   I went from being 225lbs of muscle to a very frail and defeated 150lbs.  

   
I spent the next year in more pain than I even knew existed.  I was totally devastated and felt trapped in my own body.   I ended up getting divorced and losing some good friends.  I was totally convinced my life was over.  My doctor told me to prepare for the worst and that I may never be the same.  Fortunately after a couple very miserable years of very hard work and persistence I made it back.  Somehow I managed to get up every day and push myself more and more.  I went from not being able to walk ten steps to finally making it around the block.  I eventually started dating again and made new friends.  I even ended up having new career highlights I never could have imagined. 

   
I'm just curious about what life changing tough times and obstacles people have made it through?   This time of year it's especially good to be thankful not only for what we have in life but with what we have overcome.  Maybe this can help serve as inspiration for others who are dealing with similar circumstances.

"Hi There!

I'm reaching out in the hopes of finding where I can find others who share my interests and geek out. My passions lie in the areas of tech, science, space, and video games, along with web development, game development, digital design, VR, and machine learning. I'm genuinely curious about the world and what it has to offer but in no way a smart person. Admittedly, my memory isn't the greatest unless a topic really grabs my attention. But that's a whole other issue entirely I'm sure.   
  
A big part of my daily life involves immersing myself in the passions I described above and experimenting with new tech ideas. Whenever I stumble upon something exciting, especially technology that could benefit others, I'm eager to share it. However, I often find that my enthusiasm isn't matched by my friends. Whether it's discussing the latest tech or offering advice on purchases, the response tends to be lukewarm.  
  
I'm also keen on learning about other people's hobbies and sharing insights, but it seems to go unnoticed. My challenge is not just finding joy in discovery but also in conveying why these advancements are important, and how they could be beneficial.  
  
I'm not looking for validation but rather, a community where I can share my excitement and explore these topics in depth. It would be great to connect with people as enthusiastic about these areas as I am.  
  
If anyone knows of a community where this kind of passion is shared, or if you have any advice on bridging this gap in understanding and interest, I'd be very grateful to hear from you.

"I (22F) am confused about my recent experience with a coworker (22M). 

There’s a guy at work and we kinda speak but not very often. We’ve just began to get to know each other and I’m crushing hard. 

I’m an intern that’s leaving the city soon and going back to college. His vibe has always been a little bit reserved with me. Today is his last day at work before break and I noticed he was remote so in the afternoon I sent him a text message, and here are the texts word for word:

Me: “Hey &lt;name&gt;, since I’m leaving I just wanted to say I had a good time with you the few times we spent together. Also completely forgot to thank you for insisting on waiting with me after &lt;friend’s&gt; bday dinner. Have a good break! :)”

Him: “Shoot are you leaving rn?”

Me: “Leaving Friday but you mentioned today was your last day lol”

Him: “Oh cool I’m on my way to the office rn, I get to say goodbye in person”

Me: “Oop see u soon then”

Him: “Yup”
Him: “Still loved the text tho” *went back to heart my paragraph*

Me: “Guess I’ll have to repeat it to you in person😔”

He came into work in a bit (he lives walking distance away). He may have come into work just for me maybe? He’s never before walked into work during the second half of the day like that so that’s a first. He also seemed to need something there tho so maybe that’s why?? I’m unsure here but he smiled at me brighter than usual.

At 5pm, I noticed he was caught up in a foosball match and decided he wasn’t as interested as I thought so I left and was waiting for my Uber outside when I saw him walk into the lobby possibly searching for me (I sometimes sit on the couches in the lobby). Saw him leave the building and then got a message -

Him: “I think I missed ya but have a great break and good school year! Hope to one day see you again”

Me: “Sorry didn’t wanna disturb your last foosball match with &lt;insert intern name&gt;. I hope I see you again too!”

Him: “you definitely should’ve but I got you”

Me: “Welp my Uber driver is going in circles so I’m waiting outside if you’re still here”

Him: “double welp, I left when I first texted ya😂”

Me: “Rip”

Him; “it is what it is”

Me: “are you leaving tn?”

Him: “tmrw”

Me: “gotcha, safe travels”

Him “you too when you leave”

"We have a guinea pig, it was part of a pair of guinea pigs that belonged to our two kids. One passed away from old age. 
It’s legally abusive for anyone to have a solo guinea pig where he’s from because they are herd animals and it’s very bad for them to be alone. He has always been strong about that. 
I hVe been trying to find a new home for our remaining guinea pig, and now it’s time to clean her enclosure but we haven’t found a new home for her. 
I’m always the one to clean their enclosure even though they are family pets. I asked for his help and he asked for specific tasks unwanted him to do for it, so I asked if he could remove the old and dirty substrate and dispose of it and then unwound do the rest. 
He complained that I was giving him the worst tasks and that I was the one who wanted guinea pigs to begin with (they belong to our—young- children, and getting them was a family decision). 
But he is trying to influence me to deal with them completely. 
I argued that he’s being unreasonable about it and he’s saying, “okay, fine, I’ll help find an owner for the one we have left, is that good enough for you? Even though it was your decision to get the damned things?”
I feel like he’s manipulating me. Am I crazy? I feel like I’m being gaslit but maybe I’m just imagining it?

"""Father figure"" to 2 teen boys.

English is not my first language might be hard to read sorry) Hi everyone, long story coming but i need guidance in a situation that i think needs context. 5 years ago, i was working as a street worker and i met those 2 boys who got attached to me pretty quick. Turns out those boys were almost my direct neigbours. Their father died when they were 3 years old and their mother was unfit at the time, drinking a lot, etc. So i took care of them a lot in the context of my job but also as a neigbour. I also met their mom and worked with her and got her the help she needed in terms of counceling, social workers, but also just being there for her and her children.  
                                                                                       
When i met the boys they were 11, they are now 15 (im 26).                                                         Ive been seeing them on and off for the past 4-5 years,  i usually bring them climbing since its a passion theyve developped through me. As their only passions back then were smoking pot and stealing. I also play hockey and some other sports with them, i try to make them interested in healthy stuff basically. The thing is they see me as a father figure by now, i constantly tell them i see myself more as a big brother due to my age but they still interact with me as more of a father.                                                                  
    
 There now in foster families and visit their mom here and there. I know the foster families by now and i provide them with information that worries me about the boys from time to time (they confide in me a lot). The problem is since there in good hands i dont feel like they really need me there anymore but they keep coming to me, knocking at my door, texting me to go climbing, calling me when they need guidance, etc. I tried to tell them exactly what i just said wich is that i dont really see myself as an asset in their life anymore but i got a really dramatic reaction from them and they told me                        that they'll still go on with what theyre doing.                                      
                                                                                                                    I honestly dont mind it since ive frankly became kind of attached to them by now, it isnt much of a chore to spend time with them since i mostly do what i already love to do with them. Still i just dont know if this dynamic should go on. I also dont know if just starting ignoring them would be good for them since theyve gone trough so much abandonment in their lifes already. I know its a lot but any feedback would be appreciated since their isnt really a blueprint for this kind of situation 😅 Thanks a lot!","""Father figure"" to 2 boys",18nku4n,1703157847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18nku4n/father_figure_to_2_boys/,

As a child, around 7-8, I remember being pulled out of class with a few other children. We went into a room with adults that I know weren’t teachers at the school and given blank paper and coloured pencils. They played a tape that would tell a story and we had to draw a map based on the story. 

The story would say things like ‘we started in the bottom left of the forest, next to a wooden house with a green roof.’ And then we’d have to draw a wooden house with a green roof in the right place. ‘We walked to the right of the house and found an orange and green tree with birds, we looked at it and then kept walking right.’ So then we’d have to draw the tree to the right of the house etc. 

I remember being pulled out of class to do this at least 2 times, with the same classmates. My parents don’t remember this test. It was in the UK, early 00s.

"Okay, I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

I've read multiple articles that talk about how antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are an issue with people who take antibiotics. However, these articles usually say that the reason for this is that someone does not finish a full course of antibiotics, leaving the strong bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics.

The solution given in many of these articles is to stop prescribing as many antibiotics. While I understand that would also solve the problem, doesn't just finishing your antibiotics also solve this issue?

If I'm prescribed a full course of antibiotics, and I take them all as directed, is there a risk of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria?

I've been seeing a lot of memes (possible dog whistles) of women making fun of this sort of physical maintenance that they do?? Mind you, this isn't the usual thing like taking a bath, brushing ye teeth and cutting your nails typa thing.

It's where you supposedly have to shave your pubes every two weeks, and also you limbs (arms and legs) and it's sort of mandatory for them. And your nails (hands and feet) have to be manicured and pedicured as well, and if you don't do this, you're considered unattractive.

This may not seem a lot to y'all but it has got me questioning things, is this an actual thing or am I just being fucked by the algorithm and it's just a small population that does this or have I just been living a rock?

• Bedsheets washed &amp; changed biweekly

• Bathroom cleaned lightly 1-2x per week, and deep cleaned 1 time per month

• Entire apartment picked up and generally tidied about 3x per week on average

• Laundry done 1-2x per week

• Clean laundry *does* sometimes sit unfolded in a pile for up to 2 weeks

• Trash is a tiny under-sink can that gets taken out at least once a week, usually more. Same for waste paper baskets

• Recycling is a pain in the ass in our building, and so it habitually gets left until it's a giant heap. Easily like 2 months at a stretch

• Vacuuming...is on hiatus (I *know* I know, don't look at me. We have no carpet though, and whenever something obviously dirty happens to the floor, it gets cleaned) lmao this one has me too embarrassed I'm likely gonna delete this shortly 💀

• Doors and windows opened every day, for fresh air

• Dishes are a constant battle. There's just usually a small amount of them waiting, since no dishwasher. They get tackled regularly

• The range is sanitizer every time the sink and countertops are

We’ve been married for almost 5 years, and he used to compliment me all the time (even after gaining a shit ton of weight). Recently lost about 45 lbs and am continuing to lose, yet he hasn’t noticed at all and if anything he’s been less interested in me in general… 

I throw out compliments to him like Halloween candy (he’s a bit insecure but I always always let him know how attractive he is, whether he’s in lazy clothes or feeling like shit, he never goes a day without hearing how attractive he is.) literally the only way I ever receive even the simplest “compliment” is if I verbally judge myself or wear a full face of makeup, and even then it’s always just something like “you look good” or “you look fine”. I spend at least 30 minutes every day trying to find clothes to wear that I think he might like, but does he ever notice or say anything? Not at all. I even put on a lingerie bodysuit and some cute sweats and he didn’t say a word, basically ignored me because he was so busy judging himself in the mirror (of course I remind him of the things I do like about his appearance but he didn’t even smile) and then went to bed. 

There has been VERY minimal affection from him, physically and verbally. What’s even worse is that if I ask what he loves about me/what makes him love me, the only answer he has ever come up with is that I have nice tits and that I gave him a child/family like he’s always wanted… (if he asks that question, I always name off every little thing about him that I love, I mean EVERY thing). 

Y’all he’s even told me my opinion doesn’t mean shit to him…what?? I have never ever said that (even tho I definitely have reasons to feel that way about him considering he likes to jerk off to bitches with bbl’s and tiny waists online and not touch me at all for weeks) and if we do have sex it lasts just long enough for me to finish and then he’s done, cleans himself off and then goes to sleep after saying “sorry I don’t last that long”

"I keep getting feedback from people saying that I shouldn’t be dating if I don’t know what I want. The problem is, I feel like I very clearly can define what I want. I’m not sure where people are getting confused…

I want a real, genuine, deep, relationship with a companion/partner. I don’t want to be a booty call or on someone’s NSA roster. I want a partner. Someone I’d take care of when they’re sick, or drive to work if their car breaks down, or be at a funeral to support them. Someone I’d LOVE. The relationship does not necessarily *have* to be sexual in nature, but it would be nice. (Because of trauma history, I could survive just fine, never having sex again—but I don’t actively avoid it or anything. In other words, physical/sexual attraction is not even in my top 10 of attractions.)

But: 
A. I don’t want a husband. (Long-term committed partner? Yes. Completely monogamous? Not required on his end; I tend to be more monogamous by nature, but don’t expect anyone I’m with to be. I’d prefer something fluid and communication-based.)

B. I don’t want to move in with anyone. (Spend lots of time together at one or the other’s home? Yes, of course, a million times, of course. But I love my space. It’s very important to me. People that I love and trust are invited in whenever they’d like. But it’s *my* safe space.)

C. I don’t want kids. (If he has kids, that’s ok, as long as I’m not expected to be a parent. I love kids, I just don’t want to be a mom. I could possibly imagine myself being a more hands-off step parent, but I don’t want the responsibility of raising anyone.)

I want to go on romantic dates, learn everything there is to know about each other, travel, get excited about each other’s passions, have individual goals that we can celebrate for the other person, share amazing experiences, learn things together…. All of the basic shit that a boyfriend/companion/partner could provide. But I won’t compromise on my A, B, or C.

Am I Asexual? Aromantic? Demisexual? Something else? An asshole? Delusional?Maybe I’m just fked up from all the sexual violence in my past and only *think* I know what I want.

Either way, I’m pushing 30 and have never had a serious, long term relationship. Tons of short term ones. I’m perfectly fine with that being the case; I’m in no rush. But I was hoping for some outside perspective:)

The cooked rice weighs the correct weight…but something seems different from the last batch. Less dense, easier to stir in the pot and there was a very small amount of water that just didn’t seem to soak up. I do remember thinking the cups of water were a little over filled though, the rice might be slightly overcooked from me, and I accidentally didn’t have even heat for part of the cook time. 

Does all the weight from rice come from water? Could I have only put one cup in the water and not noticed?

So me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for over a year. We have been long distance for the last three months but will  be together again soon. 
The whole time we were together in person, we met every day and we even went on vacation together. We are extremely close and I feel like I can tell him anything, he accepts everything about me, he likes everything about me, he thinks I'm the prettiest girl he's ever met. He is kind and considerate, and treatsme better than I was treated by other guy. I like being with him, I feel comfortable. He has told me he loves me several times too though I have not yet said it back to him. 
During those three months we were long distance, I didn't talk to a single guy, but sometimes when I look at some guys my heart skips a beat and I feel butterflies in my stomach. My boyfriend is not really my type, I mean face wise. I like that he's taller than me and has nice shoulders. It's not that I'm not attracted to him, I am and I enjoy having sex with him( he's also generous in bed, he always tries to satisfy me). But I guess if I guess he never really gave me butterflies, not like when I look at random guys in the street and I think I want to talk to them.

I don't want to ruin this relationship, he's really important and I feel like he's the first person outside of my family whom I felt so comfortable with. And he's loyal too he would never cheat on me.
But when I look at those guys who are my type I feel kinda sad because I so want to talk to them. I want to date those guys.

"Would you say watching anime at 30 years old is childish?

Apart from watching digimon, Pokemon and DBZ as a kid, I’ve just discovered a whole new world of anime at 30 whilst I’m off sick from work trying to desperately to get my mental health back to normal. 

It’s blown my mind and in a good way. I’ve just watched my first official anime as an adult: Fruits Basket and it has changed my life in many ways. That’s certainly not a childish program either, the themes within it are ones adults can certainly relate too (love, death, trauma, abuse)

Would you say it was childish? I know for a fact that if I told some people I watched anime, they’d tell me to grow up. 

But I’m a firm believer in doing what makes you happy and not abiding by social constraints and norms.

"I'm in the US. I know he makes about $150K and often laments about the fact that he hates living in his apartment. He lives on a top floor of a home owned by his landlord who actually lives right downstairs. I haven't asked him this as I think it might be too intrusive, but I often think, if he's making six figures, has no kids, no spouse, and he only has to care for his dog, why doesn't he get a nice condo for himself, a townhouse, or a regular apartment so he lives on his own rather than with the literal landlord? No, the landlord isn't a relative, so it's not like he's caring for sick family or getting a big discount on rent which is forcing him to stay there.

He's just 30 and so can be paying off student loans, but even then with his salary, I don't understand.

"I (20m) am afraid that I have way too little empathy or that I'm even a sociopath.

I often read horrible stories, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n33fo/overnight_ive_lost_my_wife_and_our_babies/). When I read horrible things like these (about death/war/abuse/other horrible things), the first thing I think is: ""wtf that's horrible"", but I just don't really automatically picture it as I don't want to think about it I guess. So I don't feel indifferent about it but I also don't have to cry, but lots of people do. What weirdly does break my heart though are videos of elderly or kids crying and being broken, especially in war zones. 

If a close friend or family cries in front of me, I want to console them and hold them and make things easier, but I don't necessarily have to cry or feel *super* sad. My ex-girlfriend sometimes told me that when she told her sister or mother about something bad that happened to her, they had to cry with her. In one way that's beautiful (as I see it with my mother and sister too), but I maybe had once or twice in my life max when I had to cry because someone else was crying, especially at memorials. 

What I also *do* feel a lot is when I made someone cry in the past because of my own actions. It's like a stinging guilty feeling on my chest when I picture them crying because of something I did. But I was still capable of making them cry, and that's the opposite of empathy. I feel so much shame

I've had a girlfriend like 7 months ago that I had just recently broke up with had been the person I actually liked. She started to become dry like she wasn't interested in me anymore and I told her about this and she gav3 me some good advice. Like a day later she wrote a long paragraph that she liked me but didn't wanna get in the way of me and my girls relationship. I thanked her for telling me this but I didn't tell my girl. I asked her what made her tell me this and she doged the question. We started talking some more when the talking kinda became flirting, I'm definitely in the wrong for this but she asked to sext and I agreed. We started off just talking dirty and then we just sent nudes to each other. I realized that I wanted to date her more than my actual girlfriend but I already got really close to my girls parents. I told her to stop but she offered a deal I almost said yes to, she said I could do whatever I want to her. She said she would be my little sex slave bascily and could even go as far as to abuse her. I didn't want to hurt her but you know where I'm going. I told her no but she said she's always open to me. When I broke up with my girlfriend she started to open up to me. I was going to bathroom in school and she followed me in and showed me her tits.

"I (23tf she/her) have been dating my partner (22NB, he/they) for over a year now. We are fairly adventurous in the bedroom, although not much interest in PiV sex, which is great with me.

Strictly because I think it's important for this question in particular, I was born with a dick and he was not.

We are both on HRT (2+ years) and I feel it is very important to note that has totally changed what our bodies like in bed. Nothing is standard enough about us that I can read or watch a video to learn, and I can almost guarantee what feels good on cisgender genitals tends to become neutral at best on transgender genitals. We have however done a lot of learning by doing, and we do our best to be open about how it was, what we want different next time, etc.

I was very explorative of my own body prior to us dating, so I had a lot I could tell him, and I'm very vocal in bed. He hated that he even had a libido until starting T, and has never explored his 'entrance' on his own.

When he goes down on me, he makes me cum regularly, sometimes several times within a few minutes. He has probably made me cum without needing me to touch myself at all 10s if not 100s of times. I have made him cum on my own without his help so rarely I can count it on my hands. 

I care a lot that he feels satisfied in bed. I ask what feels good, I try to listen and watch how he reacts, but no matter what I try or how closely I follow instructions, I just can't make him cum on my own. I take my time, it's not uncommon to spend over a half hour with my head between his legs. 

He groans, moans, thrusts, thrashes, begs me not to stop... The sex is good and HOT. But I always reach a point where I know my stamina is failing me around the 20-50 minute mark, and I find some way to kinkily invite him to help me out, at which point he strokes his 'clit' (not that we refer to it like that, youd be surprised how much this part changes on T) and I finger him till orgasm.

He does feel that he cums way harder with me than without me, but I want to be better. I want to feel him finish because of something that *I* did. I want to feel like I'm not bad in bed for him... Which I suppose means getting better in bed xD

Is this normal? How do I improve? Does anybody in my position have some advice?

"**My go-to response to lacking data or being unsure about a decision in my life is seeking validation for it. However, I'm unsure about most of my decisions and I'm always dealing with new situations so this just makes me an insecure person in general. How can I manage without data or certainty?**

Overall, I seek validation from people too much. It's interesting because I sometimes seek it even from people I don't respect or whose validation wouldn't have any meaningful impact on my life.

It's that momentary or long-term lack of certainty about my decision that leads to me to challenge my own beliefs constantly while simultaneously seeking for my views to be validated for a sense of certainty that I know will always elude me.

I speak with confidence only if I find that it will benefit a goal that I have in the moment but none of my beliefs are certain. They're all stacked probabilities that I take a leap of faith on because it allows me to live a life that's consistent with my values, regardless of anything else. I'd say that the only consistent ""core"" aspects in my life are my main values of growth, efficiency, and security.

If I want to live a life worthy of my own respect, I need to get rid of this weakness of seeking validation at all times. It's tough though because I'm aware of how incapable I am as one person and so I throw things out to get feedback of any form but in doing so, I'm acting in a way that's insecure, and this bleeds into my day-to-day decisions.

In certain new situations, I freeze or act out simply because I lack the data to navigate and I don't have the time to seek out feedback to ""validate"" my thought process and bounce ideas off of someone. This takes time but it's not always possible in day-to-day life without a large range of reference experiences to use as a model.

"Had to go anon on this one lol

This is a very bizarre question, I know, but it’s something i’ve been curious about for a while. I’ve noticed if I sit on the toilet for an extra 10-20 mins after my first bm, more stomach “cramps” will come and so will more turds with it, as if they’ve been in there the whole time. Usually the longer I wait the more turds come out… and this makes me wonder, is there always poop just on the other side of that sphincter muscle keeping itself closed up? Or is the rectum fairly “clean” inside (yes ik clean is not exactly the correct word lol, but I mean it more so in the sense of not containing a bunch of poop just chilling in there). I get the gist of how our digestive system works obviously but I can’t help but wonder about the fact that there could always just be more poop hanging out up there even if it feels like i’ve completely relieved myself. Google searches have both told me yes there’s likely all the poop my body has produced since my last movement in there, and no the rectum is clean 99% of the time and the poop is stored a little higher up than just right there inside the rectal canal. I guess the reason I think about it so often is because, I could technically take 10 mins on the toilet and drop just what’s ready to go and leave it there, and possibly have to use the bathroom again soon after, or wait that 10-20 extra minutes and let a little extra go then and there. Sorry for defiling everyones minds who read this but i’ve been so curious about it for so long I can’t help but ask at some point, and I figured the sub called NoStupidQuestions would be the perfect place to do so.

"Not American but all my friend attended state school so they all graduated debt free. 


I saw some post here on Reddit that people have 100k-400k worth of student loan forgiven and I deeply confused by it. People take on loans knowingly because they can’t afford the school tuition, yet they still bite the bullet and now they are waiting for government bailouts?

"So I went on a vacation with my girlfriend and we picked up a small snack for my platonic female friend who had asked for it. I said it was a gift from my girlfriend and took a picture.

Two weeks pass.

One day I had lunch with my platonic female friend, during work hours, typical lunch hour, we're both remote.

This good friend of mine, surprised me with a gift for my girlfriend, which dwarfed the small snack that I brought. It was a gift bag including booze.

The small snack that I brought was a tiny tiny bag, and I easily could have bought two, but it's only available in that distant vacation spot. 

Making matters worse, I jokingly had the snack in a giant bag themed after the place we got the snack from. Which was funny, but made the snack look too small. I ended up offering the bag too, she said no.

It stretched out to almost 1:30, my friend was able to give a work update at 1, however it did stretch out too long. I don't know how much of a problem this would have been for my friend. About half an hour after noon, I asked if we could stay up to half an hour after the update, since we're both flex schedules, and she said that sounds good, and I double checked again. However, I think she was just being nice.

Anyway, the whole time I was using kind of ego humor and kind of flirting (like making poses and dirty jokes) but no actual flirting. At the same time, I was also making grossout humor. I was also complaining about my girlfriend the whole time, although it was clear I was obsessed with my girlfriend.

An hour later, I felt like I fucked up, and texted her another thanks for her gift for my girlfriend, and apologized for acting a little crazy and taking too long, and wished my friend and her boyfriend a nice holidays.",How badly did I fuck up socially?,18o0vox,1703202216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18o0vox/how_badly_did_i_fuck_up_socially/,

let's say that amazon country wants to annex other nearby land for their people for the resources/wealth etc and wage war on other countries to do it.

Let's say the nearby countries are all male with all male militaries.  with similar military capabilities

"So back in the early days of phone apps (iPhone 2 - 6 era) there was this one mobile game that had a BANGER sound track and was also super fun but, for the life of me I can't find it anywhere.

To give a quick description of the game. It was a 2d side scroller endless runner. The screen was split between horizontally with a person running on each side (like a mirror effect. example shown at the bottom).

You tap left to jump one person and vise Vera with the right. trying to jump over obstacles (cliffs, ledges, etc.). and your objective is to see how long you can last (no shit, It's a endless runner). If one of the person dies then gameover.

I also believe that the name of the game was based off of one of the names in Greek or Norse misology.

"I have a very hard time understanding people in any case, I can't empathise or sympathise very well at all. I'm also waiting for an autism diagnosis which might go some way to explaining things if it comes back a certain way.

I've been making a point of learning to become more self aware, and I'm realising that I can be very quick to judge people's hobbies, and can be very dismissive because of that. 

For example, I've been saying for years that music festivals are awful, partly for the following reasons
- poor audio quality
- people screaming for no reason
- people are frequently on drugs
- camping is terrible but that's a whole different issue

... And I'm only recently figuring out that just because it sounds like a terrible time to me, doesn't mean it's objectively a bad thing. People enjoy all sorts of things and I shouldn't think less of them for it. I still don't understand what the appeal of festivals actually is, but that's not really the point.

"Now, I can understand generally how ""normal"" inflation rises and falls. For example the inflation over this past few years spiked and is now going down to normal levels again. But I mean as an overall trend, inflation goes up every year and just continues to do so.

Does that seriously just keep going up forever? How are we supposed to deal with that long term? Can our decendents just expect to pay like $15 for a loaf of bread in 2055? Is everyone going to make like $50/hr to keep up with inflation? 

I feel like every time I try to ask somebody about this, they just act like I don't understand and everything will just work itself out.

"I work in a factory located in the industrial district of my area. Parking spaces in the lots are limited to office workers only. Us floor workers have to fight for open street and parallel park. Because there are other businesses, there are several drive ways and other areas that have post signs stating that no parking is allowed with a picture of a tow truck under it. 

Today, I parked right next to a no parking sign, but a foot away from the prohibitive area, meaning I was the first car in that stretch of road. The car behind me parked closer that you normally would, but since I could just drive forward, it didn't matter. 

After work, I get to my car, and another car has parked in front of it, in the no parking zone. They also left, and I am not exaggerating, a mere 1 inch of space between our bumpers. I was stuck. I had zero clearance to move forward or backwards. There wasn't any identifying information on the car to figure out which building they worked in. 

After waiting a hour, the owner appeared, saw me, quickly got in and sped off. No sign of apology, guilt, or remorse and no time for me to approach them. 

I checked my car and saw no damage, so I don't think they made contact with my car.

"So I’m considering upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE 2020, and right now, the OnePlus 10T is looking like a very tempting option. A Snapdragon 8 chip, an improved camera setup, crazy fast charging, and more for under $400. 

However, one thing that’s keeping me from definitely buying it is that OnePlus, a subsidiary of Oppo, is based in the People’s Republic of China. And as far as I’m aware, the Big Brother that is the CCP can access data of its citizens and any companies whenever it wants. I know that Oppo doesn’t have ties to the CCP like Huawei, Honor, or ZTE, but I’m still concerned about how much of my data they collect and if it poses a risk to me and others in my country (the USA).

Not to drag out a story without missing details, usually every morning, we would get woken up and get breakfast first thing in the morning in jail. I just so happened to up that morning (I actually woke up like at 4am and couldn't go back to sleep) Two COs (correctional officer) came into the block. (one female, one male.

They stopped mid way through the block. I was completely dumbstruck when I watched the guy open up a new jug of milk, spit in it, while she stood there watching him and passed out breakfast. I could tell I was the only one up since nobody said anything. I didn't say anything, nothing really to say since it's two of them and it's my word against them.  
However, there is a camera in the room that has 24 surveillance, and I'm sure it caught the extra wet milk footage, but I do not know how long they keep it on file or who to reach out to, and I don't have the means to get a hold of an attorney.

Despite this we both have the same disposable income because I pay rent but he lives rent free as his family own properties which he lives in and his family send him an almost monthly allowance with cash. For this reason we split things equally most of the time. Things however appear very transactional to him for example if I buy something for both of us he won’t think about it or offer to pay me back but at the same time won’t hesitate to ask me to transfer him money when he pays for something even if it’s a small amount. 

His parents are the same age as my grandparents and have the family business in Malta (we live in Wales, U.K.). For this reason he was speaking about us eventually moving there to assist with his family business. I do not speak the language and would have to leave my career and my family to do so. Additionally he mentioned that I would be a significant part in growing his family’s business and supporting it due to my knowledge and skills. 

When I asked what I would get out of making this sacrifice I.e. being out of the labour market, being isolated and away from friends and family, not being able to earn money from my career (I can only work in the U.K. due to the type of career I have) he did not have an answer for me but instead said he would make sure I was looked after but in my view that does not make up for my lost career. When I mentioned that the prenup he wanted would also mean I am contributing to a business that I would not share success in he just replied that he had to protect his family’s money in case something went wrong in the relationship. 

I’m not sure if I am in the wrong for wanting more security.

I (23F) recently have seen a lot of chatter online about how ""kids these days don't read anymore"",""reading comprehension is down"" etc, and idk why, but it made me reflect back on my teen years in the 2010's, when so many teen novels were released and then turned into movies, and everyone in my school would read the books because they wanted to go see the movie, books such as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent,etc (I live in the US btw). And it got me wondering, do they even make films based off books for kids/teens anymore? Do they even write books for teens anymore?

You see, I have a tight knit family, my mom and dad and his step kiddos are wonderful in their own distinct ways.
However, this year has been one of the worst we've ever gone through financially, my mom and my siblings had to move more than twice this year due to rising costs, and for the first time in our lives, we came to the pretty unfortunate realization that we are gonna have to skip this Christmas almost altogether, no gifts at all.

The problem that I have is that for whatever reason, I can't accept that for them at all, so I've been trying to find ways to fund raise for a while, and I seem to be running out of time, so the question is, is there any website or any way at all that I can raise funds for christmas in time, even if it's just for a cone cup's worth of change?

"I stared working for this pressure washing company about a year and a half ago. When I started here it was great, the boss/business owner was super cool and friendly. It’s a small business and I’m the only employee which I liked because I could grow with them. I have to climb really high and sometimes sketchy roofs with no safety equipment. He would tell me I would never have to climb one if he wasn’t there to watch me but now I have to do it all the time without him there but that was fine with me. They would tell me every day how I was such a great employee and they were lucky to have found me. They even gave me a Christmas card last year that said I was a “part of their family” and had a $300 bonus. Business was slow when I started and most weeks I would work about 30 hours. He told me the job is salary pay and I would be paid for 40 hours no matter what. So over all it seemed great at first. Then summer time rolled around and we started working 40 hours a week and sometimes over that and he would say we‘ll make up for it in the winter time when u get pto. I also started to do the jobs by myself when summer started soo it was just me doing everything which was great because that part came with a raise. Soo all summer long I work long and hard days just trying to hold out till winter. As soon as school let back in business started to slow down. He would have me come in and do yard work 5 days a week 4 hours a day instead. I was wondering why I wasn’t getting pto. He then proceeded to tell me the business is very slow and hurting for money and that he needs me to go doordash and pay him all the earnings soo that he could use that to pay my wage. This happens the day before he leaves to go on a cruise (he takes them once a month). Soo I started doordashing for him and it wasn’t going good and he would constantly be on my ass about not making enough. That went on for two weeks then he says we need to have a talk during the talk he tells me It’s not that the company is broke he said it was the best year they have ever had. He said that the real reason was because business cost went up by “%30”. He tells me doordash isn’t making enough and gives me the option to either use his car and DoorDash for my own wage and he wound only pay me the days I work or he would pay me only for the days I work. He tried to make it seem like it wasn’t that bad by telling me he made 80 in 3 hours the night before but I don’t think he knew I was still signed in on his account so I looked at the delivery’s he took and it was only half that. He literally lied to my face. So now I’m doordashing in his car and stressing out about how I’m gonna pay rent while he’s gone on vacation the week of Christmas. I feel like he’s been lying this whole time and he just wanted an employee for 1 year soo he could get his investments off the ground. It’s put me in a really shit situation where idk if I’ll be homeless after Christmas. Meanwhile I’m watching him spend all this money and not pay me a cent. I’ve confronted him and told him I’m looking for a new job which I am and he basically said okay just don’t forget to give me a 2 week notice and I’ll hit you up next summer.

I've had 3 long-term partners in my life, each relationship lasted around 3 years and all of them were really healthy and loving, and ended due to some outside circumstances (having to move to another country or stuff like that). 

Like 90% of times, when I got undressed around a boyfriend in non-sexual situations (changing outfits etc), he would just show no reaction, or would occasionally grab my boob or slap my butt, but more in a joking around way, rather than anything sexual. 

When we kissed outside of sexual situations, none of them has ever got hard.

"For the record, 31M.  Married and with a healthy sex life at home.  Not particularly religious or sheltered, this stuff just makes me uncomfortable.

My first dabble with dating apps back in 2015 was a weird experience.  I was genuinely looking for dating and “taking it slow”, but often times I’d meet girls who would immediately let me know they just wanted sex.  Sometimes we would have great conversations and go on a date, just for them to initiate sex afterwards.  Going to bars was never enjoyable because the public flirting, provocative dancing, stuff like that just made me uncomfortable.  I felt like a real loser, as all my friends at the time would make a game of going to the bar to hook up with a stranger.  

I met a girl who I ended up dating for a while, but her confidence and sexuality made me feel uncomfortable at first.  She initiated sex the first time, and while that did open the floodgates to a lot of sex, her confidence was always intimidating in a weird way.  Also, the fact that she had so many partners before me never sat right with me, and I couldn’t tell you why.

I don’t care what other people do with their body, but I just couldn’t imagine having sex with someone that I just met.  The partners I have had over the years have all been great, and it’s not like I don’t enjoy sex… I love it.  Just with the right person I guess?

"So I usually have long hair, shoulder length or longer. My hair is extremely thick (I'm native american so it's probably similar to some types of latino hair) and slightly wavy. 

Anyway I cut it short myself because I was bored, and it looked great while wet. Once it dried, it was so fluffy. I don't want to say it was an afro because my hair isn't kinky and I'm not black, but it had a similar amount of volume and size.

That's what I get for following haircut tutorials for white people.

The only way I've gotten it to behave is to put gel in it and then wear a tight hat until it dries. 

Would a professional barber be able to cut it differently to reduce some volume? Should I stick with the hat method? Just putting product in doesn't cut it, it still fluffs up when it's dry.

Now, this is a tricky question to ask clearly because I can't post a picture for references. But, I am a general contractor (in US that is someone who build homes, etc) so, I fully understand the purpose of support beams, posts, collums, etc.

 However, on a space ship that is entirely made of some sort of metal; The bays/hangars where the fighters and smaller space crafts will launch out of almost always have these large (probably 4-6 foot spans) equally spaced beams at the entry ways, and normally completely open floor plan inside. 

Again, I understand that they are essentially for structural integrity and load bearing. But, it's space, there is no weight in space, and most these ships have some sort of force field, I'd assume that would be enough to maintain structural support.

I'm pretty sure the roads heading away would become completely jammed with cars.

My main question is would I be safer to get on the main road heading away from the fire that is 4 lanes wide (2 in each direction) and which will probably be at a stand still with cars trying to escape out.  Or, head perpendicular to traffic a half mile to a nearby lake that is about a half mile wide and get on the downwind side of the lake?  Would people stuck in traffic on a wide road all still get suffocated if large fires are burning on both sides of the road?  There is also a large supermarket parking lot devoid of trees as well nearby.  Is a large parking lot pretty safe or would you just die of smoke and suffocation in a car?  I'm thinking the lake is the best option, but it would probably mean driving towards the fire and riding it out in the lake instead of trying to escape on the roads with 10,000 other cars, essentially getting stuck in a traffic jam..",What should I do in the event of a quickly moving fire in a densely populated suburban area?,18okzrd,1703268256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18okzrd/what_should_i_do_in_the_event_of_a_quickly_moving/,

"So I have been seeing this girl for 6 months now and her ex (her only other boyfriend she’s ever had that she was seeing for 2 years) lives on the same street as me. My gf doesn’t live with me but is only about 15 min drive away.

My gf only met me 2 weeks after the break up (I didn’t know till a few weeks in that it was so recent) and after 2 months of us being together began finding things in her room of his and she’d go over to his to give him it back or he’d find something of hers and she’d go over. 

This has been happening about once a month and it’s usually while I’m busy and not around. The most recent time was last night. We agreed to meet up last night a few days prior and not on a specific time but just ‘when I get back from work’. Got a message from her while at work saying she was going over to her exs to give him back a pair of joggers and asked to  come over saying she assumed I was gonna be home shortly so it would all work out time wise. Which I usually would be if I wasn’t working overtime but thing is she knows that I’ve been doing overtime for the past few weeks and wouldn’t be home for hours to come and when I remind her I won’t be home for hours she just says “oh okay well there’s no point in me going home just to come back, I’m fine chilling her for a few more hours and so is he” and will end up hanging out at her exs for a few hours when it was supposed to be just a quick exchange.

 This sorta thing has happened  a good few times now and he still is into her (he occasionally tries to call her and texts her late nights at least a couple times a week) which makes me uncomfortable already but her willingness to hangout with him in his bedroom for hours just makes me feel uneasy about it all. Especially since when she does tell me when she’s going over before she goes she tells me she doesn’t wanna go to his since it was a bad breakup with him being abusive near the end of the relationship and just wants to stay outside his apartment door yet when she goes over she’s always fine with spending hours alone in his room. Have also noticed that while when she’s not at his and we message (mostly through snap) we usually just send photos and videos to chat but when she’s at his she only send texts or voicenotes.

Dk if I’m just paranoid and haven’t said much to her about it and I wanna trust her and don’t wanna seem crazy but I’m just worried she’s cheating. Any unbiased opinions or advice?

"Hey all, 23M here. I've always struggled with my frustration and alot of anxiety as a teenager but I honestly wasn't very much of an angry teen or a grumpy person until I moved out of home. Alot of stuff happened in a short two year window that included the death of two friends and parents that weren't overly the most supportive with both that and also me trying to talk about what I want to do in life,  As I've gotten older I'm learning to accept the things that happened and I no longer want to feel this deep frustration and anger that's deep within me. I'm currently in a relationship with a loving partner who really genuinely cares for me and loves me and I've been with them for a couple of years now, they know everything about me, my past, the hurt, the good bad and the ugly.  I blow up over the smallest of things and I know when I'm blowing up that it's not right, but I cannot seem to snap out of it and just realize what's actually happening vs what I think is happening and before I know it, I've said something extremely rude or been really nasty. Currently in my life it's very stressful, I've currently been made redundant and it does stress me out, I live far away from my family and friends  nowadays and can sometimes feel pretty isolated due to this, sadly alot of my mates are in that party stage still in their lives and I don't think they realize how isolating it is, I did bring this on myself though.  I think this has caused me to be a bit more on ""edge"" recently however, I don't want to be an angry person and continue what my parents were like to me so so much as a person growing up.  I don't want my lovely partner who does so, so much for me to feel like they have to walk on egg shells just to avoid setting me off, that's just not fair. We talk out all of our arguments and hug them out each time and i do genuinely try to do better and learn from my mistakes and I do know that im slowly improving with small steps and learning very slowly on how to desculate and taking a few moments but I still struggle with blowing up over the smallest of things, a good example would be like me tooting at a car and getting told I don't need to do that proceeding by me explaining in detail about how no, I was in the right to toot and x y and z and your not driving blah blah blah. In recent years I've talked to my parents about my quick to fire and inability to calm down and move on and my mum refers to it as ""red mist"" or ""red eyes"" and she also struggled alot with it as a teenager and early adulthood, she said that her brothers/my uncles all have the same problem that I describe and they both found there peace by talking to their dad/my grandfather about the things that hurt them the most on his death bed. I don't want to wait until then, nor do I overly want to bring everything back up for my parents now. I was just wondering if any other fellow users somewhat relate to this and if so, how have you managed to kind of take control of this rage when it comes on rather than becoming reactive?

"Pregnancy Scare?? Maybe?

Hey I’m turning to Reddit just to get an outside opinion on what’s going on.

My girlfriend (16F) and I (17M) are having a pregnancy scare. To go into detail, she was giving me a handie over my underwear. Then we switched positions and I started rubbing her vagina over her sweatpants. During this time she first massages herself over the sweatpants, then underneath and inside her vagina. The scare is that if she had some of my precum on her fingers and had her fingers inside her vagina, that she could get pregnant.

It sounds dumb, but we’re terrified. I plan on buying her Plan B but we’re worried that she might already be ovulating. But we’re still trying to be smart about it.

Are we right to be terrified? Her fingers weren’t dripping with the precum, and she rubbed them on clothing before inserting her fingers into her vagina, plus the fact that it’s precum and not actual semen.

"Thinking of writing two important characters to my story. These two characters are actually the reason the power system in the universe I’m creating exists in the first place. 

(This story takes place in a God realm similar to the Greek one) Thousand of years ago massive natural disasters swarmed the earth for 9 months, no one knew why it was happening but one day it suddenly stopped. Hades and Apollo, the miracle children. Seemingly born out of the ground are found by a farmer woman and are adopted by her. 

Even as babies Hades and Apollo show remarkable power but that’s not all, mortals start noticing that they’re gaining powers too and it seems that the Gods suddenly aren’t the only people with powers. This is revolutionary finally mortals can gain powers that even rival the Gods

What happened was when Apollo was born he started emitting pathogens that would spread and unlock peoples latent abilities but Hades and Apollo are still more powerful than anyone in the universe

Later in life Hades and Apollo are hailed for their powers and treated like royalty meaning they’re taken away from their mother but they don’t know she’s not allowed to see them

Hades mother eventually finds a way to sneak into Gold Fort (a place for Gods and royalty), Hades and Apollo thought they were abandoned but their mother confirms how much she loved them and she’s quickly executed in front of them

In the moment, consumed by grief, Hades has a realisation. He realises the only people he cared about in this world were Hades and his mother, he realises everyone is insignificant and weak and he can do what he wants. To which he starts killing everyone indiscriminately, when he wants and wherever he wants. He can do anything he wants like steal and kill

It takes several Gods to take him down and it wouldn’t have worked if they didn’t manage to convince Apollo to help (he turned pacifist and wanted to stay away from conflict) and all the manage to do is seal him. Hades also emits a pathogen that can turn anyone into shadow beasts which are brainless monsters that are insanely powerful, this happens when someone experiences extreme trauma but it’s also rare

So what do you guys think?

"My dog of 12 years passed away yesterday. We had gotten him when I was 7 and he was 2. So he lived to be 14 and he saw me grow to be almost 20. I've never had another dog, and it is unlikely I will have one for a very long time, if ever again. Every memory I have, he is included. There was never a time he hasn't been around since I was 6 years old. And the fact that never again will be ever be here, especially around Christmas (as he was born in December and died in December), is almost unbearable to me.

Yesterday people spent a lot of time saying they were sorry, but I guess I must have become intensely cynical over the years, because it just made me extremely bitter. All I could think was, these people are telling themselves it's just a dog, when he was quite literally almost another sibling to me. It angered me that they truly were only slightly sorry.

They also spent a bit of time saying he was ""in a better place now"". And this is the comment that really frustrates me. Where? Where is he? He's not at home, where he needs to be. It annoys me that people can say things that are so blatantly untrue, and that's how I see it. I believe, deep down, I will never see that dog again. Not even after I die. We had him, and he's gone. Forever.

But maybe I'm being cynical again, and there's really more proof toward an afterlife than I'm allowing. My parents are Catholic so I don't even want to bring up this conversation with them, as I don't want to make them think anything other than that he went to heaven.

"I failed a mandatory course in my undergrad senior year, and my life feels ruined alongside my grad school dreams which I was supposed to start in Fall 2024

I am a U.S./Canadian senior mechanical engineering student, studying at a Canadian university. I have been very fortunate to intern at 3 NASA research centers and also obtain a publication too. All my recommenders for grad school were NASA PIs, and I am also a candidate for the GEM Fellowship. I applied to 19 M.S. programs (including Columbia, MIT, Yale, Princeton, NYU, UCF, etc) and although some may be cash cow, as a GEM Fellow these could be funded through an employer or associate fellowship. I have a mediocre GPA (3.3) but still received acceptances to 2 of the 19 schools, with others having pending decisions. Unfortunately, I was writing an 80% final exam due to me deferring the midterm because I was very sick, and I ended up failing the exam and the course by a lot. I fell into a deep depression, and now I have to let my family know, my NASA supervisors, and the schools that accepted me know that I can't attend grad school in Fall 2024 because I failed. I'm so disappointed in myself and I don't know what to do. I know grad schools defer under extenuating circumstances, but I don't think failing counts, plus the fellowship is tied to start Fall and there's no guarantee I get it again next year. I also can't take the failed course (which was electrical systems, a mandatory course) until Fall 2024 due to it not being offered in the Winter or Summer semesters.

My partner rarely initiates sex. When we do it, half the time he just wants me to suck his dick. He has admitted to having issues with porn in the past. He had naked pics of his ex from their relationship in his phone but claimed they were saved because she always asked why he didn’t save them on Snapchat. He deleted these pics after I found them. He doesn’t have a single naked photo of me saved. His instagram explore page is filled with chick with huge tits. I have modest boobs. He never calls me beautiful even when I get made up for a night out. I have to ask him to tell me I look beautiful. Today I walked out of the bathroom naked and he quickly looked away from me. I asked why he looked away and he said he didn’t want to be “creepy”. 

Idk. I wouldn’t mind all the other sexualized women if he was into me sexually. He claims he is attracted to me and finds me beautiful but I don’t want to have to always ask to get a compliment or have sex initiated.

"Tl;Dr: ChatGPT + Voice replication = Possible impersonation? 

Foreword: I highly doubt an 80 billion dollar company cares to impersonate some jagoff fox, this is food for thought which considers the technology both now and within 5-10 years. 
 
With ChatGPT’s voice option, it almost gives me the feeling that they’re in natural conversation and I think this will get better as time goes on. Since OpenAI stores all its data, with enough use, couldn’t they theoretically use all my saved dialogue as training data to make a chatbot that perfectly replicates my manner of speaking? Further, couldn’t they then use voice replication software to make a Bottrot4Real who sounds exactly like me over phone? Even if OpenAI themselves don’t do this, I feel that it is very possible and indeed probable that others will do this in the future. 

I fear this could be a very convincing way to scam the elderly or even some sharper people. Snag some clean audio from a teenager trying to start his streaming career, replicate it, then call up grandma and use his voice to ask for emergency money. That is only one application, too.

"Ive recently turned 35f and realized my time has passed and my value in the market is too low. It’s been sad.

I married my ex in my 20s for half a decade and spent another half decade being completely single as in not sleeping with someone as my ex was my first real relationship and only thus far but it was so toxic I needed to heal a lot and my Dad died which tore up my life and left me mangled in grief.

I’ve decided to make myself receptive to finding a man and have a terrible time because my age even tho I am attractive and naturally fit it goes nowhere. No date nothing. 

Here are my red flags i immediately have:

🚩I’m damaged goods because I was married in my 20s to my first and only real relationship 
🚩 I didn’t have a present mom growing up so I have average, basic, subpar cooking skills if that compared to men’s moms &amp; other high value women 
🚩men wake up between 4-6am &amp; expect breakfast &amp; I know I would not be able to do that consistently as I make a breakfast on the go before I leave for work @9am.
🚩 I am *painfully* boring like sleeping in a coffin because I love to be home and preoccupy myself at home doing little tasks or lounging being home but most men want an active girl who always doing constant fun things
🚩I have no friends or family and many men want a popular woman with an active social life 
🚩 I have a toxic dysfunctional ghetto family that loves to fight &amp; meddle in my life to ruin any potential of something good for me so I can be dragged down to their ghetto standards which I work hard to minimize my life away from them which has left me an adult orphan 
🚩 I have 20yrs of conditioning by my family to find a man who mistreats and cheats on me which I don’t want as I already did that for my family
🚩I don’t know how to be loved and have never been in love (my first marriage was arranged pretty much)
🚩I’m divorced 
🚩 even though I haven’t been with different men I am experienced and men expect me to hook up with them 
🚩I’m not a hook up girl
🚩 I don’t drink or go to bars etc
🚩I have a low body count sadly (for women this is a huge negative not sure for men)
🚩 I don’t have tattoos or have piercings
🚩 I’m very boring but nice not doormat nice just respectful
🚩 I just work a simple job and pay bills like every other adult 
🚩 I’ve tried finding a man in a church but because churches are just businesses their moms tell their sons not to get with me because I don’t drink, have tattoos, and didn’t have a hoe-phase and since I don’t mesh with their mom &amp; sisters I don’t mesh with the son even tho they find me attractive and good.
🚩 I get really, really shy where I shutdown 
🚩 no man just wants to talk to me first and see where it goes just talk like text &amp; call and hang out in a group for a month or so then go out for tea alone &amp; from there
🚩my domestication skills are average basic subpar compared to other women 
🚩 all my gal pals with a past have perfect amazing lives with their husbands and even if they were single like me would be taken off the market quickly 
🚩I’m desperate but not so desperate for the men who hit on me or take interest and they have obvious red flags themselves. I just want a simple person like myself and am worried everyday he doesn’t exist
🚩 my biggest red flag even in churches I try to have a spiritual faith which the only way I’ve survived living without my Dad
🚩compared to all the options men have these days they don’t stick around for it to progress but do stick around for all their other women
🚩 I’m no longer naive .. or young lol
🚩 since I know men are bombard with easy access to women &amp; have the upperhand I’m extremely cautious to take things slow once we’ve expressed interest which has lead nowhere 


Please don’t say I’m young because I’m not. In my 20s I had no shortage of options and def notice a difference even if men hit on me superficially just weekly because now men have no shortage of options of who they seriously choose.

Men around my age are uninterested but 50+ &amp; elderly men are but I’m not into men *that* much older.

"I remember when I first read about aphantasia I thought ""oh that must be horrible"", because people described their mind as a completely black space. It is not really my case. But it put the doubt in my mind and as time went by, I realized I cannot relate to the imagination processes of most people, who talk about ""vividly visualizing something"" in their minds and having their thoughts be expressed as an internal monologue.

I remember when I was learning English and my English teacher told us that when you've lived in an English-speaking country for long enough, at some point you start to ""think in English"". I was so confused by what she meant. My thoughts aren't *ever* structured as a ""conversation"" with myself or anyone else (I mean unless I'm remembering an actual conversation ofc), it's not in ""language form"". It's only shapeless ideas and pure concepts in their fundamental form, striking right at the spot of my brain that processes ideas and concepts. It feels direct, pure and instantaneous. The whole idea of having these ideas have to go through the intermediate step of being phrased in language form seems like a limiting slog to me

Same for visualisation. When I think of something, say a mountain, I think more of the pure concept of a mountain. Sure it does conjure some form of visual representation of a mountain, but it's not *really* visual (do people actually *see* just as with their eyes? It sounds so weird to me, there's no eyes involved in the process), and it really is more a conceptual representation rather than a picture. No details, more like ""an abstract illustration of the pure concept of a mountain put into shape"". When I say conceptual representation, I mean very simplistic, with only the core elements presents that highlight its ""mountain"" nature.

When I read a read a book, it doesn't hinder me from imagining what's happening - just more at the conceptual level with barebone visuals to illustrate it. When I read a description of someone having a big black beard, it just adds to the fundamental characteristics that get *conceptually* pictured when I later think about that character. But it's never ""vivid"".

When I say that, people expect that ""mental"" stuff like mathematics is out of my my reach. Turns out I work in a mathematics-related field, and I have been blessed with a deeply mathematical mind. Since what I """"""""picture"""""""" in my mind are the conceptualized essences of things, it's just perfect for mathematical thinking. And I have no trouble having a high degree of organizations of my ideas in my mind, my mind is never a mess (my home however..).

Also I always was a very imaginative kid, always lost in fictional worlds and stuff. Just not in a ""vividly visual"" manner, in predominantly a concepts-driven manner with barebone abstract visual illustrations.

So I don't know, I may be in an intermediate situation on the spectrum of aphantasia. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm like people that are blind from birth - I'm content with my state because I've never known otherwise, but if I experienced it just once, I would realize how limited my perspective actually was.

"I believe this question will depend highly on where in the world you live but I really never understood how credit cards manage to generate such crazy profits, especially in more affluent economies. I completely understand the business model but how does the math add up?

Almost everyone I know, my friends, my family, my coworkers, all have multiple cards and pretty much max out the benefits of each card (i.e I use a specific dining card, a specific travel card). Almost everyone I know uses autopay or auto debit and the uncommon late charge is on such a minor amount that it’s a rounding error. I have paid annual fees for cards but that is the exception not the norm.

So what I fail to understand is how the credit card companies can sustain these big rewards (like 5-8% cashback) on what I assume should be very large volumes, on what should be a disproportionately small interest fees. I doubt anyone uses a credit card for large amounts of financing as bank loans would offer much better rates, and those that are consistently spending above their income would likely be lower net worth, lower amount customers?

In a nutshell, how do credit card companies make money when they pay such high rebates on all sorts of common transactions?

"TL;DR: i believe my daughter has a corn intolerance. ige blood test came back negative. because of that, her pediatrician refused to give a referral for an oral food challenge to test for a non-mediated allergy so i can get her formula and thickener covered by medicaid. what do i do now?

hi guys! i need some advice. this is gonna be pretty long but i want you guys to understand where i’m at and help me figure out where to go from here.

my 3 and a half month old daughter has had hysterical, inconsolable screaming fits since she was 2 weeks old. as well as an awful stuffy nose and sneezing. at first we assumed colic, but it didn’t seem quite right. she had to be held and comforted constantly, and even then she was she was still in extreme pain. she was eventually diagnosed with reflux, cows milk protein allergy, and lactose intolerance.

by that point, we’d had her on nexium, and 8 different formulas. 2 lactose free, and 3 hypoallergenic, and she couldn’t tolerate any of them. i was at a loss. there were a few nights i almost took her to the ER to make sure there wasn’t something physically wrong like appendicitis or a bowel obstruction etc…

my mom mentioned that her coworker has 2 kids with corn intolerance. it’s pretty rare, but it led me to some research.

in formulas without lactose, or hypoallergenic formulas without cows milk proteins, the main ingredient is usually corn! i did some more research, and found out that the formula she was on at the time, powder similac alimentum’s main ingredient is corn, but the ready to feed’s main ingredient was tapioca starch! we made the switch to ready to feed, with no lactose, cows milk protein, or corn. we also stopped her nexium because it contains xanthan gum, which is made from corn.

and oh my goodness, day by day she is a happier baby! no more hysterical fits, she finishes 3-4 oz of a bottle on average and chills for awhile on her own after eating. instead of eating an oz, screaming, calming down, eating another oz 30 mins later and repeat. she smiles so much more, is soo close to laughing, and her stuffy nose and sneezing gets better every day! it’s the ONLY thing that’s actually helped her.

the only problem she has now is her reflux, since every reflux medicine has some corn derivative in it. but we found an infant formula thickener that is corn and dairy free that we are going to try on saturday. (unfortunately it’s very expensive. medicaid will cover it if a doctor tells them it’s medically necessary but you’ll see why that’s gonna be a problem as you read on.)

now here’s the problem. wic will NOT cover ready to feed, no matter the situation or prescription etc… only medicaid will if a doctor deems it medically necessary. it’s $13 a bottle, and a bottle lasts 1.5 days MAX. that’s close to $400 a month.

i made an appt with her pediatrician, and mentioned a corn allergy. he looked at me like i was crazy, saying it was extremely rare and he had never seen it in person. after my insisting, he agreed to do an ige allergy blood test.

now here’s another problem. ige blood tests only test for antibodies that come from allergies that have the potential to become anaphylactic.

there is something called a “non-mediated allergy” which basically means the body is allergic to something the food is broken down into during digestion, not the food itself. therefore it doesn’t show up on blood tests. but either way, both allergies mean the food cannot be tolerated and it can cause severe damage to the body over time.

unfortunately, my daughters ige test came back negative. so medicaid will not cover her formula because to them, she has no allergy.

non-mediated allergies can only be confirmed by an elimination diet (which we did, and she’s improved drastically), and an oral food challenge test after the elimination diet. this basically means she would ingest increasing doses of corn in a doctors office while they record the effects.

immediately after finding out the results to her ige test, i called an allergy clinic near me and asked if i could book an appt for an oral food challenge. they take medicaid, and they offer the test i need, but they would only book an appt if i had a referral from her pediatrician. medicaid will only cover it if it’s medically necessary.

i called her doctor’s office and asked them for a referral after explaining the situation, but her doctor denied it! his reasoning was “her blood test was negative so this test is not needed. continue on the formula she can tolerate.”

i was LIVID. obviously i was going to keep her on the formula that helps her, i just need proof of medical necessity so that i can get help PAYING for it and you denied even testing for it!

i cannot afford $400 a month in formula. we have food stamps, but we only receive $406 so basically every penny we get for food would go towards my daughters formula. she’s fed and happy then but how are WE gonna eat? that’s not even counting the $30 a week for thickener if she has to stay on that too!

i was gonna just switch her to doctor after doctor until i found one who was willing to refer her to the allergy clinic, but then i realized that medicaid will ONLY accept the referral if it comes from her primary doctor, and i can’t change her primary doctor until open enrollment or something in july.

i do not know where to go from here. i refuse to take my daughter off of this formula but i don’t know how we’re gonna continue to afford it. nobody is listening to me, im being talked down to. all the doctors and nurses i’ve talked to act like i’m stupid and web md-ing my child which is NOT the case. even if the oral food challenge came back negative, at least we’d know for sure that it’s not the corn and we can go back to square one and figure out what the problem ACTUALLY is.

i have this momma bear gut feeling that i figured out what her problem is, why she was in so much pain. i just need proof so we can continue to help her.

any advice or steps to take from here is greatly appreciated. and if you made it down here, you’re a trooper! i’m known to write novels 🤣❤️

"It seems the answer depends on who you ask.

First of all, I am aware of two very important facts:

1. The statistics show that the overwhelming majority of lethal dog attacks involve a Pit Bull
2. The behavior of a dog is largely shaped by the owner and fucked up people are more likely to get a Pit Bull than, say, a Border Collie, thus skewing the statistic.

Then again, I've been around many dogs, none of them in a bad environment (I mean in my firends' and family's homes). There is a noticable, clear difference in behaviour between breeds. And any dog enthusiast knows that some breeds are, say, more active, some less. Some enjoy certain activities more than others. Some are by nature very patient and some act like crackheads most of the time. Usually the behaviour of the dog seems somewhat alligned with the intended purpose the breed was initially bred for.

So it doesn't seem too far fetched to thing that a breed that was bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head could have a disposition towards violence.

Yet people seem to adamantly defend the statement that aggresion is a trait that has nothing to do with genetics (somehow, despite other traits being partially determined by genetics).

So I'm confused, but would like to learn more.

"\*\*\*\*Requisite acknowledgment of how stupid I am\*\*\*\*

2 days ago (In PA). I'm at a bar/nightclub.

It's 10/10:30 PM. I'm standing with my front towards the bar. A guy (total stanger, with his girlfriend, I presume) begins to touch me from behind, rubbing my coat and mocking it, touching my lower back, and essentially making fun of my coat. I ask him to stop. He continues a few minutes later. All just sort of it in a mocking/drunk-behavior manner.

I don't think he was interested in me physically.

I take out a pocket knife, show it, and ask if we have a serious problem. Wanna-be-macho BS stuff, you know. He leaves. No further confrontation. The whole interaction is approximately 10 seconds. The dude leaves. No other words exchanged.

The bouncer came over a bit later, asking if I had a knife on me. Assuming the guy or someone else saw me flash my pocket knife. I said yes and that a guy was getting handsy. I apologized. The bouncer asked me to leave and began escorting me out. I asked if I could pay my tab first. The bouncer said yes. Then he walked me to the door, the guy checking IDs took a picture of my ID, and I left.

No injuries. Police weren't called. Interaction with the bouncer was super cordial, all things considered. This place can get pretty rowdy and has seen its fair share of fights.

Needless to say, I'm ashamed. There's no reason to threaten someone with pocket knife. I use it for DIY furniture that I build.

**Really what I'm asking is: is it likely I got lucky (and hopefully learned a lesson) and nothing will come of this, or is there a good chance the bar filed a police report at the end of the night?

"Hope this is the right place to post this...the TechSupport subreddit didn't seem right as this isn't really a ""problem""....just trying to understand the concepts better. I'm fairly tech savvy and I understand what pixels are and the basics concept that 1080p means there is 1080 pixels times 1920 pixels (typically) on the screen. I understand more pixels means greater detail. My question though is more about how this comes together with Resolution, Aspect Ratio, and TV size....and which term means exactly which thing. 

I use a laptop that is connected to a flatscreen TV. I just recently got into modding Skyrim (a video game for those who don't know...and modding is kinda ""upgrading"" it for lack of a better term) and I'm trying to understand some things about graphics better and if there is any point in modding to 2k graphics. Would it even be noticeable on my cheap TV? 

My specific questions are this. In my display settings panel, I have ""Display Resolution"" and the options range from 800x600 all the way to 1920x1080 with 11 options in between. However, the only thing these seem to change is the size of things on my screen (such as icons) and how the display fits in the screen. I thought that was aspect ratio? Isn't resolution supposed to make my graphics ""better""? As I don't see any improvement or worsening in graphic quality between settings. Personally I like and usually use the 1360x768 setting (which is actually the recommended one) as it makes my icons/text/etc perfect size. The bigger numbers just make everything really small, and the lower numbers make it too big. So can I even watch/notice 2k graphics on my screen and if so, is there a certain ""display resolution"" setting I need to use? What is the difference between display resolution and aspect ratio?  I think that about covers everything....sorry if this is kind of rambling, hard to put it in concise questions.","Understanding Display Resolution, Aspect Ratio, and TV Size.",18p8x90,1703347959.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18p8x90/understanding_display_resolution_aspect_ratio_and/,

"I was using a website earlier which gave me a popup basically saying 
“using *website* requires acceptance of our terms and conditions” 
with an Accept button under the text. There was no Decline button next to the Accept (which, considering the fact they said accepting is mandatory, makes sense), but there was an X at the top right of the popup in order to close it. This obviously isn’t my first time seeing this on a website, but I’ve never really given it any thought until now: 

By clicking that X and closing the popup, what’s the status of my acceptance of the term and conditions? I’ve obviously never read nor accepted them, but accepting them is stated to be mandatory for further use of the website, so I’m confused what the website thinks of me when I click X to close the popup without accepting, yet continue to use the website afterwards.

Is the X essentially a decline button, and the website was lying about clicking accept being mandatory? 

Is the X essentially another accept button, since accepting’s the only option?

Does the website work off the logic of “You’ve been made aware that you can only use the website if you accept the T&amp;C, so using the website means you accept the T&amp;C automatically (since it’s necessary for use), regardless of if you’ve actually clicked Accept or not” 
meaning my choice doesn’t matter, and really the only way to decline is by exiting the website entirely?

Is it some other fourth thing?

Is there no definitive answer to this question, as the laws around this stuff are loose enough that multiple of these options are possible depending on the website?

* When posting, apparently searching for a community just doesn't work anymore?
* Can't collapse single comment replies anymore
* I actually used the ""open in app"" button to switch between accounts (one in browser, one in app). Now it's a fuckin banana.
* Opening large images in preview no longer zooms/scales so they're readable
* Trying to go back/forward on multiple images in preview requires pinpoint accuracy on them arrows

Recently I’ve been seeing more and more racist remarks and comments about people from the Indian subcontinent.

Then, the auditor inquired about the reason for the traffic stop. The cops claimed it was none of his business and asked him to leave.

"Mind you, it's late and nearing 4AM Eastern Time where I live, so it's technically the 23rd of December. 

I have two Christmas presents for a loved one that are on their way. One is shipping through USPS, and the other is shipping via UPS. To my frustration, when I track these packages, they both say the expected delivery date is Tuesday, Dec 26th. That's quite a bummer because I really wanted the stuff to arrive by Christmas.

However, just recently I checked the status of both shipments. While they still both say the expected delivery date is Dec 26th, both packages have moved through the system and are currently now in my state. The USPS shipment was at a ""distribution center annex"" around 6PM yesterday the 22nd in a major city about 30 miles from where I live, yet still says expected delivery is the 26th. In my experience, once the item gets to that particular distribution center it usually arrives the next day, which would be today, but again, it still says expected delivery Dec 26.

The other parcel, shipped via UPS, also still lists Dec 26th as the expected delivery date. However, tracking shows me that as of 11PM Dec 22, just a few hours ago, it had arrived in a city that borders my own and is about 10 minutes away from me. I cannot imagine it taking several more days to arrive when it is so close, but the expected delivery has not updated and still says Dec 26th.

Is there a decent chance that these parcels will arrive before Christmas? They are quite close to me now, and I feel as though it's not crazy to believe they might be delivered sooner than expected because they're already so close.

I texted my dad and explained the situation and he believes both items will arrive by Sunday, before Christmas (he's retired USPS). I just don't understand why neither has updated from Dec 26th as expected delivery when they're both so close to my home right now.

"For context my mother has been an elementary public schoolteacher for her entire life, she teaches in US Indiana.

Recently she’s been complaining to me just how different teaching is anymore. She also said that the higher ups are literally giving them a script on how to run their classroom. Forcing teachers to use shit software for tracking student success. As if teachers don’t already know which student are lacking and which ones are excelling. Now I understand there a rules public teachers must abide by that are given to them by the state and then enforced by districts idk, all I know is it’s top down. There are a lot more things I would like to speak on but the most troubling and mind boggling thing to me is the fact she is forced to pass students even if they’ve failed, so I’m talking tests and hw etc. What does this mean, well she says some students know about this and because of it they don’t try cause they know they’re gonna pass anyway. 

What im asking is, is passing kids who are sometimes too illiterate and stupid to move on to the next grade level only to be taught harder material which they won’t even understand or have a concept of okay?

"Hello friends. Want to start this off with saying how hard it is to even make this post. I’m not someone who’s overly sensitive or prone to blowing things out of proportion but I’ve had enough. I’ve been dealing with this condition or syndrome if you will for the better part of 10 years. I’m (26M) and finally facing the fact that I’m dealing with faulty nerve signals that trigger eccrine sweat glands to become overactive. This has affected my ability to communicate in normal ways, as I’m constantly wiping my face from excessive sweat. I understand sweating is normal, however most people I’ve talked to said they sweat in their armpits, palms, or maybe lower back. I’d trade for that in a heartbeat. For me, it’s my face, my hair, and completely wipes out any confidence I’m attempting to display, or conversation I’m trying to have. This is mainly happening in public settings, which I thought was just social anxiety but now I know it’s much more. It could be room temperature, not warm/hot in any way, shape, or form and I break out. Everyone around me is just fine, noting that it’s not hot in the room or it’s nice outside, yet this affects me. It literally could be snowing outside and I’ll walk into a room and start sweating. As I said this has greatly affected my social life; I can’t take women out on dates in a formal setting, I can’t hold conversations or make eye contact for longer than 30 seconds. It’s exhausting…and for the record I’m not on drugs, or coming down off any substance. Yet, this syndrome almost makes me feel like I am the way people look at me dripping sweat in an air conditioned building. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice/tips on how to rectify this?

"I have a specific scenario:

Let’s say I’m a teenager who’s in High School/Secondary school. Suppose also, that I come from a Lower-middle class family. Not necessarily dirt poor, but below the average income of a family relative to my country. For the location, I could live in the US, Canada, Western Europe, or Northern Europe. For the time period, it’s 1995-2005.

I really like pulling pranks on my friends. And Halloween is just around the corner, so I really want to give them a scare! So I devise a plan to leave a scary voicemail on their Landline pretending to be a stalker or spy, or whatever such thing that would scare/intrigue them.

Assuming it’s in the parameters I said in the first paragraph

- Is it possible to hide or distort my voice to make it unrecognizable to my own? It doesn’t have to be a high tech solution or perfect, but just reasonable enough so that they don’t know it’s me.

- Is it possible to hide my landline number so that they don’t know it was me? Could I use a phone booth or a landline from a different location? (If they see it’s my number, they’ll know it’s me!)

- Assume I’m **very** determined on this prank, and I’m willing to spend hours, perhaps days, to plan and execute.

That’s the scenario. I was born in 2003 and I remember that my parents had a home phone, but don’t really remember how it worked. So I need some older people to enlighten me on the technology of the time.

"So i get that the differential (more or less) is present where the engine is located (generally) or better is located where the driven wheels are, so the driven wheels need the differential because...are driven, so the engine's power must be transferred to the wheels in a way that allow different rotation of wheels...but this is the case in the driven wheels, since they must be connected to the gearbox (sorry for mistakes, if present, i have only a basic understanding of mechanic in a car).

If the thing i said above are correct, the rear wheels (in the case of a FWD) are not driven, but they still should be able to spin at different speeds, so when we talk about ""axles"" in reality...what do we mean?

they can't be connected by a solid axle, so there's like two ""half"" of axle that are connected to a some kind of differential? Or just connected to ...well something?

Also, if this is true, in reality there's one ""axle"" for wheel, since they have to be all connected yes, but not ""attached"" in a single axle.

"So I am a 24-year-old male, I’ve actually known this girl since childhood we actually went to elementary school and high school together. I’m about to tell you a long story before I get into any more personal issues that I’m dealing with in regards of our relationship. We met when I was in fifth grade, and she was in the fourth grade, she was a nerdy girl who had no friends, and was often really quiet. I was hanging out with a group of friends, and for some odd and messed up reason my friends started picking on her, but because I wanted to impress my friends, and wanted to be in their group.

 I played along with it, and one day my friends made me push her on the playground which I did, and when I pushed her her, I felt guilty. Ultimately, she yelled and screamed at me, and the yard duties came to see what happened and of course I got in trouble, and she started crying and I was heartbroken because I didn’t mean to do it, and of course I got suspended for it but I remember I couldn’t sleep all night and I felt guilty for what I did. 

The next day I came back from my suspension. I walked up to her and she was scared and told me that she didn’t want any trouble and to please leave her alone and what I did was I just hugged her and I told her how I sorry I was and that I didn’t mean to and that I actually liked her in the beginning and that I was just following along and then, of course, from there we became friends and I let her in with open arms and we were inseparable and of course those idiots didn’t want to be my friend anymore and started picking on me as well. 

Eventually we had our puppy love experience, we held hands we hugged, and we had our first kiss on the playground and then after that, I said, I love you and then she said it back. Eventually , she moved away, and I missed her and we didn’t reconnect up until high school. She was still living in the area and we were still friends. Then, eventually, she moved away after high school.

 She was still living in the area and we were still friends, a few months ago we started connecting more and everything else especially when I went out to LA to visit her and eventually we started dating and then she moved to my hometown so we can be closer and we’re together and not too long ago she revealed to me that she was related to one of my favorite singers, and I’m not gonna say who and the reason why she didn’t tell me soon enough it’s because she was told to keep it a secret but when she knew how trustworthy I was she was able to spill the beans. 

So with that being said the problems that we’re having in our relationship is how I’m gonna be able to pursue the relationship knowing that she’s related to one of my favorite singers who is really famous and what I’m worried about is that if anybody catches glimpse of it how much publicity we’re gonna have to face and I just want to live a normal life and not deal with crazy fans hassling us because they are impressed that I’m dating someone who’s related to a huge celebrity and everything else so I just need advice on what I should do since she’s related to a well known celebrity?",How do you pursue a relationship normally with somebody who is related to a really famous celebrity?,18ozi98,1703312576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18ozi98/how_do_you_pursue_a_relationship_normally_with/,

"So this happened just about a year ago and I have not gone back since. But before this happened it was absolutely my favorite restaurant. It is the only place I can get a real bowl of Ramen that's a reasonable drive. Me and my family ate there almost every other week, likely too much but still.  
The day it happened I finished the whole bowl and was about to start sipping the broth when I noticed it floating there (I do have pictures but won't post them here, if people ask I could post in comments or DM) We called the waitress over, which of course she was horrified, and grabbed her manager. The manager apologized but she did not comp the meal, instead she gave me an extra free to-go order of the same type of Ramen. which did not feel right (we did not ask to be comped over just the shock of it all) and they also gave this free bottled drink which honestly wasn't bad. But to get the point. I for sure miss going to this place. their reviews have never gone down, 4.8 stars, and I've not seen any complaints close to what had happened to me.

"*Not sure if this breaks the rules because it’s about illegal substances, but I want to clarify that this is purely curiosity. I’m not looking for advice on doing or trying to source drugs.* 

Pretty much the title. To elaborate, alcohol, nicotine, weed, shrooms, and prescription drugs all have rules for responsible consumption that are pretty easy to find. 

Growing up as a faithful D.A.R.E. kid, I’ve always been afraid of all drugs, which extended to prescription drugs as I got older. And now, I won’t try something unless I can find a lot of information about safe consumption practices and knowing the risks before hand.

"Hello! 

I recently went at a molding session for custom Ear Pro(tection), but now I have to order it's hard to decide with color use 🤔
So, a stupid *not stupid* question : what color for custom Ear Pros?
Because, ""*do or do not, there is no try, and pay 90 bucks*""

Usage : 
+ good chunk of the day, almost always when outside, used most of days, because very annoyed of noise (kinda autistic)
+ listening loud concert (Rock and Metal 90 to 113 dB (place where custom Ear Pro don't seem to be an unpopular thing))
+ my hearing is already a bit damaged so 'am protecting what's left. 

They told me to get the -26 dB linear filter when they saw my audiograph because of ""yeah, you really need it"". 

On one hand, taking them white or transparent, people wouldn't notice I wear them, so, maybe no or less bad behaving against me when wearing them?
 
(I already have enough bad behavior against me because of my main disability, like, stuff I need to walk, etc) 

On the other hand, if a take the black or flashy colored ones, people would understand from the start that they should talk louder to me, or make me a sign so I'll take them off. 
So... easier interaction? 

I don't have that much interest / preference about the color or how it is fashion or not

There are : highly visible (let's say green phosphorescent) or almost invisible (transparent or white, with ""glitter"" effect). 

On one hand, some people could think ""he doesn't want to be disturbed"" bc of them while wrong. 
On the another hand, color could be an ice breaker or catch the eye in a good sense 😅?

"I would like to know why it is that certain beaches are protected by lifeguards and others aren’t? This lifeguard protection I am talking about includes things such as lifeguards saving drowning people, different flags to indicate if it is safe to swim and surf or not, and also warning signs.  
I notice that places like California and Hawaii are heavily protected, but the beaches in my area in the South-West of Scotland have nothing like this, even though we can have 25 degrees centigrade summers, jellyfish, and rough water currents and dodgy weather at times.  
I feel it would be useful for people in my area to know how safe the beaches are, so I find it to be a bit of a outrage that no one is smart enough to use flags, signs and lifeguards, even though these things make beaches far safer than they otherwise would be. It’s not that we are remote either, some coastal towns here have over 15,000 people, and Ayr in South Ayrshire has around 45,000 citizens.

From the ages of 14-15, I went on a diet to lose some weight. I ate 3 small meals a day and didn’t track cals or anything (oats, tuna sandwich, chicken/rice) and exercised a lot (did lots of running and sports). 

I ended up getting pretty skinny (44kg at 5’3), but started bulking up by 16, and grew to 5’7 by 21.

For context, my parents are 4’11 and 5’8.

With the pain came swelling of the wrist and hand. It was most noticeable yesterday and today when the pain reached its peak.  
Soothing hydrogels (i.e. solosite) have only temporarily alleviated the pain.  
We went to see an orthopedist about the issue and we were advised it could be due to high uric acid concentration in her blood, thus causing gout. The doc came to this conclusion partially due to her recent blood tests showing a higher-than-normal uric acid concentration (849 umol/L).  
She's also eaten seafood (including shellfish) and some soup containing pork the last few days.  
The doc also recommended wearing a brace/cast for the wrist and using a type of anti-inflammatory patch for the next few days to help reduce the pain/swelling.  
Since seeing the doc, the pain somehow seems to be travelling up her arm today.

I reached other conclusions, but, as I did with this one, they were all also dismissed. All this thinking, reaching a conclusion only to end up dismissing said conclusion has exhausted me. Now, looking back, maybe the initial conclusion I reached is actually it, at least for me.

The purpose of life is relative as with all things. The purpose of a hammer relative to a carpenter would be for hammering in nails to wood. However, relative to a psycho it's purpose could be for murder. Same goes for me, my purpose is relative. Relative to my mother, my purpose is to love her, and many more. Relative to a friend, my purpose is to be there for them, and many more. Relative to those I care about as a whole, my purpose is of course to care for and love them, and many more. Relative to humanity as a whole, my purpose may be to leave a positive impact. Relative to the universe as a whole separate from me, my purpose may be to understand it, and many more.

It can be a place you have only seen on a photo or TV, or even better, you already were there and it was a bulls eye for you. I am asking because, as a guy born and raised in Croatia, it was always something on a seaside with a beach what would make a perfect holiday for me and, more or less, everyone I know from my friends I grew up (Hawaii for example). But then, I moved to Munich a few years ago, and there is a large number of people that prefer to go to mountains or for example Alaska, Norway, cold places like that, what my close minded brain can not comprehend. It is obvious for me, that it is influenced by surroundings where you were born and that it is also some kind of a habit for many people. How many of you are sandy beaches type of people, and how many are there more for ice and snow?

"I was watching a video or documentary on Youtube where the guy filming who happens to create social media content on travelling and what not, was actually travelling with the migrants from Brazil to the US border.

It was interesting to watch but at the same time you realize that the route or routes these migrants follow, can be really dangerous. They cross countries, jungles, rivers, lakes......till they finally reach the US Southern border.

There's a risk of being robbed or simply killed and unfortunately this seems to happen to some of those who don't have enough money and take the more difficult and risky paths.....

Most end up crossing Rio Grande and then wait for the border agents and guards to arrest them in order to be sent to facilities where they claim asylum. But what happens if some lose their IDs and belongings and have nothing on them as they arrive? How would they prove who they are, how old they are, their names, etc..... because I guess that US authorities need that information to process the whole thing. But if someone lost everything on the way, with no possible way to prove their identity, what happens?

"This has puzzled me for a long time because it's a way to force the referee's whistle even as the opposing team's striker runs into a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper, and the arguments against it don't appeal to me.  
The counter-arguments I came up with and why don't make much sense in my opinion:  
1) **It's a matter of culture and fair play of fans watching the games** \- this is certainly a nonsensical argument in my opinion, because I don't believe that there won't be at least one fan at such a World Cup final who could do it to make his country win the championship, for example.  
2) **It is impossible to smuggle a ball as a fan** \- that's not true, it is very easy to smuggle at least an uninflated ball in your pants or anywhere under your clothes, and a small pump, fans inspection before matches is not so strict, I've been to several matches and it was possible to do something like that without any problems.  
3) **Penalties discourage fans** \- the same as in the first point, I do not believe that there is not a single fan who could do it even in exchange for a sizable financial penalty, just so that his club wins the Champions League or the national team wins the World Cup  
4) **It's hard to throw that far** \- if you have a seat behind your team's goal in most stadiums there should be no problem for someone physically fit  


I understand that not in every match such an action would be useful, but it still happens much less often than I would have bet on looking at how much it can change the course of a match - especially during counterattacks from which there is a good chance of scoring a goal.

I was shoveling the driveway and went to grab my ice chopper which I hadn't used since last Winter. It's usually kept in a large bin in the corner of my garage along with various other large tools.

Well I looked inside and could not see it. So I moved some of the other tools around, used a flashlight and it was nowhere to be found. Probably looked for a solid 5 minutes.

I searched around the garage, couldn't find it anywhere. Went back to the bin a few times, not there either. 

I was annoyed but figured maybe it got stolen or someone took it by accident somehow. I just shrugged it off.

Well the following day I decided to go out and buy a new one, but figured I'd check the bin one last time. 

And sure enough it was there, right in the bin where it should have been. Not even hidden or anything, quite visible. I kid you not I looked in there SEVERAL times.

"I’m not exactly sure if this question fits here, but I genuinely don’t know where to post it. None of the affiliated subs seem to fit any better.

My ex and I split up years ago. Their grandparent gave them a piece of jewelry that they rarely ever wore, since it meant a lot to them and that particular grandparent had passed away before they and I met. They were heartbroken when they couldn’t find it one day, and it never showed up.

The jewelry item itself is worthless monetarily (as in, it’s not precious metal or stone, purely decorative). But, during the holiday today I was helping my parents by fixing their dryer belt (which requires taking off the front of the dryer). My ex and I used to wash clothes at my parent’s house when we were together, and lo and behold, while fixing the belt, I found the piece of jewelry covered in lint. It probably fell into the dirty clothes bin, or was in a pocket before we washed clothes and must have fallen through the lint trap since it is fairly small.

Normally I would think that yes, I should return it. But our relationship ended after I found out she was cheating, which just so happened to be the same night my brother died. Their completely nonchalant attitude towards my grief and being glued to their phone while I was crying is what clued me in that something wasn’t right. It fucked me up and I really still haven’t gotten over it. I cut contact with them shortly after, ignoring calls and texts for a couple years until I stopped getting them.

On one hand, I know that having this item returned would make them extremely happy because they were heartbroken at its loss. On the other hand, I don’t want this to be interpreted as me wanting to be involved with them. The petty side of me thinks I should just toss it in the garbage, but the bigger person in me thinks the right thing to do would be to return it.

We maintained 0 mutual friends and the last time I looked at their profile online they were moving to another state. That was almost 3 years ago. The only way I know to contact them now would be sending a message on Facebook.

"Again this is my belief, nothing is based off of any evidence and I’d like to just know what others think about this. 

So ever since I was young I’ve always measured intelligence bracketing them down to 4 different types of intelligence. 


- Physical intellect: Having an extensive knowledge and understanding of a certain subject or that of a wide variety of subjects to a greater degree than the average.

- Emotional intellect: To have a greater understanding than the average of the feelings within yourself and others. To be emotionally intelligent one has to be able to sympathise with others of all walks of life throughout the entirety of the emotional spectrum. 

- Social intellect: This is defined by the ability of knowing what to say or do in a variety of situations to manipulate and influence others via interactions of any kind intentionally. 

- Environmental intellect: Being aware of your surrounding environment to a greater degree than the average, knowing how to take care of one’s self or others within the environment that they live in and or have a greater understanding of other environments and being able to quickly adapt. 


In summary, I believe that true intelligence is measured by these 4 factors.
Someone could excel in one of these 4 categories but not the others may score lowly due to their lack in the other categories. 

For instance a doctor of medicine may have an extensive knowledge of a variety of different medications and their ability to have an effect on the human body would score quite highly when it comes to physical intelligence.

However this theoretical doctor may not know how to nurture and care for a child or give the emotional support to a dying relative and would score quite lowly on the emotional intelligence bracket. 

Or for instance the personal trainer knew exactly what to say to sell his services to his customer to encourage them to train with him, would be considered socially intelligent. Because they were able to understand how to persuade said customer, in turn benefiting themselves. 

However if any of these people forget to look both ways before crossing the street and die they would rank quite lowly due to them not being environmentally intelligent. 
As opposed to the street hoodlum who might be a complete nuisance to the rest of us but is so used to being on the streets that he knows to look both ways on that partially busy road.

To conclude I believe all of these intelligences are just as important as the other to measure intellect accurately.

"Everything seems to go in one ear and out the other instantly, I can't even perform basic tasks.

I first started really noticing it when I was 14 and I worked a fast food job but for some reason I couldn't figure out the most basic things. I had to have everything repeated, walked-thru, and when left to do it myself I was entirely lost no matter how many times the task was demonstrated. Im still that way😭

Same thing with school, I could never understand the most basic shit, and I always went thru multiple people trying to explain it to no avail. 
Even when I did manage to learn something, I forgot the next day even if I spent the entire previous day going over it.
My ass dropped out

Admittedly it was lack of effort, UNTIL I genuinely started trying, studying, asking questions, etc, and was still dull ash

It's not even just work or school though, I can't understand what my friends are saying half the time, and they aint even tryna explain anything. Im never really aware of whats going on around me, I have eyes but they don't see. The most basic every day things confuse me.

Also recently it took me a month to find out the same person was texting me from a different number despite them explicitly telling me💀 AND IT WAS OBVIOUS ASF 

People around me get frustrated by it, and I don't blame them. 
I'm frustrated too.

I'm currently 17 which is practically an adult, and I don't want to enter adulthood this stupid because it's more embarrassing than just being a dumb kid💀 like how tf am i gon survive like this

"Hello,

I am having a hard time looking this up online as I'm not sure how to word this concisely. Searching ""entire dinnerware set chart"" brings up how to set a table and that's not exactly what I'm looking for.

My question is: Is there a list or chart of every single dish you could own for serving food in a household? Not for cooking food, not cookware like pots and pans but more like the things that go on your table like you have this many plates with these utensils and your butter dish and your sugar dish and your side dish bowls, and a coffee/tea pot, a pitcher and the glasses sets, and the salad bowl, and dessert plates, etc etc.

The reason I am interested in this is because I have been into cooking lately but I don't have a complete set of plates. I have a few plates that match bowls and a set of cups that are neutral enough that it look cohesive but when serving more people like now during the holidays I have to put food in different bowls and such. I'd like to get a complete set of everything I could need!!!! for any kind of meal!!!! And have it on hand. The tricky part is that I don't like white plane decor I like things with a design. I think it's a bit wild of me to want this but I think I can make it happen or at least get the main things with a design and separate things that match enough that are the same color to look cohesive : )",dinnerware and serveware set,18qce98,1703482891.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qce98/dinnerware_and_serveware_set/,

I am certain I did not ejaculate inside her, but I woke up the next day and realized that the condom broke, meaning we likely had a bit of unprotected sex. I texted her this, saying I was a bit worried and that maybe she should take plan B? Her response was that she was due for her period in a couple days (therefore likely infertile) and that she was on birth control and had not missed a day so she thought it would be fine. I said ""thanks, that makes me feel better - I'm heading back on the plane to my city, shoot me a text if you're ever in [my city]."" She didn't respond.

Anyways we haven't spoke since then due to being 6 hour plane ride away from each other. I saw that she's posting instagram stories as normal.

But out of the blue, 2.5 months later on the night of Saturday December 23rd she texts me last night ""Hey"" at 1am my time (11pm her time), at which time I was already sleeping. I woke up the next morning and this has sent me into a panic spiral. I texted her ""what's up"" at 6:30am when I woke up and then ""all good?"" at like 1pm, and no response. It's 4:30 pm EST now and no response. I tried calling her a few times but it's gone straight to VM each time.

Basically I'm really worried she's going to tell me she's pregnant. Or maybe she was drunk at her Christmas party and decided to text me late at night.

A few days ago I tried making plans with him. He said that day probably wouldn't work because his work would probably be running late. Last minute he then texted me asking if that day would still work. I said no because he said it wouldn't work and that I had made plans already. I then asked why we don't just make plans in advance. He then said he doesn't like being ""held up"" unless it's for his job, otherwise he prefers doing what he wants. I said I respect that, but asked how we could meet. He didn't answer. He then called me, very pissed and annoyed, asking why we can't meet. I again said I'd made plans because he said that day wouldn't work. He was seething. This kind of thing has happened several times.

There have been times where I've complimented him or wished him a good day and he gets pissed off. One time he called me ""facetious."" I once said I was from [insert US state] and grew up there, to which he said ""Yeah you seem like you're from there."" He says he values silence, but then when I'm silent while hanging with him, he gets pissed and asks me ""What?"" to which I always reply ""Nothing."" I once said I was going to the Hamptons to visit, and he said ""You definitely like the nouveau riche."" I asked him what made him think that, to which he changed the subject.

I cannot remember someone ever being so bold in asking for drugs. I’m not a square but I have ever even seen cocaine in my life much less possess it to sell.  So I responded “uhh nope sorry”

* Him: Are you sure? Someone told me you did. 
* Me: Uhh nope, just here at the game with my son (gesturing towards him)
* Him: Oh ok, good. I’m actually undercover so it’s all good

This is what I’m guessing happened:  Someone was selling cocaine in the bathroom, and someone did tell the guy to find a guy that looks vaguely like me and ask him. He mistakenly asked me and when he realized that I really am not a drug dealer he pretended like he was an undercover cop so that I wouldn’t go tell someone that some dude is trying to buy coke in the bathroom.

"Most people seem to have a very negative option of that subreddit, and I feel like I'm one of those... but does the sub have anything going for it?

I would say that there is definitely value in what the idea of a subreddit where people can ask for honest ratings and genuinely receive them rather than being coddled by people who don't want to hurt your feelings. I would even say there is some credibility to some of the material they link to with regards to a few things that are ""objectively"" attractive like high facial symmetry, even proportions, healthy skin, etc.

However, the memes are very much true about the subreddit. If you look at the comments, you will see ""warning for over/under rating"" on any rating outside of roughly the 4.5-5.5 range. It even seems very common for people to be banned for consistenly overrating or underrating.

The mods are apparently strict on their idea that no rating is allowed to carry subjective reasoning... but then why allow voting at all? Is the idea not then to have the rating guide (presumably produced by one or more of the mods) on one screen and rate people referencing that? That kind of just seems like a roundabout way of having the mods rate you, and given how heavily subjective I would suggest the higher end of their scales are, there doesn't seem to be much value in that.

I'm interested in the concept, but it seems like the execution is poor enough that the subreddit is basically just a place to go to rate everyone a 4.5 or be told off and eventually banned. I would argue that subjective ratings would need to be allowed, then averaged, to have value to the person submitting their photos; personal preference is too much of a factor to be ignored.

I’ve seen a lot of memes and videos about a “goth gf” and I’ve also seen people complain that those jokes get goth culture super wrong.

People seem to associate goth solely with dark colored, revealing clothes and niche/kinky interests. Meanwhile the subreddit for goth people seems to say being goth is mostly about exotic, horror-esque fashion, and the gothic music genre. 

Although, EDM/rave culture does seem to have some of the stuff people want a “goth gf” for. Dark clothes probably make the neon light accessories stand out so that’s probably common. The rave subReddit showcases a lot of revealing clothes people wear at rave parties and there is also heavy emphasis on the niche of drug use for pleasure.

He was very polite and said he understood my hesitance, then handed me his card and told me two cryptic things: first, to “not go with the other guys who were gonna make the same offer” and also to have a happy new year as he “had a feeling 2024 was going to be a big one for me.” 

I googled his name when I got to the car and he’s legit— he’s a top level executive at Warner Brothers who is mentioned in a couple articles, and his picture online is definitely the guy that was in the store.

"A few days ago I accidentally got water on the screen and some went down by the bottom and possibly went behind the plastic covering. Attempted to get it all wiped up but couldn't really get behind it. Tested the TV an hour later and it worked. Later that night I turn the TV on, everything was fine, then the remote acted like it was shorting out because every time I aimed it directly in front of the TV and towards the bottom panel where I think the receptor is? it wouldn't work but it would work if I aimed it to the sides or indirectly at the TV, so I thought it was either the receptor, batteries or remote. I've went through 3 different pairs of batteries so it isn't that. 

I don't know how or why my remote would just quit working, it fell a few times since having it but nothing broke so far. And I want to think (but don't want to since that's a larger issue) that it's the sensor but it isn't like a lot of water got on it. The water smashed right at the bottom near where the screen and plastic connects so it's possible some went down behind the plastic but wtf? I just got this TV as a present earlier this year.

"I found a spider in my bed almost a month ago, Chunky thick one the size of a dime. I'm thinking it's a wolf spider. But crawled into the sides before I could catch it. 

I pushed through my fear to sleep in my bed, until tonight, I wake up with a swollen kind of flat lump mosquito bite. Except I hear no mosquito. Now I'm researching a bunch of spider facts i have found for your amusement below read some horrible quora stories, and would like an opinion on if you think the spider is still there?

P. S. Some facts I saw

1. spiders try to find warm places in winter e.g. I have the coldest room in my house, but then my bed is warm so..... 

2. Spiders are more likely to be near your bed if you have storage underneath (I do) 

3. Wolf spider males travel around, especially at winter looking for female mates which like warm places. 

4. Spiders can slip through cracks into your homes. (my house has giant cracks in the walls that I can put a whole hand in) 

5. Most spider bites are actually just bacterial inflammation. A study recorded spider bites in Australia only to find 2 were bitten passively, the rest were when ppl tried to catch a spider. (though how do you know u were bitten in ur sleep) 

6. Most spiders try to stay away from us, but unfortunately despite 8 eyes, have very bad eyesight (except for jumping spiders) and can only detect motion. So your motion either seems like a potential predator or prey to some curious spiders","Found a spider in my bed, then a bite, what are the odds it comes back",18q5prj,1703457923.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18q5prj/found_a_spider_in_my_bed_then_a_bite_what_are_the/,

"Recently a man local to me went missing and the picture the family used looked absolutely nothing like him at the time he went missing. It was an old pic from when he was clean, I didn't even recognize him (I knew who he was from seeing him around town semi-regularly). He was missing for about a week but when they found him deceased it was rumored he'd only been dead a day or two and it occurred to me that people who have seen him wouldn't have been able to recognize him from the picture. There were more recent pics on his social media that looked more like him at the time of disappearance so it wasn't for lack of recent photos. 

Opioid addiction is a big problem where I live so this situation is not uncommon but thankfully missing persons are often found alive. I've noticed a trend though, more times than not the photos the families use are often from times when the person was clean and healthy looking, and if you come across a current photo of the person they are barely recognizable from the older photos used in the missing persons posts.

"I have two friends that I met while in esthetician school and we got super close while there. We were a trio , and spent ALOT of time together. The other 2 member of this group — a little background. 

Person A —(28 F) just got out of a physically abusive relationship , has a young dog.
Person B — (28 F) also just got out of a toxic relationship , and her mom is dying. 
Me — (22 F) just had a baby 4 months ago , single mom , still dealing with ex , SA’d by a family member while going to school. 

Person A and Person B live close to eachother , I however live 30+ minutes away. I was driving to them every time we hung out. It started to get annoying bc I eventually moved out of my parents and into a new apt while in school , and person A did as well. I have been to her apt , and AMPLE amount of times , while having a newborn , and brought him with me. 

She has not been to my apartment once , and barely makes time for me unless it’s on her terms and convenient for her. And every time I bring up them coming to my place , Person A uses her dog as an excuse , which I told her she could bring with her , it wasn’t a problem. 

I’m obviously closer with person B , she has the same love languages as me and she’s like a sister. Person A thinks spending money on meals and such is enough to make a friendship go round. She’s also very absent minded and half listens to you when you speak — you have to repeat yourself 10 times before she registers it all. 

A lot of her habits feed into my fear of abandonment — gifts and money were always used against me as a child,  she’s late for everything , and I feel like I come second to everyone in regard to her.

"I’ve always been quite sensitive to negative things that people say to me and the memory sticks and angers me for years and years. 

Some examples are I remember many things my aunt said to me as a kid. Although she was a good help in some situations I still feel resentment. For example I fainted on my first day of work and kept having periods of intense anxiety/panic attacks avoiding college. I remember her saying stuff like don’t be soft and ‘ we were made of stronger stuff when younger’. She was a mental health nurse too which just made me feel extra weak. There were many catty comments she made similar to this 

It’s the same with my dad I remember being angered by comments. whenever I wanted to discuss something which contradicted his view his reaction was just ‘oh piss off’. I was called a b**** countless times and he often put my looks down. I’m no angel I mean I said stuff too I guess up to being about 14 then I started to ignore him. Though ignoring only does so much he has to be called out on his name calling/sarcasm now and then or else if totally ignored he gradually gets worse and worse. 

My point is whoever is right or wrong, how can I stop feeling resentment for people for comments they made years ago?  It happens at work too peoples comments flow through my head at night and I feel angry/can’t get to sleep.

"So, you're put in a spot where you want to invite over your group of friends for like a nice reunion get-together to catch up with one another. Only thing is, one of your friends is asking for vegan options - you on the otherhand, are on a short budget and could only really cater to the majority of what the other guests want to eat.

For this example - let's have a simple barbecue. You can feed a lot of people there and shouldn't break the bank too much, only thing is - whatever veggie meat option there is would stretch our budget too thin.

Would you be in the wrong to just tell your friend that they'll either have to bring their own food or just tell them that you cannot accomodate for their particular needs?

I personally am leaning currently on just not accomodating them if it ever comes down to it. I know that it would be mean spirited of me to not try and include them, but there's also this thing with most vegans I know - They don't even know how to compromise with the average person not being vegan. Like, the situation then revolves around the vegan preaching and how we should get on the same lifestyle too.

Like look man, you're really leaving me with little options here. If you're a vegan with non-vegan friends, I hope you never try to get them into that lifestyle, because oh lord is it a huge pain in the ass to find the fucking food accomodation for you and your people. Not to mention, most vegan options are expensive dude, at least learn how to sympathize a bit with how much we're struggling currently.

"So my grandfather wrote a book about his life that I've just recently gotten a physical copy of. My grandfather is generally a man of few words and difficult to have a conversation with at his age and after a stroke, but I've heard from other family members that he has lived a really incredible life. 

It is only printed in Mandarin Chinese and I want to translate it into English. I can understand conversational Mandarin pretty well, but my reading and writing skills are not enough to understand a book as complicated as this one with military and political jargon. 

I don't want to hire a professional translator and I don't mind that it will probably take me a while. I'll do it as a little side project. 

The book itself has the spine on the right and opens to the left -- which is different from what I'm used to -- and the characters are read top to bottom, right to left. It is about 166 pages. 

I'll try to scan the book to pdf first and then I figure I'll use some sort of translating software to help me out with a rough translation. Then I'll go through it manually to correct any mistakes and do some research on political context to make sure I'm getting it right.

Of all the verses, I’ll accept that five golden rings could be about ring-necked peasants. I’ll even consider pipers— as these are another type of bird. Milk maids, drummers, ladies dancing, leaping lords. I’m not buying every verse is about birds.

obviously everybody has their preferences, and every couple is slightly different, if not drastically

Drove right down the street and back up and drove off down the main drag. Dog isn't barking any more but they heard it (noise bylaw is in effect) and did absolutely nothing and I believe it's because it's one of their own.

"This has been a long time coming, as I’ve started to get a little more desperate in reaching out for advice. I know he has a harder time doing so, as he’s so ashamed of his addiction. 

My partner has been using Meth for over a decade. He started using various drugs in his mid teens, but that’s what has always stuck. About 3 years ago, he chose to quit and left a toxic relationship with a partner that also used. Around this time, he also got a DUI as he had been using and drinking, but was only charged for the alcohol in his system as that’s what he was pulled over for. Obviously COVID slowed everything down, and he finally “failed” his diversion program in November and was sentenced to complete the 90 day outpatient sobriety program by June, as well is on probation for 18 months. He has not started the 90 program, as he has not been able to pay the evaluation fee yet. 

I have been under the impression that in the past three years, there has been more time sober than relapsing. Today, I was coming inside from taking the dog out and saw a pipe sticking out of his backpack. He occasionally smokes DMT, and I know what that pipe and substance looks/smells like. This pipe neither looked nor smelled like DMT. I calmly informed him that I am aware of the pipe and that I know it’s not DMT. He initially tried to gaslight me and tell me that that’s just because “he cleaned it”. I waited, and he admitted it was meth. He’s relapsed a few times, and has always been honest with me when I confronted him, but lies to me when I’m just suspicious. I asked him how long this time and he said “for the past decade”. He explained that he’s definitely had moments where he wasn’t using, but that they have been very short lived and he starts to use again very shortly after. He got upset (understandably) and went to leave. I asked him if we could just talk about it tomorrow as it’s Christmas and I’d like to not end it this way, he agreed. 

He’s currently in a SMART recovery program voluntarily, but this is to address a gambling addiction. His previous diversion program was aimed to help with drinking. He also doesn’t have many friends, and the person he spends most of his time with outside of work and home is an older person who he has nothing in common with and met through their dealer years ago. This person has no respect for my partner and only reaches out when he needs something or wants to go get drugs (I’ve been told the same current dealer supplies meth and DMT). This person is a huge source of conflict in our relationship. 

I know none of this is my fault nor my problem to fix, but my partner means the world to me and I truly think he’s an incredible, kind, giving, beautiful person who struggles with addiction, rather than a “garbage addict” as he usually refers to himself. I’ve been direct, but supportive through everything, but I am all too aware that a person doesn’t change unless they want to and put in the work to do so.

So what now? Will he fail his sobriety program and go to jail? Do I kick him out and stop paying for his lifestyle and let him figure out his own mess? We’ve been together for 1.5 years, moved in together 3 months ago, I helped him get a job he actually enjoys and not working with other users, we’ve spent the past few months setting up an aquarium (I funded this as a gift) so that he had a new hobby to focus on. I can’t afford our apartment by myself. 

If anyone has advice on what they think would be helpful to him or this situation, even brutally honest, I’d be so incredibly grateful. Thanks for reading this and thanks in advance ❤️",My partner is in active addiction. I’m not sure if I’m coddling/enabling or being supportive.

"I posted this before but deleted the wrong post.. give me a break, it's super early here. XD 

I know I am a very literal person at times (I am German) and an overthinker. I've worked on it, but part of it is upbringing and cultural. I also know we all have things to improve on, including me.. I'm not angry at my wife, I love her very much actually. I'm just lost on communication styles sometimes and would like a different insight. I know she doesn't do this on purpose. Help me understand myself, constructive criticism or ways to not overthink or get anxious... maybe a book I or we could read? 

Example 1: we did Xmas separate this year. Her back to the US and me to Germany. She told me she'd let me know when she landed safely so I wouldn't worry. She didn't.. I got text messages she must have sent from after boarding about 15 minutes after landing, which must have been sent when she connected to wifi.. that was around 0200 my time, but nothing like, ""Hey babe, I made it."" I didn't get anything until almost 5 hours after she landed. And I got a, ""Sorry, my phone doesn't have service unless I'm connected to wifi."" I know she connected otherwise I wouldn't have gotten those other messages. 

When I landed in Germany, I didn't have wifi either, but I connected to airport wifi and then my mom's phone to let her know. It would have literally taken a minute to do so.. i.e., while in customs or baggage claim... which she said took over 30 minutes. It takes like 1 minute to say, ""hey I landed safely."" 

Example 2: I had to pick her up from work. In a pretty poor country we currently work in. Her phone died during her work event. I waited at her work for over an hour, and nothing. I asked a coworker who came out of her work and asked him to text her other coworker, so I had an idea how long I'd be waiting or if I should head home. She then said it didn't even cross her mind to ask somebody else to use their phone, or send an email. 

Example 3: she visited her sister. She told me she'd call me at 1700. I had left work early to go grocery shopping and got to the store at 1655 and thought, ""damn, if I go now, I will miss her call."" So I waited. Until her call 30 minutes later. I was annoyed, I could've at least gotten a quick 3 word text that she was busy and will call later than agreed upon.

Example 4: she said hey I'll text you later and send you a bunch of pictures from her dog and herself, and Xmas dinner. I was super excited and waited almost two days and only got pics after I asked twice. 

In the end I think I'd rather not be told something and then not get it. Or should I just expect that it will be a 50/50 if it happens? 

And no, I'm not controlling or need communication 24/7. I used to need communication, but have worked a lot on myself. I just assume that when somebody says something, they do it, or at least let somebody know when they can't.. especially when I'm awake half the night worrying something might have happened at the airport or with the flight. 

I dont want to bring it up, I want her to enjoy her vacation, she deserves it and I don't want to argue. I just feel when you say you will contact me when you made it safely to the US from an international flight, I kinda expect that to happen?

Is it just different communication styles? Is it because I've been military all my life and you're constantly expected to respond and be accurate, on time and precise?

"So, a few months ago my friends pushed me to purchase the dillion danis fight so we could watch it. I did, regretfully. Now DAZN won't stop trying to charge me $20 monthly. I've cancelled, but the charges continue monthly for a full year, which is obviously weird and different from any subscription I've ever used before. I have them on my cashapp though, which does not have enough money to be charged.   
Will this hurt my credit and will there be any other reprecussions in the future if I do not let them charge me?

"I apologize for putting a downer on everyone's Christmas, and I hope this question isn't too stupid because the standard answer on Google is therapy, but I'm trying to find a free or low cost place to go and cry so I can process my feelings. 

Disclaimer that I am not, and will not, think about self harm in any way, shape, or form. 

Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option for me right now due to cost/lack of insurance. 

I'm not at a place mentally where I can talk to my loved ones at home or go to my friends or anything like that. I can't let my vulnerability risk the way I'm seen, and I don't mean that in a tough man way. I mean that in a I'm trying to handle my issues properly as an adult without constantly turning to others living their own lives so that they trust me to handle my issues by myself. 

If I could afford therapy, I’d go in a heartbeat. But sadly, none of the options that exist for me in a different physical location work due to cost. 

So if there’s any way I can find a place to cry that isn’t my bathroom, that would be amazing (if I spend too much time there crying, it’ll come off very suspicious too to those who live with me. I’m not specifying who for anonymity. Could be roommates or family or wife and kids or maybe even I’m in a commune but that doesn’t matter because the point is there is someone else here that my privacy is limited and I have to acknowledge that as I process my issues and trauma. I’ve never been the type to take a long bath or shower so I can’t turn to that either.)

I’ve thought about the library, a coffee shop, and many other places in my area, but unfortunately, none of them have what I need. At least not the ones I can afford to be at. Staying at a hotel/motel isn’t an option for me either due to immense cost. 

I just want to cry. And once I build my money back up, I’ll go to therapy like I should have in the first place.

"Look. I know how people can be on this website, and I know that a lot of questions like this can be thinly veiled attempts to rail against lgbtq folks. So I want to start by saying that I am bisexual and that I believe that the identity of non binary people is entirely valid. I just don’t understand it. 

So like, I get traditional trans people right? They’re born in the wrong gendered body their brain tells them they should have been born in the other type of body and that they should be treated like the gender that’s different from their sex. That I get. But from my admittedly limited understanding of non-binary people, their transiness??? Isn’t like that. From what I understand With most non-binary folks they feel like they don’t conform to societies expectations of what either gender is supposed to be and thus feel that they don’t fall in the category of he’s or hers 

Now part of this could be because I have autism, but that seems strange to me. Not trying to attack anyone. I just genuinely do not understand the concept of changing your identity because of what society thinks. It seems odd to me to like, care about what society says about how boys and girls should act.

"Alright so to start off I’m a high school senior. If you know me you would know that I work my butt off in high school taking leadership positions and hard classes and all that stuff. I know I’m watering it down but just know I mean I worked like REALLY hard so I can apply to good colleges. I did early decision and got into a really good school being in the top 10 schools in the U.S. and I just feel bummed because it feels like my mom really does not feel the way I do. I’m really pumped that I got into this school and I was honestly expecting her to be somewhat also pumped but as soon as I got in she started researching the school I got into and then proceeded to question why I didn’t apply to an Ivy or something. Honestly I felt really hurt and I’ve told her in the past that I don’t want to apply to an ivy because I feel like it’s too much for me (and I wasn’t confident I would get in, I wanted to apply to a school where I felt like I would have somewhat a chance at the time). I remember that I did want to apply to an ivy at some point but it was because I knew my mom would be really hyped that she could brag that her daughter was accepted into an ivy. It just feels really disappointing for me because although I have somewhat acknowledged that I have worked this hard up to this point for myself, there’s a part of me who also worked hard for my mother’s reputation and opinion. Recently I did something not too proud of and my mom then proceeds to comment “you should have gone to (sisters college)”. To give a little bit more context about my older sister, ever since middle school I’ve always been compared to her and everything which developed a lot of insecurities for me and so when she said that it really hurt me because I wanted her to see me for me for once and not compare me. My mom obsessed over my sisters college and so I think she was a bit upset I didn’t apply there. I feel like she also said I should’ve applied to my sisters college because I would have someone look over me. I mean but isn’t going off to college something I should explore on my own because I’ve always relied on my sisters and this new step makes me realize that i want to be more independent and rely on myself. I just feel like when she said that it really just sounded like she isn’t happy I got into my university. It makes me mad at her and myself because what am I even doing. It also makes me feel hurt because I literally don’t want to go to my sisters college (and my college is also ranked way higher so why does my mom obsess over her college so much) ok I know that sounded dumb but I just mean why can’t she also just acknowledge me too. I just remember she was being like this the day I was accepted when I was really hyped and her mood just totally kind of made me kind of sad and disappointed. I feel like it taught me that I should really just work for myself now. Sorry my rant sounds so jumbled but I’m just really upset right now.

**TLDR**: The married professor of the college has been giving a lot of attention and affection. He is trying to get closer and closer through various actions. He is trying to get very personal and tries to stay connected outside of the college. What should I do? How to deal with him?

He's married and he has children.
I know him for 2 years. 

Here are some unusual things I have noticed him do:

1. He usually doesn't remember the names of most students but somehow always remembers my name. With other students, it's like ""What was your name again?"", ""I don't remember her name..."", etc. But he always remembers my name without fail. He even acknowledged it to me, ""I can't remember most students' names, but I always remember yours!""

2. Compliments me and my work to other teachers and colleagues (in front of me, and in my absence as well). 

3. Takes care of me and does little things for me. Like, opening a door, for me turning the fan on, giving me a chair to sit, doing/helping me with a task if it's too difficult for me, like carrying something heavy.

4. Keeps telling me to sing in the singing competitions, or during the prayers (yes, it's an education college/teachers training course and we are taught how to sing prayers). It has happened multiple times. He kept trying to repeatedly tell me to sing and come on the stage during a function. But I didn't obey him. I know I am poor at singing.
Then he was like, ""You are not complying with me! Not fair... Try it, try it just once! I am sure it will be very good!""

5. Teases me and jokes around me, trying to make me laugh (when we are talking one on one). 

6. Weirdly stops speaking during the lecture he's giving, just to stare at me for a long time, then continues the lecture after several seconds, like nothing happened. It has happened several times in the classroom. It made many people uncomfortable.

7. Tells me the positive things his colleagues and other professors have told him about me. 

8. Texts me personally to congratulate me on special achievements and good academic progress.

9. Picks me specifically and gives me little tasks. Like, ""Give me that book from the table"", ""Turn on the light"", ""Give me a pen"", etc.

10. Often picks me specifically to answer the questions in the classroom, even if I don't raise my hand.

11. Watches how I write my answers during the examination, by standing right in front of my seat for several MINUTES.

12. Once he called me for help and made me sit next to him in the staff room to help him arrange and sort the documents/papers for 2 HOURS.

I just know this question is gonna get me executed but I'm very curious about this topic.

So I found myself down a rabbit hole on YouTube again and discovered a community of viewers and creators that focus on ""meltdown videos"", the videos range from cartoon characters being angry to human children being angry, sometimes these videos are skits and sometimes they are full-blown TV shows (Supernanny, Driving Mum and Dad Mad, I Want My Mummy, etc).

In the comment section of these videos, you may find comments that talk about the children/cartoon misbehaving, and quotes from the children/characters. These are normally left by accounts that are maybe fans of a cartoon or some other niche topic.

"I would classify this person as a friend. As we talk pretty often. Very least we have a work friendship.

I feel like I know a lot about her, but I don't think she knows very much about me. She asks the basic how was your day or how are you doing, but any deep conversation has never really been about anything with me.

To my point, I know she's had a very rough year. She's had a car accident, had her school future kind of go into a frenzy, her parents got divorced weeks before Thanksgiving and things have been really crazy for her and she's told me she's not doing well since the divorce. She's told me all about it.

I shared some of my experiences when my parents got divorced so I could tell her I could relate and know how it is.

Ever since she really told me about the divorce in detail a few weeks ago, she's been basically my shadow. She had come into my work area more than once to talk to me. Expressed that she wants to be in contact outside of work but we were interrupted before we exchanged numbers.

During our holiday party, she told me she was disappointed I didn't get to meet her mom and sister because they left before I showed up. She also expressed she wanted us to work together on a project, which we never do.

There's been times before the divorce where she's asked if I'd be interested in doing things together outside of work a few occasions before this, but never thought it was a good idea because I knew she had a boyfriend.

I'm not sure if they are still together, but she's just been laying it on pretty heavy the last few weeks and I can't tell if she just is looking for comfort or something.

"Curious to know if anybody else has kinks you could never openly discuss. I.e. when I met my now wife, I said I have a huge queen of spades, hotwifing kink. She said her biggest kink is an MMF threesome. And man, do we have fantasies sometimes... XD 

I.e. she wore a fake QOS tattoo in public and at the pool and both of us were super turned on by it... I don't think we'd ever do anything, we are loyal and loving. But the thought is what counts.. 

I get you can openly say, ""I like butts, or heels etc."" You can't really openly say, ""we fantasize about my wife sleeping with a black bull."" 

If you do, do you know what caused your kink? As for me, I don't fit into the stereotype-&gt; I'm not a cuckold, or small, or insecure, im fit, successfull etc, I don't want to be degraded... I don't know what caused my kink. Again, I think it's just a fantasy though. I stopped trying to figure out the why, I think it's just a kink. Even though I have been curious to the WHY.

"So, I have not accepted this kind of offer before, and I have never had a credit card either. I need to make a big purchase, and this offer would help if it's legitimate. I have no idea whether, when I'm approved, it'll charge me or ruin my credit score or anything like that.   


I've read through the offer details itself, but it is pretty purposefully unclear on whether being approved for a Prime Visa is the same as having one sent to me, being forced to use it, and automatically being forced to pay it's massive interest rates, and so on.  
   
My questions are: What will I have to do if I accept this deal? What can Amazon do to me? What are potential consequences?

The terms of the Rewards Program Agreement apply to the 5% back and 3% back earned at Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market, including any physical Whole Foods Market locations in the United States and the website accessible at wholefoodsmarket.com and the participating Amazon stores and sites operated by Amazon’s affiliates listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits, and through Chase Travel.  
  
% back and Points: “% back rewards” are the rewards you earn under the program. % back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in % back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see “% back” in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. Eligible Prime memberships only apply to Amazon.com accounts (and not accounts on any other affiliated websites outside the U.S.) and may include, in Amazon’s sole discretion: annual and monthly Amazon Prime subscriptions and members of their Amazon Household (excluding Amazon Prime Video and invited guests of an Amazon Prime account), Amazon Prime Fresh, Amazon Family, Amazon Prime Student and trial memberships of Amazon Prime. Whether a purchase earns 5% back or 3% back, as described below, is determined at the time your eligible Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market or the participating Amazon stores and sites, or Chase Travel purchase is made. How you can earn points: You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Prime Visa or Amazon Visa credit card by you or an authorized user of the card account. Buying products and services with your card account, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count and won’t earn points: transactions on Amazon.com to which you choose to apply a promotional financing offer, balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 5% back or 3% back at Amazon.com, Whole Foods Markets and the participating Amazon stores and sites: You’ll earn 5% back with an eligible Prime membership or 3% back without an eligible Prime membership for each $1 of eligible purchases made using your card account at Amazon.com (including digital downloads, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Fresh orders, Amazon Prime subscriptions, and items sold by third-party merchants through Amazon.com’s marketplace), Whole Foods Market, including any physical Whole Foods Market locations in the United States and the website accessible at wholefoodsmarket.com and the participating Amazon stores and sites listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits. 5% back equates to $0.05 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 5 points. 3% back equates to $0.03 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 3 points. 5% back or 3% back is not earned on (i) purchases from merchants using Amazon Pay, (ii) purchases made at international Amazon retail sites (including but not limited to Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, or Amazon.co.jp), or any other website operated by Amazon that is not listed at Amazon.com/primevisa/benefits and Amazon.com/amazonvisa/benefits, (iii) purchases made at international Whole Foods Markets, (iv) purchases of Whole Foods Market products and services through third-party sites such as Eventbrite, Instacart, Google Express and Shipt, (v) online purchases of Whole Foods Market gift cards (including through buyatab.com), event tickets or classes, (vi) purchases from certain third-party vendors operating at Whole Foods Markets, (vii) purchases of massage services at any Whole Foods Market, or (viii) purchases from Spa@Ink, in each case in Amazon’s sole discretion. 5% back or 3% back through Chase Travel: You’ll earn 5% back with an eligible Prime membership or 3% back without an eligible Prime membership for each $1 spent on purchases made using your card account through Chase Travel. 5% back or 3% back is not earned on purchases made using your card account directly with travel suppliers including airline, hotel, car rentals and cruises. 2% back in rewards categories: You’ll earn 2% back for each $1 spent in the following rewards categories: gas stations; local transit and commuting; restaurants. This equates to $0.02 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 2 points. 1% back: You’ll earn 1% back for each $1 spent on all other purchases. This equates to $0.01 for each $1 spent, which is equal to 1 point. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including eligible purchases at Amazon.com, cash, travel, gift cards, and products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options may vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don’t expire as long as your card account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won’t qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.

The extra % back rewards are earned after the close of each qualifying Daily Rewards posting and are generally available to be used the same day; however, it may take up to one additional day to become available if the extra points are earned after the close of the last qualifying Daily Rewards posting. Daily Rewards will post Sunday through Friday each week. To qualify for these promotional offers, your account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment.

Oi meu nome e Gustavo e hoje na noite de natal dia 25 de dezembro de 2023 eu estou em um dilema se eu mando ou não feliz natal pra uma menina.
Essa história começou a uns 4 meses eu conheci uma menina porque ela estava com ciúmes de mim e de uma melhor amiga minha e por incrível que pareça eu me apaixonei por ela, sei que isso foi uma idiotoce mais ninguém manda no coração, passei por muitas coisa com ela vi a minha melhor amiga se cortar e ela tentar ajudar ela e se cortar tbm mesmo que fosse sem querer isso me machucou muito ver as duas com as mãos vermelhas de sangue, fui inventar de ""proteger"" ela de uma amigo nosso que iria bater nela com uma garrafa e acabei cortando a meu dedo não foi muita coisa mas ficou na minha cabeça, depois de um tempo com influência dos meus amigos eu fiz a maior loucura da minha vida, eu pedi ela em namoro em uma festa que eu e uns amigos meus fizemos juntos, eu não tinha um pingo de esperança que ela iria aceitar mas por incrível que pareça ela aceitou não sei se foi por influência de alguém ou não mas eu me senti a pessoa mais feliz do mundo, dois dias depois eu fui conhecer a mãe dela não sei se ela realmente gostou de mim ouse era só pq eu era namorado da filha dela,contei algumas coisas que seriam pelo menos importante de ela saber por exemplo minha data do meu aniversário, eu jogo bola em uma quadra perto da minha casa eu joguei bola um dia antes de ir na casa dela e fui ameaçado de morte lá fui no dia seguinte na casa dela pq ela tinha me chamado pra ir lá, contei pra ela que eu fui ameaçado de morte pensando que pelo menos ela iria se importar mas claro que ela não se importou pq ela tava muito ocupada mandando mensagem pra a minha melhor amiga (que ela teria tido uma briga) ao ponto de a mãe e a irmã dela ter que brigar com ela pra ela me dar um pouco de atenção, a noite eu perguntei pra ela brincando pq agente tava falando quando era a data de aniversário de cada um e ela não sabia a minha data de aniversário mas não me importei com isso sinceramente ela tentou me dar algumas desculpas de merda mas não me importei, 3 dias depois ela me mandou mensagem me pedindo desculpas sem ter motivo algum pelo menos era o que eu pensava ela tinha brigado com a minha amiga pq ela disse que não gostava de mim como namorado depois de um tempo ela não me respondia e me falou que iria se matar fui correndo pra casa dela pra ver se ela estava bem e ela estava bem, no dia seguinte foi o último dia de aula eu não queria ter ido mas meu pai me obrigou então fui,lá fiz muitas coisas legais me despedi da minha amiga pq ela viajou pra outro estado, dei um EAE vago pra ela mas estava mal na hora da saída ela praticamente se humilhou pra ganhar um tchau da minha amiga eu passei por ela não do lado nem atrás na frente dela e ela me ignorou e antes que vc ou vcs pensem que ela não me viu ela estava na porta da sala e eu sou uma pessoa de 1,80 de altura mesmo sendo muito novo, e do mesmo jeito me deu um tchau forçado, e recentemente eu não estava me importando de mandar nenhuma mensagem pra ela estava esperando ela me mandar pelo menos um oi pq eu ainda pensava que ela se importava um pouco comigo mas pelo que eu falei ela não se importa ela me mandou um oi sim Depois de quase 4 dias sem falar comigo pra perguntar da minha amiga se ela tinha chegado no estado e se ela tava bem teve mais conversas mas eu não me lembro muito e não cabe a mim dizer pq e algo pessoal dela, eu comecei a ""discutir"" com ela e mandei umas mensagens pra ela e a bloqueie e recentemente precisei desbloquear uma pessoa e desbloqueie todos os meus contatos bloqueados e deixei quieto ela não me mandou mensagem mas um amigo nosso em comum me perguntou se eu iria mandar  feliz natal pra ela e eu disse que não estava falando com ela e ele está me enchendo o saco desde o dia 22 pra eu mandar Féliz natal pra ela.",Desabafo,18qxpud,1703558609.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qxpud/desabafo/,

They're small enough issues that all together, it might take a tech-savvy person about 3-4 hours to get things in working order. And to be honest, a lot of what I need is for them to look through all the ""tech drawers"" and tell me what pieces are useless, which wires go with which pieces, etc. It feels so ridiculous but honestly nobody in our family or friends circle knows technology well enough to do this.

I have seen some potentially helpful services online, but they seem computer-oriented and seem to require purchase from that store for help. Any ideas? Even some tips on what search terms to use would be helpful. Thank you!

Okay Reddit, I have a genuine question. Today I (28F) was talking to my boyfriend (27M) and he had asked if he (about 6in / 15cm maybe slightly bigger) was the biggest I’d ever had. He said he was asking for an honest answer so I told him no my ex was probably around 19cm. Long story short he seemed hurt or insecure after I told him, and I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings. No I wasn’t like “it’s okay, the big ones hurt,” or anything like that, I just gave him an honest answer because I know my favorite dildo is 16cm and my last boyfriend was significantly larger.

"To preface the situation, I dated a guy for two years that towards the end of the relationship treated me like absolute trash. He would not talk to me for days, talk to multiple other girls and was adding girls he randomly met on Snapchat and would talk to them but ignore me. Called me ugly to my face and lied about being in a relationship with me to other girls. He was just awful to me and constantly gaslighted me to the point I felt zero self worth. I wasn’t allowed to see some of my girlfriends, go out to bars, he was controlling. He had convinced me to move in with him and THEN started this behavior, so when I left him I was literally homeless. I was absolutely heartbroken to end it because I really loved him and it affected me for a long time afterwards. Please note that when I talk about my sister and my mom, they are actually my step family. My mom passed when I was little and my dad remarried.

My family constantly insisted that we were going to work things out and were blind to the way he treated me because of how much they liked him. Even after the relationship ended he would talk to my sister all the time. My sister was my closest friend. Even after watching what he put me through she would talk to him about me and acted like I was being over dramatic about the things he did. My sister has only ever been with one person and that is her husband, so she has never had a bad experience with a significant other. It got really bad to the point that I told my family I don’t feel comfortable with them continuing their relationship with him because he was mentally abusive to me and would use whatever they shared about me as an excuse to reach out. (Example she posted about me graduating college and he called me “to congratulate” me and let me know he was doing well.) 

My mom and sister refused to unfriend him. They said it was their choice who they could and couldn’t be friends with. I told them that I didn’t want them sharing anything about me then as i was trying to move on and I don’t want him to have any access to information about me. He gave that up when he decided to do the things he did. My sister and I got in a huge fight about it and we didn’t talk for months. I told her I felt she chose my ex boyfriend over me and doesn’t think I’m serious about the way I was treated. Months later she came back and apologized and I forgave her and that she was wrong for not believing me. She had unfriended him. I started dating someone new and we are happy. I found out my sister re-friended my ex on everything. I let her know this upset me and she had no excuse just said “sorry”. My mom posted a picture of me that I had asked her not to post and refused to take it down. I confided in my sister and told her I didn’t want my ex to see it because my mom had tagged my sister. My sister of course came back with “I shouldn’t care” because I’m with someone new. To me it doesn’t matter. He did things to me that were awful and I cut him off for a reason and forgave my sister and allowed her back into my life. I told my sister I was pissed we were going through this exact conversation all over again and that our relationship will not be the same again, that she has broken my trust because she had made a promise to me she wouldn’t do this to me again. I had to set a boundary. My mom got mad I did this and screamed at me on the phone and didn’t talk to me for 4 months. It took me coming back and apologizing to my mom because I missed my family. It was hell for me. I reached out to my sister to see if we could talk and she said I am cut off and am not her sister anymore. I saw screenshots later on my mom’s phone of my sister saying awful things about me and my mom agreeing. I can’t stop thinking about this. I don’t know if I should have just kept my mouth shut about them being friends, but I felt like I needed to set boundaries for my family as this wasn’t the first time they have done really hurtful things to me before and I don’t want it to continue.

"I’ve never been drunk before but my interpretation of it has always been a state where, you’re basically kind of “sick” for lack of a better term. I can see that it is not only mentally impairing but also physically impairing as well, which always gives me the impression that the person is not their normal self. But when other people explain it to me, it seems kind of contradictory. On one hand, it’s supposed to lower one’s inhibitions and therefore, they will act as if they aren’t held back from what might be an impulse or their feelings. Some would say that it’s even a more honest version of themselves. On the other hand, as I mentioned before it seems like an impaired state where the person has kind of lost control of themselves, and feel that they can’t be held responsible for what they do or say.

I personally don’t really know how I should feel about or interpret drunk people and their actions/words. I typically just try to ignore them or keep my distance, but in the case of something happening I don’t know if it’s right to hold them responsible for what they do in that state. I don’t think that “mistakes” or “accidents” they make should really only be blamed on them being drunk.

[[skip this chunk of text to get to the point, it’s mostly backstory]] I want to find a therapist due to personal shit I wanna sort out and I’m worried from that personal shit that I’ll become a more bitter and resentful person unless I deal with this as soon as possible. The problem is as far as I know, every therapist is booked up completely with clients for months on end giving me very little to see. I’ve had a therapist once before who had a low client volume,, and she wasn’t very good… which leads me to believe most therapists who have opened space aren’t the greatest at their job. I consider myself pretty good at expressing exactly what I’m feeling in the moment and why what concerns me does, and at least ok at reflecting on how we got here: I just need a therapist that can help narrow down courses of action and ways of thinking and maybe reassurance so I can stop feeling shit about everything.

 How would I know how good a therapist is beyond just seeing public reviews and just blind guessing? Everyone’s experience is subjective and I’m worried I’ll just spend the already difficult time to get a therapist only to not get anywhere in multiple months of sessions. 

Possible useful information: I live in Ontario Canada, don’t have financial concerns (cost isn’t a factor for the therapist, I wanna prioritize it) and am perfectly fine doing online sessions, I’m not gonna turn down options just because I can’t see them in person.

"I’ve noticed that I often get interested in certain topics to the point of ending up in a completely different place. 

Just this morning I was watching a video about television and the media evolution over the decades. This led me to an hour and a half video about the entire history of Fox News. Me not being American and not really knowing much about the subject, I had to click on it. 

This video was a masterpiece, it was a complete analysis of their history and the influence they’ve had on the real world. In the latter half of the video, Fox News is described as postmodern. I didn’t understand what the term meant to its full extent, so I had to search for a definition. 

While trying to fully understand what the term meant, I’ve encountered another difficult term I should understand first - modernity.

"So I will give full details of my situation and try to be as clear as possible. This is also for my documentation so I have a point to reference back to, so sorry if it is messy to read.

A few days ago, I was dropping my younger sister off somewhere in a small plaza. I noticed while walking around and looking at the stores there was a massage parlor. A man walks out and he was acting somewhat strange. He was looking around a lot like he was nervous of something. He walked past my car and start walking out of the plaza/parking lot. There are no houses around this area so it was strange to see someone walk off like that, but I had no reason to question anything and went into the store.

Inside there wasn’t anything particularly strange. There were heavy curtains that blocked most of the windows, but they didn’t cover the whole window or anything. I thought this might be strange but just chalked it up to an atmospheric thing. The prices were on the cheaper side (but from what I know they weren’t out of the average range). After I purchased my massage, I got sent to a room and the massage happened. Something I noticed was how there were a few customers who came in from time to time, but they were all male voices. Usually women are the ones who would get massages so I found that strange. In total I think there were 4 people who walked in.

Once that was done I left the parlor and talked to my sister about the experience. She mentioned how massage parlors are commonly used in human trafficking rings and I should be careful. I looked up some articles and I started to get worried.

I also went to look at the reviews of the place and some pictures. A few of the reviews mentioned that this place does sexual services. One of the reviews noted strange noises and another one made fun of the women for doing such a thing and left a one star for it. There was also the names mentioned. Lisa, Amanda, Kelly, and Amy (names were changed) four names were mentioned months apart from each other but none of them were mentioned twice. The pictures also showed that the heavy curtains use to block the WHOLE window so you couldn’t see into it at all.

The possible signs I noticed was:

- The strange guy who left the story

- All the employees were Chinese middle aged women who spoke little English.

- The customers were predominantly male

- The store is difficult to look into from the outside 

- the reviews for mentioned sexual activities 

- there seems to be a high turnout rate

There were a few things that makes me think it is possible I am just overthinking things though. For one, I am Female. The fact they let me in at all seems to be a decent sign. From what I know, usually these kinds of place don’t let women in to avoid having potential witnesses or something. Another thing is that the women had phones and were relatively relaxed looking. Lastly the store is very visible and doesn’t have a backdoor entrance or a buzz in system.

Still I am not at ease about this or anything. I have decided I will try to call in a private investigator and see if I can get more information before I act. I don’t want to call in the police since I heard that may make it harder for the women to escape and possibly make things more complicated.",What should I do if I may have accidentally supported a human trafficking situation.,18qw3wx,1703553544.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qw3wx/what_should_i_do_if_i_may_have_accidentally/,

I don’t think it is fair to say that all these Greek marmor statues portraying important Greek citizens had small cocks in real life too.

"Bear with me. Me and this guy are in a similar friend group so every other week we see each other. I was told by our friends that he likes me and I declined it and I did mean it at the time.

Now I'm so unsure. He is not my usual type at all. Like every attribute he has is the opposite of my usual type.
However the last times we've hung out in the group we've always talked and spent time with each other and I enjoyed our conversation every time and it's fun.
I’m always smiling around him and I enjoy talking to him so much. 

However everyone our Friend group seems to be so invested in this between us that I feel like I can't even breathe around him without someone asking me if there's something going on. Plus the fact that I do know that he's interested in me, so I really don't want to hurt him
So now I'm in this dilemma that I can't figure out if I actually like him or could like him bc im scared of doing something wrong or hurt him. 
And because he's not my usual type I just don't know if maybe I'm just trying to convince myself that I like him bc it's just nice to be treated nice and to be liked.

But also I don't know how to figure it out bc my way would be to just get to know him but bc I know that he likes me I can't do it bc if I figure out I don't like him I'll just hurt him twice be I'll give him hope and then reject him AGAIN
and bc all of our friends are invested it's even harder bc everyone feels entitled to know what's going on and I'm scared of being judged if I hurt him bc theyll think I'll played him


EDIT: To clear something up about the rejection part - 
I didn't reject him in a classical sense. I think it was like the second time we saw each other in our group and a mutual friend came up to me telling me that the guy liked me - (I felt really overwhelmed by that info bc 1. We didn't know each other really and 2. It felt weird that the mutual friend kept pushing me about it while the guy didn't talk to me about it)
So I told the mutual friend that I'm not interested
(I didn't know him at the time and he's not my usual type so I just didn't think about him in a romantic way but also bc our friend was really pushy so I felt pushed in a weird situation) and that I thought it was none of his business and until the guy comes up to me directly I don't want to talk about it bc it is a matter between the two of us. And if he wants to get to know me he should come up to me directly However our mutual friend disagreed and went to tell the guy that I'm not interested

Alternatively if you wanna read some random persons thoughts and feelings go right ahead. Also most things in this post have been floating around I'm my head for years.

Hi, so I'm doing this on a throwaway account because of how deep this is and I just wanna preface this post by saying that this is not a cry for help but rather a lot of thoughts all put into one post/question. I'm hoping this post flies under the radar a little bit.

So I'm 23, I'm gay, I'm a white British male who is living in a very small flat and just about getting by. I'm 5'11 with an average-ish body, except my torso has long had a dad bod, which I'm completely fine with! I always look at it with the mentality of ""if I can do most things everyone else can and I don't have any negative health issues, why does it matter if I'm not skinny or jacked"". I like my body how it is and I love myself, I'm confident, I can be outgoing and kind and loving, whilst still sometimes being selfish and indulgent and self-loving at times.

I suffer with depression, I have done since I was around 12. I've never gone to the doctors or had this diagnosed or even gone to a therapist, mostly because by the time I fully understood what was happening when I was around 17 i already had this mindset of 'I've beat it once and I will beat it every time', I even fully comprehend and am at peace with a lot of the events that caused this. But I know it's depression, after living it with this long and learning as much as I can about it I can say for certain that I've struggled with it frequently over these last 11 years. I've had bad moments and even life threatening moments but when I'm not depressed I know I'll always beat it.

I'm also pretty sure I'm on the autism spectrum and by quite a bit. Once again I've never gone to the doctors about it, because learning in my 20's was more of just an explanation and closure. Since I haven't had it diagnosed I always make sure people know that I'm not 100% on this and I never put it on any legal documents and such. But after doing Psychology in University, various tests online and multiple people telling me I've come to the conclusion. To be honest I don't care about getting it diagnosed, it would just be another label that I don't care about.

We finally come to my burning question. ***

Basically I wanted to know if anyone else thought ""is there anything more"". I also want to quickly add I'm very grounded and aware of what's real or not. I daydream a lot, on these daydreams I live completely other lives sometimes, being a hero, being out in the stars or just having a loving partner or family. But is there anything more out there? Is there actually a possibility of life after death, a thing we don't know for certain I know. What if somewhere magic was real or that people had powers of sorts. Is there actually a higher power or have we humans just made up so many concepts like time and space and gods and made everything to complicated and fabricated. Is there even such a thing as true happiness ( I just want to add, I'm content in life even if it may not seem like it, could be better, could be worse). How are any of us actually truly supposed to understand anything, let alone the meaning of life. At the moment life just seems to be a wave that we ride until it washes onto the shore and there's no more wave. I'm happy just riding the wave, some part of me just wishes it was a bigger wave or a magical wave.

For about 3 or 4 years there was this one recurring daydream, I was some sort of cosmic being around before the Big Bang. One night I went to sleep and awoke in an empty world and after wandering around I woke up to find out I'd been gone days. Basically let out something else the same as me that wanted to just destroy, so I trained with the people who themselves were the dream prison and stopped him. The story continues from there over the course of years. I keep telling myself one day I'll write it into a book.

That's the end of me projecting my thoughts onto the Internet of strangers. 

tl:dr: Is there anything more out there, what am I really doing here?

Is there anything purchasable, such as meteorite or some other solid space substance, that I can just straight up buy?

My other half and I have a sentimental connection to the big old floating mega-marble just for various reasons, and I’d like to be able to do something sentimental with the ring when I pop the question. 

Obviously with this being the case it only would need to buy a tiny quantity, although I’m happy to look at whatever size/shape things come in, guess I can’t be fussy with space rock. I haven’t got a plan of how to get this stuff into a ring, I’d rather figure that out if I know it would be feasible to even source something like that that I can say with confidence is at least linked to Jupiter.

"I’ve (F37) been seeing my boyfriend (M38) for a year and a half now. He goes out drinking a lot with friends but we don’t do it often as a couple. We went out a couple of nights ago. He was lovely at the start of the night but by the end I was shocked by his behaviour. He has admitted he doesn’t know when to stop and he has a bit of an issue. 

We were sat upstairs in the bar sharing a table with a couple and two girls. He was trying to speak to all of them throughout the night but whenever I went away and came back he was sat near the two girls. He’d move back over to me when I came back. 

As the night went on he was just getting up and going over to this young brunette girl. Talking to her and putting his arm round her. He was also kissing other random people including a guy. He said to me I offered to buy the girls a drink, I asked why, they didn’t seem interested in talking to him anyway. He said because I’m a nice guy. When this behaviour carried on and he started calling her babe I started to feel really annoyed and I stopped talking to him. We left and asked me what’s up and I was too angry to speak to him. He was too drunk to talk to and I was shocked by his behaviour. He started angrily shouting at me saying a real women would have said something. Why the hell didn’t you say something. 

The next day he says he couldn’t remember anything and he blacked out. I told him what had happened and he apologised. He said why didn’t you say something to me. I told him I’m not here to tell you how to behave. He said sorry I was just drunk it’s not the end of the world. 

Do you think he was deliberately testing me? Was he after a reaction? The next day he was very affectionate but also having little digs about my appearance. Pointing out little flaws all day.

I’m really confused by his behaviour lately and I felt so disrespected. Should I walk away?

I’ve seen several posts about this but I just wanted to get a general consensus on people’s thoughts and practices. By graze or grazing I mean when you go to a store and grab a drink or snack and eat it throughout the store and then ring it up at the end (or at least I hope so). As someone who worked as a cashier at Walmart I saw it often but mainly with older men and people with kids. Which I definitely understand bc anything to get some silence especially in public is worth the effort. I also never really had any problem with it. Like unless it is something is rung up by weight like produce then who cares as long as you pay. But then on the customer side I’m always too scared to do it. My grandfather always used to do it with me but like I just feel like I’ll get yelled at or something.

So I have a slightly famous friend, she and I have known each other for years, way before she got any sort of fame. 

Recently I met a guy and he started talking and eventually went on a couple of dates. After the 3rd date I really felt a spark. I opened up more to him. I let him know about my friend. He acted as if he had never heard of her. He asked a few questions about her and then said maybe I can introduce them one day. And we quickly moved on. 

Later I found out that he has been following her on instagram and twitter for years. And his old tweets show he used to engage with her on twitter called her beautiful and such things. (she never responded). 

This has made me feel some type of way. I really liked him but it now feels like he figured out who I was and found a way to meet me. He approached me at a bar by the way.

I'm not a writer, but my best friend lost her best friend, and she's heartbroken that they can't share Christmas together. I want to help or give her something that might, but I don't know. Is this like... very weird or messed up though? The story generated is below:

""From my place beyond the stars, I watch over Rebecca, my dearest human. My name is Art, a dog whose heart forever beats in sync with hers, even now as I tread the ethereal realms. Christmas nears, and I sense the heaviness in her heart, the echo of her longing for my presence.

As she packs her bags, preparing for a Christmas unlike any we shared, I hover close, unseen but ever-present. Her whisper, soft and laden with memories, reaches me: ""I miss you, Art. I wish you were here."" Oh, how I wish to nuzzle her hand, to offer the comfort that only a loyal dog can. Yet, I trust in the love we nurtured, a love that transcends the physical, residing deep in her heart.

The house, now quiet without our shared laughter and play, stands as a monument to our love. In my spirit form, I stroll through the memories – our games in the yard, our peaceful moments on the couch, our adventures that seemed to stretch endlessly under the open sky. Each memory, a testament to the love and care Rebecca showered upon me. In these recollections, I find solace, knowing that our bond is not tethered by the need for physical closeness.

On Christmas morning, as Rebecca sits by the fireplace, the flickering flames casting a soft glow on her face, I feel an ache to comfort her. In that silent room, I envelop her in my unseen embrace, a gentle, soothing presence. I watch as a subtle warmth spreads over her, a faint smile appearing on her lips. ""I feel you, Art,"" she whispers, her words a balm to my ethereal heart. It's a silent, sacred exchange, a moment where our souls touch across realms.

Throughout the day, I remain by her side, unseen yet palpably present, sending waves of love and comfort. I want her to feel our unbreakable bond, to know that I am there, in every gentle breeze, in every warm ray of sunlight – an eternal companion, unwavering in my devotion.As night falls and Jessica drifts into sleep, I lay my head across her arm, just as I always did. In her dreams, I dance, a joyful spirit reliving our happiest moments. I whisper into her slumbering mind, a promise that transcends time and space – my love is forever hers, an endless embrace from a friend who walks the starlit path, but never truly leaves.""",Would an AI generated short story be a horrible thing to send to someone who is grieving?,18qph86,1703533310.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18qph86/would_an_ai_generated_short_story_be_a_horrible/,

"AFAIK, one of the criteria for defining who belongs to Jewish community is that the person needs to be born from a Jewish woman, who needs to have a Jewish mother and so on.

I am not Jewish and neither were my grandmother or great-grandmother, and I don't know of any matrilineal ancestor beyond. But I am from a region populated by Portuguese and Spanish immigrants, so I started to wonder if eventually I would meet a Sephardic great-great-great-(...)-grandmother in a matrilineal lineage.

Extrapolating this digression, considering the Jewish diaspora that dates back to two millennia across Europe, could this apply to every person of European descent?

I know that every person of European descent has any arbitrary common ancestor from long, long ago (e.g., everybody has Charlemagne as their ancestor), so every person of European descent has likely many Jewish ancestors. Nonetheless, in order to be Jewish by this criterion, the rules are more strict, as there should be an unbroken sequence of women that have a Jewish woman ancestor.

Is it possible to create or gain the donation of a brain and keep it alive independently of a body? We know all which is necessary to keep a brain alive and have the technology to do so. 

Would it be possible to replicate the living conditions necessary to keep it alive while researching its activity? Could we introduce ways of mental stimuli for the brain for it to think it has a body and research how it reacts?

When I say ‘create’ I mean genetic replication (I kno it’s not that simple but will we have the science one day to do so even if we’re all not here) or it be given as a donation of a dying donor.

for my entire life my parents have stressed the importance of school and getting a good job in the future (as most asian parents do) and have put a lot of pressure on me to get perfect grades, test scores, etc, as I need scholarships in order to be able to afford to go to college, and they want me to go to a good school (so thats even harder ;-;) (we’re middle class so i think we live pretty comfortably, but my parents definitely dont make enough to support me through college and i probably wont get much financial aid) even with this, they wont let me get a job bc they say they i should be fully focused on school (so i RLLY need a scholarship) 

bc of all this (since middle school and pandemic) my mental health has been gradually decreasing and so have my grades (they’re still ok (mostly Bs right now but ive gotten all As and one B the previous 2 years of hs) relatively speaking, but i go to a super competitive public school and my parents basically think a B is not good and anything below that is failing)

The only problem is, is that my crush I sn’t in my classes, and I don’t have any mutual links to meet her. I could always DM her but it’s almost weird? I see her in the halls maybe once a week but that’s just to tough to wait it out and find a perfect time, and she’s with her friends mostly. 

Also for the last part this is a little obvious, it’s a little scary lmao. Like asking someone, and like even though I wouldn’t care really about a no, it’s that I’m pretty popular and she is too so like half the school would know if she talked about it, and like it would be embarrassing to walk past her in the halls. 

We used to be in classes together and she would stare a lot at me I could see it by the corner of my eye and stuff. I think she is so pretty, and she is really nice to her friends, she is also religious and I am too, so I think that is very nice. Unfortunately back then I never talked to her because I really wasn’t that interested in girls, now I regret it though cause I had a few chances. 

I would love to get to know her more and maybe start dating her maybe later down the road.

"I'm concerned about either seeming obsessed, or seeming low effort/immature.

So we had a separate Christmas 2 days before Christmas. I gave her 4 novelty gifts which she loved.

We had her family Christmas on Christmas Day. I gave her another novelty gift that she was, uncertain about, it seems like she was fake-happy with it, but it's hard to tell. My guess is it either took away from the energy of the previous gifts. Or it felt obsessed. Can't tell.

She has a birthday in a few days as well, but she's traveling with her parents (she's an only child and been very close with her parents) on her actual birthday, and celebrating her birthday socially next year. The january party will probably have more gifts from her coworkers. 

So I'm seeing her tomorrow. For a nonchalant hang out at home, because we've had so much stuff going on and no private time.

So, given that I already gave her a lot of Christmas gifts, that seemed to decline in how she viewed them. I was feeling uncertain. I'm thinking I'd give her a birthday card with a gift card to a place she absolutely uses (100% chance, but just an everyday thing), and tell her to wait to open it. I'd joke like ""Kinda feels like the 12 days of Christmas"" and kiss her forehead so it doesn't seem too sarcastic. I'd also get a box of kitchen items that I know she has a shortage of, that should be about $25 dollars.

I don't want it to be like ""he didn't get me a birthday gift"" basically, but I'm also starting to seem obsessed and buying her affection with gifts.

"If this is the wrong sub for this then my deepest apologies 

So I M20 have been very lonely for a long time. When I was 16 in school I had always thought I had friends but in reality they all just sort of put up with me and everyone hung out with eachother when I wasn’t around and I was unaware. The word people used to use for me was s*ast*c if you can decipher that, and I thought it was all in good fun as young guys do but it turns out they really meant it. Then in school one day I hurt 2 people at lunch and they all really let me know what they thought of me etc. they weren’t outright mean but they were very honest and I realised a lot then about what kind of person I was. For the next 3 years of school I mostly tried to stay away from people and did things like eat lunch alone in the toilets and avoid big nights out. I was always afraid of being friends with anyone incase I did the same things to them or they weren’t really my friend and I just wouldn’t be able to tell. When I was 16 about to turn 17 I even tried to take my own life but failed which is a whole other story.
Since I’ve gotten to college the only solid social connection I’ve made is my girlfriend f21 and even then I still question whether she really likes me or if she is just sticking around for the time being even though she actively makes an effort to show that I can trust her I just find it difficult because I don’t understand why she is around me.
The problem that I need help with comes in the fact that for these last few years the only way I have found to keep myself in check is to adamantly tell myself that I should be alone and that making friends would make me comfortable and when I get comfortable i become the version of me I don’t like. My girlfriend knows all of this and actively tried to boost my self esteem but I can’t let myself believe what she sais and I refuse to tell her more of how I feel because she has her own struggles and I feel that I would be rude to put mine on her too even though she actively wants to help. She has suggested therapy but I won’t let myself go to it because of the fact that I believe I should feel how I feel and deserve it. Though now that it has come to Christmas she has been out with her friends a lot and I have spent most of my time at home doing nothing as I have no one to do anything with when she’s gone home to her family for the holidays and I feel that my reluctance to get help and my lack of social life might be upsetting her and potentially be harming our relationship because she might feel that me refusing to better myself is a bad sign for the future. She hasn’t said this but I feel like she thinks it and I don’t really know what to do as I’m backed into a corner with the only ways out being things that terrify me so what do you guys think I should do, thankyou",Can someone just give me a tad of advice because I’m a bit lost in lifeand need help,18rcqy1,1703610454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rcqy1/can_someone_just_give_me_a_tad_of_advice_because/,
"Ever since I can remember I have always been torn on what I want to wear and who I want to be. I know it may sound rather silly but I genuinely struggle with this everyday. I often see women who are girly, with pink nails and put together outfits then, I see girls who are more on the darker side. For me I have been straight down the middle. 
 I admire women who are strong in who they are and have discovered their personal, unique look. 
For me I am never sure what I want to be and don’t know how to express myself. 
I think these certain aesthetics have been pushed on social media and it almost feels like I have to pick a side. I just truly want to discover what’s meant for me and be comfortable in my own skin. It all seems so black and white to me.

"Pardon the inappropriate question. I am not trying to shame anyone for their interests, but I have always been very confused and would love to know if I am alone in this.

I am a bisexual cisgendered male in my late 20s, with a preference for women. I am ***not*** asexual by any means, nor am I homosexual.

However, I find myself the outlier on the internet. The very, very mainstream things make me disgusted, and I am not sure what the appeal is.

Examples:

\-Vaginas in general. I find them very unappealing to look at, but a lot of people seem to enjoy how they look, and I do not understand that. I find them genuinely very gross.

\-Buttholes. There's even a subreddit for ""buttholes behind thongs,"" and anything related to buttholes can actually ruin my arousal entirely.

\-Squirting. It's so common but I cannot understand why.

\-Creampie close-ups. I can appreciate climaxing inside someone, but I very often see people zoom in on it, and it makes me very grossed out.

\-Anal. Anything related to butthole play makes me very uncomfortable. Feces are a turn-off.

I enjoy female and male bodies alike, and I find them sexually attractive, but these things in particular have always puzzled me. I cannot feel anything but disgust for them.

It usually happens about once every year or two years - a holiday or a life event - but it’s infrequent. Usually, for a holiday (like Christmas celebrations this week), we’ll spend time with one family and then another. We don’t integrate them often.

They’re quite different people so I don’t think they’d be great friends anyway, but I also think sometimes it’s good to keep things to tight families so we can focus on that unique dynamic and speak more freely in that situation. My wife’s parents are also divorced, so I think she feels a desire to integrate them more since they are more frequently alone for certain things.

We also don’t have kids (yet) so that would probably be a factor that encouraged it more.

We are loyal and loving to each other and love sex together, tbh the best we've ever had. But the thought is what counts. And plus point, it does occasionally lead to some very exciting times and role play. 

I get you can openly say, ""I like butts, or heels, etc."" You can't really openly say, ""I/we fantasize about my wife sleeping with a black bull. Or I think about my wife going out for drinks/date with a black coworker or boss.."" LOL

Obviously, in my fantasy, it's all consensual for our excitement and pleasure. As well as purely sexual, nothing more. 

If you do, do you know what caused your kink?

I feel like I’m a pretty attractive woman. I get hit on a lot, in person, online. I get hit on when I’m at the store or even getting gas and don’t even look my best. 

I’m a college student and I’m graduating a year early, I was already accepted into my graduate program. I have job, car, and internship. My hygiene is also really good. I know this may not be relevant, but I’m trying to figure out if there is something physically hindering my dating. 

Most of my friends would say I’m funny and usually when guys compliment me after getting to know me they usually call me funny, smart/intelligent, and/or interesting.

I say all this, because I get a lot of attention from men and I don’t think I’m single because I’m not physically attractive or hard to be around…I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong.

I’m usually not attracted to the guys that approach me which lowkey makes me wonder if maybe my standards are too high and that I should give them a chance. 

I have been on dates and talked to guys, but it never gets anywhere. A guy will verbally express that he likes me, but more often than not I will find out he was entertaining other women in a sexual way. For more context, I’m a virgin. I’m very open about this and will usually tell guys “I’m not interested in casual sex  and will only have sex in a committed relationship” or things along that line. I say this so that they don’t try to intiate or try anything when we first start talking/dating.

*edit: I don’t bring up the virginity randomly, but if sex comes up in convo i’ll make it known. Often times they don’t believe i’m a virgin and claim I don’t look like one, which is also weird.*

I’m not anti-sex or waiting for marriage, i’m just personally anti casual sex and hookups. There have been situations where I know the guy would have stayed if I had sex with him. 

Guys will leave and go have sex with other girls and then come back and complain they miss my company (which never fails to make me feel shitty). I have had guys tell me they like me, but then the next day I found out they trying to arrange hook ups with other women… It’s strange.

He compares this to 'domesticating' (like livestock) and 'fully civilizing' humanity,by in his view 'breeding out' people's 'lowest instincts'. To him,all of this is necessary for the end goal of 'absolute and undisrupted order and peace'. His idea of 'peace' is 'everyone blindly doing exactly what they are told'.

"While this happened back in the elementary to high school years, I will never forget this insanity. I was a very small and very smart nerdy boy. That will likely be very important.  


  
Strangely, the kids near me would constantly be taking my things without my permission. I have never ever taken their things without their permission. I always try to be nice and respectful kid.  


  
One day in 7th grade Spanish class, I made the mistake of using the bathroom. When I came back, I quickly noticed that my pencil case is missing. I noticed that my classmate is looking at me. I asked if he took it. He said no. Then, I spent the rest of class looking for my pencil case around the class like a dumbass. My teacher even asked what I was searched for. When I gave up, I noticed that my classmate is looking at me again. I ask him if he saw anyone near my desk. He said no again. I continued to search, but the bell rings. The teacher says the class will not leave until I get my pencil case back. That is when that dumbass classmate gives it to me, but says something like ""Fine. Here."" What the fuck was the point of that? We definitely are not friends. We just talk to each other because we sit near each other in a few classes. He ended up stealing the money that was inside the pencil case.  


  
Another time was in 12th grade. I made the mistake of using the bathroom before class began. When I come back, my backpack is completely gone. I was so confused that I thought I left it in my previous class until I notice that it is hidden under the desk of the kid in front of me?!? When I took it back, he literally says,""BUDDY."" We have never ever spoken before. We only spoke a few times after this.  


  
Yet another time was in 11th grade. I was using my phone to do my hw. The guy in front of me randomly turns around to take my phone. It slips out his hand and flies a few feet across the room. I was shocked, but he then takes it from the floor and gives it back to me. He took my phone many times from me. I have never even touched his phone. Thankfully, it had a case.

"When I started smoking weed I thought Ill be glued to the couch but the opposite happened.

I remember I was playing a match in some competitive game and I was having a bad performance day and those really really suck so thought ""fuck it might as well smoke it up"" after the match. 5 minutes later I find another match and I am suddenly playing 10x better than before and it feels like a veil has been lifted off my mind.

I thought it was some kind of fluke so I tried recreating a similar scenario, I was playing an instrument and felt like my hands werent listening to me and I wasnt able to play stuff Id consider easy. I was having another bad performance day (this time a different activity but it doesnt matter), 5 minutes after smoking some weed I can suddenly play even better than usual. This is pretty consistent and feels like a cheat code.

Im able to go into a deeper state of focus and for longer, my body feels more responsive anddoing things like chores becomes much easier.

I have very mixed feelings about this, on the one hand I finally found a way for me to perform more consistently on a high level at some things but if I dont have weed I cant do anything and I hate it. I feel like something is wrong with me.

I thought it might have to do something with the fact that I was diagnosed with ADHD and maybe weed made my mind slower and more relaxed but after reading other peoples accounts who have ADHD and smoked weed, some people hate it and some people swear by it. Idk what to think but my goal is to be able to control my body and mind better while sober but tbh after 22 years of living I doubt I can do that.

"I know the title is a bit rough but let me explain myself. 

As a guy I’ve always wondered when my partner is in one of her moods, is it something that they are aware of and can’t control it? I know for me personally if I’m ever in a bad mood I will straight up tell some one something like “hey I’m just feeling alittle off right now, it’s not you it’s me. I’m not mad at you or anything” and I definitely don’t get snappy to people around me. So I’m 100% aware of my emotional state and how it could potentially affect others. And that’s if I’m in a bad mood, they are typically rare.

Anyway my issue is, assuming you actually didn’t do anything wrong, and I mean truly you know for sure you didn’t do anything to put her in this mood. 

How do you handle the situation and not want to blow up on them when she’s being incredibly rude to you? 

I try to do the right thing like hug them and ask if everything’s okay but she will always say nothings wrong but yet be super “bitchy” with me and give me attitude.

I just wish she (and honestly a lot of woman) could be straight forward with their feelings rather than making guys play 20 questions.

I’m the sort of person where if you start to give me attitude I don’t play into it and will walk away. Because I refuse to waste my time with that bullshit. But lately I’ve tried to change my ways of thinking and actually go along with her and that doesn’t seem to work either. 

Sometimes I feel like it’s damned if you do damned if you don’t. If you comfort them they get annoyed, if you give them space they think you don’t care and are an asshole. 😂😂😂

How do you deal with this? Do you just roll with the punches and wait it out until she’s back to normal?  I’ve only ever dated 2 woman.

"Me f18 and my (ex) boyfriend m19 have been dating for around 9 months at this time and we have had sex multiple times and yeh it was okay but after talking to some of my girlfriends about this they asked why I didn't break up with him sooner.

I have talked about this before on this chat about that my bf won't go down on me so this is kind if an update / plea for help 

So.. at this start of our relationship I was 17 and he was 18 being the ages we were sex was one of the first things we did when home alone and being my first time I kind of knew there was a low chance of me cumming first time which I didn't but he did which I understood being that I sucked him off for a while before he inserted it. During are relationship we did it alot more times but he never went down on me like I did for him and I did question him about it and his short answer was that he thought it was gross but I just brushed it off but I did become needy for someone to touch me down there so in the end I just used my vibrator to give me the orgasm I needed after he had cum and was cleaning up it become the normal thing to do. I did suggest that I use my vibrator while he fucked me but he shut that down without giving a reason just that he didn't want to so I didn't. 
Over time I was getting a little jealous towards my friends when they would talk about how much there bfs would go down on them (yes that is what girls talk about) so yeh. 

I did end up breaking up with him and this is where I might be a bitch as I did use this as one of the reasons for our breakup and he did shut me down saying that it isn't his fault he found it gross but yeh. I just came on hear to vent really and to really get an answer about if I'm a bitch or not because my friends say I'm not but I am in to minds about it.

I got an internship, so I was not stressed out about that anymore. He surprisingly said that he didn't apply to anything and has no interest. He just wants to graduate to get a full-time role.

"So my kitten was bought from the neighborhood a while ago. I don’t know his exact age but under a year definitely. He’s a super sweet, cuddly dude but recently he started doing this weird thing. So he’ll start meowing at me. He’ll then climb into my lap, still purring and happy. He’ll meow pretty annoyed if I try to pet him and he’ll give me like warning bites but he’s cool if I don’t move. But then he’ll grab my forearm with his front two paws like a hug. The back two paws will be stepping over and over again like he’s trying to keep his balance, which makes sense cause I don’t have particularly big arms.

When he does this, he pins down my forearm, laying on it with his torso parallel to my forearm. It seems like when he does it, he really prefers to lay parallel to my arm, pinning it down and does not like me to move. I don’t think my cat is sick or anything, he’s a really happy boy.

"Ok I just learned about dye packs. Now I’m curious about how bank robbery would work if dye packs are involved.

As far as I understand, in case of robberies, the bank cashiers would slip the fake bundles of cash with dye packs inside into the bag, and after a certain amount of time, or if they pull on the money of the pack, or when the robbers get out of the bank (or far enough), the proximity censor will deploy the pack, render the whole bag of money unusable.

But then how would robbers pull the million-dollar robberies? Was that because with such a large amount of money, the cashiers would not put the dye packs in? Or the robbers were more professional and would detect the packs?

I read somewhere that bank robberies are not as common anymore. I would imagine it’s because most people use cards nowadays so banks don’t have as much cash on hand, but do dye packs have a role in this too?

Thank you and have a nice day.

"This was back in 2008-2010. She was my first crush and she didn’t give a shit about me. For context, I am good-looking, not tall, and have had few relationships. She used to make fun of me for being 5’8 (although the avg. height in India where I was born isn’t the same as in the US). I immigrated to the US in 2012, have a great family, love my wife and daughter, earn a solid salary, which is 4x the median in the US, and I am blessed and privileged to be in the position I am in today. No part of me wants any part of her. 

I dream about her maybe two times a month, and in most dreams, she is either happily talking with me, going on a vacation, or just eating in a restaurant, none of which was remotely possible in the real world. In the real world, she should make fun of me, tell me that I was being cheesy with my poems, and think I embarrassed her. This is is not affecting me but I want to remove her existence from my mental space.

"First time making a post so bear with me

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little backstory, I am a m(30) and have been out of a relationship that I ended for 3 years now. Since then, I have been casually dating (I always let this be known up front about my intentions) because I do not plan to live where I am now for long and many women I have dated nearby aren't willing to relocate on average or I tend to be far more adventurous than they are. I am pretty adventurous, I have lived in other countries, visited more than 10, I have an active lifestyle which keeps me fit, I volunteer, I travel often, and my week can range from binging some books or skydiving. I don't like the flex money, but I make around 50% more than the median household income where I live so fortunately I don't have an issue affording to date.

  
  
I live and work in a town that is a college town and multiple surrounding towns are college towns as well, so the party hard and often mindsets and/or the recreational drug use mindsets are extremely common even amongst crowds my age. I am not saying that lifestyle is bad, it just is not for me. This tends to lead to slim pickings so I have made dating apps as well as approach women in public when I'm not working. Getting matches on the dating apps aren't difficult for me, but finding someone who I like physically and has a similar mindset is few and far in between. I approach in public as well, dating apps are just a passive way to search, I'm fine with rejection in person.

  
  
\*\*Now to the heart of this post lol (remember I said bear with me)\*\*. Constant partying and any current recreational drug use are dealbreakers for me to take someone seriously (hence the casual only for so long). The crowd that tends to have a similar mindset at least where I live are the single mothers. I get an excessive number of matches from single mothers on dating apps and I have flat out been approached by a few.

  
  
I want to have children but I am in no rush. I previously tried to date three women over the last 2 years that were single mothers and they were short lived. One was not over the child's dad, another had zero control of her son, and the third was always busy so we would go sometimes 6-7 days without seeing each other which is not enough for me at all. This happened because we worked opposite schedules and for 5 months, I was willing to spend my only day off with her and her child after working 6 days of 10–12-hour shifts, going to the gym afterwards, and cooking before I would shower and sleep. I was exhausted in every sense, but I still went to pick pumpkins, to the zoo, and even some big musical festival in town with her and her kid. I did not get the same energy in reciprocation, honestly, I got a ton of ""my kid"" excuses because the father was nonexistent. There really was no effort to accommodate me at all. After a while I was tired of it, I understand putting the child first but man that was the epitome of being a second-class citizen.

  
  
Also parenting styles are a big thing too especially when it comes to discipline and I have been in a situation where I respectfully yet firmly verbally corrected the child for jumping on my couch (no swear words, no derogatory terms, etc) and I received an ear full from the mom even though she allowed the behavior..  
  
  
  
Now there's a very sweet divorced woman with kids that coparents who shows interest in being with me. We have been talking for a short time now and I let it be known that I am unsure of the situation up front. They have a split custody system for the kids so a week at the dad's then a week with her and the holidays are alternated. 80% of me wants to just decline based on my past experiences, but that may be a bit unfair which is why I am here today. I have had no problems with her as of now, but things are still early on. The thought of the custody reminds me of when I didn't see one of the other women for 6-7 days and it felt as if I was part-time dating and honestly, I'm huge on physical touch. I know that the final answer is my choice to make, but I would like to get honest and nonbiased feedback on if dating a single parent is worth it for someone who doesn't have children yet and especially someone with a lifestyle like mine?

  
  
TLDR; Single m(30), drug free, active and adventurous only seems to find single mothers in the area that have some of the same interests as me. Have not had any good experiences dating single moms though, so is this a sign that this is not good for someone with my lifestyle? Or have I just gotten terrible picks?",Is dating a single parent before you have children of your own worth it?,18r63l8,1703589754.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18r63l8/is_dating_a_single_parent_before_you_have/,

I want to move across the country and start a whole new life, cutting most of the people out of my life here where I am completely. (Probably would have to be a more temperature-moderate state and have good cooling and heating systems though haha.)

But obviously, housing is expensive, rent prices are crazy. I don't want to just live paycheck to paycheck with most of my income going to rent.

I'm talking 60+ hours a week, 2 or 3 different jobs if necessary. All day every day if necessary. Think about renting your own, nice place anyway. You'd be at work so much you wouldn't even have time to enjoy your ampartment or place you're renting, and you still have to pay 1500-2000 per month! 

I can shower at the gym. I can park in different Walmart parking lots overnight ( lots of people do this ). I can invest more in better security, not an issue. I can see myself having a pretty good setup in there. I'd be completely happy with just my phone, laptop, headphones, and a few other essentials.

"Before reading, understand that this story mentions p3dophilia 

I am not diagnosed with OCD, but I often find myself obsessing and doing compulsions to cope. 

There are multiple ways this affects me. One major obsession I have is that people can hear me think. I’m not saying in the sense that people are reading my mind, I have these thoughts because sometimes I sound out words with my tongue when thinking. This is because it occasionally helps me solidify words in my mind. The reason I get worried is that I sometimes have mean thoughts, and hope that no one can hear those thoughts when I sound them out. When I get nervous, my compulsion is to then sound out my words a little louder than before, just to gauge people’s reactions to that. Usually, this isn’t a big problem, as I always speak too quietly for people to hear. 

This story starts with me cleaning the women’s bathroom at my job, with music blasting in my ears. I was thinking about a dialogue for a character in a movie I had just randomly made up. Part of his dialogue were the words “yes, I am a p3dophile”.  I was doing my tongue thinking while creating the dialogue for this character. A moment after saying those words, I hear a voice behind me. It was a co worker of mine, simply asking to use the bathroom. I quickly began to panic, because I had no idea how long she was standing behind me, and if she heard the words “yes, I am a p3dophile” with no context. So I left the room and waited outside, stewing. I had no idea how loud I was sounding out those words because of my music, and I also had no idea how long she was trying to get my attention. I didn’t know what to do to cope. When she left the bathroom, she gave me this smile, which made me even more nervous. The only thing I could think to do was to return to my original spot in the bathroom, and repeat the words in a voice that was definitely louder than my original voice. I then realized how stupid that was, not only did it not help me cope, but now there was an even better chance someone heard those words without me realizing. 

After cleaning the bathroom, I left work ASAP, and went straight home, panicking the entire ride. When I got home, I tried distracting myself, but I could not stop thinking about how bad I may have screwed up.

Eventually, my brother came home with a friend. This is where the story gets really messy. My brother and his friend go to his room, and I go into mine. My brother and I have rooms that are separated by a single wall. I can usually hear him talking while he games at night. For some stupid reason, I repeat the words “yes, I am a p3dophile” a few times to myself in my room. I don’t know why I did this, it was random and meaningless. I don’t know how loud I said it, and I don’t know if my brother and his friend heard me or not. If they did, then this problem just became a whole lot more detrimental. I don’t know what I will do if my friends or family begin to believe I am a p3dophile.

"I'm often wondering why sex is, and always has been, such a taboo subject, one that most find uncomfortable talking about and a part of life that many try to cover up and to conceal from others. All this despite the fact that sex is arguably the most natural behavior in humans and all animals, and what drives the evolutionary process.

One argument would be that it's culture-specific. However, I would say that in most cultures today we generally see the same attitude. I'm from one probably of the most liberal, open-minded parts of the world (Denmark), but even here you certainly don't talk openly about sex or in any way treat it as the very natural thing it is.

Religion has probably had a lot to say throughout the centuries to demonize sex as impure and somehow ""sinful"". This again begs the question, why people have had the need to paint sexuality in such a bad light.

"Hello Reddit, I have a 34year old sister(with her 6 year old son) living with me(21) my mom(63) and dad(60) with no car, no job, and no income. The only income she gets is from her son’s father who passed away when the son was 2 years old. She gets about $900 a month but gambles it or spends it in less than 2 days. My sister has full parental rights and custody of her son. 

There is only so much I can write because 15 years worth of things have happened and I know theres going to be so many unanswered and left out questions. But a little about the past is she got into drugs in college and completely lost her way of life. She has multiple mental disorders that she refuses to believe and refuses to go to a therapist or to go away to a program for a certain amount of time. Me, my mom and my dad have been trying to get her to find a job for years and there is always an excuse or a fight. She hasn’t been living with us all 15 years but came back after she got evicted 2 years ago and we let her back in because she dropped her son off school and told us she was driving to a bridge to commit suicide when she was actually just asleep in her car. We bring up how she is suicidal with custody of a child and she just says “I wasnt actually going to do it.” We don’t want the son’s life to be more destroyed as it already is which is the only factor that is keeping us from kicking her out. She said she will bring him to a homeless shelter and they will live there if we kick them out. She also keyed my mom cars and broke dozens of beer bottles after us saying she has to leave and give us her son. We obviously dont have custody over the son however but it was more of a suggestion. The son just got transferred to a new school and is doing amazing and finally making friends and enjoying school. We dont want to ruin that for him. My mom has been an emotional wreck for the past 10 years over this and is thinking about getting therapy just for this. CPS has not been doing anything because they know she is safe with us. I have watched my mom cry over 100s of times about this and my sister call her the worst parent in the world telling my mom to go f herself and kill herself and I just dont know what to do anymore. I tried getting involved and she screamed at me calling me the fa**** word and that was the last time I got involved.
I know theres probably so many unanswered questions because of how much stuff has happened and I just didnt know where to start. Feel free to ask below and any advice who has been through something similar if we should just kick them out and hope she screws up soon so she loses custody of her son or what we should do.
I also know it seems like our objective is just to get the son, but me and my parents have been trying to help her for over a decade now and she doesnt want help and she just doesnt care to get help.

"Hello! I work a great job that I love with people that I care very much about. We all work remotely full-time. 

We have an awesome supervisor, who also cares about us, and our growth. When we started out, she was great at telling us how awesome we were doing, which helped us stay motivated. This showed in the numbers, but also in our interactions with one another. 

As time went on, more pressure came down on her to put pressure on us to not only perform, but over-perform. As a result, her feedback now always comes with something we can do better. Which, for professional development purposes, is awesome. The problem is that it's ALWAYS that way now, and myself and all of my colleagues are feeling like what we do is no longer ever enough, even when the numbers are amazing. We have all had individual and group conversations with her about this, and she seems receptive, but it doesn't change. This is also showing in the numbers-- performance is regularly decreasing, which is exacerbating the issue. 

As a mentor on my team, I hear a lot from my coworkers that they're starting to burn out as a result. Three of us have left the team or the company entirely, which is sad, but I'm not naive-- I wish the best for everyone regardless of their path. 

I believe that if it can't come from above, it has to come from within. There has to be SOMETHING, some sort of ritual or routine I can put in place that is just between us to lift each other up. I understand that it's our supervisor's job to encourage development and growth, and I am not in any sort of position to ask her to change tactics. I would love to know if there are people out there who have been through similar situations who have found solutions for supporting each other from within. I have thought about anonymous shout outs and things like that (since the issue seems to be lack of external affirmation).

"Struggling to make decision to work for husbands family

I currently am in a pretty stressful job. I work forty hour weeks plus being on call from 6pm to 6am once a week and being on call from Friday at 6pm to Monday at 6am once a month. I make good money from the overtime but it’s hard to enjoy my time off as I am exhausted when I come home and I can’t really relax when I am on call. I also have an additional job that I am required to work at once a month, usually on a weekend day as I work five weekdays a week. This makes it difficult to do traveling and/or family things and has severely affected my sex life. I also have to work two major holidays a year. My primary job starts at five am so I have to go to sleep early which I struggle to do. I have to do all my chores when I get home, get food, exercise, and by the time I am done doing all that I have like an hour to myself. 

My partner is very into his sport and travels to play it often and I enjoy going with him when I can. Yet, my job will not let me take off if I don’t have enough PTO and only one person can be off work at a time. This makes it very difficult for me to travel with him and see my family. 

His family owns a business and said they’d be very happy to have me work for them. This job would be completely remote, have extremely flexible working hours, and I would get to actually see my partner. The catch is that I would make 20-25k less a year. Yet, my health insurance would be free and I wouldn’t have to do my 30 mile commute every day. The flexibility would be amazing for me to be able to not only do the things I need to do everyday but also would give me the ability to actually see my family. My parents live a few hours away and I hardly have seen them in the last ten years as I have had this difficult schedule. Also, my dad has prostate cancer which is a reminder that we aren’t getting any younger. I can tell how happy he is for me to visit him (I didn’t see him a ton growing up as my parents got divorced when I was young). Also, my siblings work for my parents and it’s hard to always see them be able to go on vacation together yet I am always having to stay behind because I can’t get off of work.

"I just turned 33, currently working in retail and trying to get a BS in Cybersecurity with work paying for it. I honestly feel like I would get no where in the field for some reasons. (Currently living in a rural geographic area, imposter syndrome, Asperger, other mental issues, highly competitive since I also have no professional experience in IT, only personal projects.) This may sound a bit controversial but I keep hearing about how more and more workplaces are trying to hire more let’s say non white males who are not lgbt generally speaking for PR or whatever. I have experience this when I worked at Amazon and when I walk into some bookstores (live in a more liberal city).

The regime is very ultranationalistic and fascist,and its propaganda constantly puts an emphasis on how everyone has to be 'patriotic' and that anyone who does not 100% follow the government's ideology is a traitor and that everyone has to put the country's needs before their own.

...but in reality,the regime doesnt actually do anything to better the lives of its population,as they pour all their money into the military while not actually fixing infrastructure or living standards. The dictator,who is obese and spends his time consuming copious amounts of food and alcohol while the whole population is starving and malnourished,tells all his citizens that ethnic minorities and all kinds of other scapegoats are the real cause of their suffering and brainwashes them into ignoring what (or more aptly *who*) the actual cause is.

"For context, this was a long time ago, I was 22m (I'm 39 now), and it was probably my second longest (and the second one in general) relationship. I'm happily together with my wife for 16 years now, but this has been bugging me recently.

So, when I was on a corporate retreat with a coworker, we met two girls from our company. We kinda hanged together for the retreat period, and there was one of those cringy meet-cute moments, when one of the girls asked me if she had any cream left on her lipa, and I took it as a hint and kissed her, lol. She definitely didn't pull back or say no, just went with it, and we kinda spent together, flirting and kissing, and agreed to meeting later after the retreat ended. 

It was supposed to be a double date, which quickly evolved into our own date. However, this time she revealed she was in a relationship with a boyfriend (I believe she called him even a fiancé but they didn't have any date set), and also that she was 27, which was 5 years older than me. She complained a bit about the other guy not paying enough attention to her, but said she wouldn't want to leave him and doesn't want to lead me on, but would be OK for some fun on the side if I am OK about ""being together with a crone"" (I know, sounds ridiculous especially now). I showed her that I was still interested, which surprised her, but we decided to keep going out. 

Why I was OK with it - I guess many reasons, she was really cute and attractive, and we clicked on the conversational level. Plus, once I started seeing her, I stopped feeling weird about being alone in my 22. And also, I had (known to everyone) plans to leave for a bigger city this year. So, it felt like a perfect fling at the moment, short-lived, no emotional investment on both sides.

We hanged at her apartment, or went to the movies, or other kind of dates, I did small romantic gestures to the best of my ability. No sex, although plenty of second and sometimes third base (neither of us had their own apartment with noone present). Also, weirdly enough, I met her family, I don't know exactly what she told them about me, but we conversed with her mother and brother, as if I'm a close friend.

So, the spring passed, and towards the end of summer I left for another city as planned. We continued chatting, saying some cute things, like missing each other, and then she came over for a weekend in the autumn. Had a great time and the first (and the last) time we had sex. When doing it, she said she loved me. I mean, at that time I probably uttered something like that in reply, but it definitely ruined the thing for me. 

After she left, I must admit, I acted shitty. Started ghosting her over the phone, she became more insistent, with longer rants about how she is missing me, and my touch, etc.etc. And with every message it became clearer that she is not who I want to spend the rest of my life with. So, I didn't know what to do, and once I got myself together and called and said something very long about how I am not ready for a real relationship yet. She sounded like a mess, but I felt relieved.

In a month I met by chance my current wife, so I guess it's good that I found the time to cut this relationship off when I did. 

As far as I heard, she did marry that other guy afterwards.

I can clearly see, that I benefitted a lot from that relationship. It gave me confidence, it gave me some measure of what is it like to just be together in a romantic sense. And I cannot say I wrecked somebody's marriage cause I didn't in the end. I don't think I made anyone happy, though, both with starting this thing and ending it off.

"Hello, so unfortunately, I just got in a car accident on my way home yesterday’s night. It was just a minor accident but I’m a student, this is the first time for me in the past 3 years I have been driven. I was going straight, and this guy was in the left turn lane. He supposed to yield for me right, but no, he made a turn out of the blue and I hit my brake so quick but still could not stop my car in time. And the accident happened. However, this guy seemed to not want to stop, he kept going so I had to chase him for about 1 mile and I had to flash the beams at him to signal hey I want to talk. Then he finally pulled over at a weird as hell spot when there was multiple spot he could pull over before 💀 He got off the car, not even a hello (I was about to ask hey hru but…), he said that you know you were driving recklessly right, you were speeding. I was so confused??? I was literally driving 40 in a 45 zone. So I said, “no I was not, even if I was speeding, I was going straight and you have to yield me since I have the right of way.” He replied with “No, you have to yield me, I was having blinker on and I can turn. You did not follow the law and you hit me so pay for it.” After that he kept changing his statements, he went from I was going straight, to I was turning but then all of a sudden I went back to going straight again. Thank god I had a dashcam so I showed it to the cop and all the thing that guy said was wrong, from my speed limit, to the way I drive. 

Not too long after, my parents came (I was a girl driving alone, he was with his children). He seemed to disrespect my parents as well, seemed like we could not discuss so I decided to call the cops, and this guy asked me “So you want to make a big deal? I’m driving a Lexus and I did not want to make a big deal so why you want to? I don’t care about a Toyota RAV4 ok.” My blood boiled, it was my first car and my parents bought me the car as my 18th bday gift so I can drive it to university, work. While he was talking, my mom smelled some weird smell from his breath, it was alcohol. My mom is very sensitive to beers, wines, all that stuff so she knew right away. I already suspicious of that too because the way he talked was nonsense. While we were waiting for the cops, he went into the grocery store nearby and bought a mouth wash (the cops took about 1.5 hour to come).

I've informed the police and conducted a DUI test on him, though I'm unsure of the effectiveness given the delay and his use of mouthwash. I'm now dealing with the aftermath, having already filed an insurance claim. I'm concerned about how this incident might affect my insurance premiums as a student and the potential impact on my driver's license points.

After taking an education and working for some time in a corporate job most people look like they have lost all the juice of life. I can see from my experience with school and the corporate world that largely it is only the masculine qualities that are valued and appreciated. All this schooling and logical thinking was putting me to sleep and choking the more lively feminine qualities like creativity, speaking from the heart, and just going with the flow of life without overthinking every little detail. 

This quote by Sadh-guru says just what I’m talking about: “For life to happen in an exuberant manner, the feminine has to live in everyone’s hearts and minds.” What is the point if we cannot live in a loving, joyful and exuberant way? Instead we are messing ourselves up with all this logical thinking, analysing everything to bits…. Feminine qualities should be in everyone. Not just women. I’m sure that’s how it was intended to be.

"For a little while now I’ve been wondering about something that doesn’t make sense. I've noticed that certain TV shows and video games (the soundtracks for the games specifically, but playing some of the games still does it for me) from my early teen years have a weird ability to calm me down now in my 30s. 

To give a bit of context, my teenage years were pretty rough. I was homeschooled from the 3rd through graduation. I was constantly isolated and lonely, all that I wanted was friends and I never was able to have any. Also, I was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness but was a closet agnostic. So I had to fake my belief in god to my parents, sister and the congregation (they were all adults, there wasn’t anyone my own age in the congregation). Long story short, I was miserable growing up

What’s bizarre is things from that time period are strangely comforting to me. A few of the things from that time are: *Star Trek: Voyager* and *Star Trek: Enterprise*, *SimCity* (3000 and 4), *Mario Sunshine*, and *Sonic Adventure*. I know that most of the things on that list weren’t critically acclaimed, but they all bring me peace to this day. 

Does anyone else experience a similar or have an explanation for why I’m this way? I’d think that anything from that time period would depress me, but instead it has the opposite effect.",Why Does Media from My Depressing Teen Years Bring Me Comfort Today?,18s1lvz,1703686401.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18s1lvz/why_does_media_from_my_depressing_teen_years/,
"A lady posted on a local animal page that her dog's babysitter never showed up and needed someone to go feed, water and let them out. I offered since I was about ten minutes away.  My daughter (12yr old) came with and was invested.  She loved the dogs and still went with and helped even when she really didn't want to. 
Well, this ended up being a week long thing with little to no contact.  We would go twice a day, play fetch with them for an hour, cuddle them for about 30 minutes, check and fill food and water and sweep up all the fur and repeat in the evenings.  We even did this on Christmas.  I really felt bad for the dogs.  
When I finally confirmed that today was the last day he response was ""thank you! Have a t-shirt!"" I doubt I'll ever get one, but I was left dumbfounded.  
No expectations were discussed so I am obviously at fault for that, but I assumed if she had a different dog sitter, she would have paid them.

"Answer a question for us. 

Two people (A and B) are recently moved in together and have a child together, within the last 15 months. 

Person A had a relationship with Ex that ended in 2019 (4 years prior). They had a serious relationship that ended because the ex moved back to their hometown many states away. Ex mails Person A a Christmas card each year since.  

All of a sudden (2023), Person A is snap chatting with Ex more often. 

Then, a Christmas card arrives from Ex addressed to Person A only (does not mention person B or baby). 

Note that there was no known Christmas card in 2022. It could have been skipped completely or mailed to Person A’s previous address. 

Obviously, Ex had to ask for the new address. Ex also knows Person B and they had a friendly relationship before moving out of state. There was no overlap in the relationships whatsoever. Ex is also aware of the new relationship and baby. 

Is this a flex on Person B? Is this a healthy ex relationship and totally normal? Is Ex trying to send a message that there may be something inappropriate going on? Left gender out to remain neutral. 

Please weigh in!

"I realize this is the most first world problem one could have, but hear me out: I made a discord server about 4 years ago; just a place for friends to talk and play games together. As of now, we have over 30 people in there, some of them I've never met as they were invited through friends of friends, etc.

There's never been any real ""moderation"" and there are ""risky"" jokes in there because (at the time) everyone in the server knew you were laughing at it and not with it. But I've come to learn that some newer people on this server, *might* not be joking...Some members have told me in confidence that they've felt uncomfortable using the server and stopped showing up, while a couple times we've had new people join, see what it's like and then leave the server not long after.

I'd rather die than be a discord mod and those who offer to mod it for me are also the same people who are part of the problem. So I've decided to delete the server at the end of this year. I let people know about this back in October, so they could take and links, images or friend requests before then.

Most regular users of the server seem to understand or don't really care since they've made new smaller servers since then. But I have had a vocal minority (the problematic ones, go figure) that I'm wrong to do this: ""why is offensive humour bad now?"" which isn't my intent.

"Greetings all, I had this question because recently I was watching a video that taught all of Algebra 1 &amp; 2 within the span of \~3.5 hours. After I had taken my notes and successfully learned everything, I made sure to cement my knowledge of the formulas and what I had learned through a book of practice problems.

While I was doing all of this, my younger sister, who is in 6th grade, became curious of what I was doing. And she enjoyed my simple explanations on some of the topics. One day, she came to me after I had picked her up from the school bus, and she asked me to teach her how to graph the slope of lines.

I was rather confused, because I had sword that I had learned about this in class whilst being year younger than her. But I gladly agreed. So me and her got to work and I began to share my notes on the topic that I had down, while also explaining how to solve the problems.

Of course, I had to teach her the fundamentals before teaching her slope. But by the end of the day, we had surpassed even slope, for some reason, she wanted to keep going. Of course, she hadn't learned everything as fast as I had. However, a week in, she can now solve Quadratic Equations.

This made me think, if Algebra is just a memorization of rules, and then application of the rules, why aren't we teaching it to kids faster?

Then I somehow find an abounded place in LBC that I found on reddit. We were on the property and randomly heard cats and dogs ALL MOWING AND HOWLING ALAL AT ONCE. Then we saw a skunk and it followed us for a bit, then I hu w thus guy the same night and saw a possum. Then we got home and then my bsf and I saw the same possum just standing. Idk man its just been a lot of animals as well as the ladybug and my guts telling me to go to reddit. Do any of you know what this means or represents in my life?

I believe her, especially on the religion part. I know her. She mentions that often when talking about love. But I was confused, I could tell that Kevin likes her more than a friend. It's obvious, he took it as a green light to also be touchy with her. I haven't asked him about it because I don't feel comfortable.

But if me and the others are right about how he feels, wouldn't this be a bad thing that she keeps doing it? Or perhaps she's simply lying to me (and maybe herself)?","Women who are very touchy with a male friend, aren't you concerned he might develop feelings?",18rwttk,1703669281.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rwttk/women_who_are_very_touchy_with_a_male_friend/,

"I honestly wasn’t sure where to ask this, but i’ve been thinking about it for months and wanted to be able to discuss it somewhere. I’m the type of person who is open to anything, and I don’t believe in anything in particular, like psychics, astrology, religion, etc. I’m pretty neutral about them until I experience it myself. 

Early this year, I went on a trip to India. While I was there, I knew I wanted to get a psychic or astrological reading, since it is much more common in the culture there than it is here in the US. I met with one who didn’t speak any english, so I had my tour guide (who also knew nothing about me, as i met the tour guide that day also.) as a translator. It was also a “pay as much as you’d like” situation, so I knew this wasn’t something he was doing for money. 

I went into it like i said with neutral feelings, kinda just assuming he would give me some generic life answers. And he did for some, like to focus on school and that I will have money in the future. However, most of what he said was incredibly specific. He said he was a palm reader, psychic and astrologist, so all the info I gave him from the get go was my palm, and my date/time/location of birth (to generate my astrological chart.) keep in mind i live all the way across the world from this man, and he doesn’t even speak english, so the possibility of him just knowing certain cultural aspects of the state im from and making statements from that is pretty unlikely. 

The first thing he did was immediately describe where I live. He said i live a few feet from a hospital (which is correct). at first, i thought he was talking about my childhood home (like where i was born, since i had just given him the city i was born in to generate a chart.) so i kept telling him i didn’t. so i was starting to get skeptical and that he was just saying random things. my childhood home is nowhere near a hospital. so ofc i kept denying it and denying it. yet, he kept saying that i live near a hospital. even though i denied it multiple times. then it clicked-he was telling me where i LIVED not where i was raised. i currently live quite literally STEPS from a hospital. and the fact that he was so sure i did, even though i was DENYING IT TO HIS FACE (he wasn’t changing it up and being like “well maybe you live near ___ instead.” which is what i’d assume a “fake” psychic would do.) it was incredibly shocking. he told me that i live on the corner of a street (which is correct) and that i have four lights/lamps around my house (which is correct) and even told me the direction that i lived in, like east/west etc (no idea of this was correct, cause i don’t know that info and didn’t check at the time.) So, from the get go, wtf are the chances that a psychic just “guesses” these things? these aren’t vague statements, these are incredibly specific, and how many people just randomly live on the corner of a street, a few feet away from a hospital? I haven’t stopped thinking about this, because to me it is, statistically, very unlikely that someone can be so correct if they were simply “guessing” and he was also so confident and persistent about it. 

He proceeded to tell me other things, and i won’t state everything here, but another that stood out to me was the fact that he named every single health issue i have. ALL of these issues are not visible to the naked eye. he said i had an issue with my eyes (again, not something a stranger would just know from the get go. i have had multiple eye surgeries for an eye condition that causes me to have double vision, but my eyes look just like everyone else’s.) he said i had asthma or allergies, something with my lungs (i literally have allergy-induced asthma.), he said i have back pain (this could be an easy guess for a lot of woman, so that one isn’t as surprising, but i am also a young adult (19 at the time of the reading), and chronic back pain is more common in older women.) keep in mind he is saying these thing’s INCREDIBLY fast. all i’m doing is sitting across the table from him, and he looks at me and then to the translator, who then repeats what he said to me in english. i am not exactly a believer in psychic abilities, but for the first time it’s hard NOT to believe in them. like, i genuinely cannot fathom that a man all the way across the world, who is willing to do this for me for free (trust, i paid him at the end), is spewing specific info about me that just “happens” to be true and a just a “lucky guess.” what do you guys think?? i want to see a psychic again in the us since i am so intrigued now, but i am worried it could just be a “fake” if psychic abilities are actually real, since ik we have a lot of “psychic” scams here. maybe “real” psychic abilities are primarily prevalent in the south asia region, and that is why it is so common in their culture? again, i don’t wanna be one of those people who gets a psychic reading and all of a sudden believes in it, but i think if you saw a psychic all the way across the world who very specifically described where you lived, you’d also walk out questioning it.","if psychics aren’t real, how was my reading so accurate?",18rwoh1,1703668689.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rwoh1/if_psychics_arent_real_how_was_my_reading_so/,

"I am trying to understand how the world world. It feels fundamentally different from how it was in the past when I was growing up.

As a basic example, I have many friend who make $100k+ and they're just barely making it. They show me their finances and, these are real breakdowns from my friends where we are. One of whom literally makes $105,000/year. He pays $37,000 in taxes (state and fed), and $24,000/year in rent for a one bedroom apartment that doesn't even have AC. That's $3,250/month after taxes and rent. You can't live without a car hear, he takes the cheapest lease he can find for $200/month, and another $100 in insurance, since he qualifies for zero health insurance coverage because he is defined as rich (over 6 figures apparently?) his medical insurance is $500/month, cheapest he can find, has a $10,000 deductible, so he never even uses it. Just to commute he has to spend $600/month on gasoline. Another $75/month for the cheapest internet around. Another $100 on water and electricity every month. So just basicaly living expenses leave him with $1,175. But, he also has a student loan payment of $575/month. So, $600/month, $20/day for food. A big mac meal here costs $20.

Ok, so my friends work long hours, have little free time, toil away, after years of schooling, and make over six figures and they can afford to eat at the shittiest fast food place once a day, if that. My friend (and he isn't the only one) lives mostly off of free food from dumpsters being thrown out still packaged from supermarket chains.  


These are the people earning what people say are ""good"" salaries. MOST people are earning BELOW $100,000, correct? So, how are they living when my friends earning $100,000+ are dumpster diving to stay alive?

&amp;#x200B;

And, I swear, I am really serious, how do I go out in public every day and see restaurants and bars packed? A basic cocktail is $15 after tax and tip in DIVE bars here. I know at least some of my friends live off the free dumpster food all week and blow their whole free $100 at cheap bars, but is that what EVERYONE is doing?  


Going into a sort of Part 2, while I don't understand how most people are even surviving at all, how are there constantly packed clubs and hotels all over? These places charge prices that make no sense at all to me (I am fortunate enough to have had some rich friends take me into these places). People think restaurants are crazy serving $150 steaks and $25 cocktails, but there are clubs selling out $10,000 bottle services. It doesn't seem like there are enough celebrities, producers, and CEOs to be filling all of these places all of the time, so what is going on?  


I genuinely feel like I am living i n a simulation where the devs didn't pay enough attention to details because I cannot figure out what is going on.

"For context: I used to be a gifted kid especially when it came to math and science, then was  hit with depression and anxiety and my grades went from straight As to Bs and Cs with the rare A in sophomore and junior year. Got therapy, medication, and my grades are now Bs with some As and occasional Cs. Also pivoted from path of doing CS for college to art/graphic design.

This year, as a high school senior, I decided to take AP Stats thinking it'd be easy; it was, but I didn't try. I barely studied, procrastinated in favor of artwork, didn't pay attention in class; I was stressed, but not enough to severely trigger my anxiety. I ended up with a C for first semester, and my parents are on my case about why because I assured them throughout the year it was going fine.

At risk of sounding presumptuous, I have a good art portfolio; I know I do, I've gone to more portfolio reviews with art school reps than I can count. I'm applying to mostly art schools, and I know they often value portfolio quality more than exact grades. Does it make sense for me not to care about my bad grade? I feel very apathetic and ok with my grade. Aside from me needing to fix my study habits, math is the subject I hate the most. When it comes to art and humanities, my grades are good and I will work almost all nighters on projects and not get bored. I can't see myself doing anything else in the future.

But I also understand that I can't always do things I love in life and maybe there are valuable skills for me to learn somewhere? Like, maybe that C will prevent me from going to a more well-rounded, non-art college(""just in case"" my interests change) and will limit my future options.

"Bump above. Basically I \[M24\] am a introverted individual, dont have all that much friends and have asked them to introduce people to me, but generally yielded low results.  
I have tried following my hobbies, but they are almost very male dominated (think anime, games, value investing), any girls in the community seem to already have a boyfriend because of sheer scarcity.  
I want to go out and join/do more events and activities, but my energy is limited and at weekend it gets tiring after trying for a while and while I met great people, it has not resulted in meaningful sparks of attraction. Work is exhausting enough as it is.  
Dating app didnt work out super well for me. Its hard to get dates (there is a whole different video that explains why) and some that did, I found some very fundamental differences with the girls I met to reasonably conclude that long-term relationship is very difficult (personality, background, ambition difference) and hence yielded no advancement. Getting matches as a male is hard enough and those that I match with sometimes it feels like I am talking to a wall with very mediocre and uninterested reaction. Have met nice people here, but its an overall discouraging experience.  
I am probably sounding desperate at this point, but I am trying to be compassionate to myself.  
I consider myself to have a somewhat decent look (5 or 6/10, and maybe 7/10 for the right market), am relatively empathetic, have a modestly good career that I hustled for (private equity investment) have never entered a relationship my whole life and while there are obviously some things that I am working to improve (confidence, conversational ability, fashion, etc.), it feels so disheartening to know that I might not be deserving of love until I am a much better person physically and mentally (esp in current online dating world where it has taken a bit of a toll).  
I sincerely believe that I am not crazy picky with potential partners either. I hope it doesnt sound condescending, but I am pretty open to partners with average or slightly below average looks as long as I vibe, but this has been a challenge as well.  
Any practical advice would be deeply appreciated. Above sounds like a whole lot of vent, but I felt like put a genuine and consistent effort at this for the past year, but have only been met with disappointment. I still remain committed however to help myself and be accountable for the results of my dating life and open to the possibilities that I might be blindsided by some things I have overlooked.

"For clarification, I have no idea if this idea is based of a real theory to any degree, this is something i just thought of on my own 

I was thinking hypothetically what if there was a space where 360 degrees wasnt enough to make a full rotation? Like lets say as an example your standing still, you make one 90 degree turn to the left. you make 3 more turns. now that you've made 360 degrees of rotation, in reality you should be facing the same direction as you started, but in this hypothetical what if you werent? what if there was still 90 degrees left of visible space left to see, requiring another 90 degree rotation to the left to return to be seeing what you say before you turned.

i have no idea if this works on any grounds, or if im even making any scence. basically the idea im getting at is of having to turn over 360 degrees in order to make a full rotation, like there is just more to see / more space then is physically possible to see.

if you have any questions or need me to explain myself better by all means let me know, i have no experience in physics or anything like this whatsoever so sorry if im spouting nonscence or using wrong terminology. 

also wanted to tack on that every time i say 90 degrees of rotation i mean a right angle. so the answer couldn't be to just change how many degrees are in a full rotation",trying to understand the idea over 360 degrees of rotation from a point in space?,18rva1x,1703663266.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rva1x/trying_to_understand_the_idea_over_360_degrees_of/,

"Me and my parents are holding completely opposite points of view on this. They gave my dad's tracksuit pants to a local tailor to fix one of the zippers. The tailor charged them $15, and the pants were bought for $20 (currency doesn't really matter).

My parents think that this is ridiculous pricing because there is no way repairing a piece of clothing should cost nearly as much as buying a new one. 'Cause then it'd be better to just buy new pants.

I think that the pricing is justified for the most part. On the one hand, they're trying to compare the costs for industrial scale production to the costs for providing a service on a micro scale (it's a single person, not even an actual tailor company). The per unit costs are going to be wildly different, so that feels like a bad comparison.

Plus, the tailor is paying rent, electricity, buying consumables for the sewing machine she's using, etc. This is all factored in the price of the service, as well as labor and a small profit margin. And since the tailor has few customers (because she's local, in a very small city), she needs to charge high. I mean, look at the maths:

$1000 ÷ 50 = $20
$1000 ÷ 500 = $2

Where $1000 are your monthly costs to keep the business running, the 50/500 are the number of customers you expect for the month, and the result is the price you need to charge each customer for the same service to break even. Obviously, an industrial operation would have much higher costs, but also a much, much higher number of customers (or units produced and sold), so you'd be dividing a huge cost by an equally huge number, meaning that the final cost/unit would remain low.

Who is 25M and I'm 18F, I just know him from march 2023, yeah this year in my university, i met him because we're in the same group friends and at first i don't really liked him back like he liked me, we start talking about our interests and everything about us, we started to talk everyday and I get used to him, then I realized he has a lot of mental health issues like anxiety and depression between other ones, I don't know if that influenced me to don't want to leave him alone, what if he just kil* himself? So I told him i will be with him like his friend, but anyway, he said I'll fall for him, and I don't know why, I ENDED UP WITH HIM, I swear i didn't want to fall but just happened, we are like boyfriend and girlfriend. 

That happened in june, then I wanted to ""Break up"" with him because I didn't liked him, but he appeared in the university last day and talked with me, he just cried and and told me ""Why are you like this?"" I ended up in the same point like if we were a couple. A month later he started to ask me about screenshot of my WhatsApp, he saw I talked so much with a virtual friend (20M - Steven) I explained to him I met him 3 years ago and he was my best friend, he said I didn't need a Best friend because I had him. 

Then he asked me by my e mail password, I refused at first but then i give it to him, he checked my email until he found some messages between Steven and me from 2 years ago:

Steven - Hi, I'm Russian and I'm getting all your money
Me - Oh no, please, what can I do for you don't do that? 
Steven - You need to say I'm a sexy boy so I'll let you go.
Me - You're a sexy boy... This role is strange hahaha

When he read this his only though was ""They are more than friends"" and asked me for not talk to Steven again, the same thing, I refused but ended uo accepting and Steven blocked me wishing me bests, I cried a lot, he was my best friend I loved him a lot, like friends, I knew he didn't liked me like a woman and me neither. I  told him some days before today, that I missed Steven and I've been crying for him, he just said that was just to support what he said that we had something and maybe even I sent him xxx photos, I denied all and got angry, we discussed so hard and I ""broke up"" with him, it was calmative/soothing, ""I already Broke up with him"" I was happy, but we ended up turning back together, I don't know if I want to be with him, I don't like him, but I love him, but I don't feel good with him, I don't know if I should break up with him, how do I do?

"It's so hard for me to remember a person's name even if we see each other regularly, yet people who are maybe friends of a coworker (in a large business) will hear of my name and greet me with it when we do have a rare interaction. I feel bad because I try to play it off cool, sometimes awkwardly ask their name, but most times I will try to learn their name later in secret if I expect to see that person again in the future.

Does name recognition and memory come more naturally to some people? Do I just need to improve my memory/social skills? I'm not sure if it even matters much, but I want to know if it's something I should work on.

People talk all the time about traumatic events coming back. And they live in the moments. I get this as a veteran with severe depression. I get these and they're interesting.. but I would add that theres just as many that come from other events. Where the body relives events in the same manner.

Maybe its cause my brain is wired all over the place but

Ill have total phycholigical recalls of trumatic events as if Im there. But Also
Childhood emotional impressions at random times. I can distinctly remember the full feelings I felt. The emotions to a random moment as if its happening..as Im standing next to canned food in a grocery store. A summer feilds smell. Only im smelling it in my head. The feelings of the fun, the feilds smell or something else. 
Sexual partners and experiences, previous marriage
Happy moments throught my life. Random smells from ""bag nasties"" in the corps. 
Or the smells of the middle east. 
The only way I can described it is like a broken circut system displaying and running experiences it previously ran. 
Its almost like its full emersion in my head..while im doing something else and it's fkn wild.

"Most of my life, I spent in a small town. After 8th grade, I moved to a big city alone, living in a PG for higher studies. I was extroverted and confident as a kid until 8th grade. As soon as I moved, I became more insecure about everything—my looks, height, etc. I never felt confident in this new life. I became introverted, developed social anxiety and shyness, and never had the confidence to approach any girl as before.

Fast forward to today, I'm 21 and in the 2nd year of my college, pursuing CSE. In college, I haven't made any close friends, and my circle is limited to 4-5 people in real life because I don't feel confident enough to approach others, mainly due to my appearance and height (5.6 feet). While I was privileged enough to be approached by a girl, I lack strong social skills. Moreover, I struggle to initiate or sustain a conversation, and after a while, we stopped talking. I felt disheartened, and I'm concerned that my college life won't be any better than the last 5 years, spent without meaningful relationships or close friends. Despite having good online and overseas friends, there are moments when I feel lonely, missing out on typical experiences people my age are having, like going out and dating.

Does anyone have advice on how I should navigate these challenges and improve my situation? I don't consider myself conventionally attractive; perhaps, I'm just an average or even below-average looking guy with not a great personality.

"For context, this has happened to me twice so far in both my current and past relationship (F26) So to make a long story short, I got cheated on and ended up finding out who the other girl was. From that point on, I would screenshot everything I found that involved the communication between my partner and her. This then progressed to me checking her page multiple times throughout the day via a fake account. Watching her stories on instagram, tuning into her lives if she was actively streaming, etc. I noticed it was becoming more of an obsession with her and her life at some point to where I knew details about her that she would share online like her birthday, who her friends were, what type of music she liked. And then I even started listening for context clues that my partner would talk about from their past to see if I could catch any mention of her in anything. I know this probably makes me seem crazy but I heard that other girls end up doing this too. I’m thinking it’s not really that I’m “obsessed” with the girl but more obsessive over the idea that she might have whatever it is that I lack that would cause my partner to cheat on me with her. Also I think it’s worth mentioning that with my ex partner who this happened with, the girl was just a side chick kind of situation so no prior history between them but with my current partner, the other girl was an ex of 6+ years. But yet with both dynamics, I still found myself checking their pages regularly and keeping up with their lives even though if I hadn’t found out, I wouldn’t normally give two fc*ks about these other girls or their lives… Now that I’m not with my ex partner, I did notice a decline in me checking the girls page who I got cheated on with as often as I used to, she kind of fell on the back burner of my mind as time from that relationship passed but now with my current partner, I’ve really grown a rather obsessive habit with this other women I got cheated on with.

I know this may seem like a silly or stupid question to some, as well as complex (because it is hypothetical and has many possible answers) but it is more of a question of your levels of faith in your governments and humanity as a whole. 

Do you think governments of the most powerful nations would immediately consider them threats and detain them for research and interrogation, with a new world war starting. Or is there a world where large swathes of the population are warm and welcoming to these beings from another planet or galaxy?

"TD;DR: if most typical instruments/voices exist between 50hz - 1000hz, why do equalizers have that whole range crammed into 1 or 2 sliders and give us 2-3 sliders for frequencies higher than this? 

&amp;#x200B;

more info: I am using Sony headphones, with this equalizer:

[https://i.redd.it/fl4yi2f9gud91.jpg](https://i.redd.it/fl4yi2f9gud91.jpg)

I listen to a lot of electronic bass music. My rough understanding is that bass is usually around 50hz-150hz for what I listen to. So I had pumped that side of the EQ without reading it too closely, but was enjoying the outcome. 

Recently though, I found a musician  who uses female vocals over more traditional sounding instruments, but I am pretty sure they are digitally crafting most of whats in there, especially the bassline. I think my brain is just conditioned to enjoy this flavor of bass from so many years of listening to it, so it was cool to find something that is kinda singer/songwriter genre, but still Pavlov's me into liking it despite that not being a genre I usually care for. I figured I would adjust my EQ to see how this particular song sounds at various levels, trying to min max the experience. Looked up female voice hz range, and got an estimate of 200-250hz. So the thing I typically enjoy is at about 100hz, and her voice at maybe 230hz. Rough guess.  

Thus ensues me actually reading the numbers on the bottom of the Sony App EQ. We got 400, 1k, 2.5k, 6.3k, and 16k.

Now, maybe I am not understanding properly how what I am hearing in music translates over to specific frequency levels, but I would have assumed to maximize the two elements of this song (the bass line and the lady's voice) I would want to raise the output at 100hz and 230hz. Obviously not possible with the given options. However, messing with stuff in the 6.3k and even 16k range still makes it sound different, though in a way I can't really articulate.

So the question: what am I misunderstanding about how this works? Also why would they not break the lower end into more segments, so one could say, separate vocals and low tone instruments.

also if it helps, the song in question is Close Your Eyes by Dahlia Sleeps, specifically the chorus at 1:10 that demonstrates the high/low thing I am talking about.

"Recently, I have come across a cmv post by electricfistula, claiming the academic discipline of philosophy, specifically, is valueless, error filled and imprecise. https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/28frv7/cmv\_philosophy\_is\_bullshit/  
  
It's a lengthy rant post, but here's the general arguments I've interpretted from it:  
  
\- Philosophy has no value due to this concieved failure of philosophers to refine and expand upon the arguments and values of the past.  
  
\- And how the course is effectively about learning opinions from other people's poorly written text.  
  
\- Such opinions have no practicality, thus having no value.  
  
I can't argue with OP on this one, I also wonder why students have to read archaic, historical texts instead of modern, refined texts that refine and builds upon past text.  
  
\- Philosophy doesn't teach you how to think because you are not told what is right or wrong.  
  
\- Other subjects tell you what is right and wrong, making them better at teaching thinking by defualt.  
  
\- Most philosophy is ""wrong"", because OP and his undergraduate classmates were able to dissect and find real and major flaws with various major philosophers and philosophical positions.  
  
\- i.e. OP is amazed ""the average undergraduate can derail the best philosophical works with a few hours of study and contemplation"", in his own words.  
  
\- OP never encountered problems like this in Subjects like Math and Computer Science as he never had to correct any professor or body of knowledge.  
  
I feel this is another consequence of academia poorly carrying about the discipline, by making students argue for or against past philosophers rather than contemporary ones.  
  
\- The useful parts of philosophy are the parts that used to be called philosophy before turning into their own independent fields (e.g math, science, medecine, etc)  
  
Again, I feel this is another problem with how institutes handle philosophy. They don't explore the fields that used to be within the domain of philosophy, they only explore what's left inside philosophy.  
  
\- Philosophy is imprecise because there's no right or wrong, causing assignment grades and graders to be unreliable and falliable  
  
I'm skeptical that he simply had a bad experience in college and this could be a criticism of how educational institues carry about the discipline. But it's quite clear he isn't throwing shade at his university but at the academic discipline itself.  
  
Looking at how unconvincing the arguments in the comments were and his subsequent editor's note, he's likely made his mind up about the field already and holds this view to this day.  
  
However, this post came out 10 years ago, so why am I even wasting time on a rant post from some frustrated college graduate that obviously regrets doing their degree?  
  
I've been planning to self-study the field for a whilte now but this post is making me question my choice. It seems like the useful aspects of philosophy are scattered in the dozens of other fields that are more ""useful"" while philosophy itself remains ""useless"".

I asked on Quora but I only had one answer to my inquiry, and while their response was both helpful and appreciated, it did not provide much insight. I then stumbled upon a Quora answer where they said that I should try my luck here. I'm honestly open to any answer. Any help is appreciated greatly)*****, I'm trying to write a book in which a WWII German soldier finds himself propelled into a fantastical world, complete with all the fantastical beings commonly found in works of fantasy. To make it authentic and to prevent my readers from pointing out too many shortcomings in the character, I am, however, doing some specific research on the WWII soldier's military history.**

* How old was a Stabsfeldwebel in WW2 ***(yep, he is a Stabsfeldwebel!)*** on average, and how many years would it take them to become one if they joined at 18, before or after WW2?
* Did the rank exist in the Panzer Lehr Division? ***(yes, he is in the Panzer Lehr Division!)*** Also, according to the answer I received to my question on Quora, **""For the Panzer Lehr, the rank of Stabsfeldwebel would be used in the Panzergrenadier regiment's""**, could someone please shed some light on that? I looked on the Wiki and it said that it ""absorbed the 901st **Panzergrenadier**\-Lehr-**Regiment** while there"" so, please, some light on the subject would be appreciated!
* Which firearms did they use, or, **were** allowed to use?
* What did the Stabsfeldwebels do? What role did they serve? What was their purpose?
* Did they command/lead a group of their own or not?
* Who did they answer to? Like, what superior or person of higher rank did they answer to?
* What did their uniforms look like exactly? ***(A photo would be very much appreciated! If it's in black and white, would you be so kind as to describe the color? If not, it's okay!)***
* What Panzer did they drive or drive in? Or did they drive any panzer?
* If they wore helmets, did they have the symbol of the Panzer Lehr Division on the side?
* How many of them were there?

One more thing, the beginning of the book will begin during the Battle for Caen and when the Panzer Lehr retreats on June 17, 1944 ***(did I get that off the Wiki? Yes, I'm guilty of that crime! (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞)***

I believe that is all. However, any other details regarding the Stabsfeldwebel or the Panzer Lehr Division would also be appreciated! Of course, any other info regarding the other ranks among the Panzer Lehr Division would also be appreciated!

Again, any answers, regardless of the content, are appreciated! Also, no pressure! Please, take all of the time you need!

"I’m from a cultural family extremely similar to the Taliban and my family is *extremely* unbearably controlling.

I’m close to my 40s but if my family (my older sister mainly) could put a tracker and camera to monitor my every move, would but since I don’t allow her to she hints and throws jabs that I’m a whore.

I’ve only been with 1 person my ex and that really confirmed I was a whore.

The constant harassment led to my marriages demise and has left me for years on the market.

I struggle finding a quality guy because any time a man is interested my sister is ready to pounce with her jabs that I’m a whore and everyone sees me as a whore and she as so virtuous and me as the dirty soiled manure because there is no way I can resist men and be beautiful and not promiscuous.

She has beaten me down so much I get very shy talking to a man for fear of her envy and wrath and snide remarks of who’d be interested in the ugly, whorish little sister that should be humbled to be graced with the presence of the God’s gift to the entire universe older sister.

For example, one guy I was interested and he showed no interest so I moved on quickly to a guy who seemed decent and interested. The other guy decided to start acting interested causing problems for me. I never went anywhere alone with either just saw them in passing or hung out with mutual friends and had small banter. She said that makes me a whore and I deserve someone who beats my face in with a bat and she reads her Bible and prays so God will only hear her and never a whore like me because a guy should never have a crush on me only that happens if I’m a whore seducing him.

I do not know men well at all so maybe it is impossible for them to be attracted and take interest on their own to a lady??

I even stopped combing my hair and taking care of myself in a feminine way to repel her wrath but yet find men aren’t picky and still will be attracted to me but I get so deeply frozen in fear that my sister will lung at me and start attacking me as she’s the oldest and men only notice the oldest sister or should or else.

I defend myself and tell her I’m not a whore and a man having a crush on me doesn’t make me one as I have a body count of 1 but she says that she knows men very well and when I ask a man to pass me a napkin that’s attracted to me makes me a whore and everyone would agree.

I live such a lonely life as it is and I get so tired of dealing with life and coming home to a bitter hate filled sister who has me constantly questioning if this life is worth living on top of everything else I face alone as I’m an otherwise adult orphan.
 
I’m close to 40 and do just want to find a good man where I can live a quiet life away from my sisters constant spears of hatred which doesn’t seem me likely either.

Thankfully they all have similar or complimentary scents so that won't be an issue (I think). However, they may have different types of wax which I don't think will be much of an issue but idk candles.

So my question is; will this work and, if so, how do I prepare a jar or find the right candlewick to use for the chosen jars?

I am not saying that everything that our ancestors did is to be emulated, but sometimes I think because the way I was raised and by the influence of a globules world I tend to disregard routine. 
I do not eat at the same time ever say, I do not repeat ancient mantras, I do not gather once a week with my long last friends, I do not rely on routine to grow crops or raise animals. 
Contrary to that! Other than going to my soul sucking job I try everyday to not do the same thing over and over, why?? Because I was taught that new is best, and in  on order to succeed in new to try new things everyday!

"Me 28F confused by actions of 33M

Met 33M on a dating site about 2 months ago. After 5 dates we had the ""what are you looking for?"" conversation and he said he was only looking for something casual which didn't align with my wish for something more long term/serious. I opted to end things before I got hurt but he was keen on staying friends, saying he enjoyed our chats which I agreed to. 

But after another 3 weeks of talking non stop everyday beyond how I would talk to anyone I considered just a friend, even though we didn't physically hang out, I confronted him and asked him what was going on as the flirting was out of line with a friendly relationship and it was also stopping me from moving on and dating elsewhere. He didn't answer, just asked me what I was doing that Friday (in 4 days time). I said nothing at that stage and he changed the topic of conversation without giving me an answer. 

2 days later I had a friend ask me to dinner on Friday and I told her I wasn't sure if I was free as I didn't know if 33M wanted to do something. I messaged him to ask and he suggested that since my friend also wanted to hang out that we all go out to dinner together. Come Friday, it was raining quite heavily and he messaged me to cancel 2 hours prior to dinner because of the rain, even though myself and my friend were driving in the rain with no issues. 

I got sick of the mixed signals and felt like he was wasting my time so messaged him on Saturday saying I wanted to cut contact as it was messing with my head and my dating life and not going anywhere. He said he was sorry but understood. He continues to send me reels afterwards but we stop having proper conversation. I find that I do miss talking to him during this time period though as we had gotten into the habit of talking non stop every day for 6 weeks 

3 days later I reciprocate his reel sending by sending him a reel too that reminded me of him and we ended up getting into conversation. He said he apologised for hurting me and that he's trying to work on that part of himself. At the same time he said he missed me and it was hurting him not talking over the few days that we didn't and he wanted to be with me and only me. He asked if I would be agreeable to be exclusive with him with the intention of being serious, with the caveat that he wouldn't be able to hang out as much as his priority at the moment is his work and his goals. I have a busy job and lots of hobbies so I don't have much spare time anyway and was happy with this. 

He asked me out on a date last Friday to have dinner then look at the Christmas lights, which would have been the first since we decided to give this a serious try. He showed up at 630 to pick me up and first thing he says is ""I'm so full, just had a big dinner"". This already annoys me as the plan was to get food and look at the lights and I had finished work late then came home and quickly got ready and not eaten because I thought we were getting food. I ended up feeling cheap as well because he said it was too bright to see the lights since it was too early and asked to come inside while we wait. We ended up sleeping together, left at around 8pm to look at lights for 45 minutes then he said we should go back to mine. He stayed for another 2 hours then left, even though he knows I would have liked him to stay over and he didn't have anything on the next day. 

I worked pretty much all of the Christmas period except boxing day. He has time off all the way till 2nd week of January. Despite knowing my busy work schedule and that I only have select days off, he didn't bother making any plans to see me. I confronted him about all of this last night and he said he knows he hasn't been very good at acting as serious with me as he feels on the inside, but its something he is working on. He recommended we focus on just going on dates and hanging out and cutting out the sexual stuff for now so I don't feel like I'm getting used. He once again said his priority is on self growth and development and probably not on the relationship even though he still wants to be in a relationship with me.

It's still early days but I'm already getting sick of this hot and cold behaviour. He otherwise acts into me, messages me first thing every morning and talks to me throughout the day, asking how my day is going etc. But then this other behaviour makes me think otherwise. I don't know whether it would be better for me to cut my losses and bail now or be patient and see how things pan out

"TL;DR: A guy said he was DTF &amp; has been flirty but has a lot going on in life, is it just that or is he too nice to say no to me?

ETA: paragraph breaks

Context: There's a guy I met at the beginning of the year, we've hung out several times both with friends and just us. He's been to my house. Sometimes we've been flirty physically but we never kissed or anything beyond that. One time I straight up asked him if he was DTF and he said ""sure"" but nothing ever came of it. I had asked him out on a legitimate date a few times, and he said ""sure"" but it never worked out because we both worked a lot.

So one of the times we were hanging out alone, I straight up told him I've been blatantly hitting on him for how long, and I don't get why he says he's interested but doesn't act like it. I even asked if it was that he thought it was weird for a woman to ask a guy out instead of the reverse. He just said it was because he was busy. 

I talked to one of his other friends about it, I've known him for a few years and he'll give me advice on that kind of stuff. He's kind of like a dad/uncle figure to a lot of our friends. He told me he thinks it's because the guy is trying to work out newly being a single dad, his kid's mom had unfortunately passed away last year. They hadn't been together for a long time, but I know from my own experience that kind of thing would still affect him because she is the mother of his child, not just some random ex.

But I still can't tell if it's *just* those factors? Or if it's that he doesn't like *me* specifically and doesn't know how to say no.

Hell, there was even a time where I didn't talk to him for a few weeks, and he went out of his way to talk to me in person &amp; explain what happened with the situation. It wasn't a jealousy thing, I was genuinely scared he was going to do something stupid and end up in jail. I told him I didn't want to see another one of my friends end up relapsing or in jail. So we started talking again… But like… Why take the time to tell me that if you're not actually interested in my opinion of anything?

I know he considers me a friend at bare minimum, he said so out loud when we were with a group that he was lucky to have a friend like me he could trust. But then why he would say he's DTF if he's clearly not?

After the first couple months it turned into me trying to push him to finally say ""no"" and stand up for himself. I've had people do it to me and it actually helped me be better as a person, and the dad figure guy has done it as well and heard those people thank him later because they were able to get out of shitty relationships with their newfound confidence.

"I look at, for example, Hunger Games and Gravity Falls. I'm pretty confident in saying these are/were very popular. Yet, they don't seem to have created the same sort of effect as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Or Transformers. Or Marvel adaptations. Rather, these two franchises pretty much stick to the primary canon in the available media. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is it because, of the other franchises I mentioned, they were built off of toy-lines and comic books? Has copyright become more strict? Or maybe nothing has really changed- with Game of Thrones, for example, launching into games; Scott Pilgrim having a game and various adaptations; and Percy Jackson having all of the above, as well as a musical. Gravity Falls, after all, continues to have bonus content. Hunger Games still maintains popularity with new book releases and subsequent adaptations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps there's nothing really going on. These two might not be as popular as the others mentioned. They could be too recent. There's a whole plethora of factors to consider. I'd just like to hear what anyone coming across this thinks, if they have anything to offer.

"TL:DR - since I got home from hospital my dog has been growling at me and attacked me out of nowhere. He used to be so loving and has changed so much. As far as I know I'm doing nothing wrong and he was taken care of in my absence since he's the family dog. What's wrong?

I was admitted to a mental hospital (against my will) for about a month this year. I also got a swert cavapoo puppy with my family this year too. As of right now he is 9 months old. 

When I got back from hospital I expected him to be his usual loving self but he's changed and it's breaking my heart. He growls now. Even if I just hold my hand too close to him while he is in bed (like a meter away) his lip curls and he bares his teeth at me. If I kove closer he growls, then snaps. He NEVER used to do this. He loved bedtime bellyrubs.

On christmas day, I was petting him and he seemed happy when suddenly he lunged for my face with a snarl and bark and I was so shocked. This wasnt the first time he did this since I've been home, it's seemingly unprovoked as 99% of the time he loves me petting him but sometimes when I or someone else in my family who WASN'T in hospital pets him, he does this. If it wasnt for my dad's quick thinking batting him away I think he might of broke the skin of my face. 

Now my dad did something I don't approve of after this interaction which was hit the dog. He claimed it was light after I shouted at him but my dog looked sad after that and I cried so hard.

I just want my loving dog back. We got him because I'm autistic and dogs improve my mental health but recently his grumpyness has been so upsetting. I understand he needs to growl sometimes to say he doesn't like something but sometimes it is out of nowhere, unpredictable or excessive. I don't know what to do please help.",Please help.

I have no problem with it considering i know a lot of people who does it. But at the end of the day this is someone who i see a future with considering i’ve never done it and no one in my family that i know of does any type of smoking. I come from a big christian household, he claims himself as christian but i’m not the one to judge a person who calls oneself christian and doesn’t do the acts of christianity, it’s what you believe. But at the end of the day he smokes more than anyone i know. He dropped sports. Football basketball track etc. He had friends from all of those sports which he doesn’t talk to anymore because he’s not keeping himself active. He only has stoner friends and claims people that he did sports with smoke as well. But at least they have something going for them at least they are being active am i right? i don’t know if i’m going too far i love him but everytime i think of him smoking i get a major ick and it makes me not like him anymore. Honestly i just asked him a question about shrooms today, saw a vid a tiktok wanted to ask him about it. It’s not marijuana it’s its own drug. He claims it as being “+1 up than marijuana” i asked if he would do it. He said “probably” i got mad at this because he was already enticpating on doing the drug. He doesn’t like nicotine because he tried it. He smokes for fun and he has nothing else fun that he does. Sure he plays basketball sometimes at the ymca or at the park, but once he’s done there he goes picks up a blunt or two. He claims he’s not addicted but the way he acts what am i to think? I know it’s not an addictive drug i know all it does is take off small pieces of your IQ. But he doesn’t even know simple words or phrases. Am i wrong for being mad at the things he does because i care? or do i not see myself with someone who does things that do not interest me?

A week later we were at the gym at the same time but I didn’t say anything, 2 days later I went up to her again and told he I ended up staying and would take her out for a walk. She said yeah she would love that with some enthusiasm. 2 days later on a Sunday I text her she doesn’t respond, I texted her again a day later she still hasn’t responded. I took the notion that she was no longer interested but a small chance it could be something else if I was just being stupid.

Within the month I would see her at my gym but less often than before I went up to her. Today I worked out with a friend but what I didn’t know was that he was good friends with her older sister and they would always workout together. He said hi to her and told her to come to our area to chat. But they ended up not doing it.after they left I told him that I went up to his friends sister and told him the context. After we both left he told me that her older sister told him that she didn’t come cus her little sister( who I was tryna get at) was trying to ghost me and didn’t wanna make things awkward going up to him  cus I was there. 

I thanked him for telling me and if there’s more to the story to tell me. I’m really not butthurt about it but I don’t know why it went that route because one thing I can say for sure that I don’t want is for her to feel uncomfortable when I’m around the gym. I don’t see anything awkward or have an issue with her and I don’t want her to feel that way at all. I also wish that she could be said no if she wasn’t interested from the beginning. This isn’t something uncommon when it comes to females and why they move in weird ways sometimes. But idk, what do y’all think it could’ve been, was she never interested or could I have taken long to set something up?

"Ok so there's a Youtuber who popped onto my feed by the name of [Solus Artorias](https://www.youtube.com/@SolusAstorias) . I see them dubbing a lot of famous artist's comics. But the thing that is bothering me is they have a Patreon/Ko-Fi and are making money off the content they are dubbing which does not belong to them. In short, they are taking the artist's comics, doing simple video editing, and using VAs to dub them, while making money off of it.

As an artist, this does not sit right with me. I also cannot find any sources to show whether or not they asked for permission from the original artists to not only dub their comics, but make money off of it. To make things even more suspicious, their disclaimers do not say they have permission, and the original artists have never tweeted their comics being dubbed.

Is anyone familiar with this content creator Solus Artorias and whether or not they have permission from the artists to do such things and make money off it? If they don't, that's pretty scummy that they are kind of mooching off the artist's work and fanbase, since they are pretty popular for the wrong reasons","This Youtuber Solus Artorias, do they actually have permission to not only dub other artist's comics, but make money off of it?",18rm1qq,1703634696.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18rm1qq/this_youtuber_solus_artorias_do_they_actually/,

"disclaimer I have no specific religion in mind with these questions and I'm genuinely just confused. I also don't consider myself to be very religious at all and don't want to mock anything.

what is the one ""real"" religion? like there are so many, like Buddhism Judaism Jainism Christianity and even in those there are many subcategories like in Christianity there's orthodox and Catholic like what do they mean?? are they already just believing in the same God but in different ways? and how are there so many religions?? there's also a bunch of ideas for the afterlife and hell and what happens if you do good and what happens if you do bad, so what really happens??

also, if Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins why should we care if we sin or not? I mean he literally came down to earth and already died for us so we're just free to live a completely normal human life? of course, I don't think that now that means everyone should start killing people and doing immoral and illegal actions just because ""this won't affect me in the afterlife, who cares!"" but I just don't feel like I see it making much sense to me.

also why do people want the idea of submitting to someone? like completely devoting yourself to some God or deity like what makes that attractive for someone? do they just want guidance?

and what if you change your mind? what if one day you're just like hey I don't think I really like this god?whoever anymore, let me look at other religions to see what I do want in a god

and I know I've mentioned to the amount of religions before but how many even are there?? I can name only a couple off the top of my head, but again if there's so many religions then there are so many people who have different opinions of stuff like hell morality and whatnot, how do you decide on one???

Is it selfish to turn to religion just to get power or help from a divine source? like if I became religious tomorrow just so I can ask some God with help for a science test do you think it would work?

speaking of, what about stuff like Greek mythology? and why is it called a mythology and not so much an actual practice religion? did people believe in the deities just die out and it's lost to time?

and what proof do people have about religion? like what's stopping from someone literally just making something completely up and being like ""yeah this is going to happen if you don't obey whatever I have set for you / do exactly what I want you'll go to this hell and it will be scary but I can't actually explain it to you so just do as I say so you don't face eternal damnation""

"Okay so  (i 15 f) idk where to start but lately I've been struggling to find friends that care about me and i can count on them &amp; truly trust them, I've been in this loophole of thinking that there was something wrong with me to the point no one actually cares if i suddenly disappear and wasn't with them and i must admit it hurts like hell. But very recently I've realized that I'm the problem, like an example "" i go to school and i hang out with my friends and everything is fine then i go home and stay on my phone or whatever probably send some of them some tt videos and move on w life, no one texts me or anything and when i text them or smth they reply WAYYY later and somehow dryly idk why"", then i kept thinking about this for a really long time and i talked with mom and dad about it and turns out my dad has the very same problem too which is not liking to text first (which is basically thinking that if they didn't text first that means they're probably not interested in this friendship and if i text them first it makes me look needy or something like that) so here's the thing, irl when we talk they never talk about their lives or anything like that (not like personal stuff but like small casual events like buying a new shirt or smth) they talk about other random people they know like 97% of the time (NOTE: we're all in grade 10 and this is my 4th year in this school so they basically grew up together and know each other more) so i don't join a lot of their conversations due to this but like otherwise we're on great terms i supposed since last year we were amazing together and everything was almost perfect, now this year there's this separate thing were they'd have have gc that doesn't include a lot of the people in the friend group and they make plans there and hang out together a lot and when we're at school together u can sense this thing were some people are preferred and heard and others are not unfortunately and that is only me. According to my mother I'm like this because I don't text them all the time to maintain a strong friendship but i literally don't know wth to text them about like life - they don't have anything to say, random thoughts - they just agree with what i say and that's it, and also like i mentioned before they're dry as hell in text so idk what to do. 
And my dad said something that REALLY got me rethinking my whole existence which was "" people like us don't choose friends, they choose us. Like when ur friend keeps texting you and trying to make time for a hangout they are the one that always makes time FOR YOU, right?"" and honestly he's totally correct but it when someone does that i actually start texting talking bout life and the most random stuff with them but my only problem is that i literally can not maintain text more than 10 minutes for the life of me so that's also a problem of mine.

Hello,I am interested in applying for the EPIK Program to teach in 2025. 
I have tried emailing EPIK but haven't heard back from them. Also, I originally posted in the teaching sub, but they referred me to this sub.

HOWEVER, I have a few questions: 

1. If I want to go in 2025, when do I apply? When it says 'EPIK Spring/Winter 2025' on the website? 

2. I have moved schools a lot since I was a child and I don't remember the dates, so do I have to add them in? Can I leave some out? 

3. Teaching experience
- Can I include volunteer teaching or does it have to be in an official place or institution? 



That's all I can think of at this time. 

Any advice or information is appreciated.

"After this christmas I really got hit with a realization. In every relation I have I feel I care and think more about them than they do for me. 
I really don’t have a lot of friends, I have a bestfriend I’ve been friends with for about a year and a half now and I have a friend that is actually a failed talking stage that I’ve known for almost a year now and we’ve been trying to stay just friends for only two months now. 
I got my bestfriend some christmas gifts and I put a lot of thought into them and had so much fun wrapping them. I did have this feeling that she didn’t get me anything and I didn’t have my hopes or expectations up or anything, but I was right and I know I shouldn’t care. It just hurts a little bit, especially cuz she asked to come over on christmas which she did and it was so much fun! She cried when I gave her the gifts and that means a lot to me that she loved the gifts I got her, she’s a great person. She admitted she still has to get me a christmas gift but exclaimed she has no idea what to get me, which hurt even more tho Idk I feel like I’m not hard to buy for and I would love and appreciate anything. Maybe I’m just overthinking it and caring too much about little stuff cuz it is only a chirstmas gift but it hurts a lil bit to not be thought of. 
And now my friend, I told him that I bought him a christmas gift and that we should do a gift exchange cuz we talked about getting gifts earlier before. However he gave a really suprised reaction and said “oh whattt really? It looks like I have to get you something for christmas now.” I’m confused by this because i swear we talked about gettimg gifts before and he knows I love embracing the holidays, and I got him something for his birthday a couple months prior even tho he didn’t get me a birthday gift. Also, idk I feel like what he said was kind of hurtful, like he didn’t need to tell me that he has to get for me now like it’s a chore or like chairty. I guess I shouldn’t have expected anything but it just hurts thinking about how the two only close friends I have didn’t even think to get me something when I was putting so much thought and preparation into their gifts. I guess I’m just wondering why wouldn’t they think to get me something for christmas or atleast want to if they care about me. 
However, I guess I just need to realize that these ppl have actual real friends that they have had their entire life and that I’m just not as important to them as they are to me. I didn’t even think to not get them something, I wish I had more ppl and friends to care for where I would recieve the same energy://

"So yesterday was Christmas and my mom got me this really nice real leather jacket that she told me she saw and immediately thought that it was something I'd like, but she also let on (once asked) that it was upwards of $200 😬. And the thing is, I do like it, it's really nice, very warm, fit me pretty good, but I don't need it, at all, I have plenty of coats including a very warm winter coat already, and although it was definitely my style like 2 years ago, it's really not anymore, and above all I would absolutely NEVER spend anywhere near that much on a coat (I think $20 for a sweater is a bit of stretch tbh) and it's actually so fancy I'm not sure how to properly take of it. Bottom line is, I don't want it, I'd much rather her return it and use those $200 for something else, weather that means a replacement gift or not, idc, I just don't feel comfortable with her spending that much money on something like this, but I don't know how to tell her. I'm autistic so I don't really understand why, but I do know that expressing anything other than absolute joy at a Christmas gift is considered very rude, and asking someone to return a gift they bought you is even more so.

"Background info:

Male 35y (Caucasian) 
Live in a big city 
Low to moderate street experience 
Goal: get more street smart 

I have been thinking about this myself for quite a while. So far, my street smart level has consistently increased, although at a too slow rate. I will list an example of a street smart situation  I had which I solved extraordinarily well. 

Example 1:
There is a neighborhood where they sell drugs open on the street. I was always afraid to pass these places since my street smart level wasn’t so good. This could lead to unsmooth interactions with the drug dealers approaching me. However, I decided to improve. So I started to walk the area much more smooth and laid back, signaling that I was confident and well aware of the things going on there. I learned to say no to the drug dealers in a more casual relaxed way, sometimes only using gestures as if I was a man of experience. Anyway, this my improved street smart level culminated in a scene where I got the respect from two drug dealers and they actually “fist bumped” me. That was one of the best days in a long time. I felt that I finally got some “street cred” which I had fought for so long. Now, I walk around the area just casually enjoying the sceneries. This is something I did very well and I am very proud that I improved my street smart level this way. On that day, I imagined that my street smart level is much like a “XP” bar in a role playing game and that I sort of “leveled up”. It was a very satisfying feeling. I reported my success to a friend of mine and I felt excited. 

However, this is my pride example and in many other situations I have failed. I know I always had to struggle with my street smartness but I always felt I was not a lost case. I’m currently learning social interactions better which also should be beneficial on the street. In the event of a street fight, I have already imagined different scenarios and I can defend myself physically over the average since I have been training different martial arts. 


Anyway, I feel there’s much to learn. I do sometimes observe higher leveled street smart people in order to learn. Maybe asking you is a better way. Do you have any tips/ tricks/ suggestions?

I am a teacher and a lot of people express that schools/teachers don’t or can’t help the victims of bullying.

I am an American teacher and at least here, the government has committed to an education for all children, including mean and violent children (how it’s supposed to work anyway)

Hello all. I am aeeking guidance on a situation. In mid September I was pulled out of my car at a routine safety checkpoint in KY. I was not given any reason for removing me or searching my vehicle. Long story short, it appears they were singled out due to being from out of state (and I am sure my green hair didn't help). The unfortunate part of this wasnt being pulled out and searched however- The officers would not allow me to get my cat into a carrier (I was in the process of moving so she was with me). Instead, they directed me to get her out of the vehicle with only a leash on. Despite me begging them to not remove her, as she was clearly terrified and i knew she would freak out. They knew this too and had been taunting me and shining flashlights directly in her face the whole time. Once we were out, she got free very quickly and darted across the busy intersection, never to be seen again. My husband and i have spent over $1,000 using every tool available to search for her. We delayed our move and continue to drive back to KY for months, staying and searching. Making things even worse, she requires daily medication and obviously is not getting it. We lost a family member that day, and my emotional support animal.  I have been the route of requesting body &amp; dash cam footagee, filing and IA complaint, and reaching out to a human rights organization. But it goes nowhere. I really feel that I cannot process and move passed this until those individuals are held accountable. Most importantly,  so this hopefully does not happene to anyone else. The community there does not support their tactics either.  I believe that exposing this through mass media may be one way to go.  Or reaching out to popular animal advocates on social media or yourtube to share the story. But I am not sure where to even start (or of this is even the right thread).  I am seeking any (productive) suggestions for how to proceed.

"While cleaning out our closets over the holidays, I (34f) came across a box of old keepsakes I had stashed away and nearly forgot about. It was old stuff from college - lots of old photos and letters and just some cool memories. 

When I found an unmarked envelope of photos tucked away in a box, I immediately remembered it - it was a few dozen photos my college boyfriend had taken of me. Most were cute, some were me trying to be sexy, and many of them were nudes. I forgot I had them, but I did remember that when my ex and I broke up, he handed them over (good guy).

"I live in Northern Virginia. My lease to my current apartment ends in early April. I have until early feb to renew or give notice. If I dont make a decision my lease will automatically be renewed for 12 months.

I found a few apartments in my budget, close to jobs I am applying to (looking for a higher paying job). However, I dont have enough saved in order to go through the process of applying for an apt, paying all the fees if I get approved, and pay for movers to move me. I don't have job offers now, but it is highly likely that I will have a job that pays at least a bit more in a few months.

Here's my dilemma: I have a large amount of money in a money market account (100k+) that I dont touch unless I really need to as its taxed. So if I moved this april id have to take more money out of this account to pay for moving expenses. OR, I could save up money for a while and then get my new job in the next few months, then find a new role, commute for a couple of months, then move by breaking my lease ( I plan on choosing the shortest possible affordable lease available to me).

"Hello again, friends. So I feel very fortunate in that I was able to get some new adaptive equipment over the holidays, namely a PXN arcade stick as well as a Kensington Trackball Mouse. I had asked for this equipment after dealing with Carpal and Cubital Tunnel in both arms, as well as on-and-off bouts of arthritis due to changes in weather patterns in my home state. After testing these out I can tell that this equipment will be much easier to use than the controllers I've been used to. This does mean that my gaming experiences will be less mobile overall, but it helps to have something that can help me enjoy my games, even if it does also limit the types of games I can enjoy.  

To that end, it seems that I will need to experience games that are less intensive, such as platformers, top down games, turn based games and some puzzle games, and am wondering where it might be better for me to experience the titles I can enjoy. Currently, I have a PS4, Switch, Surface Computer and Steam Deck, and I use my computer for work as a freelance illustrator and animation teacher.   

While I acknowledge that most of these systems are great for gaming, there are some other concerns that I had along the way, namely in the longevity of my game collections. After some of the heat that had come the way of Sony and Nintendo for the preservation of products in their library, I had thought that PC might be the ideal route to go, but I am also on a budget and need to stick to equipment that I know can handle the titles that I want to play, which would be the consoles that I have at this time. I should also acknowledge, though, that given my physical condition, it would probably not be wise for me to continue using the Steam Deck, or the Switch in handheld mode for that matter. To that end, I almost wonder whether Playstation 4 (maybe 5) or Switch docked (maybe Switch 2) would be better to experience these games, or if I should stick to PC and hope that I can afford a better computer down the line that can run these games.   

Would that be the right line of thinking for me to follow, or am I off basis in my reasoning? I would appreciate any input that you guys might be able to give me on the matter, and am looking forward to having a decent discussion with you all.

But the resulting changes were not to her liking at all when she came back to her present, so she made another game, travelled to the past again, close to her previous destination (maybe late 1999 or early 2000?) and dropped it off again there. And finally she got the result she wanted!

While I was happy with the ending, a question still remains for me: Who is this time traveler now? Can she still be born when she already existed before her birthday? (Judging by her age, she was probably born 2-3 years down the line from her last destination; 2003/2004?) Did she manage to keep her origin intact?

From time to time I catch echoes of conversations about the U.S. social dilemmas, like institutional racism and CRT.

I guess it happens so that in the U.S. socio-economic inequality and division has racial features as well.

I am originally from Russia. Here, everyone were basically slaves to the state or local landlords (so called ""pomeshchiki"") irrespective of race back in XVIII-XIX century. It was called ""serfdom"", my ancestors were serfs. Then USSR came and, well, everything was not quite fancy in terms of personal freedom.

I really get on with her dad, and her sisters’ partners.

My partner isn’t very strong willed, and though she has beliefs and will defend them, she doesn’t when she’s with my family to ‘make things easier’.

Meanwhile my family - with the exception of my dad - are complete arseholes. My mum and brother will either be screaming at each other, or teaming up against me. 

My brother and I agree politically but he is just wired as an arsehole. He cannot agree with me in front of others.

My mum will agree with whatever I disagree with. She does this on purpose. Recently got in an argument with a paedophile, showed her the argument and she agreed with them. Only after I had said who was whom did she choose a side and she deliberately went for the other. Thankfully, the scum bag is now in jail. Asked her what she thought - ‘he’s more educated than you’. Weirdest reply ever. But it isn’t even true. I have three degrees. He has none. He’s just a bloke from outside my country who decided to go on a show denouncing others like him. 

I’m so fed up at this time of year.

I’m not a hateful guy. I love my dad. 

I unfortunately love the other members of my family. They’re just arseholes.

"Just finished this documentary wiith the title about something No photo beautiful family..idk I forget the title ik I butchered it (it's on HBO). Anyways my gf and me were watching it. It was very disheartening. This grandpa destroyed two generations of his family by sexually abusing his daughter and eventually one of her daughters. Not only that but a lot of other victims for many years bc he was a chiropractor. He only faced serious consequences one time and it was bc someone decided to press charges (he only spent 2 yrs in jail anyways). 
Regardless of that fact, he continued to sexually abuse others throughout his years bc he just pretty much got away with it all his life. Now to put this into perspective I was thinking when a serial killer finally gets caught after a long history of killings, more often than not they'll face very serious consequences. In my humble opinion, rape is just as bad and it should face equal if not greater consequences.
 The physical, emotional, and psychological trauma it leaves on victims alot of times can push them to suicide or even WORSE and push them to continue the cycle of sexual abuse bc that's what they experienced. Why is it so hard in our legal systems to address sexual abuse/rape and the consequences as opposed to someone getting killed?

"I've been part of a club that means a lot to me, but I'm going to leave now soon due to leadership problems and I wonder if I'm going to be the jerk for giving the reason to the other for doing so.  
  
I've have valued the club greatly, but issues with the leader, have made it hard to stay. Leader's leadership style is often overbearing, with a focus on control rather than trust and participating with it's members themselves. This has led to a lot of tension and walking on eggshells around him.  
  
I'm part of the leadership team of this club, but I'm not the first one who have had problem with this leader. There has been many other teams before me, but every team before me was not good enough for him, and many has left this club to start their own club. I was not aware of this before after I joined the team, and through interactions with the leader I have realized that he don't wanna change.  
The last straw was his disregard for a member who's been vital in keeping the community alive through his efforts in organizing events. Despite this member's dedication, the leader fails to recognize or respect his contributions, and just talk about the old good days.

How does an Aircon work and why do they never work for me? I have been traveling for nearly 20 years and nevermind figured out how to set it properly and get a more or less steady temperature during the night.

I only use aircondition when I am on holiday. Every time I have the same problem.

There is cool mode. It shall cool down the room to the desired temperature. Right? And then stop. Right??? But it never stops..it keeps on cooling until I wake up freezing.

Okay I go Auto mode. Auto mode shall solve the problem right? 

1. At some Aircons I can not set the temperature when in Auto mode. Why? And how does the Aircon know what temperature is the right one? How do I known how warm or could my night will be?

2. If I can set the temperature... sometimes Auto Mode also keeps cooling.  Or does nothing. What is happening here?

"I have 2 adorable cats, they're 10 months old and I love them! Naturally they shed some fur and sometimes when i'm bored, i take a small cleaning thing and go all around the carpet and it gathers lots of cat hairs. Don't worry, i got a vacuum cleaner too but i manually clean at night to not get the vacuum bag too full. I also do brush them daily which gives some bit of fur too... now you guys probably know where i'm going with this.

My white cats fur is so, so soft and comfy. I was thinking about collecting his fur, like from his comb or when I clean the carpet, take my time and patience (which i have lots of) and separate his fur from other things and then do something with it. Like make it into a pillow, or learn how to make it into a coat.

I know i'm not only going to get downvoted but thrown into a dumpster fire along with an open can of gasoline but hear me out you guys. Realistically it does not do any harm to the cats because it's the fur they spread themselves. It even is a good thing as far as i know because brushing their fur will make them get less of their own hairballs into their mouth when they clean themselves. Sure it's macabre and it's gonna take me years, even money when i actually wanna do a coat, blanket or scarf with it but yeah...

"I've been out of shape for a couple years due to grad school, balancing a full time job and falling off the workout wagon during the pandemic. I gained 30 pounds of body fat while losing my muscles. After graduating recently, I began running and lifting again just for my mental health. 

Mental health has been better than ever, but since I'm eating carelessly with high protein to fuel my lifts and long runs, I've been essentially dirty bulking. Now I'm starting to wonder if my pudginess might negatively affect me at my next job. 

When I started in my first career, I was skinny and toned, so I had a lot of social interactions with people at work which helped my career. But after gaining 50 pounds of fat over a year from 12-16 hour days in a toxic work environment and dealing with endless personal struggles, people began interacting with me less. Strangers in bars and clubs would treat me like shit and go after my girlfriend, seeing me at my lowest. ""Friends"" would begin putting me down and shitting on me. 

Then, in 2019, I began lifting again to face my demons. I went so hard in the gym, that despite trying to bulk, I ended up losing a lot of body fat. And I got decent beginner gains too. And suddenly people were acting friendly to me. Some people were talking shit about me hitting the gym, because they were offended I was trying to be a better person.

I've since cut off all the toxic people in my life and have only a handful of friends remaining who appreciate me for who I am. 

After seeing how people treated me when I was chubby versus when I was fit, I started wondering if I should start shedding some pounds. I like the workout regimen I've been doing, since it feels good building both muscle mass and cardio, but sadly society doesn't like it. I'll be working at a financial institution, which is new for me. I'm worried that people in finance might be extra judgemental and superficial. And if my body fat percentage was too high, I'd be treated like shit and possibly the first to be laid off if shit hits the fan.

English is not my first language so please excuse me. So we have been broken up for more than a month now and he has been trying every way possible to get me back which I’m not planning to do so. He even showed up at my work twice, went to my house, asked my brother to open the door for him twice, and got to my room without consent ( in my family we always knock and get an answer before opening the door). He also told me that he came out with his mother and she really cared about what going on between us in a positive way and how could I leave him when he did that for me. I got soft eventually and agreed to take it slow and see if this relationship could be fixed. But I found out today that he was lying about it and just told his mom that we fight as friends and nothing more. I'm really confused about what to do right now as this is my first relationship and I’m still young, I have no experience in any relationship yet.

"Kind of embarrassed to be asking this.

I'm 30. I went to the dentist 2 weeks ago for the first time since middle school. He said I have a cavity behind my front upper tooth and I also have to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed. He wants to take care of all of this in one appointment, scheduled a few months out. 

I'm fortunate enough to have dental insurance so without sedation the cost to me would only be $250 at the time of the procedure. However, because of my initial anxiety he said he definitely wants to do it with sedation. Tbh I don't remember if he mentioned that my wisdom teeth were impacted or not, nor do I remember what level of sedation he described. I was very nervous during the appointment. He mentioned medications prior to the removal procedure but I'm not sure if he would also use IV sedation or anesthesia.

My issue is that in order to schedule the procedure with sedation, they want $300 up front because insurance won't cover it. This is in addition to the 250 at the time of the appointment. I just can't seem to justify it to myself and I'm putting off getting it scheduled because that $300 is needed elsewhere.

And What I found really weird was he was calling his mom ( my auntie) every 2-3 hours   everyday for 3 days when I was there and they were on speaker conversing in kannad language and I understand that language.  I think they assumed I don't.  

And he was asking about every little details of what was going on there. From Taking bath to what we are doing everything. Is that  normal. And he is also not talking to my mother because we rarely visit there like once in 2 year. That felt so rude.It's okay if they don't want to talk.

I've recently been exploring the vast world of online forums and I've come to realize the immense value Reddit holds when it comes to seeking advice. The diversity of topics, the active community, and the depth of discussions are truly impressive. 
 
I'm curious to know - what's your favourite forum for asking questions?  

I've heard a lot about Quora too. It seems to be another platform that encourages intellectual curiosity and provides insights from experts in various fields. However, I'm still not sure if it can top the experience I've had on Reddit.

"I've been doing a lot of snorkeling in South Australia and yesterday, I saw what appeared to be a great white shark around 50m from the shore. It was the first time I saw a dangerous shark and I slowly swam backwards as I kept my eye on it. Once the water was shallow enough, I made a beeline for the coast. I know everyone says getting attacked by a shark is one of the rarest events ever but is it that rare? Once you're in the ocean past a 2m depth, you're on the menu.

"In high school I decided to go to a smaller liberal arts college 40 minutes from my parents house in California. After my first semester, I decided that I didn't want to be there anymore and I made the decision to transfer for my Sophomore year. At my first college, I honestly didn't try hard to make friends at all. I never talked to people in my classes, I didn't join clubs and I didn't rush. I didn't give my first university a fair shot. The  riends I had were my suitemates (5/8 of them I'm friends with) and one friend that was from my high school. I lacked a lot of maturity then and my decision was fueled by emotion rather than logic. I feel like I transferred for no good reason at all. The last 2 months of my time at my first school were actually very enjoyable and I have a lot of good memories from that time even though I was leaving. Anyways I started at my second school, which is a large school in the South, and I went all out in making an effort to make friends. I made it a goal to eat lunch or hang out with someone new everyday. I talked to everyone in my classes and I did plenty of things out of my comfort zone. However, I am still not happy at my new school. First, pretty much everybody already has their group of friends and it is hard to break into already existing cliques. Secondly, the social life at my new school is largely dominated by greek life which I am not apart of.  I am not miserable but this is not the college experience I want by any means. I am thinking about going back to my old school now for next year. My old school is close to home, is similar in price and status as my new school and is in the location that I want to work in when I graduate.

"I was curious about environmental impact of milk and came across this information.

https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/which-vegan-milk-is-best-for-the-environment

I haven’t fact checked, but taking on face value, why is dairy milk so much cheaper to buy as a consumer if it consumes more of everything in its production? Also considering longer shelf life of alternatives, seems alternatives should be cheaper.

One obvious fact is the supply and associated supply chain built up around dairy over decades / centuries. Though surely faced with such stark figures and increasing demand,  the store price would start to equalise as supply of alternatives increases. Yet in my anecdotal experience, there is zero vidence of this happening and it seems to be going the other way. I’ve noted price of 1L of soy has increased 60p from £1.50 to £2.10 in last 3 years. Yes inflation but still… 2L of dairy is around £1.40.

Are milk alternative producers in a worldwide cartel reaping outsized profits at expense of the environment or is there something else going on? Or am I just living in a bubble and, despite the increase in shelf space at the supermarke, demand for milk alternatives remains niche hence the price?

Furthermore, why are they only selling alternatives as 1L bottles if it keeps longer than dairy?

Look, I love my sisters so much. They mean the world to me and there's nothing I wouldn't do to make them happy.

I'm planning on investing most of the money and keeping a small bit of it for myself to buy some stuff and pay back some of my debts. 

I know they won't mean to, but if I do tell them just how much money I've actually received it's going to be ""oh, you owe me this"" or ""can you get this meal for us?"". And, please keep in mind that I say this with love... they're very impulsive. 

I know it's not like I worked for my money, it's just a payout. But it's a payout for horrible abuse that I suffered at the hands of my stepfather. It happened to one of my siblings too, and I think that if they want the money they should apply. 

They know I applied for the money, and that I'm getting it, but they don't know when or how much. When they inevitably ask, what do I say? Do I deny that I got it, or change the subject? I'm so confused and unsure what to do and say.

"To this day I love their memes, like the one about demi lovato and heroin. They did end up making a new account with a different name though. I don't know their new meme page account name, although I used to.

Story about why i don't know their new page anymore - in late 2017 I was friends with the girlfriend of one of my friends (who got charged with stealing over 800 dollars of legos a year or two ago). I initially didn't want to be anything more than friends but i recall this girl calling me ""babe"" and even saying ""you can eat my ass if you want"" (i don't eat ass). Like the idiot at the time that I was (I'm probably gonna get hate for this, but I know that I probably deserve it anyways), I told him ""Does [his girlfriend's name] do CPR? She makes my heart beat."" He then hired someone to hack my account, which initially was for the purpose of reading the conversations between me and the guy's girlfriend. Then he started threatening me - at the time I was in high school, and the guy who hacked my account got enough info to find that I get out of wrestling practice at around 5-6PM and wrestling meets at 7-8PM, and he would say to bring a flashlight, and that he would be attacking me in the dark when I was walking home at night. At the time I got the impression that he was all talk (and he never ended up even laying a hand on me). I never felt the need to report this to authorities but the girl's mom was considering doing it. The guy who hacked my account stopped going on my account when my sister reported him to the vice principal at my school, after he told her plans to attack me at night. I still don't know whether or not the info about this whole situation was shown to proper authorities. To this day I don't know exactly who hacked my stuff, but I got clues about his name (which begins with an S). Not only is instagram full of the worst comment sections but they're not helpful when it comes to getting accounts back to their initial owners. Anyways I did end up being locked out of my instagram account and had to make a new one, so i dont know savage mexiican's account name anymore.

And yes, the guy who hired the hacker did break up with the girl.

My question is, could there be a drug that inflicts pain instead? If a user kept taking it, the human body would gradually adapt and release more and more endorphins to counteract it each time, right? And then when getting off the drug, withdrawal would be amazing, right?

"TLDR at the bottom 

Im a male in my late 20s and I have struggled all my life to make friends who find value in having me around.  
  
Everyone I’d consider a friend thinks of me positively. They have always had nice thing to say even when I hear about it through the grape vine.  
  
I help my friends, i've laughed with them tremendously, i’ve had deep conversations with each one of them many times over years. I help without complaint on things they need to get done. I pick up the phone at 3am if  they are in trouble. I lend money. I offer my home. I give as much as i can. To all of them. All 20+ people i see most commonly and then crazy amounts of people i see throught the year.  
  
Yet, no one ever calls. No one ever texts. No one invites me out. Not one wants to come hangout. No one wants me to come hangout witht them. I dont get invited to parties. People don't respond very quickly (hours to weeks). People respond awkwardly to my friendly advances.  
  
If i say “ hey ive got this thing going on if anyone wants to join” no one will answer. But later on one of my “friends” will call me but only because they need something from me.  
  
And these are all people ive know for years. The shortest friendship is a little over a year and the next shortest is 5 years.  
  
The only parties i’ve ever been to are ones ive thrown myself.   
  
When i introduce a new person to my groups of friends, that person will eventually stop hanging out with me and just hangout with all of them without me.  
  
I give many sleepless nights and endless days counseling my friends to help them over come what they may be struggling with at the moment. Then once they feel better, i never hear from them again.  
  
I text friends i havent spoken to in a long time just to remind them that they are loved. No ones ever done that for me.  
  
My friends ask for my opinion. They think im smart. They like listening to what i have to say when i find myself in a position to talk to them.   
  
But they all hangout and do things without me. They plan without me. They talk without me. They go out without me. They do everything without me.  
  
And for the longest time i wouldnt really notice this. But now its starting to get to me. I do so much. But no one likes me enough for me to be their actual friend.   
  
Im so lonely around counltess amounts of people who would all say “yeah, he’s a great guy”  
  
Clearly there must be something wrong with me. It couldn’t be the case that everyone else is the problem. I must be doing something wrong.

Am I just awkward and not fun to be around without realizing it?

I’m really outgoing. I talk to everyone, I’m not shy, I have a lot of hobbies, I read a lot, I’m athletic, i do a bunch but I seem to not be enough.

It certainly wasn’t my number one, that would belong to basketball, as far as skillset is concerned, but I was no bunny hill pussy either. I skied some pretty tough hills. I’ve done steep, icy, tried snowboarding, so I probably was a bit better than your average skier, but not by a ton. There’s a lot of really good skiers out there. Like a lot. I crashed on an icy green diamond and idk how I didn’t get paralyzed. I was going like 80mph. I would rather get hit by a car at a low speed than crash at 70-80mph. My friend had to walk up and carry me down the rest of the mountain, and every step was just full body electrifying pain. On the drive home I passed out from the pain for most of the ride. Went to the doctor. Nothing. No broken bones, very mild sprains, and just a few bruises. The initial pain he said was because it was essentially a full body mild sprain, and sprains hurt like a mother even if they’re mild. Especially all over the body. I’ve given up skiing.

"TLDR : My gum fell on an encapsulated plutonium source during class and I put it back in my mouth. Any risks?

Twenty years ago, I was in physics class with a Geiger counter to test radioactive sources (uranium, cesium, plutonium, strontium, etc). We were told to put some gloves on and take out the plutonium source that was stored on the floor surrounded by lead bricks. We were told to put the wooden box on the desk, open it and take the source out to place it on the Geiger probe with tweezers. My dumbass was chewing some gum. I was talking to a teamate whilst my hand was shaking from holding the plutonium with my tweezers and my gum came out flying out of my mouth, out of nervousness, falling straight on the plutonium source I was holding with my tweezers. My dumbass took that gum and put it straight back in my mouth. After a 30 sec realization, maybe more, I took that gum and spit it out in the trash. I was too ashamed to go tell the professor about it..

We are talking something very similar to this story : [https://www.quora.com/I-m-15-and-today-we-used-plutonium-in-a-physics-experiment-in-school-It-had-gamma-radiation-and-I-was-very-close-to-it-for-20-minutes-without-lead-I-feel-sick-and-dizzy-Should-I-go-to-a-hospital](https://www.quora.com/I-m-15-and-today-we-used-plutonium-in-a-physics-experiment-in-school-It-had-gamma-radiation-and-I-was-very-close-to-it-for-20-minutes-without-lead-I-feel-sick-and-dizzy-Should-I-go-to-a-hospital)

Unlike this picture, I believe the bottom wasn't open with mesh but completely closed off in a small metal cylinder with a small handle on top.

Now this thing still keeps me up at night up to this day. I believe this was an very low potency plutonium source that was encapsulated in steel or something. I'm thinking there is no risk of adverse effect as in the worse case, my gum has only been irradiated which poses no risk to me (like any irradiated food). I think in an academic setting, the source should be safe to handle and ''student proof'' enough so that no radioactive material can leak out or spread in the wild or onto objects. Am I paranoid to still be worried about this 20 years later? Should I get my a\*\* checked for plutonium traces, aka Alpha/Gamma particles in my blood or something? I haven't grown a new limb yet.

"For those that may not be familiar, absolute pitch is where somebody can hear a note and name what it is from hearing (e.g a G, B flat, etc), and can generally produce any note which is told to them.

However, as I got older, I realised that this was apparently something most people couldn’t do, and it always confused me when people would double check notes on a piano or other instrument, or wouldn’t believe me when I named a note, because it was just clear to me - it’s akin to seeing a colour and then watching somebody have to consult a colour palette to confirm the colour.

"I've been getting into candle-making, and it seems kind of wasteful to use a whole new container for every candle, when there are so many containers already in existence. I'd love to be able to repurpose old glasses, teacups, jars, etc. by pouring candles into them. 

But I'm not naïve enough to think that anything and everything can be used as a candle container. I understand some materials could burn, melt, overheat, catch fire, or even explode under certain circumstances. I'm guessing that glass, ceramic, tin, and other common materials for candle containment can vary in safety depending on if it has any coatings on it, but I don't know anything beyond that.

How can I tell if a given vessel would be safe to use for a candle? For example, would it be safe to put a candle in a shot glass? A ceramic teacup? A Mason jar? An empty soup can?

"Last week Colorado's Supreme Court barred Donald J. Trump eligibility on its Republican primary ballot for violating the qualification requirement described in 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution.

Every news outlet is stating that the Supreme Court MUST now take the Colorado case.    But wouldn't Trump need to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court for them to take it up? 

Nobody else has standing, except Trump, and maybe other republican voters in Colorado.  

But why would Trump appeal this and rush it to SCOTUS when he most certainly would lose Colorado anyways in the general election, and a SCOTUS decision against his eligibility would be nation wide.

There are 16+ other states (so far) with disqualification lawsuits pending. A betting man would predict that all the Red states with red legislatures and state supreme courts will side with Trump.   And I'm betting a good portion of Blue States, like Michigan's decision yesterday, will allow him as well.

So really, Trump might only appeal the decision if he believes a Red state he absolutely needs to get the needed electoral college votes, decides to ban him from the ballot box.... its perhaps his last play?

And that state IMO, would be Arizona

"Hi sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I’m looking for the term when someone is so rigid that you only get one shot with anything, trivial or important. 

This is a personality trait but I'm having a hard time describing it without knowing what this personality trait is called, if there is a specific term that this is, that I shall try to describe.

As an example, and this is a very trivial example, but I feel it describes exactly what I'm trying to portray... let's say you're walking back to the car and she's carrying something and it's not too big so you think she's going to put it on the back seat. Then you realize she meant to put it in the trunk (which as custom, you would open for her) ... she stands at the trunk for a second, as you go to get in the car. Then when you realize she stopped at the trunk you go to open it for her. But no, it's too late, she's already getting in the car with said item on her lap, horribly pained at the inconvenience you've caused by not opening the trunk. You open the trunk but no amount of, ""here, hand it to me"" will get her to change her mind now, she's damn well going to ride all the way home with that goddamn thing on her lap and now she's going to be ""in a mood"" for the rest of the night, and you're the inconsiderate thoughtless son of a bitch that didn't think to open the trunk.

"Hey everyone, I have a little brother 11M and I'm 20M.  


I'd say I'm a decent brother but I get really frustrated with my little brother sometimes because of his character.  
So a little about him, he loves roblox and playing with friends which is fine but when he's not doing that he'll often play by himself which can be problematic when he's been on the computer for too many hours. He also doomscrolls on youtube shorts, thankfully he doesn't have tiktok yet but I wouldn't keep my hopes up.  
He likes the water but he's also to be quite frank, a pussy. He refuses to jump from anything above a meter, he refuses to try tricks like manus, flips etc. It's also pretty difficult to get him to jump into cold water at the beach which is a bit more understandable but it's still quite annoying.  
He complains a lot, pretty much everyday about something stupid and it's become a bit much so I refuse to listen to complaints unless they're genuine and above a certain level of pettiness.  
Other things that he typically does is leave dirty dishes and cups in our room and no matter how often I tell him, he still doesn't take them with him on his way out of the room.  


I hit the breaking point today where I feel a bit like a monster because I'm an adult and he's a kid. when I took him to the beach and it was too cold to get in he played in the sand a little bit but he tried to avoid reading his book for some reason. I had to really push him to read and he only did it for a few minutes. On the way home we rid the electric scooters and at a stop sign I stopped but he wasn't paying attention and went past the stopping line and nearly fell off - a car was about to cross which is why I stopped. He tried to blame me for stopping abruptly and I got a little mad and told him that he shouldn't blame me for his lack of awareness or safe riding, that he needs to learn to take some responsibility and that I wasn't going to let him ride on the scooters again because he clearly couldn't be trusted to ride safely.  


Our parents are extremely risk adverse and I know it had affected my childhood growing up, it's happening to him as well. My parents are well meaning but I mean come on, they wont let him walk the 10-15 minutes to school in a suburb because 'he's not old enough'.  


I really just need to know how I can be a better brother to him. I want him to be more fun, to push his comfort zone but he's really just too scared of the world. I cant take him to the beach on my own, he'll complain, I cant take him and hang out with my friends at the same time even though he's old enough - he doesn't have the will to do the same activities and that handicaps us from having the best possible time. He's just so limiting but he's my brother and I love him.

"I hope this sub is right for this...

I recently had a disagreement with a friend who said that anyone that goes on to commit a crime like murder was already inherently broken, and would have most likely gone on to ​murder regardless of whether or not they were able to receive proper mental health care before committing the act. I told her that I felt like that view is harmful because I don't think that every single person that goes on to murder was necessarily a bad seed ​to begin with, and had they received proper help, may not have gone on to commit the crimes they did.

The entire topic stemmed from me sending a link about health care being lacking among women suffering from things like Postpartum Depression/Psychosis.

She claimed that if someone commits a murder (​like a mother going through postpartum psychosis ​that murders her​ ​children) they ​w​ere clearly disturbed to begin with,​ and no amount of mental health care would have ​changed or helped them if they were capable of committing such an act, but that family planning should be utilized more before people have children to prevent ​someone that might commit murder from getting pregnant or be prepared enough that they just wouldn't have a breakdown.

I don't disagree that family planning by people in general should be u​sed, but her stance felt a bit ignorant in my own personal opinion, so I figured I would see if maybe I am the odd one out here and see what other people's views are pertaining to this topic.

She also claimed that anybody that's offended over her stance shouldn't be unless they're planning on murdering their family, meaning that I shouldn't be bothered by her feeling this way. So I really don't know if I just shouldn't have taken offense.

So, what's the general consensus from people on this topic? Was she right? Were those people just irredeemable broken and crazy to begin with or is there more to it? I originally compared her views to eugenics, and told her I don't think it's a good mentality to ​hold, because you can't always tell who is going to end up committing a ​murder or why. I don't know if I'm the one thinking backwards about ​this topic ​or not and would love to hear from others.

"I'm finally leaving the nest tomorrow, and I've got two cats who I adopted myself and I love very, very dearly.

The thing is, my mom has repeatedly expressed how much she's going to miss them. She hasn't been trying to get me to leave them with her; she's just been having a hard time coming to terms with it it seems like.

I am the last child to leave home, and since my sisters are 20 years older than me, she's been technically raising kids for 43 years nonstop. She has been divorced from my dad for 14 years now, and I've been really worried about her having to adjust to being completely alone with me leaving, especially with me taking my cats with me.

I love my cats so, so much, and I want them with me so, so badly.. But I feel like while I love and want them, my mom loves and needs them.

I feel like the right thing to do is to let her have them. It's just that I know that it would be extremely hard for me to let go of them too. I know that theoretically she could get her own cats, but I've asked her about that, and she doesn't really want to, which I understand because those are her grand babies, and I wouldn't want to replace them either.

"I live in a 15 floor apartment complex in Chicago that houses at least 150 residents, many of which are elderly.

The building has one central elevator, which is a standard size, and a second side elevator that is about 3ft X 6ft (so, much smaller.) Second elevator is also a pain to use because you have to open the outside door, which is heavy, after the inside elevator door itself opens.

The central elevator breaks down pretty often (on average 2x a month). Assuming it's not a holiday or a Sunday, it's pretty much repaired the next day.

During Thanksgiving week this year, it broke down twice. It got repaired the day before Thanksgiving, and then broke down again on Friday. It couldn't be serviced until Monday.

Then, it broke down on Dec. 24 and was repaired on Dec 26th. It functioned for all of 2 hours before it broke again, and then was repaired late afternoon today (Dec 27).

I noticed that both elevators say they have a ""Conditional Certificate of Inspection"". Central was inspected April 2020 where as the secondary was September 2019. 

The following boxes are checked off:
 ""Due to lack of compliance with all code requirements this certificate is considered conditional. Further inspection will be required to ensure full compliance with the code."" 

As well as ""Permit Required"".

N, E and I have a few classes together and for the past month I've been telling E that I think N likes her because I just get a vibe whenever they talk. But she said i was being delusional so I just tried to ignore it.

E and I always talk about how me, N, her,  C and two of our other friends would make such a good friend group. We had a sleepover a week ago where we were planning an outing with the six of us.

Then literally the next night, N texted E asking her out (C knew abt it and told him to go for it, but i think that was just him testing the water with E).

"Airbnb sub delete this so trying again here. 

I have a psychiatric service dog (PSD) and plan to take her on a trip with me in January. The airbnb I booked has a no pet policy so I let the host know that my PSD will be accompanying me. I asked about any safety concerns on property for a dog and personal rules the host has about animals on the property. Host said just to be sanitary and prevent damage to property which is completely reasonable. They also asked for service dog papers. I was prepared to answer the two questions typically asked regarding service animals (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform? My answers: yes and she’s trained to retrieve mediation and provide DPT. Maybe this is a personal thing I need to get over but I’m kind of embarrassed by the diagnosis and need to have a service dog. I got a little flustered when asked about documentation because I know that means disclosing my diagnosis to a stranger. Yeah, I’m only there for a couple days and I’ll probably not interact with this person again but I let them know I wouldn’t be providing documentation. Is that wrong of me? They’re still accommodating me I’m just wondering if disclosing my diagnosis is something I need to get over and have ready to provide.

Service animals are:

-Dogs

-Any breed and any size of dog

-Trained to perform a task directly related to a person’s disability


Service animals are not:

Nuclear power seems clean since it really only gives off steam as well as producing an incredible amount of energy so I just don’t know why it isn’t more common.

Wouldn’t electricity become cheaper as well, making electric cars more viable?

"I’ve been watching a lot of The West Wing and early Simpsons recently, and school prayer as a political issue has come up a surprising amount in The Simpsons and a reasonable amount for The West Wing as a political programme.

"Title, mostly. This question is born out of the habits of my current and former girlfriend. 

My former would consume lots of alcohol but would do so over long periods so as to not get visibly drunk. Drink of choice would rotate over long periods of time, sometimes it was wine, sometimes mixed drinks, sometimes just light beer. During Covid and work from home, she basically drank constantly.

Now, I also can drink casually and I might have a glass of wine with dinner or a few beers while I run the BBQ. Alcohol has never been an issue for me.

My current gf is something I’ve never witnessed before. She seems actually addicted to alcohol. During my aforementioned glass of wine during dinner, she will get blackout, falling over wasted. This has happened at least once a month as long as we’ve been together. 

Basically I’ve determined that she has some sort of genetic susceptibility to alcohol. No other direct family member who are blood related drink, this was my clue. 

My Second was that she seemed to be EXTRA affected by alcohol. By her second small glass of wine, she has a heavy slur and significant loss of coordination. By her third, she’s in blackout territory. 

My third clue was that she began hiding her drinking and couldn’t manage it. After about a year of this, I began to grow tired of the blackout shenanigans, so she started to try to obfuscate her drinking. I would go out to run the bbq or do yard work and would come in to find a drink tucked behind something in the kitchen, and her heavily intoxicated. There were other times when we were heading to bed, like 5 minutes from being asleep, and she’s trying to cram another drink in before shuteye. There was another time when, after a drink we had sexy time before bed, I went to the bathroom to cleanup, and I heard her go out to the kitchen, open the freezer and take a big drink of straight vodka then run back to bed like nothing had happened. There’s a bunch more odd/messy incidents but I don’t room here.

My last clue and conclusion was that she simply cannot control herself around alcohol in the house. In more or less current time, she now has several scars from blacking out and falling into the dresser, she broke the toilet, I’m surprised she has died with how many times she’s fallen in the bathroom, we’ve gone round about the issue and no matter how much she intends to have just one casual drink, it always ends up with her blacking out. All of her sober intentions go right out the window as soon as she starts drinking. I once timed her and one of these “just one glass” nights, she was on her third glass inside an hour. She blacked out not long after. 

It was like a moth to a flame. Now, we don’t keep alcohol in the house, but she makes “mock tails” and has several on most nights.

Most of those people are highly educated and it would hurt Russia to lose them.

If Sweden, Germany, France, UK and other Western countries opened their countries for anti-war Russians they would hurt Russia much more because Russia would lose its young and highly educated people. They should've even advertised themselves on Russian social media platforms. I just don't understand why the West decided to take in as little Russians as possible. Perhaps they hoped that anti-war Russians would protest against government and somehow destabilise Russia? It's been 2 years and we see nothing.

From the Anschluss, Czechoslovakia, the constant refusing to effectively deal with the growing military threat until it was too late, and ultimately literally repeating German talking points like the Nazis were simply occupying the Sudetenland for stability and peacekeeping reasons; I see Chamberlain as being largely culpable in allowing what they occurred to occur.

The British Navy was in a truly commanding position in 1938 compared to the German military and could have, with the support of France, finished off the threat before it started with a competent and realistic response to Hitler's aggression.

I know that history has not treated him kindly in terms of his legacy, but that's not punishment enough for what eventually occurred due to his repeated failure.

Clearly, he is not as accountable as the leaders of the Third Reich, not anywhere close. But one could argue he had more opportunity to stop the atrocities before they began than say a regular German soldier or even an Officer in the Nazi armed forces.

"Hello all! Very new to Reddit so I apologize if this is in the wrong place or formatted incorrectly but here it goes.   
  
I need advice. I am 26 and 5.5 years into a business I started all on my own at 21. I’ve been a hustler since I got my first job and knew early on that I didn’t want a boss. After 5 years in business and so many highs and so pretty deep lows, I just need advice on a path forward. My current business is in the automotive e-commerce space. I do have a brick and mortar location as well. Year 1 &amp; 2 I did around 1 million in sales combined. Year 3 I did around 1.5 million. Year 4 I did 2.2 million. And year 5 is 2.5 million. Year over year my sales grow and I have worked tirelessly to keep customers happy (within reason, the customer is not always right in my business). I have maintained great relationships with vendors (about 10 primary roughly 10 more secondary, then another 20 as tertiary). I am very smart about what I buy for my brick and mortar inventory so that the stuff I sell out of my retail location I make 40% ish margin on average. In my industry average margin varies between 10-30% depending on the sub niche of parts you are talking about. I put at least 100k into my pocket at the end of the day after EVERYTHING. All the possible deductions and write offs I can possibly manage. The business is more or less a cash machine when the machine is running well.   
  
So I know in all that it doesn’t sound like there is a problem, and for online gurus, that would be the part that they flashed around. I however have never been into showing success without also sharing pitfalls. I am very open about entrepreneurship and business ownership to anyone that asks. My business has problems and I have problems which culminate into one BIG question at the end.  
  
  
Problem 1 - Monthly Expenses:  
So when my business is doing those sales numbers, let’s just say my profit margin is around 20% on average. I strive for more but that’s a good round number. If my sales continue to be consistent at roughly 2 million per year that means my business makes 400k profit. The bitch is the expenses I have accumulated. Daily operation expenses just keep piling on, and I am very anal about spending money, I only add an expense if it is well worth the cost.   
  
For example, I ran out of storage space at my old shop which I rented for 1000 per month. It was a ragtag building that was a good stepping stone early on but not really viable for the long term. Renting a bigger space in my area was $7500 per month. I found double the space in a way better building for 290k setting on 2 full lots plus 1.5 lots next to me for future expansion. My “mortgage” is around $1800 per month. So all in all I did decent on a cost per month basis compared to $7500 and no equity for the next best option. At the same time though, I added $800 more in an expense because my previous crack shack rental location was $1000. I also moved cities which made my insurance go up. With the bigger building and the way the building is set up I am basically forced to keep the whole building heated and cooled and can’t just heat the main sections like I did at my previous location. So heating, electricity, internet, insurance all increased when I moved plus the fact that I now have to pay property taxes on the space. The move has absolutely increased retail business and customers are much happier at this location, BUT I’ve added a minimum of $1500 extra overall monthly expenses to my business just off of this example.   
  
As I update/upgrade the weak links and bottlenecks of my business I am very smart about the money I spend and how I do it, but no matter how you slice it, bigger and better equals more expensive. Right now my business expenses every month are roughly 14k which is low compared to what they had been at around 19k. I took a machete to those expenses in January 2023 but you can only hack away so many things before you get to the actual bones. I have myself and one other full time employee running things. As of right this minute though, that other employee is on maternity leave and I am semi-comfortably running everything on my own without too many things falling apart. The business has gotten too big to run entirely alone, but luckily I have built things so that it is actually doable to run alone if needed, just not long term because cracks would form.   
  
  
  
Problem 2 - Customers &amp; My Sanity:  
I am at like 95% capacity. I’m about to blow. Earlier today I had to hang up on a customer because I thought I was going to go ballistic.Running the business solo temporarily is doable but I’m already an anxious and stressed out guy and taking the full load of the work again for the first time in 2 years has been a wake up call. We have also noticed a shift in customers. It used to be that our customers were like 90% chill down to earth smart people. 5% Karen’s. 5% idiots. Now it's 20% Karen’s. 20% Douchebags. 20% complete idiots that I would argue may be mentally handicapped. 20% people that expect you to white glove handle every single little detail of every minute thing that may come up in or around anything related to the item they get from us. 10% scam orders. 5% canceled orders. 5% chill down to earth smart people. And I know the first thing that’s going to get said is that maybe we changed, but we didn’t. My business was founded on bringing good deals to people and providing them with great service and experience. I started this business because I was tired of overpaying and dealing with horrible people or not being able to get into contact with anyone when something went wrong. That has not changed since day one. Also, I have maintained a pretty low margin compared to most of my competitors giving my very good pricing. We have also made HUGE improvements to our website and online presence. Every single change to the business has been for the better. We have not changed at all, the customers have. So now I am making somewhat shit margins in relation to the amount of shit we have to deal with.   
  
For example, we sell you a bumper for $1500 that we bought for $1100. So $400 profit for us before card fees and like a 35% markup. The bumper comes in with a small scratch from shipping. Back in the day customers would say, no big deal. Just a little scratch, I can put touch up paint on it. Send me a hat and a shirt and we can call it even. All good and we send them either $50 back or $50 in merchandise and everybody is happy. Now, the same thing would happen and we get threatened with, you are going to send us $700 so have the powder coating completely redone or else we will call the card company and get all the money back. So then you are left with the choice of losing $700 or losing $1500 plus chargeback fees and months of headache. We as the seller are SOL because we dropship almost everything and industry wide distributors only give back $200 at most for something like this unless you really beg. That’s because the customers never notate damage at delivery when receiving, but literally no one does. So all in all, this transaction we lost $100 plus card fees plus time, and more than anything sanity. This happens over and over and over and over. It’s becoming more and more frequent. Shipping damage happens in every industry I know but in the automotive industry it is so common because the density of most of the parts and the shit job of all brands industry wide on packing things. Even the handful of brands that actually do pack well can’t survive every trip just because of how rough shipping has gotten. That is also just an example of a customer that did actually buy, we have more people than ever clogging up and bogging down our phone lines with absolutely no intention of making a purchase.   
  
  
Problem 3 - No Time:  
I know the common thing is that when you run a business that you are married to it, but i don’t want that. Why am I working for myself if I have no control over my schedule? Sure I can set whatever hours I want but unless they are within reason having shit hours or inconsistent hours will make me lose countless sales and could cause a cascade effect. So I am seemingly stuck glued to my phone/computer Monday through Friday for the rest of my life unless I sell out or shut down? I can’t even go to get a haircut because god forbid I am not at someone's disposal for 30 minutes during the week. It's maddening trying to do any sort of errand throughout the week because I literally can not. Every time I try to leave I get sucked right back in. I know the solution for this is hiring but the main time consuming portion is the retail store and in my industry and in my area the hiring pool is very very small unless I just want a complete moron running the store. I had a great boy running the store but after a year of working for me his entitlement bubble kept growing until I eventually had to pop it and let him go. I have not looked at hiring again because after the absolute shit show that he ended up being at the end I am still not mentally able to deal with hiring an employee or training them, plus I dont have the time for it.   
  
Problem 4 - Retail Store:  
So this is sort of a continuation of the last point but sort of not. Like I stated before, I have a retail store and an online store. Until I moved to the new building a year and a half ago my sales were 90% online and 10% local. My local sales at some points were so low that I considered just shutting down my retail store instead of buying a new building. However, around the same time I bought my new building things really changed in our online sales, we didn’t change anything but the sales sure did. Basically since moving and since the time our online sales plummeted in most sectors our split has been more like 65% online and 35% local sales. I know this is going to make some people say, well then it sounds like your local is where you should focus because it is growing, and I get that argument, but our local pool is tricky. We are fully tapping into our local market now since buying the new building, basically through word of mouth, some small ads, and reputation. We are about as big as we can grow locally due to the population in our area. We also have several competitors that have set up shop within an hour of us in the past year and while we haven't seen a dip because of it, only so many people can feed off the same pool in an area that isn’t growing before something gives.   
  
So the problem here is that the retail space has proven to be a valuable asset to the business, but it only accumulates for about 30-40% of sales on the high side but is the thing that requires 80% of the time needed to run the business, and probably 50% of the expenses. So is it worth it?  
  
Problem 5 - Online Store:  
So building off the last point, through no direct correlation and just by complete coincidence, around 3 months before we got into our new building our online sales dynamic really really changed. This part I do not want to divulge too much info on but across the automotive space we sell all kinds of parts. Intakes, bed covers, lift kits, tires, wheels, bumpers, lights, etc. We have a certain sector that we have always had a little stronger sales in but the other categories were not too far behind so it all sort of evened out. For example, sector A 30% of sales, sector B 20% of sales, sector C 20% of sales, sector D 10% of sales, sector E 10% of sales, sector F 10% of sales. Then in early 2022 coming off the COVID bubble lots of suppliers had overstock items, blowout pricing started happening, map pricing was removed on tons of items, and sales dropped and then plateaued at this new point they dropped to. The breakdown then shifted to something more like this sector A 80% of sales, sector B 5% of sales, sector C 5% of sales, sector D 3% of sales, sector E 1% of sales, sector F 1% of sales. So my diversification went to shit and my overall online sales went to shit in comparison to a strong steady growth from the start. I am also a little freaked out because in that sector A category a “winning product” emerged but not necessarily in a good way. Right now, because of my shit online diversification if something happened to my winning product things may not make sense anymore because of how much expense we have in maintaining an online catalog and the so few sales that have redistributed to other sectors despite numerous changes to our site, marketing, etc. in an attempt to not be so reliant on one product. The place my industry as a whole is in is overall decent because overall my sales are fine but most of their main companies and distributors are still dealing with overstock so MAP pricing on a lot of items is not there almost 2 years later.  
  
  
Problem 6 - The winning product:  
The issue is one that I have struggled with and debated on from day one. I somewhat lucked into it but someone studied my way into a winning product. The good news, I make a ton of relatively easy sales with this product because of the way my brand is positioned and the steps I was able to take to get to it first and drive out the competition surrounding the product. I sell 90% of the national stock of this product and have no real competition with it. This item basically sells itself with a little help from us. I worked my ass off to get this product to where it is and my efforts on this product have drastically increased brand recognition of the brand that the product belongs to as well as my own because they have grown together. So, I know what will be said now, you have a winning product so run with it, but I can’t. This product is a subseries of a product, of a bigger series, of a small brand, private label by one of the big main distributors in the industry, which is owned by a parent company that trades on the stock market. So basically there is no chance of me getting rights to the product. I have tried to get exclusive reseller rights to this item because we sell them like crazy, but basically without this distributor's dropshipping capabilities it doesn't work. They give us flat rate shipping prices, on top of stupid stupid low product cost to the point that if we even attempted to buy in bulk from them, warehouse ourselves, hold inventory, make purchasing commitments, negotiate shipping rates, deal with shipping, etc. We would at minimum spend absolutely no less than 20% MORE on cost per item after it was all said and done. Not to mention that due to the size and storage needs of the time that we would have to get an even bigger building adding more expense. So basically, after countless hours of thinking, working, testing, talking, brainstorming, there is no way that we can ever private label that product and keep the cost the same and we would never be able to get it lower than what it is with them stocking and fulfilling it. So on the bright side we get to make more margin and have less overhead doing it the way we currently are, however we have no say in inventory ordering, the catalog, and no exclusivity. So if one of the big big boys caught wind of this they could potentially be a big competitor overnight with one phone call to the right person. This scares the shit out of me. Part of me says, let's go all in while we can, but the other part of me is thinking about the long term.   
  
Problem 7 -The Long Term:  
I have always set things up to grow and build the business as a brand and not a fly by night shop or website. However, long term brand building is so much harder than I ever could have imagined in the dropshipping space. I get brands come and go and as a whole I will always have different brands and products to sell, right now though in the short term without some major shift in the universe I could go belly up overnight if this one brand I have become so reliant on ceases to exist. I am actively trying to diversify but every attempt to do so pulls attention away from the winning product we have and hurts current and short term sales. It is such a hard thing to balance. Without short term wins you have no chance at a long term, but on the flip side if you don’t set yourself up for the long term you are literally doomed to fail so then what is the point?  
  
Problem 8 - The Baby:  
As of April 23 I am a father to a beautiful baby. My original plan was to be a “stay at home dad” because I had everything in place to work from home and be with the new kiddo. However, when I had to let my employee go at my retail space that then put me in there running the day to day of the store 5 days a week. I love my baby so much and I know I am around them plenty compared to lots of fathers, and I am lucky to be in the position that I can somewhat dictate hours and schedules, but damn it I want more. I am missing key moments of my childs life because I am working nonstop. During the week I see them for about 15 minutes in the morning and around 2-3 hours in the evening before they go to bed. I close my business on the weekends now and spend as much quality time as I can with them until I have to drag myself back to work the next Monday. Coming off of Christmas I took a few more days than usual off to spend at home for my baby’s first christmas and then out of nowhere when I went back I gave my baby a kiss and started uncontrollably crying. I am just at my wits in with so many of the customers I deal with, I am tired from the long days and longs nights involved with running my business, I am sick of missing out on time with my baby since it is not something I can ever get back, and I am just about plumb burnt out on my business as a whole.  
  
Problem 9 - Opportunity Cost:  
So aside from costing my irreplaceable time with my baby, the massive amount of time I am spending on my business lately has been holding my back from pursuing other business avenues. Through running and growing my business I have learned countless skills. When I started I could barely turn on a computer, not through YouTube and a lot of self teaching I can do some absolutely incredible things. I started an Amazon affiliate business around a month before my baby was born and without having to do basically anything with it since starting it I have made a little over $800 so far with barely any work. I have ambitions of starting a YouTube channel/channels for various topics. I have a hobby I really enjoy doing which I have not had the opportunity to do now for 3 months because of my business. I started a white label SaaS business and have yet to launch it because I can not get enough uninterrupted time to complete everything I need to. I also have several other business ideas in the pipeline related to skills I have learned over the years. Ideally I could start these other businesses on the side and let them grow, and that was originally the plan, but then I had to let the retail employee go and I did not get the chance to get everything set up the way I wanted it to before the baby came. SInce the baby came the limited time I had to begin with completely disappeared and any down time I have now does get put towards advancing those other business ventures, it is just the time needed to get those all going in comparison to the 2 hours a week I have in between everything is not enough to get it all done. I have to sit at our store all day and answer phone calls and talk to walk-in customers which leaves the few minutes I have at the store getting allocated to actual work related to that business.   
  
  
So. Reddit. What should I do? I am at a crossroads and really not sure where to go. Long term I want to live the life that most of us want, work 10 -20 hours a week, be able to work from anywhere, be set on money, be happy. Right now though I am working my ass off for 17 hours a day and making pretty decent money, but I have literally all of my eggs in one basket. I have potential gold mines on the horizon with some of the affiliate and other business ventures in the pipeline. However, in the past I have admittedly chased and dedicated time to an idea only to have it fall apart and turn into nothing but an expense. Then I reflect and see I lost money at my automotive business by diverting time to this other expense. It has been a few years though and I have come a long way since the last time that happened. The ideas I have on the sideline are winners and I feel very confident about that, but at the end of the day they are gambles until they actually make me money.   
  
I have considered a ton of options  
Shut down my automotive retail store and just do online. Pro- More time. Con- Reliant on just online which is super competitive. I have local inventory on hand to get rid of.  
Spend big money and get great employee for retail store. Pro- More time. Con- another added expense plus retail growth is limited  
Set up a self service style retail store, like Ikea. Pro- Less long term monthly fees. COuld be a good balance of keeping local sales without investing too much time everyday by having to be there. Con- Not something people do in many industries yet and absolutely not done in my industry. Lots of confusion to be had by my local customers because I am from a poor dumb area. Potential insurance issues if customers pull their own parts. Potential theft if not properly managed. Big upfront time and money investment to set up  
Sell my business. Pro- Lump sum exit. Con- Too much BS. Looked into it and it got to the point of a Zoom call with a company that manages the sales. I was not happy with my valuation and the timeframe to get the money. Plus all the documents and data you have to produce is insane. I don’t have 20 extra hours to get all of this info together to then not even sell it for what I want to money wise.  
Scale way way way back. Hack some bones out of my business. I could cut expenses by another 3K or so and just focus on what is actually selling right now and not spend any time or resources on long term. Pro- better margins. Less BS. Easier sales. Con- doomed to eventually fail without focusing on long term brand  
Keep chugging along, be miserable at work. Hopefully not eat a bullet. Pro- Stuff will get done eventually and I will still have a consistent income from my established business along the way Con- No motivation because I sort of hate my current situation work wise. Strong chance of a mental break.   
Change retail store to appointments only. Pro- Happier. More time with the baby. More time for other business. Con- A lot of customers would be confused and mad. Would affect retail sales by a good bit more than likely. Not industry norm so there would be a ton of push back. I see myself losing good customers that don't want to deal with the hassle of making an appointment and then still having to deal with the crappy customers that think they are entitled to just show up without an appointment   
Change retail store hours to the hours I actually want. Pro- Happier. More time with the baby. More time for other business. Con-My business deliveries come at all times throughout the day so that part would be very tricky. A lot of customers would be confused and mad about the hours. Would affect retail sales by a good bit more than likely  
  
  
Please give me some advice and life experience if anyone has found themselves in a similar situation. Thank you all so much in advance, so sorry for the long post.

"I apologise for what I'm certain will be an extremely stupid How To Human type of question. But I've been having some thoughts and personal experiences that I shouldn't elaborate on here and of course looking up all my questions on reddit and I'm confused.

When people say they love their friends and family, do they actually, like, feel it emotionally, in the same way you'd feel happy or nervous or hungry? When people say they feel understood or supported, is there meant to be an actual emotional sensation there, or is it just the logical knowledge that, in theory, you could approach your mother and ask for advice on how to file your tax return?

I know there is a genuine sensation when we talk about romantic love, and like it's this deep feeling of physical warmth and sort of connectedness and emotional resonance and attunement and deep emotional empathy. But does a similar feeling also accompany non-romantic love, or when someone says ""I love my friends"" do they mean more along the lines of they enjoy having a drink together and doing hobbies and they would help their friend out of a sense of morality if anything happened?

People here say love is an action, but I act decently towards most people I see often, but I wouldn't say I love them because I don't feel very deeply towards them, I just don't want to let them down because I know they're a good person and I don't want to feel like a trash bag.

"Hi all. I was randomly thinking about this.  


  
Basically, I was sitting next to a girl. I was just doing classwork, but we are talking about something that I honestly cannot remember. I think I must have mentioned something like,""I will never punch another person."" She was shocked. She asked me what I would do if someone punched or fought me. I laughed and said nothing. She was surprised and was telling me I need to stand up for myself. Then, she started punching me very hard in the arm. She told me to punch her back to defend and stand up for myself. I didn't even touch her. Finally, she stopped punching me, but was just shocked at how pathetic I was.  


  
So what should I have done? Should I punched her in the arm? I remember that I feared punching her would get me in trouble and get me potentially suspended from the school. That would hurt my perfect grades. The other problem is that I was and still am a very small and weak guy. I fundamentally am always at the disadvantage when it comes to fighting. I have spent my childhood constantly studying and reading. There wasn't any a teacher at that moment to report this insanity. She never punched me again.  


  
Honestly, she was right. Standing up is so important. Otherwise, there will only be more disrespect and abuse. I realized it too late that being a nice and small guy only means that people will walk all over me. I want to learn boxing or MMA soon.

"Hello.

Throwaway account, as I don't want this to be traced back to my normal account.

FYI: We are currently living separately, and not earning badly. Still, a few hundred euros is a lot of money for us. We both live in germany.

TL;DR: I´ve got an renting apartment (starting from March 2024) with my gf. She started insulting me and treats me like shit the last weeks. Talking is useless. How do I get out of the apartment?

About the story:I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now and we decided to rent our first apartment of our own a few months ago. The tenancy will start in March next year. But now I have a problem. My girlfriend has had a complete change of heart in the last few weeks and her character has turned negative. She was always impulsive, or it took her some time to work something out. The last few weeks have just been hell. She can completely lose her temper over little things. Recently an unpleasant incident happened with her motorcycle. It needs to be repaired. The bike is at her parents', who have actually neglected it completely. She can't repair it at her parents' because she has a complicated relationship with them. Her parents are simply not the best and it often seems to me that they don't care about her. This has now happened over the festive period, which of course makes it even worse. During the festive Christmas period, her parents treat her like dirt. Even if that's nothing new.Well, now she's fallen into a negative spiral and doesn't want to get out of it.She thinks her life sucks and every word I say to cheer her up she counters directly.  She thinks that next year will be even worse than this one and sees me as an enemy who is just like her family.  Everything I say is not accepted or she changes the subject to something negative and then insults me. I wouldn't understand her etc.. I have offered her as much help as I can. To come to my parents over the time and start next year. Rejected. EDIT: Told her my ideas how we can fix it. Rejected. ""You cant help me"". She even blocked me on WhatsApp.

She's been extremely angry for three days now and doesn't want to let off steam. No matter what I say, it's unnecessary. She's stubborn and only sees her own point of view and, I think, just wants to wallow in her own filth. She insults me and tells me to fuck off. She puts me under emotional pressure etc.. I feel like utter sh..., I just cant anymore.I have now pulled the plug for myself. I like helping people and I love her, but when people start insulting me about it, I don't feel like it anymore. Talking no longer helps either.The problem is that I now have a two-year tenancy, starting in March 2024. She and I are both main tenants, so we have equal rights. But I don't want to spend two years of my life with someone who uses me as a scapegoat and insults me. I can look for a new tenant and ""get free"" that way, but it's very difficult there. I just don't know what to do.

ive been reading up about it but they still seem similar. For example for this from a website,

“The wives of the men, it’s said, would feel saudade for their husbands. This saudade is a longing or yearning or a pining for them, a feeling of sadness or melancholy, a feeling of absence, but also a feeling of happiness for the memories they have together.

Feeling the absence of their husbands, the wives would feel incomplete. They would feel the distance between them and their husbands, and they would know that, despite all the good memories, they might not get to create more good memories in the future. Likewise, the sailors would feel saudade for their wives and also for Portugal.”

However I would definitely still describe this as nostalgia. I mean I think with saudade a defining part is that you know it can never come back again, but I feel like this is nostalgia a bit too. Like u have a feeling of longing but it can’t come back (e.g. childhood)

Wondering why someone might repeatedly and consistently attract unempathetic  partners and or partners with sociopathic tendencies.


There are some answers that I will rule out:

 - Being unempathetic or sociopathic yourself. I'm quite the opposite.

 - Not focusing on one's self/ working on myself hard enough. I see 4 different mental health professionals a week and have been prescribed more brain altering chemicals than a goddamn MK Ultra test subject.


 - Bad Luck alone. 4 times in a row? With significant time &amp; therapy in between? I'm doubtful but I'll let you cook.

"Background info (?) 
This has been on my mind for a long time. I, (18F) have a physically present dad, but in reality he has never really been in my life that much.
Me and my family are all first gen immigrants in the
US, we (or at least me and my mom) are super cautious on how we spend money. My dad, according to all my extended family members, apparently had a serious gambling problem before I was born. (In an attempt to try to make me like my dad, my extended family members from my dads side told me he sacrificed so much, stopped smoking as much, and quit gambling entirely when I was born.) this ended up being a lie. From childhood I saw my dad continue to gamble, going to casinos occasionally in my elementary school years.

Heres where the situation first started.
 A few months ago I agreed to travel with my dad to attend my cousins wedding in another state. All went well until our car ride back, where we stopped by a gas station for a bathroom break. On my way out, my dad suddenly tried to hand me a few dollars, telling me to go buy a lottery ticket. I gave him a weird look for a few seconds. I said no and walked back to the car. A few days ago he tried to hand me scratch tickets randomly, like out of nowhere he comes in my room, and tries to give me a few of the scratch tickets that were in his hand without saying anything. Once again I gave him a weird look for a few seconds, indicating I didn't want it. He seemed to pick up on the vibe and asked why I didn't want it. I didn't really give an answer because I got really uncomfortable, I ended up just telling him to go away.

Why is he doing this? This is weirding me out alot and I don't understand his behavior. I have never shown interest in gambling of any sorts. I don’t like it at all. I've always liked to be responsible with money.

"Ok, so if obsessive is defined as ""an idea or thought that continually preoccupies or intrudes on a person's mind."" And you constantly think about random topics, but they grow deeper and deeper in ""volume"", would that be obsessive? 

Point 1: it's not continually, (repeated frequently in the same way; regularly.) it's a one time thing, even if it's a long time. Therefore not continually, and likewise not obsessive.

Point 2: it does preoccupie/intrude your head, however preoccupie and intrude have very different meanings.

Preoccupie: ""engrossed in thought; distracted.""

Intrude: ""put oneself deliberately into a place or situation where one is unwelcome or uninvited.""

Both are willing, but with different intentions.

Conclusion: Therefore obsessive can be different, than just obsessive. It can be involvement in your work, or for worse cases, just an example, stalking. And if you can assign roles to these obsessive tendencies, would they be habits, and or routine?

"( Asking for my cousin): 

Divorced 4 years ago bc she cheated. She lied on her affidavit claiming to make 1800 a month causing me to pay more $$ on child support with my military salary I could barely afford anything. Fast forward to now I find out she made over 170k a year which means I’ve paid 65k in child support since then she would need to back pay me. 

AND (drumroll…)


She hasn’t filed or paid taxes since 2018 and cannot produce a tax return. In an online video she claimed she made over a million dollars since 2019 and even posted a screenshot (idiot). I reported her to the IRS this week. She has no assets. Only a car loan she owes 27k on and lives in a 4K a month apartment and spends thousands on shopping each month, and only 50k in the bank to her name.  Not to mention, she runs a sham fitness business with no llc or registration, no educational background etc. (plus the No tax returns at all)

My questions:
- will I get an IRS payout if she has no money or assets? And if so, when will I see that reward?
-will she go to jail since she has no money to pay anything? 
- child support perjury lying - is this jail time?

"Call me a conspiracy theorist but hear me out

I propose a theory which goes like this:

Religion is an invention of the ruling classes to distract workers and make them think that their suffering and exploitation is necessary and justified. Without religion,workers realize that they are oppressed and enslaved and need to rebel against their masters,however the elite classes and rich created religion so they could use it as a tool for brainwashing them into submission. So that they would think 'yeah im suffering but its all necessary right? Ill go to heaven while being poor and having nothing right?' and that way they would be easier to control.

All I know is that I will eventually die, and from what it seems, that is all. I have decided that I want to live well and to die in peace. I’m not entirely sure what that entails.

In order to live in the first place we need food, water, shelter. We need to maintain our physical and mental capabilities. We also need people we can trust for mutual support. There’s a level of luxury that can be added onto this. If I am going to need food, it may as well taste good, within the bounds of health. This all seems to establish a level of comfort in life. Is a comfortable life a good life, or is there more?

I’ve been thinking about how a sense of accomplishment could contribute to a good life. Many people feel a sense of accomplishment as parents, or maybe in their work. People love to discover, and create things, perhaps leaving their mark on the world. There are instances where this can become bad.

Hey Reddit fam, I want to share my story about one of the most memorable and complicated situationships I've ever experienced. Get ready, because it's been quite a ride!

It all started on Tinder, where we crossed paths and quickly became ""smoking buddies."" We shared a love for the herb and spent countless hours enjoying it together. For nearly a year, we texted nonstop and saw each other a few times a week, often with her spending the night. We had our fair share of ups and downs, but the uncertainty surrounding our exclusivity started taking its toll.

Multiple times, we tried to cut ties and move on, only to find ourselves back in each other's arms. We argued like a couple, even though we technically weren't. Throughout this time, I was also dealing with a hidden struggle: a gambling and drug addiction that made it difficult to let her into my personal life. I now realize that not being more open about this added to the challenges we faced.

After one final fight, things took a different turn. I never saw her again, and our communication dwindled over the course of four weeks. To make matters worse, she even flaked on me to hang out with a ""friend"" and later revealed she was talking to someone new. As fate would have it, this new person happened to live in the same town as me, and I accidentally stumbled upon her car parked outside his house.

Now, I find myself feeling gutted and heartbroken over someone I never officially dated. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I know I need to find a way to move on and learn from this experience. So, here's where I could use some advice from you amazing Redditors.

Firstly, how do I heal from this heartbreak when there was never a formal relationship to begin with? I would greatly appreciate any tips, personal stories, or perspectives that might provide some guidance and comfort during this difficult time.

Secondly, how do I address my own gambling and drug addiction? I realize that these issues not only impacted my personal life but also hindered the potential for a deeper connection with this person. Any advice or experiences from those who have overcome similar struggles would be incredibly helpful.

Hey Reddit fam, I want to share my story about one of the most memorable and complicated situationships I've ever experienced. Get ready, because it's been quite a ride!

It all started on Tinder, where we crossed paths and quickly became ""smoking buddies."" We shared a love for the herb and spent countless hours enjoying it together. For nearly a year, we texted nonstop and saw each other a few times a week, often with her spending the night. We had our fair share of ups and downs, but the uncertainty surrounding our exclusivity started taking its toll.

Multiple times, we tried to cut ties and move on, only to find ourselves back in each other's arms. We argued like a couple, even though we technically weren't. Throughout this time, I was also dealing with a hidden struggle: a gambling and drug addiction that made it difficult to let her into my personal life. I now realize that not being more open about this added to the challenges we faced.

After one final fight, things took a different turn. I never saw her again, and our communication dwindled over the course of four weeks. To make matters worse, she even flaked on me to hang out with a ""friend"" and later revealed she was talking to someone new. As fate would have it, this new person happened to live in the same town as me, and I accidentally stumbled upon her car parked outside his house.

Now, I find myself feeling gutted and heartbroken over someone I never officially dated. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I know I need to find a way to move on and learn from this experience. So, here's where I could use some advice from you amazing Redditors.

Firstly, how do I heal from this heartbreak when there was never a formal relationship to begin with? I would greatly appreciate any tips, personal stories, or perspectives that might provide some guidance and comfort during this difficult time.

Secondly, how do I address my own gambling and drug addiction? I realize that these issues not only impacted my personal life but also hindered the potential for a deeper connection with this person. Any advice or experiences from those who have overcome similar struggles would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you all for taking the time to read my story. Let's turn this challenging chapter into an opportunity for growth and self-improvement.

"Thanks in advance for explaining this concept to me. In short, Ive been watching videos on YouTube about aquariums and vivariums where I see people place random aquatic plants into their tanks and let it settle for a few weeks before they place living animals inside the tank (fish, crabs, shrimp, etc)

However, before placing these animals, inside the tank you can see little you can see little microbes and “bugs” begin to form that swim around the tank. 

My question is this:  Where do these creatures come from? Unless there were eggs already in the dirt, if the soil substrate had no life in it, where do these living creatures come from? In these videos, people simply place some sand or dirt, as a base layer alongside some driftwood, stones and plants.

"I'm a Spanish dude that's been surfing primarily the American internet for a long while. And I'm still extremely confused by how higher education works in America.

In Spain, mandatory education is only until you're 16. Then, if you want to pursue higher education you have to take a two year course called bachiller (which is akin to the last two years of high school, but more advanced I would say). Afterwards you gotta pass a national exam called EBAU, which tests the knowledge taught during bachiller, to get into university. Once there you do a degree, which is 4 years in most cases. And then you can do a master's degree (1-2 years). Finally, if you wanna become a PhD you gotta work on and present a thesis after doing your master's. 

But then the American system has bachelor's, majors, minors, masters, grad school, post-grad, etc. What does all that mean? What are the relationships between them? And how does it correlate to Spain's higher education system? If at all.

"i was sitting at the intersection of a hwy and main road today, an ambulance came off the hwy and on to the main road and went to the hospital. 

   
My question is, how is a decision made on which hospital to go to?

lets assume the person in the ambulance is non-responsive and is incapable of making a choice and the urgency of this situation hasn't allowed a family member to be contacted to make a choice as well 

 I understand in most cases the closest hospital is probably the answer, but in this case, there are 2 hospitals right next to each other and their ERs are basically the same distance from the hwy exit. Both  are massive places and are major trauma centers and both are equipped to handle anything. In this situation, both hospitals are part of different hospital groups.  When you get off the hwy if you go left, you go to hospital A and if you go right you go to hospital B

Ginagawa namin 'to kahit hindi pa kami nagbabalikan ulit. Take note, wala pa rin kaming label ulit nung ginagawa namin 'to, or in layman's terms, ""ex-premium"". Going back, nakakaramdam na talaga ako ng something's off. Lagi kong sinasabi sa kaniya na, kung may nagugustuhan na siyang iba, sabihin niya na sa akin agad para maka bounce na ako. I never thought na seseryosohin niya 'yon since una pa lang eh hindi naman nagbago 'yung treatment namin with each other, para pa rin kaming mag nobyo at nobya, minus the term nga lang. Mahal ko pa rin siya noon kaya nga pumayag ako sa ganung set-up, obviously. Akala ko rin kasi magkakabalikan kami. I've asked him millions of times already na baka nilo-love bomb niya lang ako or whatsoever, pero sabi niya kasi mahal niya rin ako pero bu-buwelo muna siya. Anyway, sa loob ng 8 months na iyon, puro paghahabol at pagmamakaawa lang din naman ang ginawa ko, nilulunok ko lang lahat kasi nga sabi niya mahal niya pa rin ako. Sobrang tanga ni ate ko, diba? As days and weeks approached na hindi kami nagkikita ulit patago, nararamdaman kong nagiging cold talaga siya. I talked to him about it at sa tuwing magtatanong ako kung bakit parang malamig siya sa'kin, he would always resort to an aggressive reply. Madalas sasabihin niya, ""me time lang hinihingi ko, 'di mo pa mabigay?"", ""marami rin akong ginagawa, minsan wala na akong masimulan dahil sa'yo"" LOL, idadamay pa ako sa katamaran niya, gusto niya lang naman na masisi ako at ma-feel bad pag nanghihingi ako ng konting time from him. Anyway, sobrang cold na talaga niya at natiis ko nanaman 'yun for another one month, pero that time buo na desisyon ko para mag cut ties na with him dahil nga sobrang mukhang tanga na talaga ako na nagmamakaawa na mahalin at bigyan niya ng oras ulit.

People were talking about one of the issues being the need for giant batteries to store the energy created when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, for times when they are not.

I had an idea....

What if instead of storing the excess energy in batteries, you used it to pump water uphill. And then when you need to retrieve the energy, you use the water to turn a waterwheel.

"This just blows my mind, and I’m looking for anybody’s opinion my Situationship partner, and I got engaged last July. Initially I had told him when we had talked about marriage I was more of a cut person. He talked me into the radiant diamond, which I fell in love with. He ended up proposing to me, but we actually went with a lab grown diamond Around 3.5 cts and platinum . 

Still was around the $10,000 mark with the abandon all but eventually we decided to go back to the store and take a look at 2.5 ct true  diamond. Not as shiny and bright, but it was important for me to be able to adjust the setting down the road if grandkids came along things of that nature, you can’t do that with the lab settings 

So long story short, the ring totaled close to $25,000.  I was beside myself. I couldn’t believe he bought it. He was happy I was happy and did I have a rock it was beautiful and I was proud. It was something that represented both us and some thing that’s not traditional for me. we decide to call the engagement new year. Just thought it was a little premature.

He had until the end of February to take that ring back for a full Refund- my question is I can’t see his motive right now being so sincere a lot is going on in life, but he still holds onto the ring and I don’t know why??!???

He says it’s a future date but like I don’t know that’s gonna happen. I’m not super confident. and you don’t wanna rebuild a ring on top of that all he can do now the store is upgrade the ring for a slightly bigger size and pay the difference or go to a pawnshop and take loss ..   and you don’t wanna rebuild a ring on top of that for someone else, that would be pretty awful. My only other thought was making other jewelry out of it but why for that price?

I (20F) kissed my friend (22M) while we were hanging out. 

At first we were just watching a movie, and then we started cuddling. At some point, he started giving me kisses like all over my face and my hands. Like literally smothering me with kisses. Then finally he kissed me on my lips and that made me so nervous so I pulled away and giggled. 

We continued cuddling and this time we kissed again. But this time with tongue for a couple minutes. It felt great to be honest. 

Now the problem is that I want to talk about it because I don’t want to pretend it didn’t happen but I don’t think he feels the same way. 

Ever since we kissed he hasn’t brought it up and I can feel him getting a bit distant. I’m trying not to freak out because I don’t want to make things weird but at the same time it’s bothering me because I really liked the kiss but I don’t want to be that person that ruins the friendship because I want to talk about a kiss. 

Plus I find him attractive but I don’t think we could be together for a lot of reasons. However  every time I text him all I can think about is that kiss

"To start with - I’ve travelled a lot since I was a kid. I grew up in a wealthy family, and had been to pretty much every country that people from the Western World would consider travelling to (so not North Korea, Syria and stuff but most places in Europe for example). We used to fly first class most of the time, sometimes in business, and sometimes in coach. I wouldn’t say I used to hate it back then - I was too young to really think much of it. 

However, I’m older now, and I can unequivocally say I hate it today. I feel like the entire tourism industry is a bureaucratic hellhole that I’d rather not have anything to do with. Every single time I’ve booked a holiday with a tour group, I’ve felt let down and felt like I haven’t got value for money. Regardless of whether I fly first class or not, I hate flying - you have to deal with the same shitty delays, same TSA lines, same immigration lines, and believe it or not, same crew members with bad attitudes. We’ve consumerized the industry of travel so much that it all feels like a massive advert. On the plane, I get 5 minutes of ads before my movie starts. In the airports, I’m inundated with ads and duty free stores shoving the same brands in my face. I’m bombarded with advertisements for credit cards to get me into lounges. Wherever I go, it’s jam-packed with people taking videos for social media and trying to get good angles. All the tourist sites nowadays seem to be filled with con artists and scammers trying so sell a bunch of useless shit, and the police don’t do anything about it. It seems like traveling has become more about status, consumerism, and what other people think rather than your experience. Back when I used to be a child, I felt like a person when I travelled. Now, I feel like a walking chequebook that everyone and their mother is trying to sell something to.

At hotels, I feel like the standard of service has been dropping while prices have been getting more and more extortionate. Not that I can’t afford it, but it’s just unpleasant to have to pay $300 a night for some shitty Holiday Inn room if I wanna road trip across America. I don’t know about y’all, but I think it takes away from the experience.

Then there’s the fact that EVERYWHERE is so goddamn crowded nowadays. I just went to Venice for the first time since 2009, and I swear to God it felt more like Disney World. There was barely space to move around, let alone explore the town. And it’s not just the quantity of people, I feel like people have become less disciplined and respectful when they travel - I hear about so many more incidents of tourist sites being defaced, people don’t even bother to shut their crying babies up on planes nowadays, you see people come from third world countries and blatantly litter on the road, I always hear someone in a fight with some employee at every hotel or airport I go to. And not to mention, the amount of drunk tourists I see makes me cringe. All this shit just makes it way more unpleasant than it used to be.

While I’m still young, I remember traveling in an age before social media. It was much more human. I remember a time before everyone at a tourist sight would have their phones out pushing each other to try to get the best picture, and you would be able to meet friendly strangers in restaurants and share your experiences with them. Now, it feels like everyone is way less friendly, much more on edge, and unhappy with their traveling. I was in Rome the other day, and I overheard a kid begging his parents to rent a Ferrari because he’d seen some influencer driving one on social media, and I was thinking to myself “kid, you should be grateful that you’re in one of the most historic cities of human civilization” 

I don’t know if this is me losing my love for traveling, or a general gripe of what social media/money culture has done to society, or both, but do any of y’all feel the same way?

"I have a ""friend"" who I am considering dropping because I'm tired of her dramatic bullshit.

She is almost 30yrs old. She has 5 kids from MULTIPLE baby daddies. The last I heard was 3 different dads but it could be more, idk. She has been vague about it lately.

She finds a new bf EVERY MONTH. Which means every month, there is a period where she cries about how all men are terrible, used her, doesn't care about her 5 kids, cheating on her, etc. All while she post 2-3 provocative selfies a day, with only a crowd of guys liking it. Once in awhile, you might see 1 or 2 girlfriends liking it. She makes sex jokes online, but caption her photos as an ""innocent girl with a wild side"". It's clear she is attracting these kinds of trashy guys since she is making it look like she is ""easy"" out there. Yet she cries about not finding a serious long-term guy????

Not to mention still flirting with her baby daddies, or at least stalking their gfs and trashing them on her page. But yet she calls herself an empath and ""it's hard being an empath because I care about everyone"".

At this point, I wondered if she has attention issues, such as the multiple selfies a day. But also, I mentioned that she should go back to school and it would be good for her. It took her awhile but she finally enrolled and got accepted into a community college! I was genuinely happy for her! But then she started bragging too much about it like ""I kept my straight As so far"" and it has only been 2 weeks after the teachers just informed everyone about the class syllabus. She once bragged about being so smart, she got a letter to join the Honors Society (you know, the scam email they send to all schools). And bragged twice how someone loves her discussion posts (those online assignments where you have to post about a subject and like/comment under at least 2 other people to get a good participation grade).

So the attention issue, I kinda get. But what I don't get is WHY WOULD YOU ADVERTISE YOUR SLUTTY SIDE AND EXPECT TO GET SOMEONE SERIOUS? WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FINDING THE ONE AND PUMPING OUT MORE BABIES TO ""THE ONE""? AFTER 3 FAILED BABY DADDIES, AREN'T YOU EVEN AT LEAST TIRED OF RELATIONSHIPS ON A MONTHLY BASIS? IT'S TOO MUCH.

I'm here watching this whole thing and since she's not taking anyone's advice, I might seriously drop her. I'm just so flabbergasted on why someone behaves this way still, after so many failed relationships? My personal opinion, you're too old for this type of shit. I'm sure my friend isn't the only grown person in the world doing this. So why, in general, would someone behave this way?


(My background: I myself actually have 2 kids from 2 different fathers. Married and divorced the 1st, and now about to marry again to my 2nd. I am usually shy so I only ever had 3 relationships in my life so far. This friend has not been married at all, nor any engagements. But probably dates over 20 guys already. Idk.

Immediately all my sympathy went out the window and I was quite insistent that they were in the wrong here.

"The other day she started the day off yelling at me and instead of engaging, I just walked away and went back to sleep. She apologized later and we went about our merry way. 

Today is kind of the tipping block for me because she asked me to watch her dogs and when her and her wife came back, she started nitpicking everything I do. Apparently I left a napkin out, which I didn't. She did. Then she complained that I didnt lock the door, which I usually remember to do. Haven't had an issue with that. I informed her that she left a napkin and a spoon out with tea on it and I cleaned it up, she first said she didn't but I knew for a fact she did because she gleefully told me how great my tea was. Using my tea wasn't the issue, I don't care to share but blaming me for not cleaning up? I definitely did. Then she gave me the stink eye and asked if I took the dogs out and didn't put the tab on his diaper right or something. Just so much nitpicking my golly goodness. 

She often uses passive aggression as a way to communicate which I actually just had a serious discussion with her about and that went well. 

I understand why she uses her pain medications but her poor behaviors because of it is getting a bit much sometimes. She's really bad when she's withdrawaling but it seems she just gets rude sometimes out no where. She explains that she does this from time to time. 

She can be very sweet but sometimes shes downright mean and bitter and I want to avoid her.

I walked away to plug my phone and she rudely said, ""hey I'm talking to you!"" with a lot of attitude and I said ""I didn't know I thought you were talking to your wife about the dogs"". I think she responded that way because I've walked away when she was yelling at me once which I have every right to. I'm not going to respond to disrespect but this time was because I wanted to charge my phone and I'm not sure why I would think dog training would be a conversation to be had with me so I assumed it wasn't directed to me.

"I mean, looking at the pros and cons from an average joe (NOT obese NO abs, NOT an atlete for living) and assuming it is NOT done by playing a sport.

  
pros:  
1-You look better if you reeeeeeeally stick to it  
2-You ""might"" extend lifespan  
3-Was gonna put better quality of life but giving some of the cons doesn't make much sense.  
4-You maaaaaaybe get some happiness rush or bragging rights for achieving some weird exercise that few can do like backflip or handstand.

cons:  
1-Takes up a lot of time, assuming you exercise like 1h (including dressing up etc) takes around 15ish days per year of you life which amounts to a full year just training in 25ish years  
2-You might injury yourself, having PT lowers risk but can still happen  
3-Costs money if you buy equipment or go gym  
4-It is usually an unpleasant activity, sweat, tiredness, after workout sores, etc, etc  
5-Must come with a good diet or all will be waster, so enjoyable food go away and so does your happiness  
6-Genetics play a role too so you can train a lot but you might never get to see ""good enough"" results  
7-If you really don't care much about looks that leaves only the benefit of maybe performace taking grocery bags and maybe life span.

"TLDR: How do you contact venues about their DJs being involved in covering up child predator behavior from their friends? Beyond dumping it on local Facebook groups and hoping people take it seriously.

-

Serious content warning for CSA online and physical. 

Friends and I discovered an active situation in our local music scene involving people talking to kids online. Inviting minors to their place, then getting them to move here as adults. At least one kid, maybe more. There's a long paper (digital) trail tracking these interactions and a write up of the timeline of events. 

There's a lot of illegal content involved (sharing past photographs, including at a local event) but we can't go to authorities because we don't know her name. The girl in question moved to be closer to her predators right after becoming an adult, and is still close to them and has introduced other teenagers to them(!!). She is obviously a victim but victimizing others and thinking it's funny. 

Tried to reach out to people involved with her directly about it already and were shut down because ""she's an adult now"" and ""everyone lies about their age online"" - these were her friends, who are friends with the predators themselves. A few of them throw all ages events... and think it's no big deal that this group of people will be there. They've tried to cover it up and lie about it to the best of their ability.

What could a woman be proactive about to give out a higher-vibe than just for sports-fun girl?

Am attractive and friendly. If I’m interested in a guy but it’s not working i just keep it moving to the next candidate (learned that move from men) and I don’t sleep with them. I might flirt some but I don’t sleep with or do anything physical.

However, a common trend im seeing is they keep putting me in the good for sleeping with but not commit to.

How can I repel these types of men im attracting with what behavior because all my gfs get men to take them serious and they sleep with their men and do lots of fun things.

I do not understand why this is a huge deal.

I am not an American and am not highly familiar with the American political terminology. The following is my understanding of the procedure and please correct me if I am wrong: Primary ballots are conducted so that the people may choose the candidate to represent their political party in the Presidential election. [Polls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-holds-wide-lead-republican-2024-nominating-contest-reutersipsos-poll-2023-12-11/) show that Trump is leading among the potential Republican candidates. If that is the case, then being removed from the primary ballots in a few states should not be an issue since there will still be enough delegates from the remaining states to support Trump (assuming each state sends delegates proportional to its population, party membership, etc.). These bans have serious consequences if they mean that he cannot get any electors from these states during the Presidential election. But I could not find anything online that mentioned this.

This didn't affect our relationship that much as we still remained friendly but we did end up interacting less considering when I leave my shift, she starts her shift.

"Okay so I (F20) have this friend, let's call her Jane (F21). Jane is very different from me, always has been. I've tried to be a good friend to Jane but we live in different towns and are both always busy so we don't get to meet up often. I try to chat with her but again life usually interrupts and it takes weeks to get through a single conversation. I've always felt like Jane didn't quite think of me as closely as I thought of her but I've tried not to let that thought change anything about how I interact with her.

Recently I was one of few invited to Jane's small wedding, so I thought maybe I was wrong about how close we were and happily went to support both her and her groom (someone we had both known from high school). At the wedding I found out Jane was moving to a different state, and not just like a state away, no like full on opposite side of the country. This didn't particularly surprise me as that's where her new husband lives (he joined the military during senior year) and she has always liked the state we live in but it's a little too conservative for her. I was happy for her and said we should meet up at least once before she moves, both to catch up and to exchange Christmas presents as we hadn't been able to give each other our presents last year, in addition to the presents I got her this year.

I wanted to show her that she's still important to me even though she's moving away, so I had her presents from last year (some jewelry), I got her some presents for this year (incense holders, incense cones, and incense sticks), her birthday present for this year (a pair of earrings), a going away present (some evil eye jewelry as we're both very superstitious), and a housewarming present (a bar set for making drinks).

We had planned to meet up on the 31st of December to exchange and catch up. And before anyone says I'm materialistic, I don't expect nearly as much as I'm giving her, I just like giving gifts. I'd be happy with a card tbh. I messaged her last week to check in and confirm that we were still meeting and ask where she wanted to meet, what time, etc. and she told me that she can no longer meet me as her job is scheduling her every day until she leaves for her new home. She works in a nursing home that really doesn't care about it's patients or employees so it's very possible that she's telling the truth. Honestly I'm not really questioning that. But what I am questioning is that she won't answer me now that I'm trying to set up a new day to meet. Does she not want to meet? Is it just because she's busy, or does she just not care enough? Am I being selfish for trying to still meet with her? What should I do? Should I just let it drop or should I keep trying?

"Ok, this has been driving me nuts, and AskReddit doesn't let you elaborate.

This is for those disposable/recyclable bottled water bottles you get from the store.  Usually the bottles that are super soft and crunchy and easy to smash with one hand.

I noticed that if I grab an unopened refrigerated plastic water bottle, set it on the table and let it sit there for about 15-30 minutes, if I try to open it afterwards and drink from it, I'm hit with a nasty, NASTY smell that smells something like rotten plastic on the lip of the bottle (where you unscrew the cap).  The smell is so bad it makes the water impossible to drink and I'm forced to toss the water and throw the bottle in the recycle bag.

This also happens if I open the water bottle as soon as I take it out of the fridge, put the cap back on, and let it sit somewhere outside the fridge as well.

The only way I've been able to prevent this from happening is keeping the water bottle *uncapped*.  This, of course, is kind of annoying since the whole point of that cap is so you can open and close it to keep stuff from getting into it.

So what is causing that nasty smell anyway?  I've noticed this is only a problem with those water bottles with the softer more smushy plastic.","After taking a plastic water bottle out of the fridge, if you take longer than 15 minutes to open it, what causes the lip where the cap is to smell bad even when you haven't opened it yet?",18t9ju6,1703810498.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18t9ju6/after_taking_a_plastic_water_bottle_out_of_the/,

"My best friend, whom I have known for many years, has started to be more open and honest about how and what they are feeling. I love this for them seriously it makes me so happy they are getting better. They have ADHD and so do I but its on a much lesser scale. Regardless, whenever we hang out together sometimes they tell me that they don't feel like masking. (For those who don't know people with adhd struggle with having to feel more socially acceptable by exaggerating their personality to some degree. Sometimes its more and sometimes its lesser it just depends ((I really recommend looking it up for a better definition I have something that makes reading and explaining things in written text hard.)))  


Because of this it causes them to speak in a monotone voice and can sometimes sound like they are disinterested in me or what I am talking about which makes me nervous and kinda shut down. I was raised in an environment where that was incredibly prohibited of me so whenever other people do it my mind assosiates it with them being mad/disinterested. And also beacause of the dissorder they unintentially change the subject on what we are talking about and that can make me feel like what I have to say has no importance or matter.   


I am also quite slower than most people and they tend to do a lot of deadpan humor that I don't know is them being sarcastic or joking especially whenever they have that tone. I can tell if their is fluctuation but without it I am lost.   


I guess I want to know, what to do to support them going foreward because I know they can be irriated at themselves for me misinterpreting how they phrase certain things. Which is totally understandable and I don't want this to come off as they are in the wrong at all. So how do you guys talk to people that have issues with emoting?

"I’m not looking for “orange shit stain” or “crooked Joe Biden” dunks here. Not looking for who’s right or who’s wrong. I’m just interested in examining the logic behind their perspective.

In 2020, Trump told his supporters that the election would be rigged if he lost, and then told them that Democrats were committing voter fraud by all sorts of means. When he lost court case after court case trying to fight the voter fraud, I get the sense his supporters felt that the “deep state” was corruptly ruling for Biden and letting him steal the election. 

Now four years later Trump is echoing the same claims that the Democrats are going to steal the upcoming election. It’s not as if Biden has spent the last four years appointing a bunch of judges who are inclined to support Trump, so it feels like the preconditions are the same, if not worse for Trump since Biden now has the full power of the executive branch and isn’t just President-elect. 

So if you’re a Trump supporter who believes the 2020 election was stolen by Biden and upheld by crooked judges, what is the incentive to even vote in the next election? I don’t understand the logic behind a message like, “Democrats ignored/suppressed the true winner of the election and didn’t let your voice be heard last time…so make sure you go out there and vote for me this time!”

Hey all! 

I want to start an outdoor landscape contracting company. 

The name would just be “last name outdoor contracting” 

Is it bad if I do more than 1 service? 

My whole shtick is to be an all encompassing landscape outdoor company. 

I want to offer: landscape design, landscape maintenance (lawn care), concrete driveways, retaining walls and pavers, snow plowing, deck/patio building and installing irrigation and low voltage electrical. 

Is this okay? 

I am confident in doing these because I am starting a 2 year college course called “landscape technician” where they teach design, patio and deck construction, retaining walls, electrical lightning and skid steer operation plus power tools. Pretty much all landscape services.

I don’t have any memory of being hugged, held, or anything like that except my dad swinging me through the air a couple time when I was VERY little, or a hand on the shoulder/pat on the back when a family member died.

"This goes out to computer engineers, mathematicians, and just scientists in general:

As anybody savvy with computers knows, everything is coded in binary, 1's and 0's. This is called a number base, or a way to count numbers, just as base 10, the number system we use, is just a number base. The most optimal type of computer based on the Radix Economy, which determines what is the most efficient number base, is base e (Euler's Number). But [analog technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogue_electronics) *seems* to not have a number base as it runs a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) through voltage, if anything having an infinite number base as they can represent any number. But the more I have thought about it, it seems more likely that isn't an infinite number base, but base 0 that is simply manipulated by resistors, capacitors, diodes, etc. and I'm sure a few of you may argue that the computer on which it is hosted can be turned on and off so it is all binary, but that isn't what I'm saying, what I'm saying is the nature of how an anolog computer functions is through manipulation of a state which is always on or 0. 

The reason I believe this is because unlike Binary, it is always continuous, it is always running and we simply put things to modify or interfere with the electrical impulses, not changing the running aspect but changing the way we interpret it. I also believe this as it never changes, it is always a constant and while we can measure with base 10 through volts, and amperes, and change the way it behaves, it is ultimately still simply in one state all the time, which we will call 1 as it can be any number, only if it is never added upon, though as we will see, this is contradiction. We can make it do things but ultimately it is still the same regardless of the volts or amperes, it is simply on. Even through I did some research, [The Wikipedia Article for Base 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) doesn't describe what I'm talking about instead posing what I think is an infinite number base starting at 0; What I am saying is a number system that is represented by one value that never changes, but this seems impossible.

But then this problem arises, there already is one called the Unary Number System, where the only value is one, except you can count with a Unary numbering system through the Chinese tally system, which we all know as |, ||, |||, etc. and that brings up an even bigger question, if it is continuous, what would be counting? If we were counting the voltage or power sources, then we wouldn't need this base at all, just base 10 as there would be no need to overcomplicate it. What I'm talking about is a number system with one value that can't be counted, but simultaneously this couldn't exist as everything can be counted and if it can't then it doesn't exist. This would seem to imply that it couldn't exist in virtue of itself and it's parameters. This all leads to my final point:

What differentiates this from infinity? At first this question may sound absurd, as how can we think 0 can be infinite if it can't even be counted or doesn't even exist? And while this may sound like schizoposting, it is because it is a constant, meaning it is always 0 or, for the sense of our logic, 1 (on that is), and yet at the same time, it can be manipulated to represent values that are continuous or infinite **DESPITE** being nothing but a constant itself. I am sure this is a very disputed topic in mathematics or some other field that I am not aware of, but I feel like I may have figured something out, as not only can this be applied to electricity but space and time as well. They are continuous forces, and though we don't know how to manipulate them yet, we do know what manipulates them such as black holes, things that interfere with the continuous state. But even this suggests it is infinite as once I heard Neil DeGrasse Tyson state that if you were to go inbetween the force of two black holes, you would end up somewhere before you started. This must mean that at least space is infinite as it has the ability to hold itself in relation to time, or it seems that way. What I mean by this is that you theoretically shouldn't be able to go back in time, as where would this information be stored? The 4^th dimension? G*d's Usb Drive? The only answer I could posit was space itself, and while we do not have the technology to look at even atoms, though we know they exist, maybe one day this question will be answered.

**TL;DR:** What is the difference from something constant in a base 0 number system (only 1 value to the whole system of counting) and infinity? Or am I schizoposting?","Would Everything Analog (Analog Technology, Space, Time, [Presuming the last two are analog] etc.) be Number Base 0, Base 1, or an Infinite Number Base?

"I've been on a weight loss journey, and I'm currently down 35 lbs (over 5 months).

I go to this boxing gym and the coach there is amazing.  It's also dirt cheap... I sometimes slip him $20 here and there after a class as a tip since the class is pretty much free.

The problem is I'm the only guy in my 40s who works out there.  The rest are teenage boys from the HS.  I didn't really think much of it, but I'm pretty sure one of the parents told the coach to not let their son be partners with me.  (We often partner up to hold mitts and practice footwork drills and what not).

I don't know for sure, but I just got that vibe.  So that's my question: Is it weird to be working out with teenagers?

"TLDR; Guy in front brake checked me, caused the car behind me to get rear ended but I wasn’t involved. 

I’m not entirely sure what I should have done and I wasn’t sure where I could post this. 

I let a car go in front of me before I merged from an ending right lane to a left lane. I had my blinkers on the entire time.

I guess he thought I was too close because he hit his brakes, so I hit mine. I didn’t rear end him because there was enough space. 

I also wasn’t rear ended by the guy behind me. I didn’t hear anything. I didn’t feel anything. And the sensors in my car didn’t go off saying something was close behind me. 

But when we kept driving I noticed the guy behind me and a truck behind him pull over. I’m assuming the car behind me was rear ended. 

When there were multiple lanes again, the guy in front of me got next to me and yelled at me. He then drove off again. I don’t know what I did wrong. 

I wasn’t involved in the accident at all. But should I have pulled over? This is my first road rage incident and my anxiety is really high thinking that I did a “hit-and-run” even if there was no collision with my car. I found the term “phantom driver” and I’m scared i accidentally did something illegal by driving off. Am I at fault for what happened to the cars behind me?

"I’ve always been taught in school about evolution, how we started off as fish and eventually grew legs and left the water and eventually grew into primates and then Neanderthals or other Homo sapiens types and eventually humans. But when you look at diagrams showing the stages of evolution, our “ancestors” from 4million or so years ago sometimes look a lot like existing modern animals. In highschool biology I learned about convergent vs divergent evolution (may be the wrong words, it’s been a while since highschool lol), where sometimes species from completely different parts of the world can either evolve to look similar due to similar conditions, or the same species can evolve to have many different characteristics due to a variety of conditions. But if modern humans came from the same ancestors as gorillas or chimpanzees, why do those primates resemble our shared ancestors a lot more than we do? They have evolved just as much as us right? Why did we lose our body hair and get shorter arms and smaller heads and weaker muscles and the other primates are still fully covered in hair, have large heads and “snouts”, much stronger muscles and walk different than us?

I've been swimming laps at a heated pool, sat in the hot tub for 10 minutes, a hot shower after that. So my core temp is pretty high walking out of the gym to the car. I also am wearing thermals, a fleece top and sweat pants and a beanie and I blow dried my hair.

The wind picked up, so I stopped to put on my vest to get warmer. However, walking from the car to the front door it was a little chilly and I am just in my thermals sweats and beanie. Could I have caught a cold, waiting for 30 seconds for someone to open the door? I am kind of paranoid now and I think my throat is tightening when I think about it. I'm still pretty warm writing this from the hot tub and such.

"Long story short, I briefly attended a.... Religious private university located in Virginia (not sure if I'm allowed to name it on here?) For one semester this fall. I attended online. 

I did NOT enjoy my semester, and I realized pretty quickly that I had no intention of ever taking a single class from there again. I let the student aid and student affairs offices know I was withdrawing, I got sent to the appropriate channels to formally withdraw, I've sent probably half a dozen ""hey just so you know, I'm not coming back next year"" emails, in addition to verbally informing every telemarketer whoever who calls me from the school telling me spring enrollment is open that ""as you can see, I've withdrawn"".

At this point, I've started blocking/reporting as spam the phone calls but they're cleverly using other numbers from other depts to try to reach me. Today I got a call from the ticket office for their on campus theatre. I feel harassed, I've tried blocking their emails and they still just slip through. I'm so tired of being asked to enroll for spring and want nothing more to do with this school. HOW DO I GET THEM TO LEAVE ME ALONE. 

Also for those curious, yes I have a very small loan out to pay for classes, I'm handling that with my loan servicer. Not with their financial aid office.

"It’s a long story and I’m willing to share the whole story to you but let me cut to the chase for now.

I am a Foreign Language teacher in this relatively small school in this non-English speaking country for four months now and it is my first time to live outside my own country so everything is barely new to me.

I met this guy (btw I’m also a guy with little interest to other guys as well, and I’m 28) in one of the bar/club in the city which is more than one hour away from my place because I live in a province. He was in his mid-late 40s. Anyway, we became friends but not too close, we just talk casually online through chat because he really can not speak in English that much and it’s more on me asking help how to process things here in his country. 

After a month of being sort of friends and chatting online after that encounter in the bar/club, we decided to have a short trip because I wasn’t really that familiar in this country and he would tour me around. It is more of a city trip. It’s a 2D1N trip because it’s on weekend and we have to work on weekdays. That night it was really late, I don’t know what comes to my mind, I asked him if he is only interested with opposite sex or he is open to have a thing with the same sex because he was still single considering he’s in his late 40s. He laughed and said that he didn’t think of that before and just asked me why. I told him that I just wanted to know. He said he never tried it before so he doesn’t know. So to cut the long story short, something happened between us but it’s just me giving him a BJ.

Everything remains the same the following day but I felt that we are more at ease with one other. However, I felt guilty after that trip because I don’t really know if what we did, or at least what I did was right. Like I feel like it is against my religion and my beliefs as a person but I liked what happened. So a month after that trip, I sort of ghosted him. I mean there’s really nothing between us aside from being friends but I stopped replying to his messages and answering his calls. Well, to be fair, his chats and calls were more on just asking if everything’s okay and nothing serious like he’s running after me or what. It’s been two months now since we stopped talking.

Now, I’m kind of anxious because my contract is ending and I’m not sure if I will be renewed for the following year because there will be a new principal and it’s up to the principal if they still want a foreign language teacher in their school. So today, the new principal for next school year was introduced to us. What made me more anxious now is that the new principal was the good looking guy that became my friend for two months and I ghosted after giving him a bj.

Well, we are surprised when we saw each other but he doesn’t look like he’s mad or what. I mean, he knew I’m working as a Foreign Language Teacher in a school and I knew he works in the government obviously because we shared that info before but we have no idea regarding specific details of our work.

Now, do you think I will be renewed for the next school year? Or if I will be renewed, should I still stay here in this school? Fyi, I wanted to stay in this school because all of my colleagues are very nice to me.

"Before I start, please don’t take this as “wahhh there’s nothing we can do” doomer posting. It’s nonetheless good news that Trump is off the ballot in some places, and I hope this trend continues. 

  
However, Maine and Colorado are pretty blue states. Even if Trump was on the ballots, there is a very likely chance that they would have just voted for the democratic nominee anyways. Knocking Trump off the ballot is a big decision to make, and I feel like it may not occur in any swing/red states where it would significantly impact Trump. If anything, I feel there’s a chance it could be a rallying cry for Trump followers- who may have their fears of Trump being censored or whatever further validated.
