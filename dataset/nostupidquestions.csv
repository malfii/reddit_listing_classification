"So I have a friend and we normally if not every day, pretty frequently. I sent him a DM on Messenger last night but the delivery status is still sitting on 'Sent' (not delivered or seen). I'm not blocked and so I thought I might be restricted, but I can still see his profile picture and his profile as usual. I can still see his private posts (the ones tagged ""John's friends"")- but it's just unusual that he hasn't been on. It's very unlike him to not be around/respond to any of his messages for more than 24 hours. 

He's an online friend so it's not like I can check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know his number so I can't call. It's the holidays and he may just not be around, he's probably with family and just hasn't been online. Possibly traveling. But I just worry that one day he's going to block me or restrict me or something for no reason. He's not a jerk and I haven't done anything wrong, that I know of. I just sometimes feel like I bug him or chat too much, but I don't know for sure what he thinks, so I worry he might just stop responding to me some day. I'm just hoping it's not now.

"I know that there is a mathematical answer here and maybe this is ELI5 but if there’s a rectangle with sides a and b, then to traverse from one corner to another along the edges you will travel a+b distance. Now, if you split the sides into a zigzag so you traverse 1/2a + 1/2b + 1/2a + 1/2b then you will still travel a+b. Then if you make the zigzag finer and finer you will still be traveling a+b. At some point, the very fine zigzagging looks like a diagonal but it’s still a+b. At what point does it become sqrt(a*a + b*b)?  I know it’s something to do with infinity.

"I'm a 23 year old woman who has no support system, so I'm posting this here because I can't seem to find an answer to this. I know this isn't a professional sub, but im more so just searching for some possible perspective.  

I have CPTSD and I suspect thre may be schizophrenia.  I have experianced Visual, auditory and tactical hallucinations since I was a child. 
Back then, it was mainly just tactical accompanied by paranoid beleifs.

 (Such as feeling a hand rest on me every night in bed, turning to see no one there. And being so convinced people were able to hear my thoughts that i learned to turn them off) 
The rest peaked when I reached 19. 

I have had auditory voices (at 19)  that subconsciously made me act out for them, but I *knew* that it was a voice coming from within my own brain...opposed to how others deem it as God or something sentient. 

Our identities did get blurry and mixed up and I wasn't sure why I changed my name tags at work to his name, but regardedless i knew something was wrong. This lasted for 3 weeks. (I did call my parents and tell them, but no one has ever thought to get me help)  


Anyway, my question is this: 

What do you think causes two people to both experiance hallucinations, but one is not aware that they are hallucinating, while the other (me) *does* know what is happening? 

I often wonder if my ""self awareness"" means I don't have as big of a problem as I think, or if it is just me coping. 
 
I will be seeking medical opinion when I have the resources to do so, I'm mostly just in need of conversation.

"I never thought I would be in a situation where I needed to contemplate how to address a grown man's farting issues in a public workplace. I want to preface this entire thing with: my coworker just told me that this guy recently mentioned he is slightly autistic. I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue or not.
 
This guy joined our team about a year ago. He is probably about 35-40 yrs old. At first he seemed normal enough. A few months into joining the group, I slowly started having more and more issues with him. He's constantly burping under his breath all the time. His sneezes are the loudest sneezes I've ever heard come from a human, but what makes it bad is he always sneezes directly into his hand or sometimes just into the air (we work in a microbiology lab, so this is especially not good). In general he looks kind of unhygienic and grimy. He's the most socially unaware person I've ever met. But my biggest problem with him by far is his farting.

The first time or two I heard him fart, I thought not much of it because everyone has slip ups. But it kept happening. His cubicle is directly behind my cubicle, so I hear everything. Sorry for the detail but I think it's necessary:  It went from hearing quiet little farts once every few weeks, to hearing them every single day. The loudness and intention of the farts are also increasing. They used to be quiet and almost seemed like they were slipping out/maybe an accident. But at this point they are getting pretty loud, and it's clear they are intentional. I hear him push them out and they are no accident. 

What is driving me nuts is since I am the one who sits closest to his cube, I hear the most out of everyone by far, so I feel like I am going crazy. My coworker has told me that she has heard him fart like once, but again she sits further away from him. He'll do quiet ones all the time when the cube area is full of people, and I think I'm the only one who hears it because of my proximity. But conveniently when it's just me or maybe one or two other people, he farts loudly. Not sure if this is a coincidence or not, but it almost feels like he is becoming more and more comfortable doing it around me or something? One time there was a small meeting with my manager (me, him, the manager, and 1 other person). My manager was talking and he farted over her. There was an awkward silence, no one said anything, and then everyone pretended it never happened. A few weeks later, I was walking directly behind him in the hallway and he let out a big fart.  I was fucking pissed. I think everyone is coming to the realization he is kind of a gross person, but they don't realize the extent of it because they don't sit right next to him. I don't know if I should confront him, wait for someone else to get fed up so they will say something instead, or maybe just get over it?? I'm a passive person and confronting someone is way out of my comfort zone.

There is only one empty cube that would be available for me to move to, but it's directly in front of where I am sitting now. So it would give me a little bit of distance from him, but I don't think it's nearly enough.

The one event I didn’t get sick at, was the one when I wore a mask and didn’t eat anything. 

I take vitamin c every single morning, and I am constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer - especially before eating something.

"So, I've been trying to look into this topic, and I've even posted about it on AskScience but the automod kept refusing it for some reason. I hope someone here can help me out.  


I found two essays called ""Animal Cognition and ""Animal Consciousness"" hosted by the Stanford Department of Philosophy. For me, the TLDR is that it can be mistaken to attribute human-like characteristics to animals (anthropomorphism), and science is traditionally wary not to do that. Recently, however, this seems to change, e.g. ""Kristin Andrews and Brian Huss (2014) coined the term “anthropectomy” to refer to the mistake of denying that an animal has a certain characteristically human capacity when in fact they do have that capacity. They argue that anthropomorphism and anthropectomy are both errors, they both amount to a false depiction of how the world actually is, and so there is no reason to fear one over the other.""

im 19f and currently in the 3rd semester of university, there is this one guy i really wanna meet/ get to know and be friends. the thing is we only have two lectures together every week and we are in the big lecture hall and he sits with his friends, i sit with mine. does anyone have any tips for me on how i could approach him? get to know him? 


for the curious ones who wanna hear all my delusions and roast me for it: 

so im turkish but i was not born or raised in turkey but in the country i live in rn. i love this country and i would say im well adapted but i still try to make as many turkish friends as i can bc we have the same fate and i relate to them better. the guy i wanna be friends with is also turkish, thats why im so desperate to get to know him. 
i noticed him in the first semester and in the second semester we were in the same statistics group (we were about 20 ppl in each group) and it was a coincidence i ended up there with him but i blew my chance to meet him. 
i did see him in other lectures but he was always sitting on the other side of the lecture hall (its divided into three sections). this semester though, what made me somewhat hopeful was that especially in the last few weeks he´s been sitting on the side of lecture hall where i usually sit with my friends. he was sitting either in the row behind me or in front of me and we did make eye contact a few times. 

once i had to call my sister and we were talking on the phone (in turkish) and i was sitting outside of the lecture hall and he was walking by with his friend group and then when i was speaking he suddenly slightly turned around and smiled (?) at me. 

and the very last time i saw him i was sitting alone and he had just entered the hall, he sat on the other side but after some few minutes he changed his place and sat in the row behind me but next to a girl and when i was putting on some hand cream they suddenly started talking about dry hands and hand creams and stuff. 
anyways i just want to be friends with him but when i see him sitting with other girls i feel like i have no chance, like if he wanted to get to know me he would. now we´re in the winter break and after that ill probably see him only twice or three times so any advice/tips yall have is appreciated.

Context:
I bought a pair of $135 hiking boots online and they arrived while I was out. They were gone by the time I got home, so I contacted my landlord and he looked through the security camera footage. I just wanted to know if it was stolen by someone in my apartment building or not (It wasn’t). The landlord was the one who made the police report and gave them my name/number. When they called, I cooperated and described what was in the package. After that, I talked to customer service for the boot company and they sent me a replacement pair right away, so no harm done for me. When the police called back days later, they said the found the guy who did it and asked if I wanted to press charges. Apparently he also stole from another tenant in the building who did decide to press charges. I said no, I didn’t want to press charges, because: 1, theft is not a violent crime and I live in an area where a lot of my neighbors probably aren’t doing well money-wise so the guy was probably someone who needs some extra cash for his family; 2, i got a replacement pair so literally no harm no foul.

Later on, I asked my friend why this equation equals 1 and not .9 repeated. My friend is this super smart genius who is valedictorian and seems to know everything. I’m smart too but my friend is Einstein compared to me. She said that my reasoning was correct (the equation does equal to .9 repeated) but she also said that .9 repeated equals 1. Therefore the equation can equal both. I had no idea how that was even possible considering that .9 repeated is getting infinitely closer to 1 but never reaches it.

"Hi!  
I am a single adult (29M) with private health insurance through my employer. I feel like I would greatly benefit from therapy. It has been recommended to me by my doctor. Because of all these things, I naively assumed that I could get therapy covered by my health insurance.   


However, I discovered quickly, this was not the case. My insurance will not cover psychotherapy until *after* I hit my deductible for the year. My deductible is around $1500. Because I am young and very healthy (physically at least...), I never even get *close* to my deductible for a year. This year, for example, I spent about $500 on healthcare for the whole year.   


I decided to bite the bullet anyway and schedule my first session to see what the final bill came out to. After a few weeks, I got my first bill for $200. This means that, if I wished for weekly therapy appointments, I'd need to be ready to spend $800 dollars/month. That feels insane.   


I certainly would hit my deductible fast... but I still feel like this is a bonkers system, where I need to shell out $1500 dollars within the first few months of the year to even be considered for support.

"I think making it through those gut wrenching tough times makes us the people we are.  It certainly shaped me and changed my perspective on life.  A few years back I had the job of my dreams and an amazing wife.  I also had my first born on the way.   In my spare time I worked out like crazy and even fought in a couple amateur MMA fights.  Life was good!

  
While driving home after signing for my first house I was stopped at an intersection.    I don't remember much after that besides waking up in a heap of twisted metal in someone's front yard.  I was later told I had been hit by a drunk driver. I would end up in the hospital for a couple weeks and endure months of physical therapy.  A place I affectionately called ""The Land of the Misfit Toys"" because all of us had something wrong with us.   I went from being 225lbs of muscle to a very frail and defeated 150lbs.  

   
I spent the next year in more pain than I even knew existed.  I was totally devastated and felt trapped in my own body.   I ended up getting divorced and losing some good friends.  I was totally convinced my life was over.  My doctor told me to prepare for the worst and that I may never be the same.  Fortunately after a couple very miserable years of very hard work and persistence I made it back.  Somehow I managed to get up every day and push myself more and more.  I went from not being able to walk ten steps to finally making it around the block.  I eventually started dating again and made new friends.  I even ended up having new career highlights I never could have imagined. 

   
I'm just curious about what life changing tough times and obstacles people have made it through?   This time of year it's especially good to be thankful not only for what we have in life but with what we have overcome.  Maybe this can help serve as inspiration for others who are dealing with similar circumstances.

"Hi There!

I'm reaching out in the hopes of finding where I can find others who share my interests and geek out. My passions lie in the areas of tech, science, space, and video games, along with web development, game development, digital design, VR, and machine learning. I'm genuinely curious about the world and what it has to offer but in no way a smart person. Admittedly, my memory isn't the greatest unless a topic really grabs my attention. But that's a whole other issue entirely I'm sure.   
  
A big part of my daily life involves immersing myself in the passions I described above and experimenting with new tech ideas. Whenever I stumble upon something exciting, especially technology that could benefit others, I'm eager to share it. However, I often find that my enthusiasm isn't matched by my friends. Whether it's discussing the latest tech or offering advice on purchases, the response tends to be lukewarm.  
  
I'm also keen on learning about other people's hobbies and sharing insights, but it seems to go unnoticed. My challenge is not just finding joy in discovery but also in conveying why these advancements are important, and how they could be beneficial.  
  
I'm not looking for validation but rather, a community where I can share my excitement and explore these topics in depth. It would be great to connect with people as enthusiastic about these areas as I am.  
  
If anyone knows of a community where this kind of passion is shared, or if you have any advice on bridging this gap in understanding and interest, I'd be very grateful to hear from you.

"I (22F) am confused about my recent experience with a coworker (22M). 

There’s a guy at work and we kinda speak but not very often. We’ve just began to get to know each other and I’m crushing hard. 

I’m an intern that’s leaving the city soon and going back to college. His vibe has always been a little bit reserved with me. Today is his last day at work before break and I noticed he was remote so in the afternoon I sent him a text message, and here are the texts word for word:

Me: “Hey &lt;name&gt;, since I’m leaving I just wanted to say I had a good time with you the few times we spent together. Also completely forgot to thank you for insisting on waiting with me after &lt;friend’s&gt; bday dinner. Have a good break! :)”

Him: “Shoot are you leaving rn?”

Me: “Leaving Friday but you mentioned today was your last day lol”

Him: “Oh cool I’m on my way to the office rn, I get to say goodbye in person”

Me: “Oop see u soon then”

Him: “Yup”
Him: “Still loved the text tho” *went back to heart my paragraph*

Me: “Guess I’ll have to repeat it to you in person😔”

He came into work in a bit (he lives walking distance away). He may have come into work just for me maybe? He’s never before walked into work during the second half of the day like that so that’s a first. He also seemed to need something there tho so maybe that’s why?? I’m unsure here but he smiled at me brighter than usual.

At 5pm, I noticed he was caught up in a foosball match and decided he wasn’t as interested as I thought so I left and was waiting for my Uber outside when I saw him walk into the lobby possibly searching for me (I sometimes sit on the couches in the lobby). Saw him leave the building and then got a message -

Him: “I think I missed ya but have a great break and good school year! Hope to one day see you again”

Me: “Sorry didn’t wanna disturb your last foosball match with &lt;insert intern name&gt;. I hope I see you again too!”

Him: “you definitely should’ve but I got you”

Me: “Welp my Uber driver is going in circles so I’m waiting outside if you’re still here”

Him: “double welp, I left when I first texted ya😂”

Me: “Rip”

Him; “it is what it is”

Me: “are you leaving tn?”

Him: “tmrw”

Me: “gotcha, safe travels”

Him “you too when you leave”

"We have a guinea pig, it was part of a pair of guinea pigs that belonged to our two kids. One passed away from old age. 
It’s legally abusive for anyone to have a solo guinea pig where he’s from because they are herd animals and it’s very bad for them to be alone. He has always been strong about that. 
I hVe been trying to find a new home for our remaining guinea pig, and now it’s time to clean her enclosure but we haven’t found a new home for her. 
I’m always the one to clean their enclosure even though they are family pets. I asked for his help and he asked for specific tasks unwanted him to do for it, so I asked if he could remove the old and dirty substrate and dispose of it and then unwound do the rest. 
He complained that I was giving him the worst tasks and that I was the one who wanted guinea pigs to begin with (they belong to our—young- children, and getting them was a family decision). 
But he is trying to influence me to deal with them completely. 
I argued that he’s being unreasonable about it and he’s saying, “okay, fine, I’ll help find an owner for the one we have left, is that good enough for you? Even though it was your decision to get the damned things?”
I feel like he’s manipulating me. Am I crazy? I feel like I’m being gaslit but maybe I’m just imagining it?

"""Father figure"" to 2 teen boys.

English is not my first language might be hard to read sorry) Hi everyone, long story coming but i need guidance in a situation that i think needs context. 5 years ago, i was working as a street worker and i met those 2 boys who got attached to me pretty quick. Turns out those boys were almost my direct neigbours. Their father died when they were 3 years old and their mother was unfit at the time, drinking a lot, etc. So i took care of them a lot in the context of my job but also as a neigbour. I also met their mom and worked with her and got her the help she needed in terms of counceling, social workers, but also just being there for her and her children.  
                                                                                       
When i met the boys they were 11, they are now 15 (im 26).                                                         Ive been seeing them on and off for the past 4-5 years,  i usually bring them climbing since its a passion theyve developped through me. As their only passions back then were smoking pot and stealing. I also play hockey and some other sports with them, i try to make them interested in healthy stuff basically. The thing is they see me as a father figure by now, i constantly tell them i see myself more as a big brother due to my age but they still interact with me as more of a father.                                                                  
    
 There now in foster families and visit their mom here and there. I know the foster families by now and i provide them with information that worries me about the boys from time to time (they confide in me a lot). The problem is since there in good hands i dont feel like they really need me there anymore but they keep coming to me, knocking at my door, texting me to go climbing, calling me when they need guidance, etc. I tried to tell them exactly what i just said wich is that i dont really see myself as an asset in their life anymore but i got a really dramatic reaction from them and they told me                        that they'll still go on with what theyre doing.                                      
                                                                                                                    I honestly dont mind it since ive frankly became kind of attached to them by now, it isnt much of a chore to spend time with them since i mostly do what i already love to do with them. Still i just dont know if this dynamic should go on. I also dont know if just starting ignoring them would be good for them since theyve gone trough so much abandonment in their lifes already. I know its a lot but any feedback would be appreciated since their isnt really a blueprint for this kind of situation 😅 Thanks a lot!","""Father figure"" to 2 boys",18nku4n,1703157847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18nku4n/father_figure_to_2_boys/,

As a child, around 7-8, I remember being pulled out of class with a few other children. We went into a room with adults that I know weren’t teachers at the school and given blank paper and coloured pencils. They played a tape that would tell a story and we had to draw a map based on the story. 

The story would say things like ‘we started in the bottom left of the forest, next to a wooden house with a green roof.’ And then we’d have to draw a wooden house with a green roof in the right place. ‘We walked to the right of the house and found an orange and green tree with birds, we looked at it and then kept walking right.’ So then we’d have to draw the tree to the right of the house etc. 

I remember being pulled out of class to do this at least 2 times, with the same classmates. My parents don’t remember this test. It was in the UK, early 00s.

"Okay, I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

I've read multiple articles that talk about how antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are an issue with people who take antibiotics. However, these articles usually say that the reason for this is that someone does not finish a full course of antibiotics, leaving the strong bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics.

The solution given in many of these articles is to stop prescribing as many antibiotics. While I understand that would also solve the problem, doesn't just finishing your antibiotics also solve this issue?

If I'm prescribed a full course of antibiotics, and I take them all as directed, is there a risk of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria?

I've been seeing a lot of memes (possible dog whistles) of women making fun of this sort of physical maintenance that they do?? Mind you, this isn't the usual thing like taking a bath, brushing ye teeth and cutting your nails typa thing.

It's where you supposedly have to shave your pubes every two weeks, and also you limbs (arms and legs) and it's sort of mandatory for them. And your nails (hands and feet) have to be manicured and pedicured as well, and if you don't do this, you're considered unattractive.

This may not seem a lot to y'all but it has got me questioning things, is this an actual thing or am I just being fucked by the algorithm and it's just a small population that does this or have I just been living a rock?

• Bedsheets washed &amp; changed biweekly

• Bathroom cleaned lightly 1-2x per week, and deep cleaned 1 time per month

• Entire apartment picked up and generally tidied about 3x per week on average

• Laundry done 1-2x per week

• Clean laundry *does* sometimes sit unfolded in a pile for up to 2 weeks

• Trash is a tiny under-sink can that gets taken out at least once a week, usually more. Same for waste paper baskets

• Recycling is a pain in the ass in our building, and so it habitually gets left until it's a giant heap. Easily like 2 months at a stretch

• Vacuuming...is on hiatus (I *know* I know, don't look at me. We have no carpet though, and whenever something obviously dirty happens to the floor, it gets cleaned) lmao this one has me too embarrassed I'm likely gonna delete this shortly 💀

• Doors and windows opened every day, for fresh air

• Dishes are a constant battle. There's just usually a small amount of them waiting, since no dishwasher. They get tackled regularly

• The range is sanitizer every time the sink and countertops are

We’ve been married for almost 5 years, and he used to compliment me all the time (even after gaining a shit ton of weight). Recently lost about 45 lbs and am continuing to lose, yet he hasn’t noticed at all and if anything he’s been less interested in me in general… 

I throw out compliments to him like Halloween candy (he’s a bit insecure but I always always let him know how attractive he is, whether he’s in lazy clothes or feeling like shit, he never goes a day without hearing how attractive he is.) literally the only way I ever receive even the simplest “compliment” is if I verbally judge myself or wear a full face of makeup, and even then it’s always just something like “you look good” or “you look fine”. I spend at least 30 minutes every day trying to find clothes to wear that I think he might like, but does he ever notice or say anything? Not at all. I even put on a lingerie bodysuit and some cute sweats and he didn’t say a word, basically ignored me because he was so busy judging himself in the mirror (of course I remind him of the things I do like about his appearance but he didn’t even smile) and then went to bed. 

There has been VERY minimal affection from him, physically and verbally. What’s even worse is that if I ask what he loves about me/what makes him love me, the only answer he has ever come up with is that I have nice tits and that I gave him a child/family like he’s always wanted… (if he asks that question, I always name off every little thing about him that I love, I mean EVERY thing). 

Y’all he’s even told me my opinion doesn’t mean shit to him…what?? I have never ever said that (even tho I definitely have reasons to feel that way about him considering he likes to jerk off to bitches with bbl’s and tiny waists online and not touch me at all for weeks) and if we do have sex it lasts just long enough for me to finish and then he’s done, cleans himself off and then goes to sleep after saying “sorry I don’t last that long”

"I keep getting feedback from people saying that I shouldn’t be dating if I don’t know what I want. The problem is, I feel like I very clearly can define what I want. I’m not sure where people are getting confused…

I want a real, genuine, deep, relationship with a companion/partner. I don’t want to be a booty call or on someone’s NSA roster. I want a partner. Someone I’d take care of when they’re sick, or drive to work if their car breaks down, or be at a funeral to support them. Someone I’d LOVE. The relationship does not necessarily *have* to be sexual in nature, but it would be nice. (Because of trauma history, I could survive just fine, never having sex again—but I don’t actively avoid it or anything. In other words, physical/sexual attraction is not even in my top 10 of attractions.)

But: 
A. I don’t want a husband. (Long-term committed partner? Yes. Completely monogamous? Not required on his end; I tend to be more monogamous by nature, but don’t expect anyone I’m with to be. I’d prefer something fluid and communication-based.)

B. I don’t want to move in with anyone. (Spend lots of time together at one or the other’s home? Yes, of course, a million times, of course. But I love my space. It’s very important to me. People that I love and trust are invited in whenever they’d like. But it’s *my* safe space.)

C. I don’t want kids. (If he has kids, that’s ok, as long as I’m not expected to be a parent. I love kids, I just don’t want to be a mom. I could possibly imagine myself being a more hands-off step parent, but I don’t want the responsibility of raising anyone.)

I want to go on romantic dates, learn everything there is to know about each other, travel, get excited about each other’s passions, have individual goals that we can celebrate for the other person, share amazing experiences, learn things together…. All of the basic shit that a boyfriend/companion/partner could provide. But I won’t compromise on my A, B, or C.

Am I Asexual? Aromantic? Demisexual? Something else? An asshole? Delusional?Maybe I’m just fked up from all the sexual violence in my past and only *think* I know what I want.

Either way, I’m pushing 30 and have never had a serious, long term relationship. Tons of short term ones. I’m perfectly fine with that being the case; I’m in no rush. But I was hoping for some outside perspective:)

The cooked rice weighs the correct weight…but something seems different from the last batch. Less dense, easier to stir in the pot and there was a very small amount of water that just didn’t seem to soak up. I do remember thinking the cups of water were a little over filled though, the rice might be slightly overcooked from me, and I accidentally didn’t have even heat for part of the cook time. 

Does all the weight from rice come from water? Could I have only put one cup in the water and not noticed?

So me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for over a year. We have been long distance for the last three months but will  be together again soon. 
The whole time we were together in person, we met every day and we even went on vacation together. We are extremely close and I feel like I can tell him anything, he accepts everything about me, he likes everything about me, he thinks I'm the prettiest girl he's ever met. He is kind and considerate, and treatsme better than I was treated by other guy. I like being with him, I feel comfortable. He has told me he loves me several times too though I have not yet said it back to him. 
During those three months we were long distance, I didn't talk to a single guy, but sometimes when I look at some guys my heart skips a beat and I feel butterflies in my stomach. My boyfriend is not really my type, I mean face wise. I like that he's taller than me and has nice shoulders. It's not that I'm not attracted to him, I am and I enjoy having sex with him( he's also generous in bed, he always tries to satisfy me). But I guess if I guess he never really gave me butterflies, not like when I look at random guys in the street and I think I want to talk to them.

I don't want to ruin this relationship, he's really important and I feel like he's the first person outside of my family whom I felt so comfortable with. And he's loyal too he would never cheat on me.
But when I look at those guys who are my type I feel kinda sad because I so want to talk to them. I want to date those guys.

"Would you say watching anime at 30 years old is childish?

Apart from watching digimon, Pokemon and DBZ as a kid, I’ve just discovered a whole new world of anime at 30 whilst I’m off sick from work trying to desperately to get my mental health back to normal. 

It’s blown my mind and in a good way. I’ve just watched my first official anime as an adult: Fruits Basket and it has changed my life in many ways. That’s certainly not a childish program either, the themes within it are ones adults can certainly relate too (love, death, trauma, abuse)

Would you say it was childish? I know for a fact that if I told some people I watched anime, they’d tell me to grow up. 

But I’m a firm believer in doing what makes you happy and not abiding by social constraints and norms.

"I'm in the US. I know he makes about $150K and often laments about the fact that he hates living in his apartment. He lives on a top floor of a home owned by his landlord who actually lives right downstairs. I haven't asked him this as I think it might be too intrusive, but I often think, if he's making six figures, has no kids, no spouse, and he only has to care for his dog, why doesn't he get a nice condo for himself, a townhouse, or a regular apartment so he lives on his own rather than with the literal landlord? No, the landlord isn't a relative, so it's not like he's caring for sick family or getting a big discount on rent which is forcing him to stay there.

He's just 30 and so can be paying off student loans, but even then with his salary, I don't understand.

"I (20m) am afraid that I have way too little empathy or that I'm even a sociopath.

I often read horrible stories, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18n33fo/overnight_ive_lost_my_wife_and_our_babies/). When I read horrible things like these (about death/war/abuse/other horrible things), the first thing I think is: ""wtf that's horrible"", but I just don't really automatically picture it as I don't want to think about it I guess. So I don't feel indifferent about it but I also don't have to cry, but lots of people do. What weirdly does break my heart though are videos of elderly or kids crying and being broken, especially in war zones. 

If a close friend or family cries in front of me, I want to console them and hold them and make things easier, but I don't necessarily have to cry or feel *super* sad. My ex-girlfriend sometimes told me that when she told her sister or mother about something bad that happened to her, they had to cry with her. In one way that's beautiful (as I see it with my mother and sister too), but I maybe had once or twice in my life max when I had to cry because someone else was crying, especially at memorials. 

What I also *do* feel a lot is when I made someone cry in the past because of my own actions. It's like a stinging guilty feeling on my chest when I picture them crying because of something I did. But I was still capable of making them cry, and that's the opposite of empathy. I feel so much shame

I've had a girlfriend like 7 months ago that I had just recently broke up with had been the person I actually liked. She started to become dry like she wasn't interested in me anymore and I told her about this and she gav3 me some good advice. Like a day later she wrote a long paragraph that she liked me but didn't wanna get in the way of me and my girls relationship. I thanked her for telling me this but I didn't tell my girl. I asked her what made her tell me this and she doged the question. We started talking some more when the talking kinda became flirting, I'm definitely in the wrong for this but she asked to sext and I agreed. We started off just talking dirty and then we just sent nudes to each other. I realized that I wanted to date her more than my actual girlfriend but I already got really close to my girls parents. I told her to stop but she offered a deal I almost said yes to, she said I could do whatever I want to her. She said she would be my little sex slave bascily and could even go as far as to abuse her. I didn't want to hurt her but you know where I'm going. I told her no but she said she's always open to me. When I broke up with my girlfriend she started to open up to me. I was going to bathroom in school and she followed me in and showed me her tits.

"I (23tf she/her) have been dating my partner (22NB, he/they) for over a year now. We are fairly adventurous in the bedroom, although not much interest in PiV sex, which is great with me.

Strictly because I think it's important for this question in particular, I was born with a dick and he was not.

We are both on HRT (2+ years) and I feel it is very important to note that has totally changed what our bodies like in bed. Nothing is standard enough about us that I can read or watch a video to learn, and I can almost guarantee what feels good on cisgender genitals tends to become neutral at best on transgender genitals. We have however done a lot of learning by doing, and we do our best to be open about how it was, what we want different next time, etc.

I was very explorative of my own body prior to us dating, so I had a lot I could tell him, and I'm very vocal in bed. He hated that he even had a libido until starting T, and has never explored his 'entrance' on his own.

When he goes down on me, he makes me cum regularly, sometimes several times within a few minutes. He has probably made me cum without needing me to touch myself at all 10s if not 100s of times. I have made him cum on my own without his help so rarely I can count it on my hands. 

I care a lot that he feels satisfied in bed. I ask what feels good, I try to listen and watch how he reacts, but no matter what I try or how closely I follow instructions, I just can't make him cum on my own. I take my time, it's not uncommon to spend over a half hour with my head between his legs. 

He groans, moans, thrusts, thrashes, begs me not to stop... The sex is good and HOT. But I always reach a point where I know my stamina is failing me around the 20-50 minute mark, and I find some way to kinkily invite him to help me out, at which point he strokes his 'clit' (not that we refer to it like that, youd be surprised how much this part changes on T) and I finger him till orgasm.

He does feel that he cums way harder with me than without me, but I want to be better. I want to feel him finish because of something that *I* did. I want to feel like I'm not bad in bed for him... Which I suppose means getting better in bed xD

Is this normal? How do I improve? Does anybody in my position have some advice?

"**My go-to response to lacking data or being unsure about a decision in my life is seeking validation for it. However, I'm unsure about most of my decisions and I'm always dealing with new situations so this just makes me an insecure person in general. How can I manage without data or certainty?**

Overall, I seek validation from people too much. It's interesting because I sometimes seek it even from people I don't respect or whose validation wouldn't have any meaningful impact on my life.

It's that momentary or long-term lack of certainty about my decision that leads to me to challenge my own beliefs constantly while simultaneously seeking for my views to be validated for a sense of certainty that I know will always elude me.

I speak with confidence only if I find that it will benefit a goal that I have in the moment but none of my beliefs are certain. They're all stacked probabilities that I take a leap of faith on because it allows me to live a life that's consistent with my values, regardless of anything else. I'd say that the only consistent ""core"" aspects in my life are my main values of growth, efficiency, and security.

If I want to live a life worthy of my own respect, I need to get rid of this weakness of seeking validation at all times. It's tough though because I'm aware of how incapable I am as one person and so I throw things out to get feedback of any form but in doing so, I'm acting in a way that's insecure, and this bleeds into my day-to-day decisions.

In certain new situations, I freeze or act out simply because I lack the data to navigate and I don't have the time to seek out feedback to ""validate"" my thought process and bounce ideas off of someone. This takes time but it's not always possible in day-to-day life without a large range of reference experiences to use as a model.

"Had to go anon on this one lol

This is a very bizarre question, I know, but it’s something i’ve been curious about for a while. I’ve noticed if I sit on the toilet for an extra 10-20 mins after my first bm, more stomach “cramps” will come and so will more turds with it, as if they’ve been in there the whole time. Usually the longer I wait the more turds come out… and this makes me wonder, is there always poop just on the other side of that sphincter muscle keeping itself closed up? Or is the rectum fairly “clean” inside (yes ik clean is not exactly the correct word lol, but I mean it more so in the sense of not containing a bunch of poop just chilling in there). I get the gist of how our digestive system works obviously but I can’t help but wonder about the fact that there could always just be more poop hanging out up there even if it feels like i’ve completely relieved myself. Google searches have both told me yes there’s likely all the poop my body has produced since my last movement in there, and no the rectum is clean 99% of the time and the poop is stored a little higher up than just right there inside the rectal canal. I guess the reason I think about it so often is because, I could technically take 10 mins on the toilet and drop just what’s ready to go and leave it there, and possibly have to use the bathroom again soon after, or wait that 10-20 extra minutes and let a little extra go then and there. Sorry for defiling everyones minds who read this but i’ve been so curious about it for so long I can’t help but ask at some point, and I figured the sub called NoStupidQuestions would be the perfect place to do so.

"Not American but all my friend attended state school so they all graduated debt free. 


I saw some post here on Reddit that people have 100k-400k worth of student loan forgiven and I deeply confused by it. People take on loans knowingly because they can’t afford the school tuition, yet they still bite the bullet and now they are waiting for government bailouts?

"So I went on a vacation with my girlfriend and we picked up a small snack for my platonic female friend who had asked for it. I said it was a gift from my girlfriend and took a picture.

Two weeks pass.

One day I had lunch with my platonic female friend, during work hours, typical lunch hour, we're both remote.

This good friend of mine, surprised me with a gift for my girlfriend, which dwarfed the small snack that I brought. It was a gift bag including booze.

The small snack that I brought was a tiny tiny bag, and I easily could have bought two, but it's only available in that distant vacation spot. 

Making matters worse, I jokingly had the snack in a giant bag themed after the place we got the snack from. Which was funny, but made the snack look too small. I ended up offering the bag too, she said no.

It stretched out to almost 1:30, my friend was able to give a work update at 1, however it did stretch out too long. I don't know how much of a problem this would have been for my friend. About half an hour after noon, I asked if we could stay up to half an hour after the update, since we're both flex schedules, and she said that sounds good, and I double checked again. However, I think she was just being nice.

Anyway, the whole time I was using kind of ego humor and kind of flirting (like making poses and dirty jokes) but no actual flirting. At the same time, I was also making grossout humor. I was also complaining about my girlfriend the whole time, although it was clear I was obsessed with my girlfriend.

An hour later, I felt like I fucked up, and texted her another thanks for her gift for my girlfriend, and apologized for acting a little crazy and taking too long, and wished my friend and her boyfriend a nice holidays.",How badly did I fuck up socially?,18o0vox,1703202216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18o0vox/how_badly_did_i_fuck_up_socially/,

let's say that amazon country wants to annex other nearby land for their people for the resources/wealth etc and wage war on other countries to do it.

Let's say the nearby countries are all male with all male militaries.  with similar military capabilities

"So back in the early days of phone apps (iPhone 2 - 6 era) there was this one mobile game that had a BANGER sound track and was also super fun but, for the life of me I can't find it anywhere.

To give a quick description of the game. It was a 2d side scroller endless runner. The screen was split between horizontally with a person running on each side (like a mirror effect. example shown at the bottom).

You tap left to jump one person and vise Vera with the right. trying to jump over obstacles (cliffs, ledges, etc.). and your objective is to see how long you can last (no shit, It's a endless runner). If one of the person dies then gameover.

I also believe that the name of the game was based off of one of the names in Greek or Norse misology.

"I have a very hard time understanding people in any case, I can't empathise or sympathise very well at all. I'm also waiting for an autism diagnosis which might go some way to explaining things if it comes back a certain way.

I've been making a point of learning to become more self aware, and I'm realising that I can be very quick to judge people's hobbies, and can be very dismissive because of that. 

For example, I've been saying for years that music festivals are awful, partly for the following reasons
- poor audio quality
- people screaming for no reason
- people are frequently on drugs
- camping is terrible but that's a whole different issue

... And I'm only recently figuring out that just because it sounds like a terrible time to me, doesn't mean it's objectively a bad thing. People enjoy all sorts of things and I shouldn't think less of them for it. I still don't understand what the appeal of festivals actually is, but that's not really the point.

"Now, I can understand generally how ""normal"" inflation rises and falls. For example the inflation over this past few years spiked and is now going down to normal levels again. But I mean as an overall trend, inflation goes up every year and just continues to do so.

Does that seriously just keep going up forever? How are we supposed to deal with that long term? Can our decendents just expect to pay like $15 for a loaf of bread in 2055? Is everyone going to make like $50/hr to keep up with inflation? 

I feel like every time I try to ask somebody about this, they just act like I don't understand and everything will just work itself out.

"I work in a factory located in the industrial district of my area. Parking spaces in the lots are limited to office workers only. Us floor workers have to fight for open street and parallel park. Because there are other businesses, there are several drive ways and other areas that have post signs stating that no parking is allowed with a picture of a tow truck under it. 

Today, I parked right next to a no parking sign, but a foot away from the prohibitive area, meaning I was the first car in that stretch of road. The car behind me parked closer that you normally would, but since I could just drive forward, it didn't matter. 

After work, I get to my car, and another car has parked in front of it, in the no parking zone. They also left, and I am not exaggerating, a mere 1 inch of space between our bumpers. I was stuck. I had zero clearance to move forward or backwards. There wasn't any identifying information on the car to figure out which building they worked in. 

After waiting a hour, the owner appeared, saw me, quickly got in and sped off. No sign of apology, guilt, or remorse and no time for me to approach them. 

I checked my car and saw no damage, so I don't think they made contact with my car.

"So I’m considering upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE 2020, and right now, the OnePlus 10T is looking like a very tempting option. A Snapdragon 8 chip, an improved camera setup, crazy fast charging, and more for under $400. 

However, one thing that’s keeping me from definitely buying it is that OnePlus, a subsidiary of Oppo, is based in the People’s Republic of China. And as far as I’m aware, the Big Brother that is the CCP can access data of its citizens and any companies whenever it wants. I know that Oppo doesn’t have ties to the CCP like Huawei, Honor, or ZTE, but I’m still concerned about how much of my data they collect and if it poses a risk to me and others in my country (the USA).

Not to drag out a story without missing details, usually every morning, we would get woken up and get breakfast first thing in the morning in jail. I just so happened to up that morning (I actually woke up like at 4am and couldn't go back to sleep) Two COs (correctional officer) came into the block. (one female, one male.

They stopped mid way through the block. I was completely dumbstruck when I watched the guy open up a new jug of milk, spit in it, while she stood there watching him and passed out breakfast. I could tell I was the only one up since nobody said anything. I didn't say anything, nothing really to say since it's two of them and it's my word against them.  
However, there is a camera in the room that has 24 surveillance, and I'm sure it caught the extra wet milk footage, but I do not know how long they keep it on file or who to reach out to, and I don't have the means to get a hold of an attorney.

Despite this we both have the same disposable income because I pay rent but he lives rent free as his family own properties which he lives in and his family send him an almost monthly allowance with cash. For this reason we split things equally most of the time. Things however appear very transactional to him for example if I buy something for both of us he won’t think about it or offer to pay me back but at the same time won’t hesitate to ask me to transfer him money when he pays for something even if it’s a small amount. 

His parents are the same age as my grandparents and have the family business in Malta (we live in Wales, U.K.). For this reason he was speaking about us eventually moving there to assist with his family business. I do not speak the language and would have to leave my career and my family to do so. Additionally he mentioned that I would be a significant part in growing his family’s business and supporting it due to my knowledge and skills. 

When I asked what I would get out of making this sacrifice I.e. being out of the labour market, being isolated and away from friends and family, not being able to earn money from my career (I can only work in the U.K. due to the type of career I have) he did not have an answer for me but instead said he would make sure I was looked after but in my view that does not make up for my lost career. When I mentioned that the prenup he wanted would also mean I am contributing to a business that I would not share success in he just replied that he had to protect his family’s money in case something went wrong in the relationship. 

I’m not sure if I am in the wrong for wanting more security.

I (23F) recently have seen a lot of chatter online about how ""kids these days don't read anymore"",""reading comprehension is down"" etc, and idk why, but it made me reflect back on my teen years in the 2010's, when so many teen novels were released and then turned into movies, and everyone in my school would read the books because they wanted to go see the movie, books such as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent,etc (I live in the US btw). And it got me wondering, do they even make films based off books for kids/teens anymore? Do they even write books for teens anymore?

You see, I have a tight knit family, my mom and dad and his step kiddos are wonderful in their own distinct ways.
However, this year has been one of the worst we've ever gone through financially, my mom and my siblings had to move more than twice this year due to rising costs, and for the first time in our lives, we came to the pretty unfortunate realization that we are gonna have to skip this Christmas almost altogether, no gifts at all.

The problem that I have is that for whatever reason, I can't accept that for them at all, so I've been trying to find ways to fund raise for a while, and I seem to be running out of time, so the question is, is there any website or any way at all that I can raise funds for christmas in time, even if it's just for a cone cup's worth of change?

"I stared working for this pressure washing company about a year and a half ago. When I started here it was great, the boss/business owner was super cool and friendly. It’s a small business and I’m the only employee which I liked because I could grow with them. I have to climb really high and sometimes sketchy roofs with no safety equipment. He would tell me I would never have to climb one if he wasn’t there to watch me but now I have to do it all the time without him there but that was fine with me. They would tell me every day how I was such a great employee and they were lucky to have found me. They even gave me a Christmas card last year that said I was a “part of their family” and had a $300 bonus. Business was slow when I started and most weeks I would work about 30 hours. He told me the job is salary pay and I would be paid for 40 hours no matter what. So over all it seemed great at first. Then summer time rolled around and we started working 40 hours a week and sometimes over that and he would say we‘ll make up for it in the winter time when u get pto. I also started to do the jobs by myself when summer started soo it was just me doing everything which was great because that part came with a raise. Soo all summer long I work long and hard days just trying to hold out till winter. As soon as school let back in business started to slow down. He would have me come in and do yard work 5 days a week 4 hours a day instead. I was wondering why I wasn’t getting pto. He then proceeded to tell me the business is very slow and hurting for money and that he needs me to go doordash and pay him all the earnings soo that he could use that to pay my wage. This happens the day before he leaves to go on a cruise (he takes them once a month). Soo I started doordashing for him and it wasn’t going good and he would constantly be on my ass about not making enough. That went on for two weeks then he says we need to have a talk during the talk he tells me It’s not that the company is broke he said it was the best year they have ever had. He said that the real reason was because business cost went up by “%30”. He tells me doordash isn’t making enough and gives me the option to either use his car and DoorDash for my own wage and he wound only pay me the days I work or he would pay me only for the days I work. He tried to make it seem like it wasn’t that bad by telling me he made 80 in 3 hours the night before but I don’t think he knew I was still signed in on his account so I looked at the delivery’s he took and it was only half that. He literally lied to my face. So now I’m doordashing in his car and stressing out about how I’m gonna pay rent while he’s gone on vacation the week of Christmas. I feel like he’s been lying this whole time and he just wanted an employee for 1 year soo he could get his investments off the ground. It’s put me in a really shit situation where idk if I’ll be homeless after Christmas. Meanwhile I’m watching him spend all this money and not pay me a cent. I’ve confronted him and told him I’m looking for a new job which I am and he basically said okay just don’t forget to give me a 2 week notice and I’ll hit you up next summer.

I've had 3 long-term partners in my life, each relationship lasted around 3 years and all of them were really healthy and loving, and ended due to some outside circumstances (having to move to another country or stuff like that). 

Like 90% of times, when I got undressed around a boyfriend in non-sexual situations (changing outfits etc), he would just show no reaction, or would occasionally grab my boob or slap my butt, but more in a joking around way, rather than anything sexual. 

When we kissed outside of sexual situations, none of them has ever got hard.

"For the record, 31M.  Married and with a healthy sex life at home.  Not particularly religious or sheltered, this stuff just makes me uncomfortable.

My first dabble with dating apps back in 2015 was a weird experience.  I was genuinely looking for dating and “taking it slow”, but often times I’d meet girls who would immediately let me know they just wanted sex.  Sometimes we would have great conversations and go on a date, just for them to initiate sex afterwards.  Going to bars was never enjoyable because the public flirting, provocative dancing, stuff like that just made me uncomfortable.  I felt like a real loser, as all my friends at the time would make a game of going to the bar to hook up with a stranger.  

I met a girl who I ended up dating for a while, but her confidence and sexuality made me feel uncomfortable at first.  She initiated sex the first time, and while that did open the floodgates to a lot of sex, her confidence was always intimidating in a weird way.  Also, the fact that she had so many partners before me never sat right with me, and I couldn’t tell you why.

I don’t care what other people do with their body, but I just couldn’t imagine having sex with someone that I just met.  The partners I have had over the years have all been great, and it’s not like I don’t enjoy sex… I love it.  Just with the right person I guess?

"So I usually have long hair, shoulder length or longer. My hair is extremely thick (I'm native american so it's probably similar to some types of latino hair) and slightly wavy. 

Anyway I cut it short myself because I was bored, and it looked great while wet. Once it dried, it was so fluffy. I don't want to say it was an afro because my hair isn't kinky and I'm not black, but it had a similar amount of volume and size.

That's what I get for following haircut tutorials for white people.

The only way I've gotten it to behave is to put gel in it and then wear a tight hat until it dries. 

Would a professional barber be able to cut it differently to reduce some volume? Should I stick with the hat method? Just putting product in doesn't cut it, it still fluffs up when it's dry.

Now, this is a tricky question to ask clearly because I can't post a picture for references. But, I am a general contractor (in US that is someone who build homes, etc) so, I fully understand the purpose of support beams, posts, collums, etc.

 However, on a space ship that is entirely made of some sort of metal; The bays/hangars where the fighters and smaller space crafts will launch out of almost always have these large (probably 4-6 foot spans) equally spaced beams at the entry ways, and normally completely open floor plan inside. 

Again, I understand that they are essentially for structural integrity and load bearing. But, it's space, there is no weight in space, and most these ships have some sort of force field, I'd assume that would be enough to maintain structural support.

I'm pretty sure the roads heading away would become completely jammed with cars.

My main question is would I be safer to get on the main road heading away from the fire that is 4 lanes wide (2 in each direction) and which will probably be at a stand still with cars trying to escape out.  Or, head perpendicular to traffic a half mile to a nearby lake that is about a half mile wide and get on the downwind side of the lake?  Would people stuck in traffic on a wide road all still get suffocated if large fires are burning on both sides of the road?  There is also a large supermarket parking lot devoid of trees as well nearby.  Is a large parking lot pretty safe or would you just die of smoke and suffocation in a car?  I'm thinking the lake is the best option, but it would probably mean driving towards the fire and riding it out in the lake instead of trying to escape on the roads with 10,000 other cars, essentially getting stuck in a traffic jam..",What should I do in the event of a quickly moving fire in a densely populated suburban area?,18okzrd,1703268256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18okzrd/what_should_i_do_in_the_event_of_a_quickly_moving/,

"So I have been seeing this girl for 6 months now and her ex (her only other boyfriend she’s ever had that she was seeing for 2 years) lives on the same street as me. My gf doesn’t live with me but is only about 15 min drive away.

My gf only met me 2 weeks after the break up (I didn’t know till a few weeks in that it was so recent) and after 2 months of us being together began finding things in her room of his and she’d go over to his to give him it back or he’d find something of hers and she’d go over. 

This has been happening about once a month and it’s usually while I’m busy and not around. The most recent time was last night. We agreed to meet up last night a few days prior and not on a specific time but just ‘when I get back from work’. Got a message from her while at work saying she was going over to her exs to give him back a pair of joggers and asked to  come over saying she assumed I was gonna be home shortly so it would all work out time wise. Which I usually would be if I wasn’t working overtime but thing is she knows that I’ve been doing overtime for the past few weeks and wouldn’t be home for hours to come and when I remind her I won’t be home for hours she just says “oh okay well there’s no point in me going home just to come back, I’m fine chilling her for a few more hours and so is he” and will end up hanging out at her exs for a few hours when it was supposed to be just a quick exchange.

 This sorta thing has happened  a good few times now and he still is into her (he occasionally tries to call her and texts her late nights at least a couple times a week) which makes me uncomfortable already but her willingness to hangout with him in his bedroom for hours just makes me feel uneasy about it all. Especially since when she does tell me when she’s going over before she goes she tells me she doesn’t wanna go to his since it was a bad breakup with him being abusive near the end of the relationship and just wants to stay outside his apartment door yet when she goes over she’s always fine with spending hours alone in his room. Have also noticed that while when she’s not at his and we message (mostly through snap) we usually just send photos and videos to chat but when she’s at his she only send texts or voicenotes.

Dk if I’m just paranoid and haven’t said much to her about it and I wanna trust her and don’t wanna seem crazy but I’m just worried she’s cheating. Any unbiased opinions or advice?

"Hey all, 23M here. I've always struggled with my frustration and alot of anxiety as a teenager but I honestly wasn't very much of an angry teen or a grumpy person until I moved out of home. Alot of stuff happened in a short two year window that included the death of two friends and parents that weren't overly the most supportive with both that and also me trying to talk about what I want to do in life,  As I've gotten older I'm learning to accept the things that happened and I no longer want to feel this deep frustration and anger that's deep within me. I'm currently in a relationship with a loving partner who really genuinely cares for me and loves me and I've been with them for a couple of years now, they know everything about me, my past, the hurt, the good bad and the ugly.  I blow up over the smallest of things and I know when I'm blowing up that it's not right, but I cannot seem to snap out of it and just realize what's actually happening vs what I think is happening and before I know it, I've said something extremely rude or been really nasty. Currently in my life it's very stressful, I've currently been made redundant and it does stress me out, I live far away from my family and friends  nowadays and can sometimes feel pretty isolated due to this, sadly alot of my mates are in that party stage still in their lives and I don't think they realize how isolating it is, I did bring this on myself though.  I think this has caused me to be a bit more on ""edge"" recently however, I don't want to be an angry person and continue what my parents were like to me so so much as a person growing up.  I don't want my lovely partner who does so, so much for me to feel like they have to walk on egg shells just to avoid setting me off, that's just not fair. We talk out all of our arguments and hug them out each time and i do genuinely try to do better and learn from my mistakes and I do know that im slowly improving with small steps and learning very slowly on how to desculate and taking a few moments but I still struggle with blowing up over the smallest of things, a good example would be like me tooting at a car and getting told I don't need to do that proceeding by me explaining in detail about how no, I was in the right to toot and x y and z and your not driving blah blah blah. In recent years I've talked to my parents about my quick to fire and inability to calm down and move on and my mum refers to it as ""red mist"" or ""red eyes"" and she also struggled alot with it as a teenager and early adulthood, she said that her brothers/my uncles all have the same problem that I describe and they both found there peace by talking to their dad/my grandfather about the things that hurt them the most on his death bed. I don't want to wait until then, nor do I overly want to bring everything back up for my parents now. I was just wondering if any other fellow users somewhat relate to this and if so, how have you managed to kind of take control of this rage when it comes on rather than becoming reactive?

"Pregnancy Scare?? Maybe?

Hey I’m turning to Reddit just to get an outside opinion on what’s going on.

My girlfriend (16F) and I (17M) are having a pregnancy scare. To go into detail, she was giving me a handie over my underwear. Then we switched positions and I started rubbing her vagina over her sweatpants. During this time she first massages herself over the sweatpants, then underneath and inside her vagina. The scare is that if she had some of my precum on her fingers and had her fingers inside her vagina, that she could get pregnant.

It sounds dumb, but we’re terrified. I plan on buying her Plan B but we’re worried that she might already be ovulating. But we’re still trying to be smart about it.

Are we right to be terrified? Her fingers weren’t dripping with the precum, and she rubbed them on clothing before inserting her fingers into her vagina, plus the fact that it’s precum and not actual semen.

"Thinking of writing two important characters to my story. These two characters are actually the reason the power system in the universe I’m creating exists in the first place. 

(This story takes place in a God realm similar to the Greek one) Thousand of years ago massive natural disasters swarmed the earth for 9 months, no one knew why it was happening but one day it suddenly stopped. Hades and Apollo, the miracle children. Seemingly born out of the ground are found by a farmer woman and are adopted by her. 

Even as babies Hades and Apollo show remarkable power but that’s not all, mortals start noticing that they’re gaining powers too and it seems that the Gods suddenly aren’t the only people with powers. This is revolutionary finally mortals can gain powers that even rival the Gods

What happened was when Apollo was born he started emitting pathogens that would spread and unlock peoples latent abilities but Hades and Apollo are still more powerful than anyone in the universe

Later in life Hades and Apollo are hailed for their powers and treated like royalty meaning they’re taken away from their mother but they don’t know she’s not allowed to see them

Hades mother eventually finds a way to sneak into Gold Fort (a place for Gods and royalty), Hades and Apollo thought they were abandoned but their mother confirms how much she loved them and she’s quickly executed in front of them

In the moment, consumed by grief, Hades has a realisation. He realises the only people he cared about in this world were Hades and his mother, he realises everyone is insignificant and weak and he can do what he wants. To which he starts killing everyone indiscriminately, when he wants and wherever he wants. He can do anything he wants like steal and kill

It takes several Gods to take him down and it wouldn’t have worked if they didn’t manage to convince Apollo to help (he turned pacifist and wanted to stay away from conflict) and all the manage to do is seal him. Hades also emits a pathogen that can turn anyone into shadow beasts which are brainless monsters that are insanely powerful, this happens when someone experiences extreme trauma but it’s also rare

So what do you guys think?

"My dog of 12 years passed away yesterday. We had gotten him when I was 7 and he was 2. So he lived to be 14 and he saw me grow to be almost 20. I've never had another dog, and it is unlikely I will have one for a very long time, if ever again. Every memory I have, he is included. There was never a time he hasn't been around since I was 6 years old. And the fact that never again will be ever be here, especially around Christmas (as he was born in December and died in December), is almost unbearable to me.

Yesterday people spent a lot of time saying they were sorry, but I guess I must have become intensely cynical over the years, because it just made me extremely bitter. All I could think was, these people are telling themselves it's just a dog, when he was quite literally almost another sibling to me. It angered me that they truly were only slightly sorry.

They also spent a bit of time saying he was ""in a better place now"". And this is the comment that really frustrates me. Where? Where is he? He's not at home, where he needs to be. It annoys me that people can say things that are so blatantly untrue, and that's how I see it. I believe, deep down, I will never see that dog again. Not even after I die. We had him, and he's gone. Forever.

But maybe I'm being cynical again, and there's really more proof toward an afterlife than I'm allowing. My parents are Catholic so I don't even want to bring up this conversation with them, as I don't want to make them think anything other than that he went to heaven.

"I failed a mandatory course in my undergrad senior year, and my life feels ruined alongside my grad school dreams which I was supposed to start in Fall 2024

I am a U.S./Canadian senior mechanical engineering student, studying at a Canadian university. I have been very fortunate to intern at 3 NASA research centers and also obtain a publication too. All my recommenders for grad school were NASA PIs, and I am also a candidate for the GEM Fellowship. I applied to 19 M.S. programs (including Columbia, MIT, Yale, Princeton, NYU, UCF, etc) and although some may be cash cow, as a GEM Fellow these could be funded through an employer or associate fellowship. I have a mediocre GPA (3.3) but still received acceptances to 2 of the 19 schools, with others having pending decisions. Unfortunately, I was writing an 80% final exam due to me deferring the midterm because I was very sick, and I ended up failing the exam and the course by a lot. I fell into a deep depression, and now I have to let my family know, my NASA supervisors, and the schools that accepted me know that I can't attend grad school in Fall 2024 because I failed. I'm so disappointed in myself and I don't know what to do. I know grad schools defer under extenuating circumstances, but I don't think failing counts, plus the fellowship is tied to start Fall and there's no guarantee I get it again next year. I also can't take the failed course (which was electrical systems, a mandatory course) until Fall 2024 due to it not being offered in the Winter or Summer semesters.

My partner rarely initiates sex. When we do it, half the time he just wants me to suck his dick. He has admitted to having issues with porn in the past. He had naked pics of his ex from their relationship in his phone but claimed they were saved because she always asked why he didn’t save them on Snapchat. He deleted these pics after I found them. He doesn’t have a single naked photo of me saved. His instagram explore page is filled with chick with huge tits. I have modest boobs. He never calls me beautiful even when I get made up for a night out. I have to ask him to tell me I look beautiful. Today I walked out of the bathroom naked and he quickly looked away from me. I asked why he looked away and he said he didn’t want to be “creepy”. 

Idk. I wouldn’t mind all the other sexualized women if he was into me sexually. He claims he is attracted to me and finds me beautiful but I don’t want to have to always ask to get a compliment or have sex initiated.

"Tl;Dr: ChatGPT + Voice replication = Possible impersonation? 

Foreword: I highly doubt an 80 billion dollar company cares to impersonate some jagoff fox, this is food for thought which considers the technology both now and within 5-10 years. 
 
With ChatGPT’s voice option, it almost gives me the feeling that they’re in natural conversation and I think this will get better as time goes on. Since OpenAI stores all its data, with enough use, couldn’t they theoretically use all my saved dialogue as training data to make a chatbot that perfectly replicates my manner of speaking? Further, couldn’t they then use voice replication software to make a Bottrot4Real who sounds exactly like me over phone? Even if OpenAI themselves don’t do this, I feel that it is very possible and indeed probable that others will do this in the future. 

I fear this could be a very convincing way to scam the elderly or even some sharper people. Snag some clean audio from a teenager trying to start his streaming career, replicate it, then call up grandma and use his voice to ask for emergency money. That is only one application, too.

"Ive recently turned 35f and realized my time has passed and my value in the market is too low. It’s been sad.

I married my ex in my 20s for half a decade and spent another half decade being completely single as in not sleeping with someone as my ex was my first real relationship and only thus far but it was so toxic I needed to heal a lot and my Dad died which tore up my life and left me mangled in grief.

I’ve decided to make myself receptive to finding a man and have a terrible time because my age even tho I am attractive and naturally fit it goes nowhere. No date nothing. 

Here are my red flags i immediately have:

🚩I’m damaged goods because I was married in my 20s to my first and only real relationship 
🚩 I didn’t have a present mom growing up so I have average, basic, subpar cooking skills if that compared to men’s moms &amp; other high value women 
🚩men wake up between 4-6am &amp; expect breakfast &amp; I know I would not be able to do that consistently as I make a breakfast on the go before I leave for work @9am.
🚩 I am *painfully* boring like sleeping in a coffin because I love to be home and preoccupy myself at home doing little tasks or lounging being home but most men want an active girl who always doing constant fun things
🚩I have no friends or family and many men want a popular woman with an active social life 
🚩 I have a toxic dysfunctional ghetto family that loves to fight &amp; meddle in my life to ruin any potential of something good for me so I can be dragged down to their ghetto standards which I work hard to minimize my life away from them which has left me an adult orphan 
🚩 I have 20yrs of conditioning by my family to find a man who mistreats and cheats on me which I don’t want as I already did that for my family
🚩I don’t know how to be loved and have never been in love (my first marriage was arranged pretty much)
🚩I’m divorced 
🚩 even though I haven’t been with different men I am experienced and men expect me to hook up with them 
🚩I’m not a hook up girl
🚩 I don’t drink or go to bars etc
🚩I have a low body count sadly (for women this is a huge negative not sure for men)
🚩 I don’t have tattoos or have piercings
🚩 I’m very boring but nice not doormat nice just respectful
🚩 I just work a simple job and pay bills like every other adult 
🚩 I’ve tried finding a man in a church but because churches are just businesses their moms tell their sons not to get with me because I don’t drink, have tattoos, and didn’t have a hoe-phase and since I don’t mesh with their mom &amp; sisters I don’t mesh with the son even tho they find me attractive and good.
🚩 I get really, really shy where I shutdown 
🚩 no man just wants to talk to me first and see where it goes just talk like text &amp; call and hang out in a group for a month or so then go out for tea alone &amp; from there
🚩my domestication skills are average basic subpar compared to other women 
🚩 all my gal pals with a past have perfect amazing lives with their husbands and even if they were single like me would be taken off the market quickly 
🚩I’m desperate but not so desperate for the men who hit on me or take interest and they have obvious red flags themselves. I just want a simple person like myself and am worried everyday he doesn’t exist
🚩 my biggest red flag even in churches I try to have a spiritual faith which the only way I’ve survived living without my Dad
🚩compared to all the options men have these days they don’t stick around for it to progress but do stick around for all their other women
🚩 I’m no longer naive .. or young lol
🚩 since I know men are bombard with easy access to women &amp; have the upperhand I’m extremely cautious to take things slow once we’ve expressed interest which has lead nowhere 


Please don’t say I’m young because I’m not. In my 20s I had no shortage of options and def notice a difference even if men hit on me superficially just weekly because now men have no shortage of options of who they seriously choose.

Men around my age are uninterested but 50+ &amp; elderly men are but I’m not into men *that* much older.

"I remember when I first read about aphantasia I thought ""oh that must be horrible"", because people described their mind as a completely black space. It is not really my case. But it put the doubt in my mind and as time went by, I realized I cannot relate to the imagination processes of most people, who talk about ""vividly visualizing something"" in their minds and having their thoughts be expressed as an internal monologue.

I remember when I was learning English and my English teacher told us that when you've lived in an English-speaking country for long enough, at some point you start to ""think in English"". I was so confused by what she meant. My thoughts aren't *ever* structured as a ""conversation"" with myself or anyone else (I mean unless I'm remembering an actual conversation ofc), it's not in ""language form"". It's only shapeless ideas and pure concepts in their fundamental form, striking right at the spot of my brain that processes ideas and concepts. It feels direct, pure and instantaneous. The whole idea of having these ideas have to go through the intermediate step of being phrased in language form seems like a limiting slog to me

Same for visualisation. When I think of something, say a mountain, I think more of the pure concept of a mountain. Sure it does conjure some form of visual representation of a mountain, but it's not *really* visual (do people actually *see* just as with their eyes? It sounds so weird to me, there's no eyes involved in the process), and it really is more a conceptual representation rather than a picture. No details, more like ""an abstract illustration of the pure concept of a mountain put into shape"". When I say conceptual representation, I mean very simplistic, with only the core elements presents that highlight its ""mountain"" nature.

When I read a read a book, it doesn't hinder me from imagining what's happening - just more at the conceptual level with barebone visuals to illustrate it. When I read a description of someone having a big black beard, it just adds to the fundamental characteristics that get *conceptually* pictured when I later think about that character. But it's never ""vivid"".

When I say that, people expect that ""mental"" stuff like mathematics is out of my my reach. Turns out I work in a mathematics-related field, and I have been blessed with a deeply mathematical mind. Since what I """"""""picture"""""""" in my mind are the conceptualized essences of things, it's just perfect for mathematical thinking. And I have no trouble having a high degree of organizations of my ideas in my mind, my mind is never a mess (my home however..).

Also I always was a very imaginative kid, always lost in fictional worlds and stuff. Just not in a ""vividly visual"" manner, in predominantly a concepts-driven manner with barebone abstract visual illustrations.

So I don't know, I may be in an intermediate situation on the spectrum of aphantasia. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm like people that are blind from birth - I'm content with my state because I've never known otherwise, but if I experienced it just once, I would realize how limited my perspective actually was.

"I believe this question will depend highly on where in the world you live but I really never understood how credit cards manage to generate such crazy profits, especially in more affluent economies. I completely understand the business model but how does the math add up?

Almost everyone I know, my friends, my family, my coworkers, all have multiple cards and pretty much max out the benefits of each card (i.e I use a specific dining card, a specific travel card). Almost everyone I know uses autopay or auto debit and the uncommon late charge is on such a minor amount that it’s a rounding error. I have paid annual fees for cards but that is the exception not the norm.

So what I fail to understand is how the credit card companies can sustain these big rewards (like 5-8% cashback) on what I assume should be very large volumes, on what should be a disproportionately small interest fees. I doubt anyone uses a credit card for large amounts of financing as bank loans would offer much better rates, and those that are consistently spending above their income would likely be lower net worth, lower amount customers?

In a nutshell, how do credit card companies make money when they pay such high rebates on all sorts of common transactions?

"TL;DR: i believe my daughter has a corn intolerance. ige blood test came back negative. because of that, her pediatrician refused to give a referral for an oral food challenge to test for a non-mediated allergy so i can get her formula and thickener covered by medicaid. what do i do now?

hi guys! i need some advice. this is gonna be pretty long but i want you guys to understand where i’m at and help me figure out where to go from here.

my 3 and a half month old daughter has had hysterical, inconsolable screaming fits since she was 2 weeks old. as well as an awful stuffy nose and sneezing. at first we assumed colic, but it didn’t seem quite right. she had to be held and comforted constantly, and even then she was she was still in extreme pain. she was eventually diagnosed with reflux, cows milk protein allergy, and lactose intolerance.

by that point, we’d had her on nexium, and 8 different formulas. 2 lactose free, and 3 hypoallergenic, and she couldn’t tolerate any of them. i was at a loss. there were a few nights i almost took her to the ER to make sure there wasn’t something physically wrong like appendicitis or a bowel obstruction etc…

my mom mentioned that her coworker has 2 kids with corn intolerance. it’s pretty rare, but it led me to some research.

in formulas without lactose, or hypoallergenic formulas without cows milk proteins, the main ingredient is usually corn! i did some more research, and found out that the formula she was on at the time, powder similac alimentum’s main ingredient is corn, but the ready to feed’s main ingredient was tapioca starch! we made the switch to ready to feed, with no lactose, cows milk protein, or corn. we also stopped her nexium because it contains xanthan gum, which is made from corn.

and oh my goodness, day by day she is a happier baby! no more hysterical fits, she finishes 3-4 oz of a bottle on average and chills for awhile on her own after eating. instead of eating an oz, screaming, calming down, eating another oz 30 mins later and repeat. she smiles so much more, is soo close to laughing, and her stuffy nose and sneezing gets better every day! it’s the ONLY thing that’s actually helped her.

the only problem she has now is her reflux, since every reflux medicine has some corn derivative in it. but we found an infant formula thickener that is corn and dairy free that we are going to try on saturday. (unfortunately it’s very expensive. medicaid will cover it if a doctor tells them it’s medically necessary but you’ll see why that’s gonna be a problem as you read on.)

now here’s the problem. wic will NOT cover ready to feed, no matter the situation or prescription etc… only medicaid will if a doctor deems it medically necessary. it’s $13 a bottle, and a bottle lasts 1.5 days MAX. that’s close to $400 a month.

i made an appt with her pediatrician, and mentioned a corn allergy. he looked at me like i was crazy, saying it was extremely rare and he had never seen it in person. after my insisting, he agreed to do an ige allergy blood test.

now here’s another problem. ige blood tests only test for antibodies that come from allergies that have the potential to become anaphylactic.

there is something called a “non-mediated allergy” which basically means the body is allergic to something the food is broken down into during digestion, not the food itself. therefore it doesn’t show up on blood tests. but either way, both allergies mean the food cannot be tolerated and it can cause severe damage to the body over time.

unfortunately, my daughters ige test came back negative. so medicaid will not cover her formula because to them, she has no allergy.

non-mediated allergies can only be confirmed by an elimination diet (which we did, and she’s improved drastically), and an oral food challenge test after the elimination diet. this basically means she would ingest increasing doses of corn in a doctors office while they record the effects.

immediately after finding out the results to her ige test, i called an allergy clinic near me and asked if i could book an appt for an oral food challenge. they take medicaid, and they offer the test i need, but they would only book an appt if i had a referral from her pediatrician. medicaid will only cover it if it’s medically necessary.

i called her doctor’s office and asked them for a referral after explaining the situation, but her doctor denied it! his reasoning was “her blood test was negative so this test is not needed. continue on the formula she can tolerate.”

i was LIVID. obviously i was going to keep her on the formula that helps her, i just need proof of medical necessity so that i can get help PAYING for it and you denied even testing for it!

i cannot afford $400 a month in formula. we have food stamps, but we only receive $406 so basically every penny we get for food would go towards my daughters formula. she’s fed and happy then but how are WE gonna eat? that’s not even counting the $30 a week for thickener if she has to stay on that too!

i was gonna just switch her to doctor after doctor until i found one who was willing to refer her to the allergy clinic, but then i realized that medicaid will ONLY accept the referral if it comes from her primary doctor, and i can’t change her primary doctor until open enrollment or something in july.

i do not know where to go from here. i refuse to take my daughter off of this formula but i don’t know how we’re gonna continue to afford it. nobody is listening to me, im being talked down to. all the doctors and nurses i’ve talked to act like i’m stupid and web md-ing my child which is NOT the case. even if the oral food challenge came back negative, at least we’d know for sure that it’s not the corn and we can go back to square one and figure out what the problem ACTUALLY is.

i have this momma bear gut feeling that i figured out what her problem is, why she was in so much pain. i just need proof so we can continue to help her.

any advice or steps to take from here is greatly appreciated. and if you made it down here, you’re a trooper! i’m known to write novels 🤣❤️

"It seems the answer depends on who you ask.

First of all, I am aware of two very important facts:

1. The statistics show that the overwhelming majority of lethal dog attacks involve a Pit Bull
2. The behavior of a dog is largely shaped by the owner and fucked up people are more likely to get a Pit Bull than, say, a Border Collie, thus skewing the statistic.

Then again, I've been around many dogs, none of them in a bad environment (I mean in my firends' and family's homes). There is a noticable, clear difference in behaviour between breeds. And any dog enthusiast knows that some breeds are, say, more active, some less. Some enjoy certain activities more than others. Some are by nature very patient and some act like crackheads most of the time. Usually the behaviour of the dog seems somewhat alligned with the intended purpose the breed was initially bred for.

So it doesn't seem too far fetched to thing that a breed that was bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head could have a disposition towards violence.

Yet people seem to adamantly defend the statement that aggresion is a trait that has nothing to do with genetics (somehow, despite other traits being partially determined by genetics).

So I'm confused, but would like to learn more.
